"fox","Top Dems turn on Israel after Biden call with Netanyahu","Michael Lee","Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Biden's phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on ""Special Report.""Dozens of Democrats have followed President Biden’s lead and argued against continued support of Israel following a White House call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Calls among Democrats for the U.S. to halt weapons shipments to Israel have grown since Biden’s conversation last week and an Israel Defense Forces strike that killed seven staffers of the World Central Kitchen, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., being the latest party leader to sign onto a letter urging the president to end the shipments.""In light of this incident, we strongly urge you to reconsider your recent decision to authorize the transfer of a new arms package to Israel, and to withhold this and any future offensive arms transfers until a full investigation into the airstrike is completed,"" reads a letter from 37 House Democrats.The uprising against Israel was not limited to the House of Representatives, with several Democrat Senate leaders voicing similar concerns in recent days.BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU THAT US WILL CHANGE POLICY ON GAZA UNLESS ISRAEL PROTECTS CIVILIANSFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer On March 14, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Israel to hold new elections to oust Netanyahu, who Schumer said had ""lost his way"" during Israel’s monthslong siege of Gaza.""Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah,"" Schumer said, according to a report in the Associated Press.The calls come at the same time as Biden warned Netanyahu in a phone call last week that U.S. policy on Gaza could change if Israel does not do more to protect civilians in Gaza, with a White House readout of the call noting that Biden told his Israeli counterpart that strikes on ""humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation are unacceptable.""Biden’s message was repeated by other members of the administration, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning that the U.S. would shift gears ""if we don't see the changes that we need to see"" and White House national security communications spokesperson John Kirby calling for such changes within ""hours and days.""""The president made very clear his concerns, and the prime minister acknowledged those concerns,"" Kirby said.ISRAELI POLICE THWART ALLEGED ISIS TERROR PLOT AGAINST JERUSALEM STADIUM, POLICE STATIONBiden also noted the need for an ""immediate cease-fire,"" according to the White House readout, telling Netanyahu that doing so would be ""essential to stabilize and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent civilians.""President Biden (AP Photo/Evan Vucci/File)But Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told NBC News in an interview last week that changes to Israel's behavior in the conflict have not come fast enough, arguing that the strike on the aid convoy is ""an indication that there has been no modification of the Netanyahu war plan"" and has created increased ""concern among more and more of my colleagues.""One such colleague is Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., according to an NBC News report. Coons, a longtime Biden ally who has traditionally been a dependable supporter of Israel, argued in favor of placing conditions on arms shipments to Israel if civilians in Gaza are not better protected.""If Benjamin Netanyahu were to order the IDF into Rafah at scale ... and make no provision for civilians or for humanitarian aid, I would vote to condition aid to Israel,"" Coons said during an interview with CNN on Thursday. ""I’ve never said that before, I’ve never been here before.""Meanwhile, families of several American hostages in Gaza have been critical of Biden for not doing enough to bring their loved ones home.FAMILIES OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN GAZA URGE BIDEN TO ACT AFTER 6 MONTHS OF CONFLICT: 'DON'T HAVE TIME' TO WAIT""By now, they are all in dire humanitarian condition,"" Orna Neutra, mother of hostage Omer Neutra, said during a press conference for families last week. ""A cease-fire with a partial deal, or with no deal, could be a death sentence for our son.""""We are tired of hearing about progress towards a deal,"" Neutra added. ""We don’t have time for progress.""But those concerns didn’t appear to be top of mind for many Democrats, who have focused their ire on the humanitarian situation facing Gaza.Palestinians rush to collect the humanitarian aid airdropped into Gaza City on March 17, 2024.

Biden said, before being asked the same question again.""Is that a serious question?"" Biden replied.One notable exception to the trend has been Sen.

On Wednesday, the Biden campaign wrote a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, abandoning the decades-old tradition of three fall events organized by the debate commission.

"cnn","Special counsel Jack Smith again seeks Trump gag order in classified documents case","Hannah Rabinowitz;Holmes Lybrand","Special counsel Jack Smith has once again asked the federal judge overseeing the classified documents case against Donald Trump to impose a gag order against the former president, barring him from making statements about the law enforcement officers who searched his Mar-a-Lago resort. The gag order request is focused on false or misleading statements Trump has made about the 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago, including that his life was in danger because of a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the search. Prosecutors say Trump’s comments in recent weeks have “endangered law enforcement officers involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case and threatened the integrity of these proceedings.” Trump is charged in the case with taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. He has pleaded not guilty. The request comes one week after Smith’s initial attempt for a gag order, which Judge Aileen Cannon quickly shot down for procedural reasons, and is almost identical to the original request. In her ruling earlier this week, Cannon bashed prosecutors for failing to make a sufficient effort to discuss their motion with Trump’s defense attorneys before filing. The judge said prosecutors could refile their motion once that effort had been made properly. Prosecutors now say they discussed the motion with Trump’s attorneys but failed to resolve the issues. While Trump has told his supporters he could have been in danger during the search because of the use-of-force policy, the policy is standard protocol for FBI searches and limits how agents may use force in search operations. The same standard FBI policy was used in the searches of President Joe Biden’s homes and offices in a separate classified documents investigation. Trump, according to prosecutors, has made false claims that have created “a grossly misleading impression about the intentions and conduct of federal law enforcement agents—falsely suggesting that they were complicit in a plot to assassinate him—and expose those agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial, to the risk of threats, violence, and harassment.” Prosecutors also repeated their concern that Trump’s “deceptive and inflammatory claims” expose agents involved in the case to “unjustified and unacceptable risks,” including threats and harassment. In a statement from defense attorneys in the prosecutors’ filing, Trump’s lawyers reiterated their stance that the gag order “is a blatant violation of the First Amendment rights of President Trump and the American People, which would in effect allow President Trump’s political opponent to regulate his campaign communications to voters across the country.”","https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/trump-special-counsel-gag-order-classified-documents/index.html",2977,2024-05-31,"trump"
"cnn","Biden blasts House GOP’s budget proposals as he readies for a shutdown fight","Donald Judd","President Joe Biden on Thursday issued a blistering rebuke of House Republicans’ budget proposals ahead of an upcoming fight over funding the government, warning “MAGAnomics” proposals are “more extreme than anything America has ever seen before.” “Since I’ve come to office, all they’ve really done is attack me and my economic plan – there hasn’t been much else, even though we’ve created, I should point out, over 30 million jobs – more jobs in two years than any president’s created in a four-year term,” he said. “America has the strongest economy in the world, of all major economies, but all they do is attack it.” “But you know, you notice something? For all the time they spent attacking me and my plan, here’s what they never do – they never talk about what they want to do. No, think about it, they tell you what they’re against. What’re they for? It’s like they want to keep it a secret. I don’t blame them.” Thursday’s speech – which the president delivered at Prince George’s Community College in Largo, Maryland – was the latest attempt to reframe the public’s perception of Biden’s handling of the economy, a metric on which he frequently receives poor marks. A majority of Americans polled – 58% - say Biden’s policies have made economic conditions worse, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS released last week, up from 50% a year ago. The president has made his economic story – building “from the bottom up and middle out,” as he frequently says in speeches – central to his reelection effort. Changing voters minds about the economy and convincing them of its strength is among the key challenges Biden most overcome between now and November 2024. There is no consensus among House Republicans on the best path forward to fund the government with some in House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s right flank threatening to oust him if he brings a clean spending bill to the floor. The White House has called on Congress to pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government running while congressional leaders hash out major differences, something conservatives in McCarthy’s caucus are loathe to accept. Biden said House Republicans’ economic proposals would achieve three major things – cutting taxes for the wealthy and for corporations, cutting funding for Social Security and Medicaid, and raise costs for families by gutting investments in the middles class. He slammed McCarthy for reneging on a deal cut in June to keep spending level over the next fiscal year as part of negotiations to raise the debt ceiling. “Now, they’re turning their backs on the bipartisan budget deal Speaker McCarthy made with me just a few months ago, after threatening to do something no one – and came very close to it – shutting down and reneging on our national debt, which would have caused an international economic crisis,” he warned. “Well, they’re back at it again, breaking their commitment, threatening – threatening more cuts and threatening to shut down government again this month.” The speech was also the latest effort from a White House intent on turning the nation’s attention toward Biden’s domestic agenda as legal issues envelop his son Hunter, who was indicted just before the speech began, and Republicans in Congress prepare to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Biden. The White House directed requests for comment on Hunter Biden’s indictment to the Justice Department on Thursday. The president commented on the impeachment inquiry for the first time on Wednesday night, linking it to the shutdown fight. “Well, I tell you what, I don’t know quite why, but they just knew they wanted to impeach me. And now, the best I can tell, they want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government.” “So look, look, I got a job to do. Everybody always asked about impeachment. I get up every day, not a joke, not focused on impeachment. I’ve got a job to do. I’ve got to deal with the issues that affect the American people every single solitary day.” The impeachment inquiry announcement and the specter of a possible shutdown has given the White House another chance to turn the focus on the sometimes-chaotic House Republican Conference and draw a stark contrast with Biden’s economic message. The Biden administration and allies in Congress blasted the House GOP for proposing “devastating” cuts to federal programs in legislation they warned runs afoul of the bipartisan budget agreement signed into law this summer. “Earlier this year, President Biden and congressional leaders reached a bipartisan budget agreement that set a framework to keep the government open and protect critical priorities for the American people – a deal is the deal,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday. “The president, House Democrats, Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans have stood by that agreement with bipartisan movement in the Senate today, but speaker McCarthy and House Republicans have taken a different approach, ignoring the agreement that a majority of them voted for and advancing extreme partisan bills that break their promise and gut investments in America.” Biden’s campaign has already attempted to move the needle on the issue, launching an ad titled “Got to Work” last week touting the administration’s economic achievements as part of a $25 million ad blitz first reported last month by CNN.","https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/14/politics/joe-biden-economic-speech/index.html",5675,2023-09-14,"biden"

(AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps) (AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps)In its fundraising filings, MAGA Inc. disclosed that it brought in over $68 million in fundraising last month, with most of the money coming from Mellon, with another $10 million from the conservative mega donors Dick and Liz Uihlein, founders of the Uihlein shipping and packaging company.The super PAC announced a few days after the Mellon donation that they were reserving $100 million in ad reservations to run spots this summer in support of Trump.The latest contribution from Mellon follows a previous $25 million donation earlier this cycle to MAGA Inc. Mellon also contributed roughly the same amount to American Values, the main super PAC supporting Democrat turned independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign.The Bloomberg and Mellon news came as the Biden campaign announced that they and the Democratic National Committee raised a combined $85 million in May, which is their second-best month of fundraising this election cycle.But the money raised by Biden and the DNC is far short of the staggering haul raised bytTrump's campaign and the Republican National Committee last month.In announcing their May fundraising figures on Thursday evening, the Biden campaign also highlighted that they had a massive $212 million cash-on-hand as of the end of May. ""Our strong and consistent fundraising program grew by millions of people in May, a clear sign of strong and growing enthusiasm for the President and Vice President every single month,"" Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. Biden's announcement came on the final day the presidential campaigns had to file their May fundraising figures with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).But the Trump campaign didn't wait for the deadline to tout its May fundraising haul.The former president's campaign announced two and a half weeks ago that they and the RNC, fueled in part by the former president's guilty verdicts in his criminal trial, combined hauled in a stunning $141 million in fundraising in May.That was up from the $76 million they raised in April when they topped President Biden and the DNC for the first time in their 2024 election rematch. Fundraising, along with public opinion polling, is a key metric used to measure the strength of a candidate and their campaign.

"cnn","Trump wins all delegates at stake in Michigan GOP convention amid leadership battle","Eric Bradner;Daniel Strauss","Former President Donald Trump won all 39 delegates at stake at a Michigan Republican convention Saturday, as officials there sought to move past a leadership battle that has split the state party into rival factions. The party chairman, former Ambassador and Congressman Pete Hoekstra, presided in Grand Rapids after days of disputes over where the convention would happen — and who would be in charge. Tensions over the leadership battle were on display throughout the day, as convention organizers sent an email linking to its results that also included a post from Trump’s Truth Social account. “I look forward to working with Ambassador Pete Hoekstra as Chairman of The Republican Party of Michigan. He is a winner who was a GREAT Congressman from Michigan and, likewise, did a fantastic job as Ambassador to the Netherlands. Pete will make The Republican Party of Michigan GREAT AGAIN, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be its Chairman — HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” the post read. The Michigan Republican Party’s state committee tapped Hoekstra as the new party chair in January after ousting former Chairwoman Kristina Karamo, an election denier and failed 2022 secretary of state nominee. Karamo sued, but a Michigan judge this week rejected her bid to retake power. The Republican National Committee also moved to recognize Hoekstra as the state party chair. Amid the leadership struggle, Karamo and her aides had planned a convention in Detroit. Hoekstra, after taking over as party chair, announced one in Grand Rapids. Some delegates were confused over which to attend, and some Karamo allies in the 1st and 4th congressional districts broke off to hold their own gatherings Saturday. Those in attendance in Grand Rapids acknowledged the toll the squabble had taken on the state GOP. “Everyone’s emotions are really high,” said Hima Kolanagireddy, a delegate and candidate for RNC committeewoman. She said she believes the party will unite “once the dust settles down” behind an effort to win in 2024. But she acknowledged the deep rift within the state GOP. “It’ll take some time. There is a lot of hurt,” Kolanagireddy said. “And I think we will find our way, because at the end of the day, we are all Republicans. We need to unite in order to win.” Rob Steele, an RNC committeeman, predicted that support for Trump — which was strong across all factions of the split state party — would help bring Republicans together. “I think there’ll be noise but we’ll be ready to move forward,” Steele said. Hoekstra on Saturday repeatedly invoked Trump to showcase the former president’s support for his chairmanship. The Saturday meeting in Grand Rapids comes five days after Trump bested former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in Michigan’s primary. The state awarded its delegates through a split process, with 16 up for grabs in the primary and the remaining 39 decided on Saturday; three went to the winner of each of the state’s 13 congressional districts. Support for Trump dominated the Grand Rapids convention, with delegates sporting “Make America Great Again” hats and candidates for committee spots touting their history of support for the former president. Outside of Trump, though, the divisions among Republicans were apparent. Flyers that read “Kristina KARAMO is our Chair” and “Pete Hoekstra is an Imposter” floated around the convention. The flyers said they were “paid for by “Patriots who believe in THE TRUTH!” Ken Beyer, the 4th District chairman, told CNN on Saturday that he and other Karamo allies will seek to strip Hoekstra of his power. “What we’re doing is we’re retreating back to our counties and we’re going to start replacing people who sided with Hoekstra right now … and we’ll replace them with new delegates,” he said. Beyer also said Trump’s support for Hoekstra won’t end the division over control of the state GOP. “I love Trump. Our district voted 100% for Trump. However, we’re not a cult,” Beyer said. “He’s not always given good advice. And I have to stand firm against him maybe getting bad information from somebody or — I don’t know why he makes the decision he makes. I know he wants to win Michigan.” Hoekstra himself ticked off to reporters all the backing he had as Michigan Republican Party chairman. “No. 1, the state committee acted. The RNC certified that what the state committee did was legitimate. Donald Trump has endorsed me. The congressional delegation has endorsed me. The state House and Senate leaders have endorsed me. And now you have the court making their determination. The appeals court making their determination,” Hoekstra said. Clark Harrington, a delegate for Michigan’s 2nd Congressional District, described the chairmanship of the GOP as “kind of in disarray” but said “the vote for Trump is unanimous.”","https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/02/politics/trump-michigan-convention-delegates/index.html",5188,2024-03-02,"trump"

"fox","Biden admin weighs executive action on border crisis, drawing fire from left and right","Adam Shaw","Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer (R) on how the border crisis is impacting southern California and how immigration could impact Democrats in the upcoming electionThe Biden administration is considering executive action to tackle the ongoing border crisis after a bipartisan Senate bill failed to gather support, and reports of what moves are being considered are already drawing fire from both immigration activists and Republicans.Multiple outlets reported that, in the wake of the failure of the bipartisan Senate border legislation this month, the White House is eyeing potential executive action to tackle the migrant crisis. An administration source told Fox News that the president is considering executive action to restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum, but that it’s one of ""several"" plans being looked at.Asked about reports of the plans, the White House told Fox News Digital that the administration ""spent months negotiating in good faith to deliver the toughest and fairest bipartisan border security bill in decades because we need Congress to make significant policy reforms and to provide additional funding to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system.""7.2M ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATESPresident Biden and migrants attempting to cross into the U.S. (Getty Images)AOC MOCKS BIDEN FOR DOING ‘TRUMP IMPRESSIONS’ ON THE BORDER CRISIS""Congressional Republicans chose to put partisan politics ahead of our national security, rejected what border agents have said they need, and then gave themselves a two-week vacation,"" spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez said. ""No executive action, no matter how aggressive, can deliver the significant policy reforms and additional resources Congress can provide and that Republicans rejected. We continue to call on Speaker [Mike] Johnson and House Republicans to pass the bipartisan deal to secure the border. ""An administration official stressed that there have been no final decisions on what actions, if any, could be taken and that exploring policy options does not mean they will come to pass.SEN BILL HAGERTY SAYS DEMS ENGAGING IN ‘SHEER POWER GRAB' BY TOLERATING BORDER ‘CARNAGE’ One option reportedly on the table is the use of 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act. That allows the president to restrict certain categories of foreigners who are deemed ""detrimental to the interests of the United States.""It was used during prior administrations, including by former President Donald Trump, but he was blocked by a federal court from using it specifically to stop illegal immigrants at the southern border. The ruling was later upheld by the Supreme Court.As a consequence, a similar move by Biden may face a similar judicial roadblock. Another reported option includes raising the bar for initial asylum screenings in which migrants are required to show ""credible fear"" of persecution if returned home. However, most migrants currently do not go through a credible fear screening, so without additional expansion of the ""expedited removal"" process, which the administration sought as part of the supplemental spending bill, it would not affect the majority of migrants.The Biden administration last year moved to limit the asylum process by imposing a restriction on those who enter illegally and who have crossed through other countries before entering the U.S. That rule, however, still does not prevent the release of migrants into the interior and only affects their asylum claim at a later court hearing, and it is also currently blocked by a court order.However, the reports of some sort of action being mulled drew immediate fire from both the left and the right. Speaker Johnson, R-La., said the reports appeared to contradict prior administration claims that Biden had done everything to stop the crisis.""Americans have lost faith in this president and won’t be fooled by election year gimmicks that don’t actually secure the border,"" he said. ""Nor will they forget that the president created this catastrophe and, until now, has refused to use his executive authority to fix it.""RJ Hauman, president of the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE) and a visiting adviser at The Heritage Foundation, said Johnson's assessment was ""spot on"" about it being a gimmick.""The Biden administration could have used it on day one. Instead, they revoked countless effective Trump policies, issued a 100-day deportation ban, and rolled out a mass amnesty bill. The end result? A historic border crisis that they suddenly want to pretend to end, not actually do so,"" he told Fox News Digital.Some Democrats and immigration activists were unimpressed with the reports, accusing Biden of going back to the Trump-era.""Democrats CANNOT solve immigration problems by adopting Trump-like policies,"" Rep.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)The Biden administration was widely expected to bring in such a policy but has instead put the provision on hold.

A school must not separate or treat people differently based on sex, except in limited circumstances, under the provisions and critics say that the change will allow locker rooms and bathrooms to be based on gender identity.LGBTQ+ students who face discrimination will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.Biden is also officially undoing sexual assault due process rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump.

The case will now go before U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, a 2014 appointee of former President Barack Obama. She will handle future motions and set a trial date. The eventual date will undoubtedly be consequential to the 2024 presidential election, as Trump remains the clear frontrunner in a Republican primary race that includes Vice President Mike Pence, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and others.Both sides have already signaled differences in their preferred date for the trial as Smith’s team wants it held before the November 2024 election, while Trump’s defense attorneys have said they will seek a delay until after the election. Trump faces up to 55 years in prison if convicted on all counts. The next court hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday, Aug. 28. Trump does not have to be present. MSNBC host Al Sharpton commented Thursday on Special Counsel Jack Smith’s indictment of Donald Trump and urged people to imagine reading about the news in history books years later.“One day, our children’s children will read American history and can you imagine our reading that James Madison or Thomas Jefferson tried to overthrow the government so they can stay in power? That’s what we’re looking at,” Sharpton told the “Morning Joe” panel. “How it’s going to play out is going to be very important.”“The sad part about this to me is that this is not a man that is facing all this because he believed in a political position or political policy or cause. I’ve seen people go down the wrong side for a cause,” Sharpton continued. “This is all about him.” Special Counsel Smith brought four charges against Trump, all stemming from Smith’s investigation into 2020 election interference and the Capitol protests of Jan. 6, 2021.On Thursday, Trump pleaded not guilty in federal court in Washington, D.C., to all four federal charges.Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich reacted to the testimony of Devon Archer, the former business partner of Hunter Biden, who argued the younger Biden sold access to his father, then-Vice President of the United States, to foreign entities. “All these things keep building week after week,” Gingrich said on ""America's Newsroom"" after the testimony of Archer's recorded transcript was released. “I understand the Democrats have to play defense and they have to pretend they don't understand it but to any normal person, this story is not complicated.”Speaking of Hunter Biden, Gingrich continued: “You had a guy that had no skills, no professional ability who is making money in Kazakhstan, Romania, Ukraine, Russia and China.”Gingrich then said if Hunter had any other last name “then he wouldn’t have made a dime.” “The fact is, he was playing off of his father and we now know, despite Joe Biden’s lies, that [the elder] Biden was part of the game,” Gingrich said, noting the DOJ has shown preferential treatment to the Obama, Clinton and Biden families. He also contrasted Biden's situation with Donald Trump's legal indictments: ""This is so blatantly, disgustingly political that it has no business being in the Department of Justice."" Mollie Hemingway, the editor-in-chief of the Federalist, said during a segment on “Special Report” Thursday that voters are “unhappy” with how President Biden’s Department of Justice continues to pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump, especially given its track record over recent years.Hemingway recalled the DOJ pursued the “Russian collusion” narrative for three years between 2016 and 2019 — which ultimately found Trump did not collude with Russia to win the presidency. The DOJ also mostly ignored the Biden family’s business dealings before the presidential election in 2020, she explained.“They colluded with Big Tech companies to keep that information from coming to light for a lot of Americans,” she said. “And now, is involved in prosecuting the former president in a really novel way and a lot of the country recognizes this as a major problem.” “It’s not just Republican voters who are concerned with the weaponization of our Department of Justice and law enforcement on behalf of the current ruling party but a lot of Independents and moderates are probably very unhappy to see what’s happened to the rule of law in this country as well.”In addition to Trump, the DOJ has gone after parents at school board meetings and pro-lifers, Hemingway noted.Fox News contributor Josh Kraushaar and Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kim Strassel joined the panel to discuss Trump’s legal troubles ahead of the 2024 election.Special Prosecutor Jack Smith addresses reporters after his grand jury has issued more indictments of former President Donald Trump in Washington, DC. (Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images)A CBS News panel fawned over Special Counsel Jack Smith's rigorous fitness routine and how it allegedly ""correlates"" to his indictments of former President Trump.During the network's coverage of Trump's DC arraignment on the Jan. 6 charges, CBS anchor Norah O'Donnell paused to put a spotlight at the former president's courtroom rival. ""I want to spend a moment on Jack Smith because he is essentially who Donald Trump is up against. And multiple of these indictments -- the two, of course, the classified documents and January 6 the one, they’re sitting across from each other inside this courtroom,"" O'Donnell said. ""Jack Smith is somebody who has run and has competed in over 100 triathlons. He was reportedly at one point hit when he was on his bike by a truck and 10 weeks later, he ran another triathlon.""She continued, ""This is a man of a lot of grit and a lot of determination. And even what we have seen in these indictments is just a sliver of what they know and what his prosecutorial team knows, right?""Legal expert and Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy said Thursday that Special Counsel Jack Smith would ultimately regret his ""tactical move"" of indicting former President Donald Trump on the classified documents case in Florida before Thursday's indictment related to Jan. 6 and the 2020 presidential election. McCarthy argued the order of the indictment's gave Trump the ability to argue in the D.C. court that Smith ""undermined"" his ""due process right to prepare a defense"" by choosing to indict him in another district and persuading the judge in the classified documents case to bring the trial forward in May 2024.""He has made himself a kind of minefield in terms of doing that,"" he added.Former White House press secretary and Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer warned Thursday that former President Donald Trump could face trouble in the presidential general election over the federal criminal charges he faces related to Jan. 6 and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.Fleischer conceded that the three indictments Trump has now faced would help him in the Republican primary, but that things would be different come next fall.""I do think all this hurts Donald Trump in a general election, particularly with a group that Republicans have struggled with recently, which is college educated suburban voters,"" Fleischer said.""Primary, I think this fortifies him; general, I think this could potentially hurt him, yes,"" Fleischer added.House Republican Conference Chair Rep.

Trump pleaded ""not guilty"" to four federal counts stemming from alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden. It’s his second federal indictment and third criminal indictment in the span of less than five months. His Republican allies in Congress have continued to stick by him, however. GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, the No. 3 leader in the House, echoed Trump’s repeated insistence that investigations into his conduct are ""witch hunts.""""The unconstitutional and unprecedented arrest of President Donald J. Trump is truly a chilling chapter in Joe Biden’s weaponization of the Department of Justice against his leading political opponent who is beating Biden in many independent polls.

While Trump has accused the Biden administration of orchestrating a witch hunt against him, GOP candidate Will Hurd told Fox News Digital just ahead of the arraignment, ""This is not about the weaponization of the government.""""This is not about individuals in Washington, D.C., that serve on a grand jury,"" said Hurd, a former CIA spy and member of the House Texas delegation. ""This is about a former president who lost an election and tried to use everything within his power to overturn that election, failed, and now he’s trying to stay out of prison.""On the opposite end of the spectrum was multimillionaire biotech entrepreneur, best-selling author and culture wars crusader Vivek Ramaswamy, who charged that Trump's indictment was the ""politicized persecution of political opponents."" ""I wanted to make a point to say we the public deserve to know what did [Attorney General] Merrick Garland tell Jack Smith? What did [President] Joe Biden tell Merrick Garland? Just tell us. Be transparent with the public,"" Ramaswamy told Fox News Digital. ""And I think, right now, we live in a time when we feel like the government suppresses the truth.""A seemingly casual greeting to the former president of the United States set social media abuzz Thursday when a judge presiding over the arraignment for former President Donald Trump referred to him as ""Mr. Trump.""Trump pleaded not guilty in federal court in Washington, D.C., to all four federal charges stemming from Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into 2020 election interference and the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021.U.S. Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhaya presided over Thursday's proceedings, and reporters and onlookers highlighted how she referred to the former president as ""Mr. Trump.""The greeting sparked speculation whether Trump would be stung by the lack of presidential reference. ""If there is one thing I know Trump loves that he's called Mr. President now,"" ABC Executive Editorial Producer John Santucci tweeted.""No mention of Donald Trump being former president. No special treatment. Treating him as just another man in a Courtroom. This is the rule of law at its best,"" Democratic commentator Victor Shi said.Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, argued Thursday that Trump's latest indictment only ""strengthens,"" ""expands,"" and ""hardens"" his support for the former president going into the 2024 election.Jordan touted a recent New York Times poll showing Trump tied with President Biden in a hypothetical general election matchup, and said Americans living in ""flyover country"" were ""sick"" of the elitist behavior coming from those targeting Trump in these indictments.He went on to discuss the ongoing investigations into the Biden family finances and alleged involvement in an international bribery scheme.Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz argued Thursday that former Attorney General Bill Barr is ""dead wrong"" in his assessment of the latest Trump indictment, and said prosecutors will have to prove the former president knew and believed he lost the 2020 presidential election to prevail. Dershowitz joined ""The Brian Kilmeade Show"" on Thursday to discuss his previous legal predictions and why the Justice Department could be facing an uphill battle in proving Trump's alleged guilt in connection with the Jan. 6 charges.""I like Bill Barr. He's a good man, but I think he's just dead wrong about that,"" Dershowitz said. ""Of course, this is a free speech case. Everything involves his exercise of free speech and not only First Amendment free speech, but also the First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances.""""The way you protest an election is to come up with an alternate slate of electors. That was done in 1960. That was the Tilden Hayes election. That's been done throughout history. And a court in Hawaii said that's the right way to do it,"" he added.Republican presidential candidate Will Hurd, a frequent critic of former President Donald Trump, said Thursday that the latter's latest arraignment was ""something that was preventable."" Speaking with Fox News Digital on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, Hurd said the charges brought against Trump were ""not about the weaponization of the government,"" but rather about Trump ""trying to stay out of prison.""""This... didn't have to happen if he would have been like every other president and accepted the election he wouldn't be in this position,"" Hurd said.When asked about Trump's continued front-runner status, Hurd noted the first primary contests were ""weeks away,"" and pushed back on any notion the race was already decided for Trump.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., should be held accountable for other violent incidents. Walker discussed the federal indictment against Trump on ""The Julie Mason Show"" on SiriusXM radio. He argued that GOP primary voters will rally around the besieged former president because they think the charges are political and unfair.""I think there’s a sense when they feel like someone’s being attacked, there’s a sense in the family of circling around that person and trying to protect them, and I think that’s a little bit of it here,"" Walker said.""People think, ‘Well, if these sorts of things are worthy of indictment, why aren't they indicting Bernie Sanders for inciting violence against Steve Scalise and the other Republicans at the baseball practice or Chuck Schumer for the things he said about Supreme Court justices?’"" Walker continued.

""Unlike the other candidates, I didn't rush out with a statement yesterday on Trump's indictment for one simple reason — like most Americans, I'm tired of commenting on every Trump drama. I've lost track of whether this indictment is the third or fourth or the fifth,"" Haley said on the ""Good Morning New Hampshire with Jack Heath"" radio show.Haley cited other national security and economic issues as more important focuses for her attention rather than the ongoing legal drama.She continued, ""We should be focusing on how to stop China.

But I want to underline what we're doing. I think it's the right thing to do, but it is a modified form of Russian roulette.”Bolton is one of several former Trump officials to have turned against the former president after Jan. 6.He explained, “If Trump is convicted in one or both of the federal cases, I think that will turn things upside down. I think he could be denied the Republican nomination. He'd certainly lose the election.”“But the risk is real… the impeachment efforts against Trump failed twice to convict him, and what it what was the consequence of the failure? Emboldening and empowering Trump.

This is election interference at its finest against the leading candidate right now for president for either party,” Habba said. “President Trump is under siege in a way that we have never seen before. President Trump and his legal team and everyone on his team will continue to fight. Not for him, but for the American people.”She would not say directly whether she thought the case should move forward before or after the next presidential election, but said, “I think that every court needs to look at this as a whole.”“It's not about the Jan. 6 case. It's about the fact that in the matter of a couple of months, we have seen them try and tie up – and me as an attorney, I've never seen this – tie up one individual… who's running a campaign, in a campaign, running for office for president, so that he is in court in depositions and distract him so that he won't properly run for 2024.

The podcast was recorded before special counsel Jack Smith unveiled a federal grand jury indictment against Trump on Tuesday. Other Trump rivals have stood by the former president and accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Department of Justice against a potential 2024 opponent.Vivek Ramaswamy went to the courthouse where Trump will attend a hearing on Thursday and demanded that the government ""tell us the truth about what's really driving this flurry of prosecutions, with trial dates set during the height of the upcoming election."" ""That’s why I sued the DOJ this week to tell us exactly what Biden told Garland & what Garland told Jack Smith about the Trump indictments. That’s why I was in Nashville yesterday to demand the release of the transgender school shooter’s manifesto. That’s why I’ve pledged to release the state action files about what the government tells tech companies to suppress. We *can* handle the TRUTH,"" Ramaswamy said. A diverse panel of voters weighed in on the latest indictment against former President Donald Trump on ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday morning. ""It just seems like an ex-boyfriend seeking revenge in court and just slamming their spouse,"" said Republican voter Lydia Dominguez, an Air Force veteran and former Democrat from Las Vegas. ""All these different charges, it's just overwhelming. I'm over it. They just need to move on.""Republican voter Moses Sanchez of Arizona said he thinks ""most people aren't paying attention to the specifics"" of the charges against Trump. ""I think the average American couldn't tell you the difference between the third indictment, the second indictment — which indictment is this? I think a lot of people are just checked out,"" Sanchez said. ""Clearly [Trump] has calcified his support during this time and during this indictment and a lot of voters feel like he is being attacked by the mainstream media and he's being victimized.""Bernadette Wright, an independent from Georgia, agreed with the others that the timing of the indictment is ""strange.""""It's taking over all of the election news,"" said Wright. ""He has gotten so big that it's gotten out of control.""Former Reagan Justice Department chief of staff Mark Levin warned the current DOJ's legal pursuit and indictment of former President Donald Trump is another step in the ""unraveling"" of America at the hands of Democrats. Levin, host of ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" on Fox News, said Wednesday he is praying that his premonitions are wrong, but asserted the Democratic Party is intentionally creating a ""combustible situation"" among the populace, even beyond its indictment of a former president on charges that could land Trump in prison for hundreds of years.""You see what's going on. You see we're unraveling… The Democrat Party is destroying our schools, it's destroying parental rights, it's destroying the nuclear family, it's destroying people of faith. It's gone after the Catholic Church. The Democrat Party is promoting censorship in all of its departments and agencies. It's destroying our traditions,"" Levin said. Levin said President Biden's claim his administration is building a ""bottom up; middle out"" society is anything but true, instead contending the behavior of the president and Democratic Party is that of a ""passive revolution"" that is nonviolent but radically transforms longstanding institutions to control all aspects of life and repress political opposition.""It's the kind of revolution that Antonio Gramsci, an Italian Communist, and even [Soviet leader Vladimir] Lenin talked about, where they take over the institutions of government, they take over the institutions of the culture and they impose their will.""""We now have a government that's banning household products from light bulbs to automobiles in order to control your life. We have a government that is destroying your lifestyle; driving up the cost of energy. It's going to get worse before it gets better."" He said of Trump's latest indictment that nothing like this has happened since 1776, and said all of the prosecutors charging or potentially preparing to charge Trump are politically opposed to him.""They will use any tool they can. They don't care about free speech. They don't care about the Bill of Rights. They don't care about attorney-client privilege… This is a Democrat Party that is power-hungry, and they see an opportunity right now to monopolize the government and politics forevermore.""Fox News' Charles Creitz contributed to this report.On ""Fox & Friends First"" on Wednesday, former Assistant FBI Director Chris Swecker sounded off on the ""extraordinary"" indictment against Trump, arguing it read more like an ""op-ed or political manifesto.""""This is an extraordinary indictment. When I read it, I thought I was reading a New York Times op-ed or a political manifesto. Where's the beef? There is nothing in there that goes beyond opinion, talking, expressing things,"" Swecker said. ""And I'm not defending President Trump because I think he did a lot of things that were ill-advised and unwise, probably against his lawyers' advice,"" he continued. ""But these charges are conspiracy charges. That means there are other people involved. And I think there are six or seven lawyers that are... unnamed or not named, but they are unnamed co-conspirators. And it is alleging basically that Trump provided some sort of disinformation campaign, that he knew that the election was not stolen, that there was not enough fraud to have stolen the election. And yet he went forward with all of these actions and tried to get the election overturned in a lot of different ways. But those charges are extraordinary. ""I don't think I've ever seen an indictment like this in my 40-plus years in this business. So, it'll be interesting to see. I know he does not have a favorable judge. He has an unfavorable judge. We'll see. I think this case could get thrown out if it really were an objective Constitution-adhering judge, you would see this case thrown out very early in the process.""Fox News' Madeline Coggins contributed to this report.IOWA CITY, IOWA - JULY 29: Republican presidential candidate former U.N.

One of the first to release a statement was former CIA spy and former Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a long-shot for the nomination and a very vocal GOP Trump critic. ""Let me be crystal clear: Trump's presidential bid is driven by an attempt to stay out of prison and scam his supporters into footing his legal bills.

""I will have more to say about the government’s case after reviewing the indictment.""

(Photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Legal experts are criticizing special counsel Jack Smith for his latest indictment against Donald Trump for accusing the former president of spreading disinformation and other activities protected by the First Amendment.Trump was indicted out of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation related to 2020 election interference and the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, and is facing charges such as conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. ""The most jarring thing about this indictment is it basically just accuses him of disinformation — this is a disinformation indictment,"" said legal scholar Jonathan Turley, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University and a Fox News contributor.""It said [Trump] was spreading falsehoods, that [he] was undermining integrity of the election — that is all part of the First Amendment,"" Turley said. ""And I think that courts will look skeptically.""Andy McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor and assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Fox News contributor, told Fox News Digital that Smith brought ""a lousy case.""""I think all the counts have significant legal problems, and that’s even before you get to the complex problems of trying to prove Trump’s intent,"" McCarthy said. But not every legal expert says Smith's case is weak. Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law emeritus at Harvard University, told Fox News Digital that Smith has brought an ""airtight"" indictment against the former president.""The factual details, if true as claimed, leave Trump with no legitimate legal defenses,"" Tribe said. ""And the sources for all the damning direct quotations, including those by Mr. Trump himself, are all individuals he hand-picked for their loyalty to him — they have no conceivable motive to lie. And there’s no chance they’re misremembering anything so stark.""Tribe told Fox News Digital that Trump’s ""only hope to avoid conviction"" on this latest set of charges is ""to get someone installed as president who would pardon him or get the Justice Department to drop the case.""Fox news' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.Former Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday rejected the notion by former President Donald Trump's then-attorney John Eastman that he could have ""paused"" the certification of the Electoral College vote on January 6, 2021, referring to him as a ""crackpot"" lawyer.Pence made the comments during an appearance on Fox News' ""The Story,"" telling host Martha MacCallum that he did his duty as vice president according to the Constitution by not bowing to calls for him to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.""I was confident as a student of American history that those founders would have never vested the vice president or anyone else with unilateral authority to decide what Electoral College votes to count and which not to count. I was clear on that throughout. I was clear with President Trump throughout all the way up to the morning of January 6th,"" Pence said. ""But let's let's be clear on this point. It wasn't just that he asked for a pause. The president specifically asked me — and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers asked me — to literally reject votes, which would have resulted in the issue being turned over to the House of Representatives. And literally chaos would have ensued,"" he added.Fox News' Brandon Gillespie contributed to this report.The indictment against Trump claims he made ""knowingly false"" claims about the 2020 presidential election and urged Pence to illegally overturn the results. (Ty Wright/Getty Images)Then-Vice President Mike Pence took ""contemporaneous notes"" of his conversations with Donald Trump in the days before the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, Special Counsel Jack Smith's indictment of the former president revealed Tuesday. Pence's previously unreported notes are presented as evidence against Trump, who faces four federal charges related to his actions after the 2020 presidential election and unproven claims the election was stolen. Trump is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights. The indictment cites several phone calls between Trump and Pence in late December 2020 and early January 2021 in which Trump allegedly made ""knowingly false"" claims about the election and pressured his vice president to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory. Pence recounted some of these conversations in his memoir, ""So Help Me God."" Pence's notes recount how Trump told him the ""Justice Department [was] finding major infractions"" in the election, a claim the special counsel calls false.During a meeting on Jan. 3, 2021, Trump allegedly said ""Bottom line-won every state by 100,000s of votes"" and ""We son every state."" Citing Pence's notes, the indictment also claims Trump asked, ""What about 205,000 votes more in PA than voters?"" — a claim his senior Department of Justice officials had debunked as early as the day before, the indictment alleges.Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to appear in federal court in Washington, D.C., Thursday afternoon after being indicted on charges that stem from Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into 2020 election interference and the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump, the 2024 GOP front-runner, faces four federal charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.The former president is expected to travel from Bedminster, New Jersey, to Washington, D.C., on Thursday. He was ordered to appear in federal court for a 4 p.m. arraignment.This is the second federal indictment the former president faces out of Smith’s investigation. Trump, who leads the 2024 GOP presidential primary field, has already pleaded not guilty to 37 counts related to his alleged improper retention of classified records from his presidency.Those charges include willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and false statements. Trump was charged with an additional three counts as part of a superseding indictment out of that probe last week.Trump is the first former president in U.S. history to face federal criminal charges.

"cnn","Biden on China vs. Trump on China","Zachary B. Wolf","The current US president, Joe Biden, has spent his first term talking about the need to use American democracy as a counterweight to autocracy in China, among other countries. Biden called out Chinese President Xi Jinping by name in his State of the Union address earlier this year as he slammed autocracies. “Name me a world leader who’d change places with Xi Jinping. Name me one!” Biden said, ad-libbing in the House chamber in his February address. How about the former US president, Donald Trump, who is desperately trying to become a world leader once again? Trump has spoken with clear envy for Xi’s iron-handed ability to extend his presidency for the foreseeable future. “He’s now president for life,” Trump said during a speech to donors at Mar-a-Lago back in 2018. “I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll have to give that a shot some day.” For all the difference in their rhetoric, however, it’s striking that there is a throughline between Trump’s and Biden’s China policy. Trump amped up US support for Taiwan, which Biden has continued. Trump engineered tariffs on Chinese imports that complicated the US relationship with China. Biden has notably left them in place. The Biden administration is on the cusp of a new deal in which China would agree to crack down on the export of ingredients used to make fentanyl, known as precursors, which find their way from China to Mexico and ultimately devastate US communities. If that sounds familiar, it’s because the Trump administration also reached a deal with China to schedule fentanyl and its derivatives as a controlled substance. That earlier deal, agreed to over a steak dinner shared by Trump and Xi in Buenos Aires, according to CNN’s report at the time, didn’t stop the flow of fentanyl into the US. Biden is set to meet with Xi Wednesday outside San Francisco on the sidelines of a larger meeting of Asia-Pacific nations, and the main goal of the four-hour meeting, according to the US president, is to get the two countries “back on a normal course” and “being able to pick up the phone and talk to one another if there’s a crisis, being able to make sure that our militaries still have contact with one another.” That’s a particularly important goal at a time when two wars – the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the Israel-Hamas war – make the post-World War II international order feel flimsy. A key reason Biden has cited for supporting Ukraine against Russia is to deter countries outside Europe, who are watching. Biden has vocally supported Taiwan, a democratic island that the Communist leadership in Beijing has long claimed as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it. Biden has repeatedly teased that the US would offer military support in the event of a Chinese invasion, abandoning the long-time principle of strategic ambiguity by which the US offered support for Taiwan while attempting not to anger China on the topic. As president, Trump supported Taiwan in numerous ways, but there is some indication he could return to a more strategically ambiguous position. Over the summer, Trump complained on Fox News that Taiwan “took all of our chip business,” referring to semiconductors, and he would not say how the US should defend Taiwan in the event of Chinese action against the island. The semiconductor issue is important domestically. Biden has pushed the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan law to prop up the US semiconductor industry and bring new manufacturing jobs. The more intentional and public support for Taiwan under the Trump and Biden administrations has had an effect. The Chinese military cut off normal contacts with its American counterparts after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022. Now the US wants to bring down the temperature a bit. “The US and China are in competition,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday, adding that Biden wants to “manage that competition responsibly, so it doesn’t tip over into conflict.” Specifically getting the militaries talking again is an important step, he said. Talking is a nice thing, The Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin said on “CNN This Morning,” but it’s not exactly a major breakthrough. “In terms of solving any of the problems in the US-China relationship, addressing China’s economic aggression, its military expansion, its internal repression, its problem with all of its other neighbors who will also be there in San Francisco – 20-something Asian countries – no, no real progress at all,” Rogin said. “So, yeah, talking is better than not talking.” The countries, the world’s two largest economies, are importantly linked by trade, and that link is not coming to an end any time soon. In 2022, China was both the top exporter to the US and one of the top importers of US goods. “We’re not trying to decouple from China,” Biden told reporters Tuesday. “What we’re trying to do is change the relationship for the better.” Trump, meanwhile, frequently brags about his personal relationships with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. The former president promised during an appearance in New Hampshire over the weekend that if he were reelected, he would be able to stave off World War III – an unprovable and ludicrous claim. “President Xi in China controls 1.4 billion people in China with an iron hand,” Trump told supporters at the campaign event, praising Xi for his smarts and going on an extended riff about how the US should emulate China with abridged trials and a swift death penalty for drug dealers. But given his failure to secure a lasting crackdown on fentanyl sourced from China, it’s notable that Trump’s respect for Xi is based on China’s attitude about drugs. Set aside that Trump’s death penalty proposal for drug dealers is not new and is also in bizarre conflict with his First Step Act, his greatest bipartisan achievement as president, which lowered sentences for some drug traffickers. Focus instead on his effusive praise for Xi. “President Xi is like central casting. There’s nobody in Hollywood that can play the role of President Xi. The look, the strength, the voice,” Trump said. He lowered his voice in a strange emulation of the Chinese leader: “We will begin immediately negotiation.” For all of their many differences, both Trump and Biden are known to prize personal contact even with world leaders they oppose. Biden will get that opportunity for the first time in a year with this meeting outside San Francisco. It will be the first time Xi has visited the US since 2017, when Trump hosted Xi at Mar-a-Lago, a bizarre meeting when Trump told Xi about US missile strikes against Syria while the two ate chocolate cake.","https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/politics/biden-trump-china-what-matters/index.html",7220,2023-11-14,"biden"
"cnn","Tim Scott takes center stage in Trump-Haley battle as South Carolina primary approaches","Aaron Pellish","Former President Donald Trump’s campaign released this week a new ad attacking former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ahead of Saturday’s South Carolina GOP primary. But instead of featuring Trump’s voice, it highlighted attacks against Haley levied by Sen. Tim Scott. The ad, which featured Trump’s most prominent surrogate in the state outlining Haley’s proposal to increase the gas tax as governor, illustrated the fallout between two South Carolina Republicans with a rich history that started amicably but turned increasingly bitter over the course of the 2024 presidential campaign. While Haley faces steep odds to overtake Trump for the Republican nomination, Scott’s decision to endorse Trump in January has thrust him back into the spotlight after suspending his own presidential campaign last year, and he’s recently been floated as a possible vice-presidential nominee alongside Trump. A CBS News poll of South Carolina Republicans released earlier this month showed Trump leading Haley by 35 points. Scott on Thursday said that Haley stepping aside would be for “the good of the country.” “The one person that stands in the way of having a conversation between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is Nikki Haley, and so getting out of the way is incredibly important, not for the party but for America’s future,” Scott said in response to a question from CNN’s Jeff Zeleny. Scott will join Trump at his rally on Friday in Rock Hill and will then fly with the former president to the Black Conservative Federation gala in Columbia, according to a spokesman for the senator. Scott and Haley began their relationship under favorable circumstances. Haley, who served as South Carolina governor from 2011 to 2017, elevated Scott from his House seat to the US Senate in 2012 to fill a vacancy left by Sen. Jim DeMint’s retirement. Scott was in the middle of his first term in Congress when Haley appointed him to the Senate. He’d previously spent most of his political career serving on the Charleston County Council. At the time of his appointment, Haley said Scott “earned the seat” from his personality and his record. After both Haley and Scott jumped into the presidential race last year, they refrained from directly attacking each other even as they courted the same GOP voters and donors. Scott in particular made a point of not criticizing any of his rivals and instead projected an optimistic, positive image he hoped would charm the electorate. But when polls showed Haley rising in the field following heated exchanges with other candidates, Scott used the second Republican debate to take a more aggressive posture, and circled Haley as one of his targets. In addition to criticizing Haley over her proposed increased gas tax, Scott attacked her for approving a $50,000 purchase on curtains during her time as UN ambassador. Haley said the curtains were approved during the Obama administration. While the attacks on Haley helped Scott deliver what was seen as among his strongest moments of his campaign, it did little to improve his standing with voters, and he ultimately dropped out of the race in November. In January, with the field narrowed to just Haley and Trump, both candidates sought Scott’s endorsement as they looked to consolidate as much Republican support as possible. Scott announced his endorsement for Trump at a campaign rally in New Hampshire days before the state’s primary, a pivotal contest where Haley staked her campaign on delivering a strong performance. While Scott said he informed Haley he was planning to endorse Trump, she told CNN she learned of Scott’s endorsement when it was reported in the media, further fraying their relationship. “He didn’t call, he didn’t text. He didn’t tell me that he was going to do this. I texted him and said, ‘Look, I want to sit down and talk.’ Because we had only spoken once since then, I said, ‘I’d love to sit down and talk about an endorsement,’” Haley told CNN in January after Scott endorsed Trump. “He said, ‘I’m getting with my team to figure that out.’ And I never heard anything else again until his endorsement.” Since Scott’s endorsement of Trump, he’s gone to great lengths to not publicly criticize Haley. At Trump’s New Hampshire primary night watch party, Trump appeared to suggest that Scott endorsed him because he disliked Haley – a sentiment Scott quickly dismissed. “She actually appointed you, Tim,” Trump said to Scott, who behind Trump on stage. “You must really hate her.” “I just love you,” Scott replied, stepping to the microphone for the audience to hear. The Haley campaign has taken a sharper stance against Scott, led notably by Haley’s son Nalin. At multiple campaign stops in South Carolina in recent weeks, Haley’s son has labeled Scott “Senator Judas” in introductory remarks. Haley has suggested she doesn’t approve of Nalin attacking Scott publicly. “You know, the last couple of times he’s introduced me, he’s tended to say things he really shouldn’t say. In one instance, he referred to Tim Scott as Senator Judas,” Haley told supporters in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, on Saturday. “So, I sat down with him today and I go, ‘Nalin, I love you, but your job is not to make my life harder. I need you to keep focused on what we’re trying to do.’” Scott said the attacks from Haley’s son reveal how the primary has made Haley “desperate,” and dismissed the label as coming from “someone you would not take advice.” “Politics makes people and their families desperate. It’s unfortunate for a person with a high caliber of an individual that she has been to stoop down to having me and her family refer to me or anyone else as Judas Iscariot or any other name calling,” Scott told CBS News on Sunday. “The one thing I will say to your viewers, when you are attacked, please remember this: Do not take criticism from someone you would not take advice.” Since endorsing Trump, Scott has inspired speculation, including from Trump himself, about the possibility of him joining the former president on the GOP ticket. Scott has conspicuously tacked closer to Trump’s worldview in recent days, refusing to say whether he would have overturned the results of the 2020 presidential election if he were vice president. “I’m not going to answer hypothetical questions,” Scott told CNN on Sunday in response to a question about the 2020 election. As a senator, Scott voted to certify the results of the 2020 election. And last August, Scott said former Vice President Mike Pence “absolutely” did the right thing in certifying the election results. Despite his own failed presidential bid, Scott has forcefully inserted himself into Trump’s campaign, appearing alongside the former president at every public campaign event he’s held in the state, helping Trump apply maximum pressure on Haley in the days leading up to the South Carolina primary. Trump praised Scott for his campaigning during a Fox News town hall in South Carolina on Tuesday. “I have to say, in a very positive way, Tim Scott, he has been much better for me than he was for himself,” Trump said.

"cnn","What to watch for out of Hunter Biden’s closed-door depositions with Republicans on Capitol Hill","Jeremy Herb;Annie Grayer","Hunter Biden has been the focus of Republicans in Congress since they won the majority over a year ago. Now, they finally get their chance to interrogate President Joe Biden’s son about his foreign business dealings. Hunter Biden is appearing behind closed doors before the House Oversight and Judiciary committees on Wednesday, an appearance that only came after months of public sniping and tense negotiations. The appearance of the president’s son marks the most important testimony to date in the Republican-led impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden. But it comes at the same time that the impeachment probe – already struggling to turn up any evidence of Joe Biden’s involvement in his son’s business dealing – is now grappling with an even bigger blow after a former FBI informant who alleged Ukrainian entities paid millions of dollars in bribes to Biden and his son is now facing federal criminal charges that he fabricated the story. There’s already serious doubts about the impeachment effort among some House Republicans, and Hunter Biden’s testimony may represent impeachment investigators’ last chance to convince skeptical colleagues inside the GOP conference. Republicans have tried to move past the FBI informant’s allegations, and they say that Hunter Biden won’t be the final witness in their investigation. “This is an important interview in our investigation, but it is not the end. There are more subpoenas and more interviews to come,” the House Oversight Committee posted on X on Tuesday. Regardless, Hunter Biden’s appearance is expected to create a spectacle on Capitol Hill, even as he will be testifying behind closed doors. While Hunter Biden had insisted for months that he would only testify in public and House Oversight Chairman James Comer has said a public hearing would follow the deposition, there are currently no plans for a public hearing or discussions about holding one, according to multiple sources. Here’s what to know ahead of Wednesday’s deposition: Hunter Biden’s appearance before the two congressional committees leading the impeachment inquiry Wednesday will be anything but another routine deposition – and that’s not just because the witness is the president’s son. Hunter Biden’s team negotiated several distinct terms that Republicans agreed to so he would appear behind closed doors, after the president’s son and his attorneys had said they would only agree to a public hearing. The deposition will not be videotaped, CNN reported Tuesday, even though other Biden family business associates and related witnesses have all been filmed during their depositions. The two sides also agreed to quickly release the transcript as a way to avoid selective leaks. Sources said the transcript could be released within 24 hours after the deposition. Both sides assume there will not be a conflict releasing this transcript, and that it will happen quickly after a review to redact any sensitive information. The House GOP impeachment investigation has focused heavily on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings, looking for a link to Joe Biden through meetings where Joe Biden met his son’s associates. Republicans in recent weeks have hauled in a series of Biden family business associates who testified, based on first-hand experience, Joe Biden was not involved in his family’s foreign business dealings, undermining the allegation at the heart of their entire investigation. While Republicans have focused on these interactions, none of the hundreds of pages of witness testimony provides evidence that the president was involved in or benefited from his family’s business ventures. Whether it was stopping by a business lunch, overseeing his bookkeeping, an exchange at a White House Fourth of July picnic or a phone call, business associates in the Biden family orbit said they never witnessed Joe Biden do anything wrong. The GOP impeachment inquiry took an even bigger blow earlier this month when the Justice Department charged an ex-FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, accusing him of making up a story that Ukrainian entities paid millions of dollars in bribes to Joe Biden and his son. Republicans have tried to move past the informant’s allegations and play down its significance since the charges were filed. But House leadership and rank-and-file lawmakers repeatedly put Smirnov’s unverified bribery allegation front and center as they made their case against the president in 2023 and this year, depicting the bribery allegation as critical to the impeachment push. On Wednesday, however, Republicans are likely to ignore the bribery claims and focus on Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm, and his work on a joint venture involving a Chinese-backed energy company that dissolved in 2018. Republicans have falsely tried to link Joe Biden’s actions as vice president to push for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor, claiming the prosecutor was investigating Burisma. But that’s a long-debunked allegation against Joe Biden stemming from Donald Trump’s first impeachment in 2019 – in reality, Biden’s actions were consistent with bipartisan US policy, which sought to remove the prosecutor because he wasn’t doing enough to crack down on corruption, including at Burisma. Wednesday’s deposition will be the first chance for Hunter Biden to confront his Republican critics who have accused him of corruption and taunted him for months – and it will also be the first time for the Republicans to interrogate the president’s son. Not surprisingly, the committees are expecting more lawmakers to show up for Hunter Biden than typical for depositions. Hunter Biden has made two appearances on Capitol Hill. He held a news conference outside the Capitol in December, on the day Republicans had scheduled his deposition. Then the president’s son made a surprise appearance at the committee hearing room where the two committees were debating whether to hold Hunter Biden in contempt. His brief 10-minute appearance sparked an intense reaction on both sides of the aisle. “You are the epitome of White privilege,” GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina told Hunter Biden from the dais. “Coming into the Oversight Committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed. What are you afraid of? You have no balls.” Democrats responded by claiming that Republicans weren’t willing to hear from Hunter Biden publicly even as he sat before them. Hunter Biden left the hearing room when GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia began speaking. Last year, during a hearing with IRS whistleblowers, Greene held up large posters showing highly explicit images of a naked Hunter Biden with a sex worker, drawing swift rebukes from Democrats on the panel. On Wednesday, Greene will get the chance to question Hunter Biden. Wednesday’s deposition appeared unlikely to occur at multiple points over the past year, as Hunter Biden’s lawyers and the GOP committee leaders fought over his appearance. After Republicans subpoenaed Hunter Biden, his attorneys said that the president’s son would only appear at a public hearing. Republicans said that was unacceptable, arguing they were going to follow the same process as other witnesses of holding a deposition before any public hearings. The stand-off led to contempt proceedings against Hunter Biden, after he showed up on Capitol Hill the day the committees scheduled his deposition. “For six years, I have been the target of the unrelenting Trump attack machine shouting ‘Where’s Hunter?’ Well, here is my answer, I am here,” Hunter Biden told reporters outside the Capitol. After the committee approved the contempt resolution against Hunter Biden in January, and had the votes to pass it on the floor, his attorney sent the committee a letter arguing he needed to receive a new subpoena, because the original was sent before the House voted to approve the impeachment inquiry. That sparked additional negotiations between the committee and Biden’s lawyers, and less than a week later, the committees announced Wednesday’s deposition was agreed to, putting aside the contempt vote in the House.","https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/politics/what-to-watch-biden-deposition/index.html",8807,2024-02-28,"biden"
"cnn","Opinion: Would a guilty verdict doom Trump at the ballot box?","Mark Mellman","We’re in the midst of a historic first: As Donald Trump’s trial winds down, a jury will decide as early as the coming week whether the former president is guilty of a crime resulting from his alleged effort to conceal the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Pointing to surveys like an ABC News/Ipsos poll that found a fifth of Trump voters would either reconsider or withdraw their support if he’s convicted of a felony, some analysts contend a conviction — itself far from a certainty — could cost Trump the White House in November. As much as I’d like to believe it, there’s ample reason for doubt. Trump may well lose the presidential election again, but a criminal conviction in the current case is unlikely to play a significant role in that outcome. While pollsters can ask voters questions and voters will generally oblige with answers, in some instances the answers can be meaningless mush. Part of the science and art of polling is understanding what kinds of questions are more and less likely to yield meaningful insights. Two kinds of questions tend to be in the mush category — those that ask people directly about changing their views and those that ask individuals to transport themselves to an alternate reality and predict what their response would be in that new context. Asking people how their votes would change if Trump were convicted falls into both categories. Then-President Bill Clinton’s highly partisan and wholly undeserved impeachment in the late 1990s illustrates how survey research and human brains operate in these cases. A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in January 1998 found 55% of voters believed Clinton should be impeached if he had lied under oath about not having an affair with Monica Lewinsky, while 40% opposed impeachment under those circumstances. Months later, it became clear the president had lied. But instead of 55% supporting impeachment, only 30% favored impeaching him (whereas 66% opposed impeachment). Americans had claimed they’d favor impeaching Clinton if he had lied about his relationship. However, when it was evident that he had not been forthright, they overwhelmingly opposed impeachment. Similarly, when the Post pollsters asked whether Clinton should resign if the House voted to impeach him or fight the charges in the Senate, only 38% of Americans wanted him to battle the charges, whereas 58% preferred he resign. Did the electorate hold onto that view after Clinton was impeached by the House? No. In fact, the numbers changed almost instantly. The proportion of Americans who said Clinton should resign rather than fight the charges fell to 42% within days of him being impeached. Difficulties inherent in such poll questions also emerged in the wake of the 2020 election —when most Republicans believed Trump’s fantasy that he had actually won the election. Many of them told my polling firm that they would revise their view if the courts ruled against Trump. However, despite their previous protestations, their minds remained largely unchanged even after Trump lost some 60 cases on the integrity of the election. Similarly, in March of 2016, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found half of the women who voted in Republican primaries said they could not imagine themselves voting for Trump in the general election. Nearly 90% did in November what they could not imagine in March. Beliefs are persistent, stubborn things. People fancy themselves open to new information and sometimes we are. But I’ve learned from 40 years of studying public opinion that mostly we cling to our preconceived views about social and political matters of import. Moreover, people are not very adept at forecasting their reaction to changed realities. Humans struggle to transport themselves to parallel universes and correctly predict their reactions in that alternate reality. Is it possible that a Trump conviction will change votes? Of course it is. The charges against Trump are more serious than those Clinton faced, and no former president has ever been convicted before. Of course, some presidents have been deeply damaged by scandal. Richard Nixon’s approval rating sank from 67% to 31% between January and August 1973 as Watergate consumed public attention. When he resigned a year later, only 24% approved of his performance. A Trump conviction could result in similar fate, though history would urge us to bet against it. The point, though, is that answers to poll questions today yield little insight as to how the public will ultimately react in November. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens after the jury renders its verdict.","https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/25/opinions/trump-guilty-verdict-2024-vote-mellman/index.html",5023,2024-05-25,"trump"
"cnn","Biden says antisemitism has no place in America in somber speech connecting the Holocaust to Hamas’ attack on Israel","Betsy Klein","President Joe Biden on Tuesday issued a call to fight a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism, saying such hate has no place in America as he connected the horrors of the Holocaust to Hamas’ attack on Israel. Biden’s speech was a somber – yet impassioned – moment of reflection amid a tense and pivotal time in his reelection push. The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden’s presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values. “We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone,” Biden said. But Biden’s staunch support for Israel’s war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel’s campaign and the Biden administration’s support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential political problems that the president is facing with the younger voters he needs to win a second term. On Tuesday, during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw direct links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas’ attack. “This ancient hatred of Jews didn’t begin with the Holocaust – it didn’t end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,” Biden said. He continued, “Now, here we are – not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later – and people are already forgetting. They’re already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. … I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.” Biden pointed to a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism in the US in the aftermath of October 7, from propaganda on social media to Jewish students being harassed or attacked on campus. “Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 – including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It’s absolutely despicable – and it must stop,” he said, raising his voice. The president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas’ attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans “can’t stand by and stand silent.” Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased. The most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a “dramatic” increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are “more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.” Biden offered a direct message to American Jews Tuesday. “I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. Let me reassure you as your president: You are not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will,” he said. He recounted the story of Tom Lantos, who escaped a Nazi labor camp during the Holocaust with the help of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who used his diplomatic cover to hide and rescue about 100,000 Jews. Lantos became a top adviser to Biden, then a first-term senator, and later became the only Holocaust survivor elected to Congress. The president quoted Lantos, who warned, “The veneer of civilization is paper-thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.” “My fellow Americans: We must be the guardians,” Biden added. While the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza. The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel’s war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks. The president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel’s military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to “evacuate immediately,” raising questions about whether Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out – a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against. During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden “again made this clear” in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s not clear such a plan has been presented to the US. Biden on Tuesday reiterated his “ironclad” commitment to Israel’s right to exist as an independent Jewish state – “even when we disagree.” Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah. The speech also came as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation’s colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18. On Tuesday, Biden reaffirmed the right to free speech, but roundly condemned antisemitism, hate speech and threats of violence “against Jews or anyone else.” Biden’s speech on the topic last week appeared to mark a shift in the administration’s response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning “abhorrent” incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources – a move aimed at further bolstering the administration’s public-facing response to the protests. He cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should “go back to Poland,” verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors. House Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking earlier at the same event as Biden on Tuesday, compared the growing unrest at college campuses to German “elite centers of learning” in the 1930s and 40s “where anti-Jewish courses were introduced” and saying “today we are witnessing American universities quickly becoming hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.” “The very campuses which were once the envy of the International Academy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus. Students who were known for producing academic papers are now known for stabbing their Jewish peers in the eyes with Palestinian flags. Faculty who once produced cutting-edge research are now linking arms with pro-Hamas protesters and calling for global intifada,” Johnson said. On Monday, a day ahead of Biden’s speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders. Tuesday’s speech came alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet. The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Department of Homeland Security is working to “build an online campus safety resource guide” to provide “financial, educational, and technical assistance” for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing “best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,” the fact sheet said. And the State Department’s Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism “will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,” the fact sheet said. Biden’s speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden’s campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump’s antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler “did some good things.” The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden’s speeches are these days, the senior administration official said. Still, Biden’s steadfast support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University’s Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Biden’s remarks linking the Holocaust and the October 7 attack were largely praised by pro-Israel groups. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street – a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group – said in a statement he is grateful to Biden “for standing unequivocally against the sharp rise in antisemitism while also defending our First Amendment rights to speech and nonviolent protest.” Adam Lehman, the president and CEO of Hillel International, a Jewish campus group, said in a statement Biden’s remarks “come at an important moment, as anti-Israel and anti-Jewish groups continue to pursue hateful, divisive and destructive actions that violate the civil rights of Jewish students and undermine campus safety for all students.” However, leaders of two of the largest US Jewish groups that have been critical of Israel’s actions in its war with Hamas said Biden had missed the mark in his description of college protests. Stefanie Fox, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, said Biden’s characterization of campus protests was “entirely inaccurate” and “a really intentional misrepresentation.” She said that “peaceful multiracial, multifaith student protesters are simply calling out the very clear complicity of their universities in the Israeli attack on Palestinians.” Eva Borgwardt, a national spokesperson for IfNotNow, said Biden’s speech “was a misclassification of what’s happening on college campuses.” “To respond to a few isolated incidents in what has been overwhelmingly nonviolent student protest with the use of police and state force that targets particularly Palestinian, black and brown students, Jewish students among them, is a completely irresponsible and dangerous approach to protest and does not at all advance any kind of Jewish safety,” Borgwardt said.
