Why the NCAA Should Be Terrified of Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh’s Concurrence,Sean Gregory,Sports;College Sports,"June 21, 2021 6:24 PM EDT","For years, critics of the college sports business model—which tends to enrich schools and administrators, but not the actual players—have relished the potential of this day: a Supreme Court ruling against the NCAA. But while today’s unanimous Court opinion on behalf of college athletes in NCAA v Alston is historic for momentum towards real real change in college sports, for the good stuff, go to Kavanaugh. As in, the concurring opinion of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who took a sharp turn from the measured approach in criticizing NCAA arguments offered in the principal opinion penned by Justice Neil Gorsuch. This shouldn’t be entirely surprising. During oral arguments in the case, which questioned whether the NCAA was permitted to cap education-related benefits to college athletes—a district court ruled that it couldn’t, and the Supreme Court upheld that decision—Kavanaugh was particularly aggressive in his questioning of NCAA lawyers. “It does seem … schools are conspiring with competitors—agreeing with competitors, let’s say that—to pay no salaries for the workers who are making the school billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing,” Kavanaugh said during the March 31 proceedings. “And that just seems entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing.” In his opinion, Kavanaugh seemed to invite more legal challenges to the NCAA’s caps on all forms of compensation for athletes, not just those tethered to education, which was the narrower focus of this particular Supreme Court case. “Nowhere else in America can businesses get away with agreeing not to pay their workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate,” Kavanaugh wrote. “And under ordinary principles of antitrust law, it is not evident why college sports should be any different. The NCAA is not above the law.” Those words, from a Supreme Court justice no less, serve as a useful rallying cry, sure to be quoted by lawyers representing college athletes, and college athletes themselves, for years to come. Not that a ruling that allows schools to offer athletes additional education-related benefits like scholarships for graduate school, internships, and computer equipment isn’t of great importance on its own. First, these items are intrinsically valuable to college athletes. And second, the timing of a Supreme Court victory for college athletes couldn’t be better, as they fight for additional economic rights. On July 1, state laws allowing athletes to profit from their own name and image in likeness (NIL) are set to go in effect in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas. The NCAA has pushed for the Congress to pass a national NIL law by July 1, but that’s unlikely to happen: the NCAA is expected to vote on its own NIL legislation this week. Although the Court did not rule on the rights of athletes to secure third-party sponsorships in NCAA vs Alston, it did strike down the NCAA’s continued reliance on language from a 1984 Supreme Court case to justify its commitment to curtailing compensation. In that case, NCAA v Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma—which pertained to the rights of sports conferences to negotiate their own television rights deals—Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority: “The NCAA plays a critical role in the maintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports. There can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role, or that the preservation of the student-athlete in higher education adds richness and diversity to intercollegiate athletics and is entirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act.” The Court, Gorsuch wrote, “could not agree” with the NCAA’s longstanding argument that, essentially, amateurism must be maintained because it says so (and that a 37-year-old Supreme Court opinion justifies this stance). “These remarks do not suggest that courts must reflexively reject all challenges to the NCAA’s compensation restrictions,” the Court writes in NCAA v Alston. “Given the sensitivity of antitrust analysis to market realities—and how much has changed in this market—we think it would be particularly unwise to treat an aside in Board of Regents as more than that. This Court may be ‘infallible only because we are final,’ … but those sorts of stray comments are neither.” And the markets realities cannot be clearer. “At the center of this thicket of associations and rules sits a massive business,” Gorsuch writes, noting the $1.1 billion annual worth of the March Madness broadcast contract, and that the TV deal for the College Football Playoff is worth $470 million per year.” Those who run this enterprise profit in a different way than the student-athletes whose activities they oversee. The president of the NCAA earns nearly $4 million per year. Commissioners of the top conferences take home between $2 to $5 million. College athletic directors average more than $1 million annually. And annual salaries for top Division I college football coaches approach $11 million, with some of their assistants making more than $2.5 million.” So while the Court was careful not to officially settle the debate about whether athletes have rights to all forms of compensation—agreeing with an appeals court that “the national debate about amateurism in college sports is important. But our task as appellate judges is not to resolve it. Nor could we.”— a reasonable takeaway from the Court’s seems clear: the current model is badly broken. Kavanaugh makes things even clearer. “The NCAA couches its arguments for not paying student athletes in innocuous labels,” he writes in the concurring opinion. “But the labels cannot disguise the reality: The NCAA’s business model would be flatly illegal in almost any other industry in America. All of the restaurants in a region cannot come together to cut cooks’ wages on the theory that “customers prefer” to eat food from low-paid cooks. Law firms cannot conspire to cabin lawyers’ salaries in the name of providing legal services out of a “love of the law.” Hospitals cannot agree to cap nurses’ income in order to create a “purer” form of helping the sick. News organizations cannot join forces to curtail pay to reporters to preserve a “tradition” of public-minded journalism. Movie studios cannot collude to slash benefits to camera crews to kindle a “spirit of amateurism” in Hollywood.”  He also cites a brief, filed by a group of African-American Antitrust Lawyers, that squarely frames the issue as a civil rights one. “College presidents, athletic directors, coaches, conference commissioners, and NCAA executives take in six- and seven-figure salaries,” Kavanaugh wrote. “Colleges build lavish new facilities. But the student athletes who generate the revenues, many of whom are African American and from lower-income backgrounds, end up with little or nothing.” The Supreme Court may not have “blown up” college sports with one swipe of the pen. But college athletes will soon get their fairer share thanks to the Court. Write to Sean Gregory at sean.gregory@time.com",https://time.com/6074583/ncaa-supreme-court-ruling/
"Your Questions About the Colorado Trump Ruling, Answered",Solcyré Burga;Why did the Colorado Supreme Court kick Trump off the ballot?;What is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?;How does Trump's behavior on Jan. 6 relate to the 14th Amendment?;Do legal experts agree with the ruling?;Have other states considered this claim?;What will the U.S. Supreme Court do?,Politics;Donald Trump,"December 20, 2023 1:36 PM EST","The Colorado Supreme Court ruled late Tuesday that former President Donald Trump is ineligible for election in the first-ever invocation of the U.S. Constitution’s insurrection clause for the presidency.  Trump was removed from the state’s presidential primary ballot in a 4-3 vote in which justices partially overturned a previous district court’s ruling on the matter. One of the issues under question was whether Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which has an “insurrectionist ban,” disqualified Trump from being on the presidential primary ballot.  “We do not reach these conclusions lightly,” the state supreme court, whose justices were all appointed by Democratic governors, said in their filing. “We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.” Read More: How Republicans Are Reacting to the Colorado Ruling to Remove Trump From the Ballot Trump's attorneys vowed to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.  “The Colorado Supreme Court issued a completely flawed decision tonight and we will swiftly file an appeal to the United States Supreme Court and a concurrent request for a stay of this deeply undemocratic decision,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that accused “the all-Democrat appointed Colorado Supreme Court” of being part of a scheme to “interfere in an election on behalf of Crooked Joe Biden.” The Colorado Supreme Court said that they would stay their ruling until Jan. 4 in case the decision goes under review by a higher court. The state begins to print names on presidential primary ballots on Jan. 5.  Here’s what to know.  In September, Colorado electors filed the initial petition to remove Trump from the Republican presidential primary ballot. The six voters claimed that the former president should be ineligible under the 14th Amendment because he engaged in an act of insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. The lawsuit made its way to the district court, which ruled that Trump did engage in insurrection, but that the rules in the 14th Amendment did not apply to the presidency, and that therefore Trump should remain on the presidential ballot.  The Colorado Supreme Court agreed that Trump engaged in an insurrection, but ruled that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does, in fact, apply to the presidency, meaning that Trump could not appear on the ballot.  The 14th Amendment was ratified shortly after the Civil War to abolish slavery, but also included other provisions. Section 3 of the 14th amendment says that “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office…who, having previously taken an oath…to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”  In other words, Section 3 disqualifies people from certain positions of power if they have previously taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and engaged in an insurrection, or given some sort of aid to a U.S. enemy.  This provision was most recently applied in Sept. 2022, when a New Mexico County commissioner was removed from his position after his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.  Both the district and state supreme court of Colorado found that the actions that took place on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the capitol while President Joe Biden’s win was being certified, constituted an insurrection. They also agreed that the former president engaged in that insurrection.  Last year, the Jan. 6 Committee assembled by the House to investigate the effort to overturn the 2020 election, issued a final report that made the case that Trump was the main cause of the insurrection. The report said that Trump and his inner circle “engaged in at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation, targeting either State legislators or State or local election administrators, to overturn State election results.” The report also pointed to Trump repeatedly alleging that there was voter fraud without evidence and his lack of action to stop his supporters after they had converged on the Capitol.  The committee recommended using the 14th Amendment to prevent people who engaged in the insurrection from being elected to office.  Legal experts have been mixed about whether Section 3 applies to the presidency because it is not one of the positions explicitly stated in the 14th Amendment.  But the section says it applies “to any office,” which some say includes a candidate for  president. A report by the Congressional Research Service adds that while judgeships are not directly mentioned in Section 3, the bar has historically been applied to them.  Two leading legal scholars, William Baude and Michael Stokes Paulsen, released a 126-page report this year finding that the 14th Amendment does disqualify Trump from office. Other scholars, like Steven Calabresi, founder of the conservative legal group known as the Federalist Society, initially agreed with their research though he later changed his mind. That is because he interprets Section 3 to apply to appointed officials not elected ones, when the text references officers of the United States, according to the New York Times.  In at least 13 other states, including Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin, there are also existing lawsuits attempting to disqualify Trump from the ballot. Some of these cases have already been dismissed by at least one court, according to the legal website Lawfare. The Supreme Court has been asked to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision. The court has not yet decided whether it will take up the case, but they have a limited timeline because Colorado’s primary ballot deadline falls in early January.  According to NBC News, even if the Supreme Court chooses to hear the case, it would likely take time to issue a ruling, meaning that their decision would more likely apply to the general election as opposed to the primaries.  The court could also decide that the lawsuit is moot, or has lost its significance to be resolved, once the Jan. 4 deadline passes.  The Supreme Court has also been asked to intervene over a separate Trump-related case about whether the former president can be prosecuted on charges that he attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

"Affirmative Action Still an Option at West Point, But Supreme Court Likely to Have Final Say",Philip Elliott,Politics;The D.C. Brief,"July 6, 2023 2:43 PM EDT","This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Amid the flurry of dramatic rulings the Supreme Court’s nine justices handed down last month right before ditching D.C. until October, there was an under-appreciated footnote that merits a second reading. In the blockbuster decision that essentially ended the use of race in college admissions, Chief Justice John Roberts gave U.S. military academies a carve-out. Put simply: West Point can keep using affirmative action but Harvard cannot, and students of color worried that the challenges of getting into their preferred school now seem insurmountable might want to consider how they look in uniform. The rationale, co-signed by the Court’s six-strong conservative majority, carries inherent problems, and there is little doubt the ruling will be revisited. In the meantime, it seems as if the court was simply punting with the June 29 ruling on something that clearly is going to define part of its legacy. “No military academy is a party to these cases, however, and none of the courts below addressed the propriety of race-based admissions systems in that context,” Roberts wrote in a note at the bottom of page 30 of 237, tacitly acknowledging and then dismissing arguments that affirmative action helped diversify the military’s leadership. “This opinion also does not address the issue, in light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.” Those “distinct interests”—namely having a leadership corps in the national security space that reflects all parts of the society it is built to defend—may be worth considering under different circumstances, the justices conceded. But as it stands, the court essentially bought for now the argument that issues facing military academies were beyond the scope of cases about Harvard and the University of North Carolina and that increasing diversity in our armed forces may be in the national interest. Implied in that posture is the notion that increasing diversity in other, bigger parts of society is not. Got it? The elite military academies are already some of the most selective institutions in the country and create a pipeline for a generation of national security leadership. Fewer than one-in-five applicants get invited, and the application process is one the toughest out there even before that. While anyone with $85 can apply to Harvard (acceptance rate: 4%), applicants to four of the five academies need to persuade their member of Congress to nominate them for a finite number of slots. That, of course, comes with its own political dynamics, further complicating the screening process for what is essentially the toughest H.R. interview in federal service. For anyone who’s been around Washington for a minute, the ruling didn’t come as a complete surprise. For good or ill, anything linked to the military is seen in some corners of D.C.’s elite class as sacrosanct. Budget cuts at the Pentagon are all but verboten in even fiscal hawks’ dens. Whenever there are talks of across-the-board reductions in spending, everyone trips over themselves to point out that they’re talking about “non-defense spending,” and the good folks in the military-industrial complex shouldn’t lose any sleep. It’s a combination of respect for the troops and fear of the defense lobbyists on K Street who are quite adept at casting any skepticism about military spending as disloyalty. This court’s decidedly conservative tilt was not about to wade into that space at the moment. At the Capitol, the ruling sparked predictable outrage among liberals and giddy gloating from conservatives. Without much real recourse, Democrats bemoaned the double-track that, to channel Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s dissent, values racial diversity in bunkers but not boardrooms. To their dismay, liberals read the ruling as telling the country that diversity matters only when it comes time to send men and women into war zones. And it further tells persons of color that they would do well to practice their marching skills if they want to enjoy any advantage that affirmative action may offer. Across the aisle, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has plans to ban remaining affirmative action programs as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. House Republicans have similar plans to also eliminate the Pentagon’s diversity officer, funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and a review of existing programs in the name of combating perceived “wokeness.” From 30,000 feet above the gorgeous campuses, the student populations at the academies have made strides at better reflecting their neighbors they’ll spend their careers protecting. At the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., the ranks of cadets who identified as a racial or ethnic minority went from 20% in 2000 to 36% in 2021. At the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., that number rose from 19% percent to 37%. There are similar stories in the data from the Air Force and Coast Guard academies. Still, enlisted and commissioned military members remain distinct worlds demographically. The military’s leadership is still overwhelmingly white and male in an institution that, historically, has been an instrument for social change. Roughly 90% of generals and admirals are white, although Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is working on leveling that out.  All of that explains why there’s a good chance the court will find itself dealing with the specific issue of affirmative action at military academies in the future. Military leaders know that having military academies train diverse cohorts of graduates stands to pay dividends for decades. Now, that talent pipeline is back on conservative lawmakers’ agendas—and not necessarily in a good way. Make sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter.

                  Inside Brett Kavanaugh's First Term on the Supreme Court
                ",,,"June 28, 2019 11:46 AM EDT","Who is Brett Kavanaugh? That may seem like an odd question. For a few weeks last September, America and the world learned almost everything about Kavanaugh: his tenure as a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals and as a White House lawyer for President George W. Bush; his privileged education in Maryland and New Haven; most of all, the allegation that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were in high school. Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings left few Americans without an opinion about him. But now that Kavanaugh is on the Court, who he is matters more than ever. The 54-year-old lifetime appointee replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who for decades occupied the swing seat on the bench, casting the decisive vote on legalizing same-sex marriage, protecting corporations’ political spending and affirming an individual right to own guns. Those issues and more may hang on what kind of justice Kavanaugh becomes and how he votes. The process is less predictable than anyone who watched the confirmation battle might suspect. Kavanaugh could veer hard to the right, as Justice Clarence Thomas did after Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment during his confirmation hearings in 1991. He could settle toward the center, as Kennedy did after the contentious nomination battles over Robert Bork in 1987. Or he could become something more complicated than the most fervent agonistes on either side expect. As his first term ends, everyone—from Kavanaugh’s oldest friends to his fiercest detractors, from clerks to court-watchers to his eight new colleagues—is scrutinizing the new justice for signs of where he will take the court. A close look at Kavanaugh’s voting this term reveals that he is more reliably conservative than Kennedy, helping push the court right since his confirmation. He has formed an influential alliance with Chief Justice John Roberts, and, to a lesser extent, Justice Samuel Alito, both Bush-era nominees. But Kavanaugh has also voted with some of the liberal justices as often as he did with the far-right flank during his first term. He sided with justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, for example, the same percentage of the time that he did with President Donald Trump’s other appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, according to data collected by Adam Feldman, a lawyer who writes the Empirical SCOTUS blog. Kavanaugh has already provided the decisive vote in eight 5-4 rulings with a traditional ideological split, including cases related to immigrant detention, the death penalty and sovereign immunity. In one of the most hotly anticipated cases of the term, he and the other conservatives decided that partisan gerrymandering of legislative districts isn’t reviewable by federal courts. And over the coming years, Kavanaugh will wield enormous power as the new, more conservative court takes up pivotal subjects like environmental regulations, guns and religious liberty. The wild card in Kavanaugh’s effect on the court, and America, is his own effort to move past the confirmation hearings. Unlike others who have been accused of past sexual abuse in the #metoo era, he has a lifetime appointment to a position of power from which to try, and already he is using his spot on the court to do so. Rather than always sign on anonymously to his colleagues’ rulings, for example, he has issued multiple concurring opinions, laying out his thinking in ways first term justices don’t often do. For many, nothing he does on or off the court will change the judgment they have already rendered. The confirmation hearings were a torment for Blasey Ford. She says she never wanted to testify, and that her life has been upended by the public airing of the suffering she had carried for years. “Having Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, with allegations of sexual misconduct still very fresh in the public’s mind, strikes millions of Americans as a dagger through the heart,” says Nan Aron, founder of liberal judicial advocacy group Alliance for Justice. Outside the court, Kavanaugh’s friends and colleagues are speaking, on-the-record and on background, in hopes of shaping perception on his behalf. “I don’t know if he’ll ever fully get over the confirmation process,” says one friend. Not even those closest to him know how his work as a justice will be affected. Kavanaugh, who has vociferously denied Blasey Ford’s allegations, hasn’t given an on-the-record interview since the hearings, and declined to do so for this story. Sometime soon, the most charged moral, legal and political issue will land on Kavanaugh’s desk: abortion. And at that point, another reckoning with history will come for him, even if he doesn’t yet know how he will rule. Kavanaugh’s chambers at the Supreme Court are a work in progress. His bookshelves are a jumble of freshly unpacked volumes and trinkets. Seven months after he was sworn in, Kavanaugh still had unframed reproductions of the paintings he planned to borrow from the Smithsonian taped up on his walls: portraits of Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant and former Chief Justice John Marshall. The most prominent decoration, behind Kavanaugh’s desk, is a framed reproduction of a Tom Lea landscape over a quote from the artist about living on “the sunrise side” of the mountain. The original hung in Bush’s Oval Office, when Kavanaugh served as staff secretary. The office reflects Kavanaugh’s unsettled place on the court. During his 12 years as a judge on the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh developed a reputation for being a conservative judge, but not an entirely dogmatic one. His writings and opinions displayed a broad reading of the Second Amendment, skepticism about the power of federal regulatory agencies, and a robust view of executive power. This last attribute may have piqued Trump’s interest when he decided to nominate Kavanaugh in the summer of 2018, in the heat of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Kavanaugh’s first term on the court presents a more complicated picture of the kind of justice Kavanaugh may become. From one perspective, he is developing a new center on the court with the Chief Justice. Kavanaugh voted with Roberts more often than any other justice, sticking with the chief 94% of the time, according to Feldman. These two justices voted with the majority the highest percentage of the time this term, cementing the court’s new conservative middle. Those who know both Kavanaugh and Roberts aren’t surprised by this emerging judicial partnership. Kavanaugh regularly sent law clerks to Roberts, and the two judges are temperamentally, philosophically and stylistically similar, friends and former clerks say. Kavanaugh may be more academic in his jurisprudential approach, while Roberts tends to be more practical— Kavanaugh has said he’s an originalist, while Roberts doesn’t identify as one. But neither is doctrinaire like the late Justice Antonin Scalia was, philosophically adrift like Kennedy or incrementalist like former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. Some on the right see a second possibility, that Kavanaugh’s alignment with Roberts could be a passing phase. Citing Kavanaugh’s testimony following Blasey Ford’s, they hope the confirmation hearings will help drive him further to the right. “Brett Kavanaugh has seen how unforgiving the Left can be,” says Leonard Leo, executive Vice President of the Federalist society and a friend of Kavanaugh’s who advises Trump on judicial nominations. “[He] has experienced, in a way the Chief Justice never really has, that no matter what you try to do to placate or reason with the potential opposition, they will never be satisfied. So Justice Kavanaugh has every incentive to basically do what he wants to do and ignore the Left.” Leo and his allies predict that Kavanaugh will evolve to be more like Alito, who is ideologically to the right of Roberts, less willing to compromise or inclined toward consensus. There is some data to support this conclusion. According to Feldman, Kavanaugh sided with Alito 91% of the time in his first-term. In a fractured decision on the court’s most political case of the term, about whether the Trump Administration can add a citizenship question to the Census, Kavanaugh, Alito and the other conservatives split from Roberts and the liberal wing. Kavanaugh also joined conservatives in some key 5-4 cases in his first term. He found that federal courts can’t strike down electoral districts designed to favor certain political parties. He adopted an expansive interpretation of a mandatory immigration detention statute that will allow the Trump administration to arrest and detain immigrants without bond hearings years after they have completed criminal sentences. He also voted with the conservative bloc in ruling that Alabama could execute a Muslim prisoner without the man’s imam present as requested, and to clear the way for the execution of a Missouri man who claimed lethal injection would cause him terrible pain due to a medical condition. Previously, five justices had delayed this same man’s execution, with Kennedy joining the four liberals. Kavanaugh’s vote suggests his presence may strengthen the court’s conservative bent on capital punishment. But in his first term, Kavanaugh was not simply a strident conservative crusader. He voted with a majority over Thomas and Gorsuch’s dissents to stay the execution of a Buddhist man in Texas who requested his spiritual advisor be present. Squabbling over the decision among the conservative justices burst into public view. Kavanaugh, joined by Roberts, took the rather unusual step of issuing an explanation of his decision. The other three conservatives responded with another statement, written by Alito, accusing Kavanaugh, Roberts and the liberal justices of being “seriously wrong.” Kavanaugh also granted other wins to liberals, including in a 5-4 case where he ruled that consumers could pursue an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for monopolizing the iPhone app market. He even wrote the majority opinion in that case, an assignment handed down by the senior liberal justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “People made all sorts of wild predictions about him,” says Travis Lenkner, who clerked for Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit. “So far, those have not come to pass.” Few suspect that Kavanaugh will take a third route, to the left of Roberts. But his occasional alliance with Breyer and Kagan suggest that he may be more moderate than many expect. What is clear is that the court is still adjusting to its new configuration, with some surprising results. There have been eight traditional 5-4 splits this term, with the five conservatives voting as a bloc. But there were as many 5-4 decisions with all the liberals plus one conservative in the majority this term as there were cases with all the conservatives voting over the liberal wing. “They’re trying to discover a new identity,” says Feldman. Just as observers are scrutinizing the court’s rulings for signs of Kavanaugh’s impact, they are also watching Kavanaugh himself. The inspection began with his arrival at the Supreme Court in October. His eight new colleagues had just watched as his crass jokes from his high-school yearbook were dissected and his drinking history analyzed. The normally staid judge had unleashed an angry, emotional attack on his Democratic critics. The other justices were hardly strangers: Kavanaugh knew them from Washington legal circles, academia, and even those high school years, in the case of Gorsuch, who was a couple of grades behind him at the same school. Whatever they thought of Kavanaugh or his performance at the hearings, the justices knew what his arrival meant for the balance of power on the Court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the first to come by his chambers. By her own account, she wanted to welcome him. “The nine of us are now a family and we’re a family with each of us our own burdens and our own obligations to others, but this is our work family, and it’s just as important as our personal family,” Sotomayor told CNN last November. “She clearly made a point” of being the first to reach out, says one of Kavanaugh’s former clerks. Kagan, whom Kavanaugh knew from his time teaching at Harvard Law School while she was its dean, had him over for dinner. Day to day, Kavanaugh has the most interaction with Kagan, Gorsuch and Roberts, the three other youngest justices, with whom he had the most established relationships before he joined the court. In his chambers, Kavanaugh has maintained the Spartan approach to judging for which he was known on the lower court. He writes fast, chugging six to eight Diet Cokes a day. Clerks know he prefers short bench memos, 10 pages maximum. “He’s an excruciatingly careful writer,” says Sarah Pitlyk, who clerked for Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit. Pitlyk recalls hanging in her office her 100th draft of an opinion, as a kind of trophy. “Everything had to be technically perfect before it was circulated,” she says. Friends are looking for signs of the hearings’ effect on Kavanaugh now that he’s settling in. “He just doesn’t talk about it,” says Maura Kane, a friend who attended a February luncheon he hosted at the Supreme Court for more than 35 of his female friends who had organized themselves to defend him during the hearings. He has been stepping out in public, sometimes going unrecognized in a baseball cap. A Bible on the mantle in his office is tabbed to Matthew 25, which includes the verse, “I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.” But Kavanaugh seems to hope that his emerging record on the court will be his legacy. If any issue is central to that mission, it may be the question of a woman’s right to an abortion, and it is coming to the Supreme Court, perhaps sooner than the justices would like. A flurry of states passed anti-abortion laws in 2019. At least nine have passed bills that would ban abortions early in pregnancy. In May, Alabama passed the most restrictive abortion law in the country, which would criminalize abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest and punish doctors who provide abortions with lengthy prison sentences. Louisiana passed laws requiring abortion-performing doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, which in practice would drastically decrease the amount of providers in the state. The Supreme Court temporarily stayed the Louisiana laws this term, with Roberts joining the four liberal justices; the court may hear the case next term. Kavanaugh dissented, arguing he wouldn’t have blocked the law preemptively in order to see how it affected women’s ability to obtain abortions, and allowing plaintiffs to challenge the law later. Kavanaugh’s thin record on the subject leaves observers reaching for inferences: he is a Catholic conservative, and Trump said he would only nominate “pro-life” judges. During his confirmation hearing Kavanaugh suggested he would approach the issue in a pragmatic way. “I don’t live in a bubble,” he said under questioning. “I live in the real world. I understand the importance of the issue.” But Kavanaugh ruled on abortion only once during his 12 years on the federal bench. In 2017, his court allowed a pregnant immigrant teen in federal custody to obtain an abortion. The teen argued that a federal policy that required approval for the procedure was an unconstitutional burden, and a majority of the court agreed. Kavanaugh dissented—in a way that worried people on both the left and the right. The judge wrote that he was attempting to find a compromise between Supreme Court precedent that prohibits the government from placing an “undue burden” on a woman seeking an abortion while maintaining the government’s interest in protecting “fetal life.” That instinct to find middle ground alarmed conservatives, who thought it suggested Kavanaugh might shy away from a sweeping constitutional ruling on abortion. At the same time, liberals seized on Kavanaugh’s language as coded antiabortion rhetoric. Kavanaugh wrote that his colleagues were creating “a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand,” and promoting “a radical extension of the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence.” Says liberal judicial advocate Aron: “He came across with many platitudes about Roe v. Wade, but then sought to undermine her case.” Even if the Supreme Court ultimately chooses not to overturn Roe, it could chip away at abortion rights in more incremental ways. Kavanaugh’s colleagues even seem to be playing for that possibility, firing warning shots on abortion from both sides of the bench. Kavanaugh and Roberts sided with three liberal justices this term in declining to take up a case about Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. In his dissent, Thomas accused the majority of avoiding a polarizing issue—an echo of the conservative criticism of Kavanaugh’s dissent in the immigrant case. In another abortion case this term, the justices tried to have it both ways, upholding an Indiana law requiring fetal remains to be buried or cremated, but blocking another part of the law that would have prohibited women from obtaining an abortion after a diagnosis of Down syndrome or another disability, or because of the fetus’s gender or race. Thomas once again accused his colleagues of cowardice in his dissent. “Although the court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever,” he wrote. “Having created the constitutional right to an abortion, this Court is duty bound to address its scope.” Breyer offered the opposite warning in another dissent this term, suggesting conservatives on the court are charging towards the issue. “It is far more dangerous to overrule a decision only because five Members of a later Court come to agree with earlier dissenters on a difficult legal question,” Breyer wrote in a case unrelated to abortion but in which the conservative majority overturned precedent. “Today’s decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the Court will overrule next.” Kavanaugh is in the middle of that fight and will play a key role in resolving it when it arrives in full at the Court. His first term suggests he is still uncertain how he will come down on that and the other issues over which he now holds influence. On the coffee table in his chambers, is a book he points out to guests that captures what defenders say is his capacity for empathy but that those who believed Blasey Ford will surely view with bitter irony: his faded sixth-grade copy of Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird. Written in the back of the book is Kavanaugh’s essay assignment from that year: “Give examples of standing in someone else’s shoes.”   Correction, July 12 The original version of this story mischaracterized the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision on partisan gerrymandering. It found that partisan gerrymandering is a political question beyond the reach of federal courts, not that it is constitutional.

"Supreme Court Allows Idaho to Enforce Its Strict Abortion Ban, Even in Medical Emergencies",MARK SHERMAN / AP,Politics;Supreme Court,"January 6, 2024 8:58 AM EST","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, while a legal fight continues. The justices said they would hear arguments in April and put on hold a lower court ruling that had blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies, based on a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration. The Idaho case gives the court its second major abortion dispute since the justices in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to severely restrict or ban abortion. The court also in the coming months is hearing a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration's rules for obtaining mifepristone, one of two medications used in the most common method of abortion in the United States. In the case over hospital emergencies, the Biden administration has argued that hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by federal law to provide emergency care, potentially including abortion, no matter if there's a state law banning abortion. The administration issued guidance about the federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, two weeks after the high court ruling in 2022. The Democratic administration sued Idaho a month later. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Idaho agreed with the administration. But in a separate case in Texas, a judge sided with the state. In a statement Friday night, President Joe Biden objected to the high court's decision and said his administration “will continue to defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law.” Idaho makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion. The administration argues that EMTALA requires health care providers to perform abortions for emergency room patients when needed to treat an emergency medical condition, even if doing so might conflict with a state’s abortion restrictions. Those conditions include severe bleeding, preeclampsia and certain pregnancy-related infections. “For certain medical emergencies, abortion care is the necessary stabilizing treatment,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in an administration filing at the Supreme Court. The state argued that the administration was misusing a law intended to prevent hospitals from dumping patients and imposing “a federal abortion mandate” on states. “EMTALA says nothing about abortion,” Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador told the court in a brief. Just Tuesday, the federal appeals court in New Orleans came to the same conclusion as Labrador. A three-judge panel ruled that the administration cannot use EMTALA to require hospitals in Texas to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy. Two of the three judges are appointees of President Donald Trump, and the other was appointed by another Republican president, George W. Bush. The appeals court affirmed a ruling by U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, also a Trump appointee. Hendrix wrote that adopting the Biden administration's view would force physicians to place the health of the pregnant person over that of the fetus or embryo even though EMTALA “is silent as to abortion.” After Winmill, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, issued his ruling, Idaho lawmakers won an order allowing the law to be fully enforced from an all-Republican, Trump-appointed panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But a larger contingent of 9th Circuit judges threw out the panel’s ruling and had set arguments in the case for late January. The justices' order Friday takes the case away from the appeals court. A decision is expected by early summer. Friday’s development is just one of several legal battles currently making their way through the courts in Idaho. Separately, four women and several physicians have filed a lawsuit asking an Idaho court to clarify the circumstances that qualify patients to legally receive an abortion. That lawsuit was recently granted the greenlight to move forward despite attempts by the Attorney General’s office to dismiss the case. Meanwhile, a federal judge in November temporarily blocked Idaho’s “abortion trafficking” law from being enforced while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality is underway. That law, which Idaho lawmakers passed last year, was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don’t have their parents’ permission.

The Supreme Court’s Confused Ruling on the Trump Ballot Case,Ideas;Aziz Huq,Ideas;Donald Trump,"March 4, 2024 4:50 PM EST","Huq teaches at the University of Chicago Law School The Supreme Court showed it can act with speed by allowing Trump to continue his presidential campaign and punching down states’ ability to disqualify insurrectionist candidates. Indeed, the Court showed it could do so even on hard constitutional questions. Its decision, however, only exacerbates questions about the Court’s reasons for acting—questions that will deepen doubts about the Justices’ even-handedness and freedom from partisan tugs. Doubts are sewn both by the timing and the content of the recent decision on disqualification. The Court added a date to its ordinary calendar just for the purpose of issuing this opinion, plainly heeding Trump’s demands for resolution before Super Tuesday. It also issued a short (for the Justices) unsigned opinion that bespeaks a rapid work-effort. But while it heeded Trump’s demands for speedy resolution on the disqualification question, the Court has repeatedly declined to expedite Special Counsel Jack Smith’s request for prompt resolution of the question whether Trump is immune from criminal prosecution. That question is, in truth, much easier to resolve than the disqualification question (in brief, no). Yet the Court has dragged its heels in ways that enable Trump’s efforts to delay the criminal justice system’s operation—perhaps right up to or beyond the election. We often judge others by how they spend their limited time and money. These decisions about how to allocate scare resources cast direct light on their character. The Justices’ decisions about when to hurry, and when to lollygag, are impossible to understand without attending to the partisan overtones of the cases. Crudely started, it appears that the Court hurries when Trump demands it, and brakes when he says brake.   Substance follows method. When it comes to the substance of this week’s disqualification decision, the unanimity of the bottom line can’t hide an embarrassing series of logical jumps needed to make the issue of disqualification go away for Trump—at least for the time being. To begin with, the unsigned opinion rests upon the idea that only Congress can say how disqualification occurs. Yet, as the Court itself concedes, the text and history of the relevant constitutional language of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment are plainly inconsistent with that notion.  It is settled history that those disqualified by dint of participation in the Confederacy did not have to await exclusion under a federal statute: They were disqualified automatically. If, as a matter of original understanding, Section 3 disqualification was automatic, why is there a need for Congress to set forth a procedure? It’s not that the Justices don’t know the historical facts: The opinion cites approving a 1868 instance of a putative House member from Georgia, who was treated as ineligible by both state and federal officials without a statute coming into play. Worse, what the Court goes on to say about how Congress can act is internally contradictory. On the one hand, the majority suggests that “congressional legislation” is needed for disqualification. On the other hand, the opinion picks out and approvingly discusses two cases in which a single chamber of Congress considered whether to disqualify a potential legislator—without relying on any law being passed. So can a chamber of Congress, acting through its election-related functions rather than by enacting a statute, disqualify Trump? Original understandings and history cited approvingly by the Court suggest it can—but the Court at least hints otherwise. This confusion matters because the Court expressly refuses to say anything about whether Trump did, in fact, trigger disqualification on January 6 or its runup. So the question whether he is a lawful candidate remains undecided. By suggesting that “congressional legislation” is needed to complete his disqualification, however, the Court overrides Section 3’s original understanding—that disqualification is automatic—and leaves the matter in Congress, knowing full well Congress won’t act via a new law. The result is, alas, something of a blueprint for allowing insurrectionists to run for office. Across these arguments, a supposedly “originalist” Court—including the most vehemently purist of Justices when it comes to method—repeatedly plays fast and loose with the originalist evidence and arguments that they elsewhere treat as binding. They instead lean on arguments from consequences that they mock and pillory in other contexts, such as recent Second Amendment caselaw. If there is one immediate casualty from today’s ruling, it may well be the originalist Justices’ reputations for acting in consistent and principled ways.  What then is going on, if the decision is not the result of the Justices’ legal commitments? A separate opinion from Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson decries the majority opinion’s passages on Congress’s role as an effort to “insulate this Court and petitioner [Trump] from future controversy.” This is an incendiary sentence—one that will, once digested, add fuel to the deepening skepticism about the Court’s willingness or ability to stand above the partisan fray.  In effect, the concurring Justices are saying, the Court reached out to decide an issue that was not before the Court—and then it did so in a way that was driven in part by a desire to protect a particular political candidate. Setting aside the fact that this candidate is in court because he tried to derail the lawful counting of 2020 ballots by illegal means, the concurrence is suggesting that the other Justices (all appointed by Republican presidents) are acting to favor the candidate sailing under their partisan flag. Perhaps as troubling, the concurrence suggests that the Court is doing so because it is conflating its interests in dodging “future controversies” with that of the likely Republican candidate. What’s good for Trump, the majority is said to believe, is good for the Court. It is an identification that is possible only if one thinks that the Constitution itself takes a stand in favor of one partisan faction, and an insurrectionist one at that.        When put alongside its speed and timing, the disqualification decision casts only deeper shade on the Court’s supposed ability to stand above the partisan divide—as opposed to digging in on just one side. However one things the disqualification issue ought to have been handled, it is hard to see how anyone but a partisan absolutist can take comfort from this opinion.

How Google’s Big Supreme Court Victory Could Change Software Forever,Madeleine Carlisle,Tech;Google,"April 6, 2021 10:24 AM EDT","The U.S. Supreme Court sided with Google this week in a major decision that some legal experts are hailing as a victory for programmers and consumers. The Court ruled that Google did not violate copyright law when it included parts of Oracle’s Java programming code in its Android operating system—ending a decade-long multibillion dollar legal battle. The Court’s ruling in Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. upheld long standing industry practices that have furthered development of software that’s compatible with other programs, legal experts tell TIME. The ruling means copyright holders for software “can’t maintain a monopoly over critical interface aspects,” argues Jeanne Fromer, a professor of copyright law at New York University School of Law—and those aspects can be used by both users and programmers to more easily switch between products. “This is huge for a vibrant tech industry to continue innovating,” says Fromer. “In fact, that’s what the tech industry has long been built on… if this [practice] had been forbidden, there’s so many things in fundamental aspects of software that we wouldn’t have today.” The Court did not rule on the broader issue of whether the code in question could be copyrighted. Rather, Breyer wrote, “The Court assumes for argument’s sake that the copied lines can be copyrighted,” so it could focus on whether Google acted illegally. While a ruling on the copyright status “would have provided a clearer safe harbor for software developers,” writes Peter Menell, a professor of copyright law at University of California at Berkeley School of Law who filed an amicus brief in support of Google, it still “provides some assurance” for people looking to use a similar approach to develop products. The case stretches back to 2005, when Google included roughly 11,500 lines of code from an Application Programming Interface (API)—a tool that allows applications to more easily communicate by drawing on pre-written instructions—in its mobile Android operating system. The Java API had been developed by Sun Microsystems, which Oracle purchased in 2010. Oracle filed its lawsuit against Google later that year, seeking as much as $9 billion in damages. Google contended that its use of the code was covered by the doctrine of “fair use”—which allows copyrighted material to be used by other parties without permission if it’s within the public’s interest, such as when the use is “transformative” or limited. A federal circuit court ruled in Oracle’s favor in 2018, deciding that Google’s use of the technology was illegal. The Supreme Court overturned that decision on Monday in a 6-2 decision, with Justice Stephen Breyer writing the majority opinion and Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito dissenting. (Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate as she was not yet on the court when the case was argued in October.) In his opinion, Breyer wrote that Google’s use of the Java API, “which included only those lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program,” was protected under fair use. Java was one of the most widely used programming languages at the time, and Google copied the lines to “allow the millions of programmers familiar with the Java programming language to work with its new Android platform,” he continued. The 11,500 lines was only about 0.4% of the total Java code—which comprises around 2.86 million lines in total, he continued. And while Java was originally most used on desktop and laptop computers, Google used the API to make a whole new—and eventually widely popular—mobile operating system, which Breyer argued was “transformative.” In his dissent, Thomas criticized the Court for avoiding what he viewed as the larger question. “The Court wrongly sidesteps the principal question that we were asked to answer: Is declaring code protected by copyright? I would hold that it is,” he wrote. “The majority purports to save for another day the question whether declaring code is copyrightable. The only apparent reason for doing so is because the majority cannot square its fundamentally flawed fair-use analysis with a finding that declaring code is copyrightable. “By copying Oracle’s work, Google decimated Oracle’s market and created a mobile operating system now in over 2.5 billion actively used devices,” Thomas continued. “If these effects on Oracle’s potential market favor Google, something is very wrong with our fair use analysis.” In response to Monday’s ruling, Dorian Daley, the executive vice president and general counsel of Oracle, said in a statement that the “Google platform just got bigger and market power greater—the barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower.” “They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can,” he continued. “This behavior is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google’s business practices.” In its response to the decision, Google called the ruling “a victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science. The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers.” While good news for developers looking to further interoperability of programs, the ruling might also help consumers, Lori Andrews, a professor of law at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, says in an email. Software underpins more and more aspects of society, and allowing fair use access to copyrighted code could potentially “allow challenges to any discriminatory factors built into the code” in the future, she argues. But the ruling doesn’t necessarily mean software developed in a similar manner will always be protected under fair use. “Given the fact-specific nature of fair use, there remains some risk that some efforts to build [interoperable products]—partial or full [interoperability]—could be deemed insufficiently transformative,” Menell warns in an email. Reusing some aspects of APIs is also a “longstanding” practice in the software industry, says Former, who argues it explains “some of the wide success” of the industry because it “makes software more available, and makes it easier for people to switch to better products.” The Supreme Court has now affirmed Google’s use of that practice in the highest court in the land, in a ruling that could help “the software industry to continue to grow and not get stuck in obsolete programs or standards,” she continues. “So the ruling today is a huge victory for computer programmers and users, which is just about everyone these days.”  Write to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com",https://time.com/5952718/google-oracle-supreme-court/
"From Military Coups to Selling Nuclear Secrets, Supreme Court Wrestles With Implications of Granting Trump Immunity",Nik Popli,Politics;Supreme Court,"April 25, 2024 2:17 PM EDT","Can a President order a political rival’s assassination and avoid criminal prosecution? What if he sold nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary or staged a coup? These are some of the hypothetical questions posed during oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Thursday as the Justices wrestled with the practical implications of what could happen if they grant former President Donald Trump immunity from criminal prosecution in special counsel Jack Smith’s election interference case against him. “This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh. During nearly three hours of arguments in Trump v. United States, the Supreme Court Justices raised concerns about the broad implications for future Presidents depending on how they rule in this historic presidential power case, often avoiding discussing the specific allegations against Trump.  ""We're writing a rule for the ages,"" Justice Neil Gorsuch said.  Many of the Justices seemed skeptical of Trump’s lawyer’s argument that a former President has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts related to the presidency. That, they suggested, could violate the bedrock legal principle that no one is above the law, and could turn the Oval Office into “the seat of criminal activity,” as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson called it. She argued in a line of questioning that Presidents would have no incentive to follow the law they are duty bound to uphold if the Supreme Court granted them immunity from criminal prosecution. “I think that we would have a really significant opposite problem if … someone with those kinds of powers, the most powerful person in the world with the greatest amount of authority, could go into office knowing that there would be no potential penalty for committing crime,” Jackson said. Justice Elena Kagan offered hypothetical scenarios in which a President ordered his military to conduct a coup, or sold nuclear secrets to a hostile power abroad. Trump’s lawyer D. John Sauer argued the President couldn’t be held criminally accountable for those actions unless he were to be impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate first. “That sure sounds bad, doesn’t it?” Kagan replied. Yet Justices also worried about the practical effects of the government’s argument that a President isn’t immune from such criminal liability. Justice Samuel Alito noted that a President is in a “peculiarly precarious position” given the high-stakes decisions he has to make and enormous amount of power he wields, and Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch both raised the specter of overzealous prosecutors targeting former Presidents after they leave office. “I’m not concerned about this case, but I am concerned about future uses of the criminal law to target political opponents based on accusations about their motives,” Gorsuch said. He raised a hypothetical scenario in which a President staged a peaceful civil-rights protest outside the Capitol that inadvertently delayed legislative business, and could be held criminally liable for that action. The Justices and Sauer also discussed whether the threat of criminal prosecution might constrain a President’s decision making or ability to govern. At the heart of Trump’s argument before the Supreme Court was that his actions after the 2020 election fell under official conduct that should be protected rather than private actions, which all parties agree do not enjoy criminal immunity. If the Supreme Court does find that there is at least some presidential immunity, the question that follows is where to draw the line between official and private actions—and into which category Trump’s actions in the Smith case fall. In response to questioning from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who seemed wary about granting absolute immunity, Sauer admitted that some of the allegations against Trump in the indictment are indeed “private” acts. Michael Dreeben, arguing on behalf of the government, said even if the Supreme Court finds some presidential immunity, Smith’s case could go forward against Trump with the charges that amount to “private” actions, including his alleged involvement in the fake electors scheme. The high court’s decision—and how quickly it arrives—will help determine whether Trump will go to trial in his Washington, D.C. case before the November election. Chief Justice John Roberts asked a series of questions suggesting he is skeptical of the appeals court decision earlier this year that found Trump did not have immunity. He raised the prospect of returning the case to the appeals court to make a determination of whether some of Trump’s acts are immune from prosecution, which would further delay the trial. “Why shouldn’t we send it back to the court of appeals?” Roberts asked Dreeben. “What concerns me is, as you know, the court of appeals did not get into a focused consideration of what acts we’re talking about or what documents we’re talking about.” The Justices have already come under criticism for their delay in taking up Trump's appeal, waiting until the last day of the term for oral arguments. Some legal experts viewed the delay as a win for Trump, potentially jeopardizing the possibility of a trial before the upcoming election. “The fact that the Court has now taken this case makes it exceedingly unlikely that the former President will be tried for his offenses on January 6 before the election in November 2024,” says J. Michael Luttig, former U.S. Court of Appeals Judge and assistant attorney general under George H.W. Bush. “Of course, the Court can decide cases quickly when it has to. It could hear this case tomorrow and could fairly easily produce an opinion one week later. That is not going to happen. The Court has all but told us and assured us that that will not happen.” The election case in Washington is one of four felony cases Trump is facing while he challenges President Joe Biden for re-election. The Supreme Court’s ruling will almost certainly apply to Trump’s other federal cases in Florida and Georgia, where he also faces the prospect of criminal prosecution should the Justices rule against his immunity bid. (It will not affect his hush-money case in New York, which doesn’t concern official actions Trump made while President.) The immunity case has added more pressure on the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority that includes three Justices Trump appointed. Just last month, the court gave Trump an election-year boost when it ruled that Colorado could not kick him off the ballot. Trump took to social media on Thursday morning to echo arguments from his court brief, claiming that by denying a President immunity he would be subjected to ""extortion"" from political opponents. ""If a President doesn’t have IMMUNITY, he/she will be nothing more than a 'Ceremonial' President, rarely having the courage to do what has to be done for our Country,"" Trump wrote. Trump’s legal team has often cited a 1982 Supreme Court ruling—Nixon v. Fitzgerald—that recognized absolute immunity from civil suits for Presidents. But a federal appeals court had previously rejected Trump’s immunity claim, asserting that as a private citizen, he is not shielded from criminal prosecution like he is during his presidency. Originally, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan had set Trump’s trial in the Smith case to begin on March 4, but Trump’s appeal to the Supreme Court resulted in a delay in the proceedings, paving the way for his New York hush-money case to be the first to reach trial. The federal indictment from Washington, D.C. charges Trump with four counts: conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding, and two other charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, culminating in the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. Prosecutors allege that Trump participated in a plot to submit fake election certificates to Congress, aiming to invalidate Biden’s win. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Supreme Court Rules Against Race-Based Affirmative Action,Olivia B. Waxman;Decades of precedent,Politics;Supreme Court,"June 29, 2023 11:17 AM EDT","The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the race-conscious college admissions processes at Harvard and the University of North Carolina are unconstitutional.  In a 6-3 decision along ideological lines, the justices ruled that the admissions policies that include race as a factor violate the Equal Protection Clause. “Many universities have for too long wrongly concluded that the touchstone of an individual’s identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned, but the color of their skin,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. “This Nation’s constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.” In one case, Harvard University was accused of discriminating against Asian Americans in its admissions process, while in another, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was accused of giving preference to Black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants over white and Asian applicants. Both cases were filed by Students for Fair Admissions led by Edward Blum, a conservative activist who is best known for his efforts to challenge affirmative action policies. “We have permitted race-based admissions only within the confines of narrow restrictions,” Roberts wrote. “University programs must comply with strict scrutiny, they may never use race as a stereotype or negative, and—at some point—they must end. Respondents’ admissions systems—however well intentioned and implemented in good faith—fail each of these criteria.” Read More: How the Supreme Court’s Affirmative Action Decision Affects the AAPI Community The Court determined that using race as a factor in college admissions necessarily—and unconstitutionally—hurt some races and helped others. “College admissions are zero-sum. A benefit provided to some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the former group at the expense of the latter,” Roberts wrote. Americans’ views are divided on race-based affirmative action. A Pew Research Center poll published June 8 found half of American adults disapprove of elite colleges and universities considering an applicant’s race or ethnicity when making admissions decisions. “The devastating impact of this decision cannot be overstated,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissenting opinion. “The majority’s vision of race neutrality will entrench racial segregation in higher education because racial inequality will persist so long as it is ignored.” The Supreme Court said colleges can still consider race obliquely: “Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,” Roberts wrote. The two Black justices on the Supreme Court held opposite views. “With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces ‘colorblindness for all’ by legal fiat,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a dissenting opinion. (She recused herself from the Harvard case because she has served on Harvard’s Board of Overseers.) “But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.” In his concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas slammed her “race-infused world view” and claimed she “locks blacks into a seemingly perpetual inferior caste. Such a view is irrational; it is an insult to individual achievement and cancerous to young minds seeking to push through barriers, rather than consign themselves to permanent victimhood.” Read More: Read Justice Sotomayor and Jackson’s Dissents in the Affirmative Action Case Still, the decision marks a dramatic change in higher education in the U.S. Colleges and universities will have to come up with new ways to recruit diverse student bodies. And it remains to be seen how the decision will affect the economy and society more broadly, if college campuses become less diverse and fewer minority college graduates could enter the job market. The decision marks a departure from about 45 years of precedent for upholding affirmative action. The term dates back to a 1961 executive order from John F. Kennedy to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color or national origin.” His successor President Lyndon B. Johnson expanded this mandate, and over time it began to be associated with education. On June 26, 1978, the Supreme Court handed down the first major affirmative action decision concerning university admissions, involving a 38-year-old white engineer Allan Bakke’s petition to enter a California medical school. The case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, made the cover of the TIME’s July 10, 1978, issue, and in the Letter from the Publisher, Hays Gorey, the main TIME correspondent following the case, argued that the decision left a lot undecided, stating, “Before the Bakke ruling, the question was how America could remedy the effects of past discrimination without indulging in present and future discrimination. And that is still the question.” As TIME described the ruling at the time:  It had been heralded as the most important civil rights case since Brown vs. Board of Education, the 1954 ruling that outlawed racial segregation in the schools and ultimately in all of American life. The nation had moved far in 25 years, but the goal of equality had remained elusive, and the question now before the Supreme Court in the case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke seemed infinitely perplexing: Is it fair to give some preference to blacks over whites in order to remedy the evils of past discrimination? Split almost exactly down the middle, the Supreme Court last week offered a Solomonic compromise. It said that rigid quotas based solely on race were forbidden, but it also said that race might legitimately be an element in judging students for admission to universities. It thus approved the principle of “affirmative action,” the system by which the Government is pressuring U.S. universities, corporations and other institutions to provide more jobs and better pay for millions of blacks, other minorities and women. Despite a flurry of protest demonstrations by militants, most observers praised the court for a cautious but astute effort at reconciling conflicting forces–but they also foresaw many future conflicts in the actual carrying out of the court’s new edict. One of those future conflicts would be Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), when Barbara Grutter, a white woman from Michigan, sued because she was rejected from the University of Michigan. Even former President Gerald Ford, a Michigan alum, wrote an op-ed for the New York Times warning that if the court did not allow Michigan to consider race when putting together its student body, it would be a throwback to an era when “were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin…or national ancestry.” He recalled a story from 1934 when his Black teammate, Willis Ward, benched himself because the visiting Georgia Tech football team wouldn’t play against a Black American. The Supreme Court’s June 23, 2003, decision marked the first time a majority of Supreme Court justices supported considering race as a factor in university admissions. And yet litigation related to affirmative action policies continued over the past 20 years. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court considered a case involving Abigail Fisher, a white woman from Texas, who claimed that she didn’t get into the University of Texas’s flagship Austin campus because she was white. The top 10% of Texas high school seniors are automatically admitted, but the university has considered race in evaluating students, like Fisher, who are not in the top 10% of their class. The Supreme Court sent the case back down to a lower court, but when the case came back on the Court’s docket in 2016, and the majority of the justices 4-3 opposed quotas but maintained that race could be considered as one of many admissions factors.  In the last decade, how Asian Americans are evaluated in university admissions has become a new focus of the affirmative action debate. Michael Wang became one of the most prominent of these activists after he argued he was rejected from several Ivy League and elite universities in 2013 because of his race and filed a complaint with the Department of Education against three schools that rejected him–Princeton, Yale and Stanford–which raised awareness of how Asian applicants are treated by admissions officers. Though he enrolled at Williams College—which, historically, has been ranked the #1 small liberal arts college in the nation by U.S. News & World Report—he continued to speak out on affirmative action issues, telling TIME in 2018, “I believe affirmative action in principle is absolutely okay and needed. But in practice, it is flawed and definitely needs some kind of changes to fit the modern-day age.”  But Wang expressed regret about the state of the affirmative action debate in an Oct. 10, 2022, PBS Retro Report segment, admitting, “I think I may have set in motion things that might have been out of control. Affirmative action might just get completely tossed and I don’t fully agree with that.” Write to Olivia B.

The Supreme Court Overturned a Ruling That Enabled Internment of Japanese-Americans During World War II,Abby Vesoulis;Abigail Simon,Politics;Supreme Court,"June 26, 2018 12:05 PM EDT","In Tuesday’s majority opinion upholding President Donald Trump’s travel ban, the Supreme Court also overturned a long-criticized decision that had upheld the constitutionality of Japanese-American internment during World War II. Justice Sonia Sotomayor had mentioned the 1944 case, Korematsu v. United States, in her dissent, arguing that the rationale behind the majority decision had “stark parallels” to Korematsu; in both cases, she argued, the government “invoked an ill-defined natiounal security threat to justify an exclusionary policy of sweeping proportion.” Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the case was not relevant to the travel ban, but went ahead and wrote that it is now overturned. “The dissent’s reference to Korematsu … affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and — to be clear — ‘has no place in law under the Constitution,'” he wrote. Korematsu arose out of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1942 executive order mandating that Japanese Americans leave their homes and jobs for internment camps. Over 117,000 Japanese were ultimately removed from their homes. Civil rights activist Fred Korematsu, who died in 2005, challenged his interment, but the Supreme Court ruled that his detention was a military necessity. Parallels between Japanese interment and the Muslim ban had been highlighted before Tuesday’s ruling. Fred Korematsu’s daughter Karen, who now runs a civil liberties institute in his name, had filed a friend of the court briefing against the travel ban, and argued in a Washington Post op-ed last December that the policy “just as unfair” as Japanese internment. “Korematsu is a reminder that while we may sometimes be afraid during times of crisis, fear should not prevail over our fundamental freedoms.,” she wrote at the time. Both liberal and conservative justices have criticized the Korematsu decision in the past, but it was never formally overturned. In 1995, liberal Justice Ginsburg wrote in a dissent that “a Korematsu-type classification … will never again survive scrutiny,” conservative Justice Antonin Scalia said in a speech that it was wrong but warned that it could happen again. “In times of war, the laws fall silent,” he said. In the majority opinion Tuesday, Roberts quoted from Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson’s famous dissent in Korematsu. Jackson, who later served as a chief prosecutor for the U.S. in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, argued that the majority decision upholding internment would set a bad precedent. He noted that a military order would eventually lapse, but a judicial opinion would validate racial discrimination by creating new principles to justify it. “The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need,” he wrote. After a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., during the 2016 campaign, Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, comparing it to Roosevelt’s executive order authorizing internment. In a later interview with TIME, he would not unequivocally repudiate the internment camps. “I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer,” he said. Recently, Trump Administration attorneys favorably invoked Hirabayashi v. United States in a legal briefing on a case involving Guantanamo Bay detainees, a World War II-era decision which was a basis for Korematsu.

Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Employment Discrimination Against Transgender Workers,Tara Law,Politics;Department of Justice,"August 17, 2019 5:07 PM EDT","The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court to set a legal precedent that would enable employers to fire employees because they are transgender. The Department of Justice has submitted a brief to the Court Friday asking the Justices to rule that Title VII, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, does not protect transgender people. The department argued that they should throw out a lower court ruling that found that a funeral home that fired a transgender woman had discriminated against her. The brief concerns R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one of three cases that the Supreme Court agreed to hear earlier this year that concern whether Title VII can be applied to LGBTQ workers. In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found that the owner of the funeral home, Thomas Rost, had violated the law when he fired Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who worked for the company from 2007 to 2013. According to court documents, Stephens sent the company a letter in 2013 that said she struggled with a “gender identity disorder” and planned to begin to live as a woman, including by wearing the company’s female uniform – a jacket and skirt – instead of a suit and tie. The company argued that Stephens was fired because she refused to wear the company’s dress code and argued that “[m]aintaining a professional dress code that is not distracting to grieving families is an essential industry requirement that furthers their healing process.” In its brief, the Department of Justice has argued in favor of the funeral home, arguing that Title VII only protects what it defines as “biological sex.” “In 1964 [when Title VII was enacted], the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the DOJ writes, clarifying, “In the particular context of Title VII—legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities—it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of “sex” referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.” Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Stephens, told HuffPo that the case could weaken Title VII protections both for transgender people and other groups. “People don’t realize that the stakes are extending not just the trans and LGB communities, but every person who departs from sex stereotypes: Women who want to wear pants in the workplace, men who want more childbearing responsibilities,” Strangio said.

Supreme Court Signals It’s Ready to Limit Abortion at Historic Arguments,Abigail Abrams;A long time coming;A political case;More from TIME;The viability question,Politics,"December 1, 2021 3:48 PM EST","The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed ready to uphold a Mississippi law that bars abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a move that would significantly curtail the right to abortion in the United States.  The law in question directly contradicts what has been the central holding of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion and said that states cannot ban the procedure before fetal viability, which occurs around 24 weeks of pregnancy. After nearly two hours of often heated oral arguments, the Supreme Court’s six conservative justices appeared willing to undermine that nearly 50-year-old precedent, but they seemed divided on whether the court should weaken the viability standard or overturn Roe entirely. The three liberal justices vigorously defended Roe and questioned Mississippi’s arguments for doing away with the precedent. Chief Justice John Roberts, typically the most moderate of the conservative majority, seemed to push for a middle ground that would allow states to prohibit abortions before viability but not get rid of the Court’s precedent altogether. He asserted that Mississippi’s law does not represent a “dramatic departure” from viability. “Why is 15 weeks not enough time?” Roberts asked during the arguments.  Some of the other conservative justices suggested they may want to go further. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett expressed clear skepticism of Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the right to abortion and prohibited laws that pose an “undue burden” on people seeking abortions.  Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued the Supreme Court should return the issue of abortion to the states, which would mean overruling Roe. “The Constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice,” he said, adding that the Court should “return to a position of neutrality.” Read More: Inside Mississippi’s Last Abortion Clinic—And the Biggest Fight for Abortion Rights in a Generation Julie Rikelman, the lawyer arguing on behalf of the Mississippi abortion clinic challenging the state’s law, responded that overturning Roe would not be a neutral act. The Constitution protects liberty, she said, but if women cannot make decisions about their own pregnancies, “then they will never have equal status under the Constitution.” The case is the result of a decades-long effort by advocates and legislators who oppose abortion. Republican-led states have passed waves of laws restricting the procedure and aimed at testing Roe in recent years. Overturning the landmark ruling would eliminate abortion access in large swaths of the country, particularly in the South and Midwest. Nearly half of states would act quickly to ban abortion completely, forcing people to travel across state or national boundaries to access abortions, go around the law, or carry unwanted pregnancies to term. Abortion rights activists were bracing for this moment. The fact that the Court agreed earlier this year to consider the Mississippi case at all signaled that a majority of the justices were ready to revisit Roe. When Mississippi passed its law in 2018, the state’s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Organization, immediately filed suit challenging the law. A federal district court and the conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled the law was unconstitutional. Mississippi then appealed the case to the Supreme Court, and after months of deliberation, the justices agreed to take the case focused on the question of whether all bans on abortion before viability should be unconstitutional. However, Mississippi then asked the Court to go further, urging the justices to completely overturn Roe v. Wade. Mississippi’s case is just one of the abortion-related disputes the Supreme Court has heard this term. On Nov. 1, it heard arguments over a Texas law that bans almost all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and has not yet ruled on that. The decision in the Mississippi case is expected to come by the end of June, just months before the midterm elections. Read More: The Supreme Court Will Consider the Texas Abortion Law. Their Decision Could Change the Court—and the Country While the justices did not specifically mention the electoral implications of the Mississippi case on Wednesday, several asked whether overturning a long-held precedent like Roe would make the Court be seen as a political actor. “Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?” asked liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor during arguments. “If people actually believe that it’s all political, how will we survive? How will the courts survive?” Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, quoting from Casey, made a similar point. “To overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the court’s legitimacy beyond any serious question,” he read. Another liberal justice, Elena Kagan, also argued that the Court should be careful about overturning precedent in order to prevent “people from thinking that the court will go back and forth depending on changes to the courts membership.” Read more: The Fate of Roe v. Wade May Rest on This Woman’s Shoulders The Court has grown more conservative over the last few years as former President Donald Trump nominated three justices, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Despite this new 6-3 conservative majority, many legal scholars predicted before Wednesday that the conservative justices would likely want to avoid being seen as overly partisan. Four of the court’s justices have publicly expressed concerns about that this year. Public approval of the Court reached a historic low this fall.  The justices have also dealt with high profile cases before important elections in the past. In 2012, Roberts voted to uphold the Affordable Care Act shortly before that year’s presidential election.  Lawrence Baum, a political science professor at the Ohio State University who studies federal judicial decision making, said that the justices would likely be aware of how a ruling that avoids firing up Democratic voters on the issue of abortion could help Republicans in the midterms next year. “They might want to find some way to finesse things so there wouldn’t be headlines about the Court overturning Roe,” he said before Wednesday’s arguments.  Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart argued that it is Roe and Casey that have damaged the Court and the country. “Roe vs. Wade and Planned Parenthood vs. Casey haunt our country,” Stewart said in his opening argument. “They poison the law. They’ve choked off compromise. For 50 years they’ve kept this court at the center of a political battle that it can never resolve and 50 years on, they stand alone. Nowhere else does this court recognize a right to end a human life.” Much of the arguments focused on the viability standard established by Roe.  If Mississippi’s law prohibiting abortion is allowed to stand, that would move the line at which abortion limits are constitutional away from the current state of focusing on viability, around 24 weeks.  “The right of a woman to choose, the right to control her own body, has been clearly set since Casey, and never challenged. You want us to reject that line of viability and adopt something different,” Sotomayor said to Stewart during the arguments.  Both sides in this case argued there is no middle ground on the issue of abortion, but Stewart said if the Court does not go all the way in overruling its precedent, it could offer a “clarified version” of the “undue burden” standard established in Casey that would allow laws like Mississippi’s to stand. Abortion rights advocates have said that any decision upholding Mississippi’s law will effectively eliminate the right to abortion.  Rikelman, the lawyer for the Mississippi clinic, and U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who also argued in support of the clinic, noted that allowing Mississippi’s 15-week law would open the floodgates to other laws further limiting abortion. Mississippi has also previously passed a six-week abortion ban, and many other states have laws that are currently blocked or making their way through the courts that could be revisited depending on the outcome of this case.  “For a half century, this Court has correctly recognized that the Constitution protects a woman’s fundamental right to decide whether to end a pregnancy before viability,” Prelogar said. “That guarantee that the state cannot force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, has engendered substantial individual and societal reliance. The real-world effects of overruling Roe and Casey would be severe and swift.” Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6124416/supreme-court-abortion-oral-arguments-mississippi/
Not Just Another Conservative Vote: How Amy Coney Barrett Could Influence the Supreme Court,Tessa Berenson Rogers,Politics,"October 27, 2020 11:49 AM EDT","To hear Judge Amy Coney Barrett tell it, she is the intellectual heir to the late Justice Antonin Scalia. “His judicial philosophy is mine, too,” Barrett said at her nomination ceremony at the White House Rose Garden on Sept. 26. In important ways, that is true. Like Scalia, Barrett practices originalism, which interprets the Constitution according to what adherents claim is the framers’ intent, and textualism, which interprets laws based on the meaning of the words rather than the intentions of the legislators. But there is a crucial difference between the two: style. Scalia could be testy and brutal in his opinions, castigating ideological opponents in an attempt to dominate the argument. Barrett, by contrast, has built a reputation of being more diplomatic. Her friends and former students, clerks and colleagues describe a woman confident in her own legal analysis, willing to engage and debate on even the smallest details of cases, but unfailingly polite. Of the current justices “she’d be most like Scalia,” in judicial philosophy, says her mentor, DC Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Laurence Silberman. But, he says, “Her rhetoric would be much less combustible.” That, say supporters and detractors alike, may make Barrett a more powerful advocate of Scalia’s legacy on an already conservative court. Whereas Scalia famously shared a friendship with the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom Barrett has replaced, his irascible demeanor sometimes alienated even his fellow conservatives. Barrett’s collegiality, in contrast, may turn out to be more efficacious, helping her to both unite the six justices on the right and shape the language of the majority ruling. After being confirmed by the Senate on a near party-line vote on Oct. 26, Barrett joins a solid conservative majority— potentially creating the most conservative court since the mid-1900s. Her philosophy places her further to the right than Chief Justice John Roberts, who had become the ideological middle of the bench. She could bring the less rigid conservatives along with her, but doing so may require a more deft touch than Scalia’s. Julie Gunnigle, a liberal prosecutor and one of the judge’s former students, says that Barrett’s combination of ideology and courtesy makes her “more effective, more dangerous,” positioning her to influence not just votes but also the language of opinions that become the law of the land. Barrett’s days often begin at the crack of dawn, perhaps a necessity for a mother of seven children with a demanding career. Two of Barrett’s and her husband Jesse’s children are adopted from Haiti and the youngest has Down syndrome. With a lot to juggle at home, the Barretts take turns going to work out in the morning at a high intensity, CrossFit-style gym they both favor, and Amy takes the early shift, with classes sometimes starting in the 5AM hour, friends who go to the same gym say. “Our children are my greatest joy, even though they deprive me of any reasonable amount of sleep,” Barrett said after her nomination. Friends say the Barretts are active in their community and Amy is an involved parent, and the Barretts’ house often has a motley assortment of kids coming around to play. At the White House, Barrett described herself as both a judge and a “room parent, carpool driver, and birthday party planner.” Barrett herself was the eldest of seven kids, and she grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana where the seeds of her interest in law and her religious beliefs were planted early: her father is an attorney and a deacon. Now, Barrett has brought some New Orleans flavor to South Bend: she is known for her annual Mardi Gras parties and Creole cooking. And she and Jesse, a lawyer in private practice, are a regular presence at Notre Dame football tailgates. Barrett was a passionate teacher during her career as a professor at Notre Dame Law School. Barrett’s former student Laura Wolk remembers one year, she was advancing an argument for textualism in Barrett’s statutory interpretation class. Barrett pushed back, poking holes in Wolk’s defense of the theory despite her own belief in textualism. “She’s very tough,” says Wolk. Barrett’s former colleague at Notre Dame and friend Jeffrey Pojanowski puts it more bluntly: “She doesn’t like bad arguments.” Former clerks say the same holds true at the court. Pardis Gheibi, who clerked for Barrett from 2019-2020, says Barrett would spend “hours, and hours, and hours” dissecting “legal arguments and legal questions that would bore even lawyers to death.” Barrett’s path to a Supreme Court nomination began nearly four years ago. During the 2016 transition period, a team including Trump’s first White House counsel Don McGahn and former executive vice president of the Federalist Society Leonard Leo drafted a list of lawyers to nominate for appellate judicial vacancies. According to a source familiar with the process, McGahn knew of Barrett from his connections to Notre Dame, and Leo was familiar with her because of her clerkships for Silberman and Scalia, a celebrated combination for budding conservative lawyers. They added Barrett to their list, and she was nominated to the Seventh Circuit the following year. That, according to the source, is when she attracted the president’s attention. Trump noticed her during the contentious Seventh Circuit hearing, when in questioning Barrett about how her Catholic faith would affect her decisions, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said, “The dogma lives loudly within you.” The moment went viral and made Barrett a household name for Fox News viewers. Trump added her to the Supreme Court shortlist later that year, in the fall of 2017. After Barrett’s confirmation to the Seventh Circuit, the New York Times reported that she and her husband are members of People of Praise, an ecumenical faith community. According to the Times, the group requires a lifelong oath of loyalty and teaches that women are submissive to men. Neither Barrett nor People of Praise have confirmed her membership. “If they’re part of a movement that subjugates women, they’re really bad members of it,” says O. Carter Snead, law professor at Notre Dame and a friend of the Barretts. “If anyone is subjugated in that marriage, it’s Jesse.” In her three years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Barrett was known for being a staunch conservative and courteous colleague. She grappled with several hot-button political issues, and her opinions gave Republicans much to applaud. She demonstrated a willingness to curtail the rights held in the landmark decision Roe v. Wade. She championed a muscular reading of the Second Amendment, voted to uphold the Trump Administration’s “public charge” rule—which makes it more difficult for immigrants seeking green cards if they rely on public benefits—and wrote an influential decision that paved the way for students accused of sexual assault to sue their schools over the handling of their cases. In writings before she took the bench, she criticized the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. The Court will once again consider the constitutionality of the Obama-era law just one week after the election, now with Barrett on the bench. Barrett quickly became the woman to beat for Ginsburg’s seat after Ginsburg’s death on September 18. Barrett was backed internally by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, three sources familiar with the process say, and by Vice President Mike Pence, two of the sources add. On the questionnaire Barrett submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, she wrote that Trump offered her the nomination when they met on Monday September 21. That was just three days after Ginsburg died and almost a week before he announced the choice publicly, indicating he never seriously considered any other candidate. How effectively Barrett advances a conservative ideology from a seat formerly occupied by the liberal icon Ginsburg could depend on how she deploys the charm and intellect that has earned plaudits throughout her career. Barrett’s “combination of smart and nice will be scary for liberals,” Noah Feldman, a liberal Harvard Law School professor who clerked at the Supreme Court the same year as Barrett and supports her nomination, wrote in Bloomberg Opinion. Feldman noted that Scalia “managed over the years to alienate Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, which may conceivably have helped produce more liberal outcomes as she moved to the left.” That’s where demeanor and diplomacy come in. Justices discuss cases and assign opinions in a delicate back and forth. “There’s no question that when you like someone on the high court, and someone is affable and easy to approach, you’re more likely to have ongoing conversations with them about cases,” says a source familiar with Barrett’s nomination process. “[Barrett’s] personality will create approachability.” Those who know Barrett say her natural interpersonal skills could help wrangle conservatives like Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh or Neil Gorsuch and reconstitute a powerful conservative bloc at the heart of the court. And Barrett’s confirmation marks an essential change in the dynamic of the court. Under the previous 5-4 conservative majority, the swing vote on the right amassed enormous power, which Roberts wielded after Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018. After Barrett’s confirmation, conservatives could lose a vote and still win a majority decision. That’s a major blow to Roberts’ influence and to the liberal bloc’s chances for success. Roberts had “a huge amount of leverage,” says Michael A. Bailey, professor at Georgetown University, and the liberal justices had been able to gain wins by peeling off just one conservative. “That’s really out the window now because you [would] need two people to be liberal, and the odds of that obviously are much lower.” By pulling the center of the court to the right, Barrett’s confirmation ensures that the drama in most decisions will be in how the six conservatives craft the ruling. “It’s the liberals in exile,” says Melissa Murray, professor at New York University School of Law. “The real action is going to be in how the extreme positions and both sides of the conservative wing are going to work together.” That potentially marks a concentration of power in Barrett, with her unique blend of philosophy and tact. Ideologically, “Barrett would be on that far right wing of the court with [Clarence] Thomas and [Samuel] Alito, but she’s likely not temperamentally an extreme in the way the two of them are,” says Murray. “She might be able to work the middle, where the other conservatives are, even though her position is not necessarily of moderate conservatism.” The Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony at which Barrett was nominated by Trump turned out to be a super-spreader event for COVID-19, throwing an already unsettled election season into greater doubt. (Despite multiple attendees coming down with the virus after the Sept. 26 ceremony, Trump once again hosted an event on the White House lawn for Barrett after her confirmation one month later.) Barrett was confirmed by a 52 to 48 vote, with the support of every Republican senator except for Susan Collins of Maine, and without the support of a single Democrat. The highly partisan process was accelerated before Election Day despite the virus’ march through the halls of Congress and the West Wing— at least two Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee tested positive for COVID-19, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, both of whom attended the Rose Garden event. Democrats called to slow down, arguing that pandemic safety precautions and sick senators necessitated a longer process, to no avail. Both sides understand the stakes of the moment. Furious over what they perceive as Republicans’ hypocrisy in refusing to hold hearings for Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 but then pushing Barrett through on an even faster timeline, Democrats are threatening court packing— adding more justices to the Supreme Court— in retaliation. Both moves are broadly unpopular. A majority of Americans wanted the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election to choose Ginsburg’s replacement, according to multiple polls, and more Americans oppose expanding the court than support it. In this fraught context, Trump is calling on the Supreme Court to adjudicate election-related questions, claiming without evidence the election will be a “fraud.” Cases are already winding their way up to the Supreme Court over changes to state election rules. In a national election with widespread mail-in voting, a potentially prolonged vote count and an incumbent already casting doubt on the results, it’s not hard to imagine scenarios in which the Supreme Court might have to settle contested results in critical states. That’s a situation the justices and the American public surely dread. But it might be one the nation soon faces. With her confirmation just eight days before the election, Barrett will experience an extraordinary introduction to the Supreme Court. She could hold the power to affect the outcome of an acrimonious presidential election, women’s reproductive rights, health care coverage, climate change, and issues that affect millions of Americans. And that would be just the start. Whatever her effect on other Justices, Barrett’s influence could be felt for a generation. If the 48-year-old judge serves until she’s Ginsburg’s age, she’ll be on the court until 2059.   Write to Tessa Berenson Rogers at tessa.Rogers@time.com",https://time.com/5898043/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court/
Supreme Court Will Hear Challenge to Idaho’s Near-Total Abortion Ban,Nik Popli,Politics;Supreme Court,"April 23, 2024 7:00 AM EDT","The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a case on whether Idaho can enforce its near-total abortion ban in medical emergency situations under a federal law that requires most hospitals to treat patients with life-threatening conditions. The case marks the second abortion-related challenge to come before the Justices this term, following the Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in a 2022 ruling that left abortion policy to the states. Legal experts anticipate that the Court's ruling in the Idaho case, called Moyle v. U.S., could establish a significant precedent regarding whether emergency medical care can be denied to a pregnant woman in distress in order to save the fetus. At the heart of the case lies the clash between Idaho’s stringent abortion restrictions and the  federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates hospitals to stabilize patients facing life-threatening conditions regardless of their ability to pay. Idaho contends that EMTALA's language requires equal treatment for both the pregnant patient and the ""unborn child,"" arguing that its near-total abortion ban does not conflict with federal legislation. The Justices must decide whether they believe Idaho’s law conflicts with the federal EMTALA law. If they do, then the fundamental legal question they will have to consider is whether federal law supersedes state law when the two are in conflict, says Jill Habig, a former legal adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris in the California Attorney General’s office who now runs the Public Rights Project. While courts have consistently ruled in favor of federal law under the Supremacy Clause, the Idaho case attempts to challenge this bedrock principle. “What we've learned post-Dobbs, and especially with this right-wing court, is that things that should be simple legally are not actually simple in practice,” Habig says.  The legal battle in Idaho is part of a broader wave of challenges following the 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, when a so-called “trigger” law automatically came into effect in Idaho prohibiting all abortions except in cases where it is deemed necessary to prevent the mother's death. In legal filings, Idaho has noted that the term ""abortion"" is absent from the EMTALA statute enacted by Congress in 1986, arguing that abortion care was not intended as one of the required stabilizing treatments under the law. The statute does, however, include the phrase ""unborn child,"" which the state contends necessitates consideration of the fetus's well-being when addressing medical emergencies. Read More: How Kate Cox Became a Reluctant Face of the Abortion-Rights Movement “Idaho law is perfectly consistent with EMTALA, which provides explicit protections for ‘unborn children’ in four separate places,” the state’s Republican Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement. “The notion that EMTALA requires doctors to perform abortions is absurd.”  Lawyers for Idaho contend that the federal law only requires doctors to administer stabilizing treatments that are ""available"" at a particular hospital, and since abortion is largely prohibited under state law, it is effectively unavailable.  The Biden Administration sued Idaho over its abortion ban in 2022, resulting in a temporary injunction preventing its enforcement in emergency care situations, but the case has raised questions about the ongoing struggle between federal and state authority in shaping reproductive healthcare policy. Should the court side with Idaho's interpretation, it would mark the first instance of a federal statute granting individual rights to a fetus and could pave the way for other Republican-led states to enact similar bans even in emergency situations. Fourteen states have already banned abortion since the fall of Roe v. Wade, and while each of these bans include some kind of exception for the mother’s life, patients, doctors, and lawyers have run into challenges interpreting the statutes’ language. Many states permit abortions in a “medical emergency” but do not offer a concrete definition of that term, says Molly Duane, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights. As a result, some women seeking abortions have been turned away from hospitals in life-threatening situations.  “What we know from the real experiences of patients and medical providers is that doctors are terrified to rely on these exceptions when years of prison time and loss of their medical license are on the line,” Duane says, adding that Idaho’s abortion law could enable state officials to challenge doctors on whether their patient is close enough to death to receive an abortion. Read More: What Blocking Emergency Abortion Care in Idaho Means for Doctors Like Me Several Idaho-based medical providers wrote in amicus briefs that the state’s abortion law does not match up with common medical judgment, forcing doctors to violate their oath and delay medical care until their patient’s condition deteriorates to the point that an abortion is necessary to save their lives. Some OB-GYNs have decided to leave Idaho over fear of being prosecuted for treating patients, according to the briefs. “There is no practice of OB-GYN in which abortion as a health saving life-saving measure can be taken out,” says Dr. Caitlin Gustafson, a family medicine obstetrician in Idaho and co-president of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare.  The outcome of the Supreme Court’s latest abortion-related case is poised to send a signal to states regarding their autonomy in shaping abortion policy. A ruling in favor of Idaho, legal experts say, could enable other states to pass strict abortion bans with fewer exceptions.  “We've seen across the country a race from anti-abortion states to pass more and more extreme bans,” Habig says, “and I think we can expect other states to follow Idaho's lead if the Supreme Court allows Idaho to trump federal law and women's health.” Write to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com",https://time.com/6969108/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban-case/
The Supreme Court Doesn’t Need 9 Justices. It Needs 27,Ideas;Jacob Hale Russell,Ideas;Supreme Court,"July 16, 2018 8:17 AM EDT","Justice Kennedy’s retirement has prompted a chorus of cries by Democrats to resuscitate a seemingly unlikely idea: “packing” the Supreme Court. For would-be packers, expanding the court from nine to 11 justices, if and when the Democrats take back executive and legislative power, provides the only opportunity to regain a liberal majority on the court. A packing approach, in proponents’ view, is justified by the need to “fight dirty” in exigent times. The equally vociferous refrain of anti-packers worries about protecting the integrity of court: It’s not worth compromising the institution, they say, for a temporary policy result. The battle over court packing is being fought on the wrong terms. Americans of all political stripes should want to see the court expanded, but not to get judicial results more favorable to one party. Instead, we need a bigger court because the current institutional design is badly broken. The right approach isn’t a revival of FDR’s court packing plan, which would have increased the court to 15, or current plans, which call for 11. Instead, the right size is much, much bigger. Three times its current size, or 27, is a good place to start, but it’s quite possible the optimal size is even higher. This needn’t be done as a partisan gambit to stack more liberals on the court. Indeed, the only sensible way to make this change would be to have it phase in gradually, perhaps adding two justices every other year, to prevent any one president and Senate from gaining an unwarranted advantage. Such a proposal isn’t unconstitutional, nor even that radical. There’s nothing sacred about the number nine, which isn’t found in the constitution and instead comes from an 1869 act of congress. Congress can pass a law changing the court’s size at any time. That contrasts it with other potentially meritorious reform ideas, like term limits, which would require amending the constitution and thus are unlikely to succeed. And countries, with much smaller populations, have much larger high courts. In 1869, when the number nine was chosen, the U.S. was roughly a tenth of its current size, laws and government institutions were far smaller and less complex, and the volume of cases was vastly lower. Supreme Court enlargement only seems radical because we have lost touch with the fundamentals of our living, breathing constitution. The flawed debate over court-packing is an opportunity to reexamine our idea of what a Supreme Court is, and some foundational, and wrong, assumptions. The court’s current design is troubling. Proof is found in a commonplace observation at every mid-term and presidential election, when it is said that the most critical outcome of the election will be the one or handful of justices appointed to the Supreme Court by the President. The refrain has become so common that we have become blind to its frightening implications. How could it be that the most important decision a President makes is picking one non-elected lawyer, distinguished at this point mainly by their ability to avoid ever saying anything controversial, to a court that decides cases at an average rate of one or two a week? Our framers’ conception of constitutional interpretation was far more complicated, messy, and democratic. Constitutional interpretation was seen as fundamentally in the hands of the people, not of courts, much less of nine unelected justices, as Larry Kramer and others have cogently demonstrated. Judicial supremacy, the idea that the court is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, took off later, arguably not gaining wide acceptance until the past half-century. In that transition, we the people abdicated our constitutional role—creating and interpreting fundamental rights as part of an ongoing process—to a non-transparent, non-democratic, non-representative body of nine. That is dangerous: we are taught, from our earliest civics courses, to revere the court as higher, more “supreme,” and less subject to the whims of politics—despite the increasingly close splits and increasingly frequent reversals of precedent, the political maelstrom surrounding each nomination, and the fact that it is just one of several co-equal branches of government. We have been lulled into believing that the Supreme Court possesses oracular powers to divine the Constitution’s meaning in a way the rest of us can’t. Recent years’ decisions, and the frequency of 5-4 splits, have made it difficult to disagree with the fact that the Supreme Court is a fundamentally political, partisan body. How we got to that point is contestable. Liberals might date true partisanship—when the court went from being liberals and conservatives to being Democrats and Republicans—to Bush vs. Gore. Conservatives might say liberals themselves opened the floodgates to politicization with the Warren court’s expansive decisions on rights. Legal theorists might suggest this is simply part of the fundamental nature of law. As first-year law students learn, “easy cases” are rare and laws are never unambiguous. There is no unanimously agreed upon mode of interpretation. And even if we agreed on a mode of interpretation—even if, for instance, originalism was universally adopted as a means of constitutional interpretation—what the constitution “originally meant” is almost always up for reasonable debate. A much larger court would make the Supreme Court more comparably sized to our federal circuit courts, as law professor Jonathan Turley observed in a his 2012 call for a 19-person court. Those regional circuit courts are composed of anywhere from 6 to 29 judges. Not all judges sit on all cases heard by the circuits, as most cases are decided by smaller panels of three. In a small number of cases, the entire circuit sits to review a previously convened panel’s decision. The larger size of the circuits, then, yields two advantages. First, it reduces the influence of a single, swing voter like Kennedy or, before him, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. Second, there is variance in the panels, which are randomly drawn. Even on a supposedly liberal circuit, like the west coast’s 9th Circuit, cases are sometimes heard and decided by panels composed of three conservatives. The system promotes variety and prevents excessive entrenchment of, say, a 5-4 majority. This is counterbalanced by the fact that the full circuit can choose to review the decision, providing consistency. A modified version of this approach could be adopted for an an enlarged Supreme Court. There are further benefits to a much larger Supreme Court. A larger court could hear more cases, which could help break up the cabal that currently controls the court’s docket. One of the most terrifying aspects of current Supreme Court practice is the politicking to get particular cases before it, which benefits a small cadre of insiders who are usually the system’s most staunch defenders. Unlike circuit courts, the Supreme Court picks and chooses which appeals it wants to hear. Currently it grants hearings for only about 80 out of 8,000 cases filed each term, making it five times harder to get your case in front of the court than to get into the nation’s most competitive colleges. That’s, put plainly, absurd. Because the court issues so few opinions, its few pronouncements have outsize influence. What’s especially disturbing is how the 80 cases are chosen. An increasingly small number of lawyers, who are usually past Supreme Court clerks themselves and who know what the court will look for in a petition for hearing, are responsible for most of the arguments before the court. A 2014 Reuters investigation found that just 66 lawyers, of whom 63 were white and 58 were men, were six times as likely to get their cases heard than any other lawyers. Half were former Supreme Court clerks. By hearing many more cases, a larger court would break up this scheme. A larger docket would be healthy in other ways, allowing a uniform national resolution of more disagreements between regional circuits. There is nothing in the Constitution that envisions the court hearing such a small fraction of the nation’s cases, and the framers lived in an era of extremely low federal judicial volume and minimal influence of the Supreme Court. At three times its current size, the court’s ratio of justices to filed appeals would be more in line with that of the circuits. The greatest feature of an expansion is that it would convert what currently seems like an unavoidable vice—the court’s politicization—into a strength. Law cannot be divorced from politics. But politics can be made to work better with better institutional design. Just as a 9-person Congress would be highly undemocratic, dangerously powerful, and ultimately ineffective, a 9-person court is no better. Larger bodies have some inherent features that are more democratic and effective: they are more representative, and they can include a more diverse group; they can do more work; their splits are less likely to be narrow and therefore arbitrary; they have more regular, natural turnover, and any one vacancy would not dominate the political scene as it does today. If politics are inevitable, they should at least be made to work: a larger number means Republican justices and Democratic justices would be less likely to engage in simple bloc voting. With a larger body, more natural coalitions can develop, yielding richer dynamics than the 5-4 decisions that have become all too common these days. (Because justices serve for life, the coalitions could be more free-flowing and less beholden to the party system, unlike legislators who must maintain party support for committee assignments and reelection.) Finally, court size isn’t one of the design features that supposedly insulates the judiciary from the tyranny of the majority, unlike lifetime appointments. The framers would be appalled by the degree to which we have abdicated responsibility for the constitution to a small, homogenous, unelected group. We should be appalled, too. But there is a solution. Enlargement will involve sacrifices by partisans on both sides, as a larger court will be less predictable. For liberals, it may be hard to move past their memories of a court that served them well over a half-century in expanding rights when political branches would not do the same. For conservatives, it may be hard to give up control just as they are finally cementing the victory of a multi-decade campaign to retake the judiciary. But increasing court size should not favor one particular party, and should appeal to all Americans—save perhaps the Supreme Court bar and former clerks.

Breaking Down the Supreme Court’s Ethics Rules as Justices Come Under Fire,Nik Popli;Does the Supreme Court have a code of conduct?;How are ethics violations enforced?;Does Congress have the authority to regulate Supreme Court ethics?;What are the ethics allegations facing the Supreme Court Justices?,Politics;Supreme Court,"May 30, 2024 10:24 AM EDT","The U.S. Supreme Court is facing mounting pressure to address its procedures for handling potential conflicts of interest amid a recent string of ethical questions involving the Justices.  The Justices rely on self-policing mechanisms to uphold ethical standards and maintain the integrity of the court. But with public trust in the judiciary the lowest it’s been in 50 years, some are pushing for more stringent and enforceable policies.  The latest Supreme Court scandal involves Justice Samuel Alito's controversial display of an upside-down American flag—a symbol associated with the ""Stop the Steal"" movement—outside his home following the 2020 election. Alito has refused to recuse himself from pending cases related to former President Donald Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, despite concerns about that flag and another flag associated with Jan. 6 flown at another of his properties, has sparked renewed criticism and raised questions about judicial impartiality. “The two incidents you cite do not meet the conditions for recusal,” Alito wrote in a letter distributed by the Supreme Court on May 29. “As I have stated publicly, I had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of that flag. I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention.” (Alito has said his wife chose to fly the flags.) Critics argue that without external checks and balances, the potential for conflicts of interest and ethical lapses among the Justices remains a significant concern, highlighting the need for comprehensive reform to restore public confidence in the judiciary. “We are in a moment of real crisis with respect to public trust of the Supreme Court,” says Alicia Bannon, a constitutional lawyer and director of the Judiciary Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “And that trust has to be earned.” Here’s what to know about the ongoing debate surrounding Supreme Court ethics. The nine Supreme Court Justices in Nov. 2023 unanimously adopted the institution’s first-ever code of conduct. The code, comprising five canons that include avoiding “impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities” and engaging in outside activities “consistent with the obligations” of the office, represented a departure from the court's previous resistance to formalized ethical guidelines. The unveiling of the code was met with mixed reactions, with critics pointing out several loopholes and ambiguities. One major concern is the absence of clear enforcement mechanisms, raising doubts about how the code will be upheld and whether Justices would face consequences for violations. Without robust enforcement, skeptics argue, the code may lack the teeth needed to truly hold Justices accountable for ethical breaches.  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who has been probing the Supreme Court’s ethics issues, said in a video after the code was made public that “the job is not done”  until there are more answers about accountability. “The real test now is: how do you enforce it? Is there a place where you can file a complaint against a Justice? Who sorts out the ridiculous complaints from the legitimate ones? For the legitimate ones? Who does the fact finding about what happened?” he asked. Alleged ethics violations within the Supreme Court are typically enforced through a combination of internal accountability mechanisms and external scrutiny. But unlike other branches of government, there is no formal mechanism in place specifically designed to hold Justices accountable for misconduct. The primary avenue for addressing serious ethical breaches remains impeachment, a process that has occurred only once in the court's history, back in 1803. Instead, enforcement largely relies on self-policing within the institution, with Justices responsible for upholding ethical standards among their peers. Bannon says that when it comes to allegations about ethical conflicts, there is no formal process  to ensure accountability or transparency among the Justices, leaving the public reliant on sporadic disclosures and voluntary actions by the court. “It's a fact of human psychology that we're very bad judges of our own biases,” she says. “That’s why it's important to take some of these decisions out of the judges’ individual hands.” The Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate certain aspects of the Supreme Court. But the extent to which Congress can directly regulate Supreme Court ethics has been subject to debate and interpretation. Historically, Congress has exercised its authority by enacting legislation that sets forth ethical standards and requirements for federal judges and Supreme Court Justices. For example, Congress has passed laws mandating financial disclosure requirements for federal judges, including Justices of the Supreme Court, to promote transparency and accountability. But Alito asserted in 2023 that Congress has no authority to regulate the Supreme Court despite the ethical regulations Congress already imposes on the Justices. Some legal scholars have also argued that Congress may have limited authority to impose disciplinary measures or enforce ethical standards on individual Justices, as this could potentially encroach upon the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches. Lawmakers have already introduced legislation that would require the Supreme Court to adopt a binding code of conduct and develop a process for enforcement, as well as strengthen recusal rules, but the legislation has been stalled in the Republican-led House of Representatives, where lawmakers claim the push is a politically motivated attempt to undermine the legitimacy of a conservative majority court.  Alito is facing scrutiny after The New York Times reported in May 2024 that he flew an inverted flag outside his house in Virginia following the 2020 election, a symbol associated with the ""Stop the Steal"" movement, which aimed to challenge the legitimacy of President Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. Alito said the flag was briefly flown by his wife amid a dispute with neighbors, and that he had no part in it. The New York Times then reported that the Alitos had flown an “Appeal to Heaven” flag outside their New Jersey vacation home in 2023, another symbol associated with Jan. 6, support for Donald Trump, and religious conservatism. ""My wife is fond of flying flags,"" Alito wrote in his letter to lawmakers. ""I am not.” The incidents have raised concerns about Alito hearing cases related to the Jan. 6 riot and Trump’s role in it. Alito faced criticism last year after ProPublica reported in June 2023 that he took a luxury fishing trip with billionaire Paul Singer, whose hedge fund has had repeated involvement in cases before the court, without disclosing it. Alito defended his actions in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published before the ProPublica report, claiming ignorance of Singer's connections to court cases and asserting that he did not feel obligated to disclose the trip. Alito also came under fire after his involvement in the case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby drew attention after The New York Times reported in November 2022 that a conservative activist was privy to the ruling in 2014 following a dinner with donors and Alito, a revelation that sparked a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. Justice Clarence Thomas has been a focus of inquiry in recent years for accepting gifts and luxury travel from GOP mega donor Harlan Crow without disclosing them as required by federal law. Thomas also faced criticism for his wife Ginni Thomas' rightwing activism and her involvement in efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest as Thomas heard cases related to the election. Thomas has faced allegations regarding a substantial loan he received from a wealthy friend, Anthony Welters, which he allegedly never repaid in full, a Senate investigation found. Questions arose about the proper reporting of this loan on Thomas' taxes and financial disclosures. Thomas has not directly commented on the incident, though his lawyer disputed the Senate investigation’s findings, telling the New York Times that the loan was never forgiven. Other Justices, including Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch, have also faced scrutiny for various ethical concerns. Sotomayor's staff reportedly pressured public institutions to buy copies of her books during her speaking engagements, though the Supreme Court denied that attendees of events featuring Sotomayor were ever required to purchase her book. Gorsuch was accused of selling real estate to the head of a law firm with cases before the court, without naming the buyer on his financial disclosure forms. He has not directly commented on the matter. Chief Justice John Roberts came under scrutiny in January 2023 due to reports of his wife's significant earnings from her work as a recruiter matching attorneys with law firms. Concerns were raised about the potential influence of these earnings on the Chief Justice's decisions and the perception of impartiality. ""This complaint raises troubling issues that once again demonstrate the need for a mandatory code of conduct for Supreme Court Justices,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in a statement at the time.

Donald Trump Offers Conservatives a Deal on Supreme Court,Tessa Berenson Rogers,Politics;Donald Trump,"March 21, 2016 5:25 PM EDT","Donald Trump once suggested that he might appoint his sister, a federal appeals court judge, to the Supreme Court, though he later said he was joking. Just to be clear, he went even further at a debate, naming two federal judges appointed by George W. Bush as potential high court nominees. Now that President Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, Trump is going even further, essentially offering a deal to conservatives nervous about his potential influence on the Supreme Court. Speaking at the construction site for his new hotel in Washington, D.C., Monday, Trump said he will make a list public in the next week of 10 conservative judges that he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court. If elected, Trump said, he would only pick from that list, which is being made in consultation with the conservative Heritage Foundation. “I’m going to submit a list of justices, potential justices of the United States Supreme Court, that I will appoint from the list,” Trump said. “I won’t go beyond that list. Some people say maybe I’ll appoint a liberal judge. I’m not appointing a liberal judge.” By “some people,” Trump means Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, his top rival for the Republican nomination. Cruz has repeatedly warned that Trump can’t be trusted to appoint a conservative justice, part of his overall message casting doubt on Trump’s Republican credentials. The argument over the next Supreme Court justice has become more urgent now that President Obama has announced his pick, a widely respected federal judge with centrist credentials and a blank record on abortion rights. With Senate Republicans vowing not to even hold hearings on Garland, his best bet for confirmation remains the lame-duck session after the November elections. So Trump, who likes to boast that he knows how to make a deal, is offering conservatives a pretty sweet one: He’ll give up some of the independence that a president normally has on judicial nominations if they’ll stay on his side. He also hinted that a third-party campaign, which some anti-Trump Washington conservatives have considered mounting in recent days, could reduce the court’s conservative bloc by helping Hillary Clinton win. “If they want to embrace this, that’s great,” Trump said. “And let me tell you, if they don’t win, they’re going to have probably four, and could even be five, Supreme Court justices approved that will never allow this country to be the same. It’ll take 100 years, but that won’t work. So they better be careful. And they certainly should be careful with third party stuff. … A third party means that the Democrats are going to win almost certainly. You can’t be that spiteful. You can’t be that spiteful, because you’ll destroy the country. Third party will destroy the country.” During his visit to Washington, Trump noted that he has spoken to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in recent days, saying both conversations went well. “They can play games and they can play cute, I can only take them at face value,” he said. “I understand duplicity, I understand a lot of things. But [Ryan] called me last week, he could not have been nicer. I spoke to Mitch McConnell, he could not have been nicer. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement. … If they don’t want to be smart, they should do what they’re doing now and the Republicans are going down to a massive loss.” Trump also met with various Congressmen and lobbyists Monday morning who had been against of his candidacy in hopes of dampening Establishment opposition. Trump declined to say exactly who attended the meeting other than Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has endorsed him, and “some of the great people in Washington.” But Trump said it was “a great meeting.” Write to Tessa Berenson Rogers at tessa.Rogers@time.com",https://time.com/4266700/donald-trump-supreme-court-nominations/
Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Legalize Workplace Discrimination Against Gay Employees,Alejandro de la Garza,U.S.;Supreme Court,"August 25, 2019 5:03 PM EDT","With an amicus brief filed on Friday, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to essentially legalize anti-gay discrimination in the workplace. The brief, from Solicitor General Noel Francisco, argues federal prohibitions on employer discrimination do not extend to protect individuals from being fired or otherwise disenfranchised in the workplace because of their sexual orientation. The Justice Department’s arguments pertain to the employment protections offered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which are being argued in two Supreme Court cases involving gay workers in October. Title VII is a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin. But it does not, the Justice Department says, cover sexuality. Earlier this month, the Justice Department submitted another brief asking the Justices to conclude that Title VII does not protect transgender people from employer discrimination. Toeing a similar line, federal lawyers now argue that “Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination because of sex does not bar discrimination because of sexual orientation.” By effectively drawing a distinction between sex and sexual identity, the brief aims to carve out the latter from Title VII’s protections. The brief goes on to assert that discriminating against same-sex couples is not discriminatory on the basis of sex — arguing that employers are only required to apply similar treatments to people in male-male relationships and female-female relationships. In other words, as long as male and female members of the queer community are treated equally, the brief appears to argue, it is not a violation of Title VII to treat them differently than people in heterosexual relationships. “Unfavorable treatment of a gay or lesbian employee as such is not the consequence of that individual’s sex,” the Justice Department argued, “but instead of an employer’s policy concerning a different trait—sexual orientation—that Title VII does not protect.” Asked last week about his administration’s legal steps to make it easier to discriminate against LGBTQ people in the workplace, Trump sidestepped the question, touting his recent endorsement by the Log Cabin Republicans, a national LGBTQ organization. Several members of that group have quit in response to the endorsement, however, including board member Jennifer Horn. “I’ve done very well with that community,” the President said last week. “Some of my biggest supporters are of that community.” The Justice Department’s most recent brief pertains to two cases currently slated to be argued before the Supreme Court. In one, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, Gerald Bostock, a former county government employee, claimed he was fired because of his sexual orientation. In the other case, a skydiving instructor, Donald Zarda, also claimed he was fired for being gay. The Department of Justice previously submitted an amicus brief in 2017 when the Zarda case went before Second Circuit Court of Appeals. That brief also argued against extending Title VII protections to gay workers. Zarda died in 2014, and his partner and sister have continued the lawsuit on behalf of his estate. The Second Circuit decided in favor of the Zarda estate; Bostock’s case was dismissed in lower courts. “Most of America would be shocked if the Supreme Court said it was legal to fire Aimee because she’s transgender or Don because he is gay,” said James Esseks, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) LGBT & HIV Project, in an April statement on the Zarda case and the transgender discrimination case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “Such a ruling would be disastrous, relegating LGBTQ people around the country to a second-class citizen status. The LGBTQ community has fought too long and too hard to go back now, and we are counting on the justices not to reverse that hard-won progress.” The ACLU is co-representing the Zarda estate, and also representing Aimee Stephens, the plaintiff in the transgender discrimination case. The Supreme Court is slated to hear oral arguments in the two Title VII sexual orientation discrimination cases on October 8, as well as on the case pertaining to Title VII and gender identity. The Justice Department’s amicus brief states that it is up to Congress to amend Title VII to cover anti-gay discrimination, should it choose to do so. “Congress has amended other statutes expressly to cover sexual-orientation discrimination, and it remains free to do the same with Title VII,” it says. “But until it does, this Court should enforce the statute as it is written.” In a related statement, Justice Department spokesperson Kelly Laco tells TIME that, “the government argues that the law can only be enforced as it is currently written. Since Title VII’s original enactment 55 years ago, Congress has repeatedly declined every year to pass bills to expand the scope of the statute to add sexual orientation. Any change to protections under Title VII must go through Congress, which remains free to legislate in this area, not the courts. The proper role of the judiciary, which the rule of law requires, is to fairly enforce the laws as written, not re-interpret or re-write them.” More than 150 House representatives and senators filed their own amicus brief on the three LGBTQ discrimination cases in July. “Congress’s consideration of other legislation, such as the Equality Act, does not diminish protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a statement in July. “The LGBTQ community, and all Americans, are entitled to the full protection of the law – in school, in the workplace and everyplace.” Write to Alejandro de la Garza at alejandro.delagarza@time.com",https://time.com/5660956/trump-administration-anti-gay-brief-title-vii/
You’ll Soon Be Able to Look Up Supreme Court Justices’ Wall Street Investments,"Madeleine Carlisle;What ethics rules are Supreme Court justices under?;The long, slow road of judicial reform",Politics;Supreme Court,"May 13, 2022 3:44 PM EDT","President Joe Biden signed a law Friday that will increase financial disclosure requirements for federal judges and Supreme Court justices, a move legal experts describe as a small but meaningful step towards reform at a time when public trust in the federal judiciary is at an all time low.  The new law, the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, mandates the creation of an online database where the public can search federal judges’ and Supreme Court justices’ financial disclosures. It also mandates that judges and justices follow the same financial disclosure rules as Congress, which require that transaction reports are filed for any securities trades worth more than $1,000 within 45 days of the deal. The law says the database must be online within 180 days of enactment and that all future disclosures must be uploaded within 90 days of the May 15 filing deadline.  “The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act is a small step, but an important one, in the long-belated effort to reduce financial conflicts of interest that compromise the integrity of federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices,” Harvard Law professor Laurence H. Tribe tells TIME. “But the most dangerous conflicts are those arising from partisan politics, and this law would do nothing at all to curb those.”  Read more: Behind The Scenes of President Biden’s Supreme Court Reform Commission The bipartisan change is part of a broad, years-long push to reform the federal judiciary. Efforts on the left were fueled in recent weeks after an unprecedented leak of a draft opinion showed the Supreme Court poised to overturn the constitutional right to abortion access enshrined in Roe v. Wade. (The court’s final opinion is expected in June.) The legislation also comes amid increasing calls from Democrats for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from all cases dealing with the January 6th insurrection, after texts reported by the Washington Post revealed his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, urged then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to overturn the results of the 2020 election.  Supreme Court justices are the only judicial officers in the country not governed by an ethics code, and Democrats have introduced bills in both the House and the Senate that would not only impose a formal code of conduct, but also raise standards for when judges and justices must recuse themselves because of a perceived conflict of interest.  “There’s been more action on judicial ethics in the last few months than there’s been in the last 40 years,” says Gabe Roth, the executive director of the court reform advocacy group Fix the Court, which helped advise on the crafting the new law.  Judges and justices already have to file financial disclosure reports each year. The problem is that the judiciary is often several years behind in releasing the disclosure reports of the 2,400-plus lower court judges, and doesn’t release them online, says Roth. The new law increases the types of financial disclosures judges and justices must make and increases the accessibility of that information.  The legislation was introduced after the Wall Street Journal reported in September that more than 130 federal judges had violated U.S. law and judicial ethics by overseeing court cases involving companies in which either they or members of their family owned stock, and found that federal judges had improperly failed to disqualify themselves from 685 court cases since 2010. In his year-end report in December, Chief Justice John Roberts said the violations found by the Journal were mostly “isolated” and “unintentional,” but said that collectively the federal judiciary’s “ethics training programs need to be more rigorous.” The bill passed through Congress with a rare showing of bipartisanship this winter, passing the House and Senate by a voice vote.  “Litigants cannot find the information that they need to avoid these conflicts,” says U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross, a Democrat from North Carolina, who sponsored the bill in the House. “And judges, because of the way they report and the lack of periodic reporting, don’t hold themselves accountable to avoiding conflicts.” Now, if a lawyer heads to court, Ross tells TIME, they can look up a judge’s financial disclosures in an online database to determine for themselves if they have a conflict.  Read More: Why We Need to Pack the Supreme Court Now|IDEAS Kermit Roosevelt, a professor of law at University of Pennsylvania, says the new law can be seen “as a test case to see if Congress can in fact, regulate [jurists’] behavior after they become Supreme Court justices.” It’s usually up to the individual justices to recuse themselves, he explains. The online database, and the increase in disclosure requirements, could make it easier for the public to see whether justices are complying with the new law. “It’s a very unclear situation, and this might bring some clarity to it,” he says.  Stephen Gillers, a professor at NYU School of Law, says that in Justice Roberts’ year-end report back in 2011, he questioned whether Congress has the power to impose such requirements on Supreme Court justices at all, but added that they must comply with them anyway. “It will be interesting to see if any of the justices balk at the new requirements and what happens if they do,” Gillers says.  After calls for broader reforms of the Supreme Court dominated the Democratic presidential primary, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in April 2021 establishing a commission of legal experts to provide analysis of the “principal arguments” for and against—“including an appraisal of the merits and legality”—of various proposed reforms, such as changing the size and composition of the court or imposing term limits on justices. Some progressive advocates felt the reform commission would give an opinion on such proposals. But in the end, the commissioners did not take a position on either controversial issue. Democrats have introduced bills in the House and the Senate that would impose term limits on justices, but they have not advanced.  Caroline Fredrickson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who served as the president of the progressive American Constitution Society from 2009 to 2019, calls the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act a “start.” Tribe, Roosevelt, and Fredrickson all served on Biden’s reform commission.  “There is obviously much more to be done to ensure meaningful judicial reform — and Congress continues to pursue that objective,” Fredrickson says. “But it is good to see some progress now as we try to ensure further improvements in transparency, ethics, and fair treatment for staff.”  Write to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com",https://time.com/6176657/supreme-court-justices-ethics-rules/
Supreme Court Strengthens Religious Freedom Protections for Workers,Sanya Mansoor,Politics;Supreme Court,"June 29, 2023 11:44 AM EDT","Employers will have to meet a higher standard to deny religious accommodations in the workplace, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Thursday.  The court clarified a previous legal standard that only required employers demonstrate a de minimis (minimal) cost to deny a worker’s request for a religious accommodation; it now says that employers must “show that the burden of granting an accommodation” has “substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business.”  Groff v. DeJoy rose to the Supreme Court after a Christian former postal worker living in rural southeast Pennsylvania sued the post office. Gerald Groff argued that his job did not allow him to observe Sabbath on Sundays and punished him when he did not work those days.  Read More: The Post Office Made a Christian Employee Work on Sundays. Now He’s at the Supreme Court Now, it’s not just observance of the Sabbath that will be affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling, but all sorts of religious accommodations tied to scheduling, dress, and even abortion. That could include the ability for a Muslim woman to wear a hijab or a Christian person to attend Sunday church or an employee’s decision to refuse vaccines on religious grounds. “A bevy of diverse religious organizations has told this Court that the de minimis test has blessed the denial of even minor accommodation in many cases, making it harder for members of minority faiths to enter the job market,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the opinion of the court.  “This decision is especially important for religious minorities, like Muslims, Jews, and Sikhs, who are predominantly the plaintiffs in these cases,” says Joshua McDaniel, director of Harvard University’s Religious Freedom Clinic, who submitted an amicus brief on behalf of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in support of Groff’s position. He points out that Muslims make up less than 1% of the general population but bring more than 18% of all Title VII religious accommodation claims. “This decision will give those religious minorities a fair shot in court and, one would hope, encourage more employers to adopt more inclusive workplace policies so that religious employees won’t have to choose between their livelihood and their faith,” McDaniel says. Other experts argue expanding religious accommodations for employees could also be harmful. “We should not overlook that the Christian conservative legal movement brought this case and what they want is to allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions for contraception, teachers to misgender students, and Christians to proselytize to their co-workers,” says Elizabeth Sepper, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and expert on religious liberty. “These cases fill the federal dockets, and so the real question is what will the lower courts do with a new standard that emphasizes that businesses must take on substantial, not minimal, costs to accommodate religious practices of employees.” Read More: Louis DeJoy’s Surprising Second Act The historical standard for religious accommodations draws from Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which requires employers to show that an employee’s request for religious accommodations would create an “undue hardship” in order to deny it. But the Supreme Court undercut this standard in 1997 when it ruled in Trans World Airlines v. Hardison that employers needed to prove they face more than a “de minimis” (minimal) cost to deny a religious accommodation. Legal experts pointed out that most people understand “undue hardship” to mean more than just a minimal cost, even as some lower courts clung to this phrase. Now, the Supreme Court says interpreting Hardison primarily through the de minimis standard interpretation is a mistake. “We hold that showing “more than a de minimis cost,” … does not suffice to establish “undue hardship” under Title VII. Hardison cannot be reduced to that one phrase,” Alito wrote. “We therefore, like the parties, understand Hardison to mean that “undue hardship” is shown when a burden is substantial in the overall context of an employer’s business.”  Legal experts say the court’s decision on Thursday sends a message to lower courts that they should no longer abide by the minimal cost standard. “The decision is a long overdue correction to an error that has eroded the protections that Congress enacted to safeguard workers’ rights from destruction by their employers,” says John Meiser, director of the Religious Liberty Clinic at Notre Dame Law School. “For decades, courts have permitted even the richest or most powerful employers to deny religious needs that would have cost next to nothing to allow.” Still, the Supreme Court’s ruling might not help Groff. The U.S. Postal Service did make some accommodations for him—like initially allowing him to avoid Sunday shifts before staffing shortages—and his employers may have reached even the heightened standard, experts say. The local postmaster sometimes had to deliver mail himself and his coworkers had to take on more weekend shifts to accommodate Groff.  “Groff may not ultimately win. The postal service went to great lengths to attempt to accommodate him and their efforts may have been enough,” Sepper says.

Why 3 Supreme Court Justices Didn’t Attend the State of the Union,Tessa Berenson Rogers,Politics,"January 20, 2015 9:18 PM EST","The wording in the Constitution is simple and straightforward: the President “shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.” There’s nothing in there about the Supreme Court justices and, accordingly, there’s nothing simple and straightforward about their attendance. This year, six justices were in attendance, while three of the most conservative members of the court, Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, were noticeably absent. In the modern era, custom has held that the justices would show up in their official robes and sit impassively. But in recent years, they’ve become more resistant to the tradition. Justice Antonin Scalia’s absence is no surprise. It was the 19th State of the Union in a row that he’s skipped since he considers the speech a “childish spectacle.” Justice Clarence Thomas’s empty seat was also unsurprising. In 2012, Thomas said he doesn’t attend the annual event because “it has become so partisan and it’s very uncomfortable for a judge to sit there.” Thomas’s remark gets to the heart of why the State of the Union has become a painful event for the justices: the address has become a “political pep rally,” according to Chief Justice John Roberts (who still attends nonetheless), as the justices are forced to sit calmly while the President and members of government around them cheer and crow about the politics of the moment. For years, attendance among the justices has been declining: From 1965 through 1980, the attendance rate was 84 percent. Over the next two decades, the number dropped to 53 percent. Since 2000, the rate has fallen to 32 percent, according to a study by Todd Peppers of Roanoke College and Michael Giles of Emory University. This tension between the speech and the highest court in the land came to a head in 2010, when President Obama directly criticized a conservative Supreme Court decision. “With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that, I believe, will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections,” he said of the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision, which allowed corporations to donate to political candidates. Justice Samuel Alito then shook his head and whispered, “not true.” This was a clear breaking point in the years of simmering discontent between the justices and the annual speech. After the 2010 State of the Union, Alito said the speeches have become too awkward and that the justices have to sit there “like the proverbial potted plant”and he hasn’t been to a State of the Union since. Justice Stephen Breyer, a liberal, is the only justice that attends every year (in fact, three times in recent history he has been the only justice in attendance), but his defense was hardly inspiring: “People attend if they wish to attend. I do wish to attend, so I go,” he said in 2005. Tonight there probably won’t be any public controversy between between the President and the justices in the vein of 2010’s “not true.” But the grim faces of the six in attendance speak volumes.

Why We Need a Code of Ethics for the Supreme Court,Ideas;Alicia Bannon;Johanna Kalb,Ideas;politics,"October 1, 2019 4:57 PM EDT","When the Supreme Court returns from vacation on October 1, the justices have a week to do administrative work before arguments begin. Their first order of business should be a code of ethics.  Such codes govern the rest of the nation’s courts, not to mention a growing number of corporations, universities, and similar institutions. But not the Supreme Court. It’s an egregious gap, particularly at a moment when public trust in our democratic institutions is falling, and in the aftermath of Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s highly contentious confirmation hearing, which polarized the country and continues to cast a shadow over the Supreme Court.  Judges are supposed to take steps to avoid even the appearance of bias or political activity. But over the last twenty years, we’ve seen Supreme Court justices engage in activities forbidden under the code of ethics for other federal judges. Members of the Court have given partisan speeches. They have failed to recuse themselves from cases with which they have apparent conflicts of interest. Some have accepted lavish gifts from people and organizations who also fund constitutional litigation. Congress has taken notice of this behavior. A series of bills – sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats – have sought to require a code of conduct for the Supreme Court. This year, H.R. 1, a comprehensive package of democracy reform bills that passed the House of Representatives in March, included a provision requiring the creation of an ethical code for the Supreme Court. But the Court doesn’t have to wait for Congress to act – nor should it. The justices can clean their own house by drafting and adopting a code of ethics. As a start, they can draw from the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, which has applied to the federal judiciary since 1973. Much of the code can be easily applied to the Supreme Court, including its new provisions on harassment and abusive behavior in the workplace. The code prohibits judges from participating in or tolerating such behavior and forbids them from retaliating against employees who report it. While the code is a good foundation, the Supreme Court would also need to account for its unique powers and position. For example, the Supreme Court’s rules for stock ownership should be more stringent than those in the federal code of conduct to reduce the likelihood of needing to recuse themselves from cases involving their investments. And given the growing frequency with which the justices make public appearances, the Court should adopt ethical standards for speeches and events that are more specific than those in the federal code of conduct. Of course, having a code of conduct isn’t a cure-all, whether the code applies to judges, professors, or CEOs. But it’s vital for transparency and accountability. By adopting a code of ethics that is publicly available, the Court would shape expectations among judges and the public about acceptable behavior. A code would anticipate and give guidance on knotty ethical dilemmas, and also help to protect the justices against criticism for the tricky ethical decisions they make. And if the justices slip up, a code would allow them to be held accountable, by each other, in the court of public opinion and, in very rare instances, through impeachment. Since becoming chief justice, John Roberts has suggested multiple times that a code of conduct for the Supreme Court is unnecessary. But there are signs that his views may have changed. Six months ago, Justice Elena Kagan told Congress that the chief justice was considering a code of conduct for the Court. The justices must act. Our highest court should model accountability, not dodge it.   Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/5690513/code-ethics-supreme-court/
The Supreme Court Just Took Up a Case That Poses a Major Threat to Roe v. Wade,Abigail Abrams,Politics,"May 17, 2021 5:47 PM EDT","The Supreme Court said on Monday it will hear a challenge to a Mississippi law barring almost all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, setting up a clear opportunity for the court’s new 6-3 conservative majority to reexamine Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion. This case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, will be the first time the court considers a state restriction on abortion since Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed last fall. It’s one in a wave of state laws limiting abortion passed in recent years that are designed to challenge the decades-old ruling. Barrett is one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by former President Donald Trump and an open opponent of abortion rights. Before she joined the court, Trump’s two other appointees, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, dissented last June when the court struck down a Louisiana abortion law in June Medical Services v. Russo. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s liberals in that decision, but made clear it was only because the Louisiana law was nearly identical to a Texas one the court had ruled against in 2016 and he didn’t want to ignore the court’s own recent actions.  This time, the details of the case are different, and Barrett’s position means the other conservatives on the court don’t need Roberts’ vote to significantly diminish protections for reproductive rights. “It’s a huge deal,” says Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor who studies abortion. “There’s no way that four of the conservatives would want to take this case unless they felt they had a fifth to uphold Mississippi’s law.” The Mississippi law would prohibit all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy except in the cases of medical emergencies and severe fetal abnormalities. It has not gone into effect because a federal district judge and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit both blocked the ban, saying the law went against decades of precedent that a woman has the right to an abortion before the fetus is viable, or before it can survive outside the womb. “In an unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed, and reaffirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability,” Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote in the appeals court decision in 2019. “States may regulate abortion procedures prior to viability so long as they do not impose an undue burden on the woman’s right but they may not ban abortions.”  Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the Jackson, Miss. abortion clinic at the center of the case, told reporters on Monday that she had expected the Supreme Court to decline to hear the case because of that longstanding precedent. The court had delayed taking action on Dobbs since last year, but now it will take up the case with a focus on exactly that question of “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”  Even if the high court doesn’t overturn Roe, any decision in favor of the Mississippi law would have significant ramifications for abortion rights across the country. “The court cannot uphold this law without overturning the principle protections of Roe vs. Wade,” Northup said on Monday. Part of advocates’ concern is that, without the viability standard, there would be no established alternative for when states must allow people to obtain abortions, according to Ziegler. “If viability isn’t the limit, then what is the limit? Is it when you can detect a heartbeat? Is it fertilization? So it’s not clear, if the court says you can ban abortions pre-viability, if there’s going to be any limit [on when they can ban abortions] at all,” she says. That is exactly what many abortion opponents are hoping will happen. “This is a landmark opportunity for the Supreme Court to recognize the right of states to protect unborn children from the horrors of painful late-term abortions,” Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement on Monday. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said the Supreme Court’s move to take up the case was long overdue. “The sanctity of life. The future of our children. Mississippi is at the forefront of protecting both. And that is what is at stake in the case we have been praying the U.S. Supreme Court would decide to hear,” he said in a Facebook post. The Biden Administration and abortion rights advocates support legislation that has been proposed in Congress that would effectively create a federal right to abortion, but it has not made much progress. Right now, Jackson Women’s Health Organization is the last remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi, so the outcome of the case could make it more difficult for people in that state and across the South to access abortion. Eleven states also have what are known as “trigger bans” that would prohibit abortion if Roe were overruled, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. The case will be heard in the Supreme Court’s upcoming term, which starts in October, and a decision is likely to come next year.

The Worst Supreme Court Decisions Since 1960,"Andrea Sachs;Richard Delgado, University of Alabama;Saikrishna Prakash, University of Virginia;Jamal Greene, Columbia University;Margaret Montoya, University of New Mexico;Martin Redish, Northwestern University;Cass Sunstein, Harvard University;Lawrence Sager, University of Texas, Austin;Erwin Chemerinsky, University of California, Irvine;Owen Fiss, Yale University;Richard Pildes, New York University;Cary Franklin, University of Texas, Austin;Steven Shiffrin, Cornell University;Jenny Martinez, Stanford University;Kathryn Abrams, University of California, Berkeley;Ashutosh Bhagwat, University of California, Davis;Michael Dorf, Cornell University",Politics;Supreme Court,"October 6, 2015 11:36 AM EDT","Excerpted from the TIME special edition The Supreme Court: Decisions That Changed America.  Ah, the glorious life of a Supreme being. For one thing, the nine justices on the Supreme Court never have to worry that their verdicts might be reversed by a higher court—there isn’t one. But that doesn’t mean that the court’s decisions aren’t regularly critiqued by hundreds of constitutional law professors nationwide. As this book was being prepared, TIME reached out by email to a number of leading law professors and asked them to identify their choices for the best and worst Supreme Court decisions since 1960. We sent our admittedly unscientific survey invitation to more than 50 such scholars and garnered 34 responses. Our respondents were asked either to reply to our invitation anonymously or to share their thoughts for attribution in these pages. Among the decisions repeatedly praised by the law-school professors were those that championed civil and individual liberties, as well as those that made democracy more participatory. Decisions that were often mentioned included Loving v. Virginia (1967), which found restrictions on interracial marriage unconstitutional; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), which protected freedom of the press in the realm of political reporting and libel; Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), which established the one-person, one-vote concept in legislative apportionment; and Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 same-sex-marriage ruling. On the negative side, many professors were critical of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), which removed campaign-spending limits on corporations and unions, as well as Bush v. Gore (2000), which resulted in George W. Bush’s winning the presidential election. It’s no surprise that the ever-controversial decision in Roe v. Wade (1973) appeared on the lists of both the best and worst decisions. Here’s a sampling of the opinions generated when we asked court-watchers to put the worst decisions of the past 55 years on the scales. Click here to see what they thought the best decisions were. Citizens United v. FEC (2010) and Bush v. Gore (2000). Citizens United because it departed from precedent and distorted the political process in ruinous fashion; Bush v. Gore because it was unprincipled, result-driven, and exposed the court to well-deserved scorn. Roe v. Wade (1973). This decision is the worst on two levels. First, its legal reasoning is so thin that numerous law professors felt compelled to author chapters in a book about what Roe should have said. Second, it generated a potent public backlash that was somewhat successful in curbing the court’s willingness to wade into thorny social issues. Bowers v. Hardwick (1986). The worst decision since 1960 is Bowers, in which the court upheld the constitutionality of a Georgia anti-sodomy law. It was narrow-minded, cynical and offensive, very much in the sad tradition of Plessy v. Ferguson. Bush v. Gore (2000). This judicial coup d’état led directly to the disastrous wars in the Middle East and the equally bad decision in Citizens United (2010). Bush v. Gore (2000). On its four corners the decision may be plausible, but put in the context of the circumstances and the justices who voted to make up the majority, this case is the paradigm of transparently politically driven, unprincipled constitutional analysis. Citizens United v. FEC (2010). Because it is undermining our system of democracy itself. Bush v. Gore (2000). In a context where—absent Supreme Court intervention—no important principles of political justice were in peril, and where the salutary constraints of reason-giving and precedent-following were conspicuously absent, the court chose the president of the U.S. The charge of naked politics is hard to answer. San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973). This decision held that inequities in school funding do not violate the Constitution. The court thus said that discrimination against the poor does not violate the Constitution and that education is not a fundamental right. It played a major role in creating the separate and unequal schools that exist today. Milliken v. Bradley (1974). This decision, which barred the proposed busing of Detroit students to achieve racial integration, repudiated the proudest aspirations of Brown v. Board of Education and began the long and extended process of draining that landmark 1954 decision of much of its substantive meaning. Buckley v. Valeo (1976). In its first crack at an immensely complicated problem, campaign finance, the court tried to decide too much at a time when it knew too little. By sweepingly ruling that any and all forms of regulating election spending were unconstitutional, the court essentially made any efforts to regulate the system destined from the start to be fruitless and impotent. And at the same time, by carving in half the statute Congress enacted, the court created a campaign-finance system Congress never would have enacted. We continue to live with the fallout. Shelby County v. Holder (2013). It’s not just that a bare majority of the court gutted one of the most important civil rights laws in American history; it’s that the principle they relied on was one relied on by apologists for the Confederacy after the Civil War: that states possess a special dignity that is offended if we recognize that some engage in more race discrimination than others. San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973). By permitting funds for children in schools to be distributed on the basis of neighborhood wealth instead of educational needs, it has permitted millions of children to be imprisoned in a system of educational inequality. Citizens United v. FEC (2010). Because this decision undermined our democracy. Bowers v. Hardwick (1986). The entanglement of the court in religiously infused moralizing and the rendering of gays and lesbians as (as the court in Romer put it) “strangers to the law”: it doesn’t get much worse than this. Bowers v. Hardwick (1986). The case, involving a state anti-sodomy law, was legally complex, but the majority opinions are at bottom hateful and bigoted. Bush v. Gore (2000). The decision grossly abused the power asserted in Baker v. Carr and was impossible to explain as dividing along anything but partisan lines.

Why the Supreme Court Ruled for Westboro,,U.S.,"March 3, 2011 12:00 AM EST","Albert Snyder has always sworn that he wasn’t doing it for the money. He wasn’t waging a four-year legal battle against Westboro Baptist Church, the Topeka, Kans.-based fringe group that stages protests at military funerals, for a cash settlement. Yes, he was seeking millions in damages, but his goal was to silence the group. Westboro believes that God is punishing troops for America’s tolerance of homosexuality and has called upon the church to spread this message. So in March 2006, seven Westboro protesters flew more than 1,000 miles to attend the funeral of Snyder’s son, Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, 20, who had been killed in Iraq that month. They hoisted revolting signs that said things like “Thank God for 9/11” and “You’re Going to Hell” and “Thank God for Dead Soldiers.” Snyder said he was fighting to protect other families already coping with the tragedy of losing a loved one from the pain that Westboro inflicted on him. Feeling that protesters ruined his son’s funeral, held in a Roman Catholic church in Westminster, Md., Snyder got depressed. He could no longer drive his car for long stretches, alone with his thoughts, because Westboro’s words were drilled into his mind. “To me, what they did was just as bad, if not worse, than if they had taken a gun and shot me,” Snyder told TIME during a September interview. “At least the wound would have healed.”  (See LIFE.com’s photo gallery “Inside the Westboro Baptist Church.”)  But now, thanks to the Supreme Court, Snyder has lost more than the money he might have gotten in damages. He’s lost the bigger fight. His attempt to shield Westboro’s targets fell short. The group will only get louder.  In a sweeping 8-1 victory for Westboro and First Amendment fundamentalists, the Supreme Court on March 2 upheld Westboro’s right to picket a military funeral. The case, Snyder v. Phelps, was among the most charged on the Supreme Court docket last year, as Snyder sought to recover the $5 million in damages awarded to him by a lower court jury but overturned on appeal. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals: in this case, the First Amendment shields Westboro from torts of intentional infliction of emotional distress and intrusion upon seclusion.  (See “The Long, Sometimes Painful History of the First Amendment.”)  The decision shocked Snyder. “It’s easy for eight Justices to sit up there and take away your privacy rights when they’ll never have to worry about that,” he says. “No one will get three, five or 1,000 feet away from the funeral of anybody in their family. So it has no effect on them. It has no effect on the politicians, no effect on the celebrities. It has an effect on us, the everyday people. And now Westboro can pretty much do and say and act however they want. And there’s not a damn thing anybody can do.” Chief Justice John Roberts, who delivered the majority opinion, wrote, “Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding Westboro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is of public or private concern.” And in this specific case, the judges determined, the words on Westboro’s signs indeed dealt with “matters of public import” and are thus protected by the First Amendment. Signs like “America Is Doomed” and “Fag Troops” and “Priests Rape Boys,” in the court’s view, highlight issues like “the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens, the fate of our Nation, homosexuality in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic clergy.” (Matthew Snyder was not gay.)  (See the top 10 gratuitously provocative acts.)  In his arguments, Snyder asked the judges to examine the context of Westboro’s speech. The protesters said hateful things at a funeral for a young man who made the ultimate sacrifice: fighting for our country. Doesn’t common sense dictate that we make a free-speech exception? Don’t let the nuisance near a funeral, he argued. But to the court, content trumps context. “The fact that Westboro spoke in connection with a funeral … cannot by itself trump the nature of Westboro’s speech,” Roberts wrote. “Westboro’s signs, displayed on public land next to a public street, reflect the fact that the church finds much to condemn in modern society.” Because of the nature of Westboro’s protest, the court also rejected Snyder’s “intrusion upon seclusion” claim. Snyder cited the “captive audience” doctrine in his arguments: since he had to attend his son’s funeral, which couldn’t be moved somewhere else at the last minute, he could not avoid the protest. In Frisby v. Schultz, for example, the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance prohibiting picketing “before or about” an individual’s residence. Since you can’t just pick up and move, you’re a captive audience. In this instance, however, the court noted that Westboro “stayed well away from the memorial service” — some 1,000 feet. When driving to the funeral, Snyder saw only the tops of the signs; only later, on a television broadcast, did he see the sinister speech. The protesters gathered lawfully, on a public area under police supervision, and did not interfere with the procession or service. Snyder may have been secluded at the funeral, but the court insists that Westboro did not intrude. “We decline to expand the captive audience doctrine to the circumstances presented here,” Roberts wrote. Snyder’s lone backer, Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a passionate dissent that accuses his colleagues of being plain mean. “Respondents’ outrageous conduct caused petitioner great injury, and the Court now compounds that injury by depriving petitioner of a judgment that acknowledges the wrong he suffered,” Alito wrote. He seems to be asking them, How can you sleep at night?  “In order to have a society in which public issues can be openly and vigorously debated, it is not necessary to allow the brutalization of innocent victims like petitioner,” wrote Alito. “I therefore respectfully dissent.” Perhaps another adverb is more fitting: angrily. Any reasonable person, Alito opined, could interpret Westboro’s signs as personal attacks on a dead soldier rather than opinions about public issues. “God Hates Fags” could have been viewed as an attack on Matthew Snyder’s sexuality. “Moreover,” Alito wrote. “Since a church funeral is an event that naturally brings to mind thoughts about the afterlife, some of the respondents’ signs — e.g., ‘God Hates You,’ ‘Not Blessed Just Cursed’ and ‘You’re Going to Hell’ — would have likely been interpreted as referring to God’s judgment of the deceased.” Roberts emphasized that the court’s ruling was narrow. Since, at the time of the protest, Maryland law did not dictate the minimum distance funeral protesters must stand from a service, the court declined to evaluate the constitutionality of the 44 state statutes that have passed picketing restrictions. And then there’s the separate question of whether there are limits to free speech in cyberspace. About a month after his son’s death, Albert Snyder came across a posting on Westboro’s website that said he and his ex-wife “raised [Matthew] for the devil.” After seeing this note, Snyder threw up, and then cried for three hours. The lower court considered how this message affected Snyder’s emotional state. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, did not factor this post into its decision, in part because “internet postings may raise distinct issues in this context.” Alito called this explanation “strange.”  Though the majority opinion mostly avoided language with broad free-speech implications, one section could set precedence — and it raises even more questions. Roberts wrote, “And even if a few of the signs — such as ‘You’re Going to Hell’ and ‘God Hates You’ — were viewed as containing messages related to Matthew Snyder or the Snyders specifically, that would not change the fact that the overall thrust and dominant theme of Westboro’s demonstration spoke to broader public issues.” So does that mean a protest group has license to carry one or two offensive signs that cause a person severe distress as long as most of their other signs pertain to some public issue? And how do you define “overall thrust and dominant theme”? Can 70% of the signs be benign and 30% offensive? Or is the split 80-20? How about 60-40? Further, why should such a split matter? If you or a family member were verbally assaulted while in a vulnerable state, why would there be any comfort that most of the other signs were not directed at you? Why would that soften the blow? This passage clearly troubled Alito. The Justice argued that even if you were to agree that most of Westboro’s signs referred to issues of public import — and Alito stresses that he doesn’t — “I fail to see why actionable speech should be immunized simply because it is interspersed with speech that is protected. The First Amendment allows recovery for defamatory statements that are interspersed with nondefamatory statements on matters of public concern, and there is no good reason why the respondents’ attack on Matthew Snyder and his family should be treated fairly.” Westboro members boast that the Supreme Court ruling will strengthen their cause. Margie Phelps, daughter of Westboro founder Fred Phelps and the lawyer who argued the church’s case to the Supreme Court, vowed to “quadruple” funeral protesters. “It’s so impressive and amazing,” says Margie’s sister, Shirley Phelps-Roper, “that it compels us to go quicker. This nation’s destruction is imminent.” We shouldn’t be too fearful of these words: Westboro often talks a big game and then fails to show up at events. And according to Westboro, America’s destruction has been imminent for at least 20 years. Snyder, meanwhile, says he’s ready to move on. “It’s over,” he says. “I fought the fight.” Pushing forward won’t be easy, especially since the court’s decision arrived the day before the fifth anniversary of Matthew’s death. Snyder says he’ll spend more time with friends and family — “That’s been one thing I’ve neglected,” he says — and try to find closure regarding his son. During these years of legal battles, Snyder never got to grieve. The legal loss will compound the sadness. “I’m just very disappointed in America today,” Snyder says. “You’ve got countries that won’t even let these people on their land [Britain banned Phelps from entering the U.K. for a protest], and we allow them to desecrate a Marine’s funeral. There’s something very wrong.  “We have other countries laughing at us right now.”  See TIME’s Pictures of the Week.  See the Cartoons of the Week.

Supreme Court Rules Thousands of Immigrants Can Be Detained Indefinitely,Madeleine Carlisle;Jasmine Aguilera;More from TIME,Politics;Courts,"June 13, 2022 2:03 PM EDT","The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Monday that immigrants detained in the United States are not entitled to a bond hearing, a decision that means that the thousands of people with open immigration cases who are currently in federal holding facilities can continue to be detained indefinitely. The high court also ruled that federal courts lack the authority to grant class-wide relief to detainees. In other words, if any detainees want to argue in the future that they have a right to a bond hearing, they will need to bring their cases individually, despite the fact that immigrants are not entitled to counsel during immigration proceedings.  The Court’s ruling maintains the status quo. For-profit corporations, like Geo Group and others, currently detain thousands of immigrants in prison-like centers. Such immigrants are not charged with a crime, nor do they have a right to a hearing justifying their detention. The Court also maintains the U.S. government’s broad discretion over immigrant detention, ruling that immigrants can only have a bond hearing if the government says so.  The ruling is not a surprise, says Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a nonpartisan research organization. But, he adds, “it’s a pretty strong statement” from the highest court in the land. “It does not raise any more hopes for people who have been held in prolonged detention, that there may be a reprieve for them,” he says. The two cases, Johnson v. Arteaga-Martinez and Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, were brought by unauthorized immigrants who challenged their prolonged detention by the U.S. government. They argued that immigrants held in detention for longer than six months are entitled to individualized bond hearings where the government must prove the necessity of their detention. Read more: Why Judges Are Basically in Charge of U.S. Immigration Policy Now At the center of the lawsuits was a 1996 immigration statute that states an unauthorized immigrant “may” remain in detention for an extended period of time if they fail to meet certain criteria. Several detained immigrants sued the U.S. government, arguing that because the statute says “may” be detained rather than “shall” be detained, it connotes discretion by judges and entitles them to a hearing. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, where the Biden Administration argued that the law grants the U.S. Attorney General the power to detain unauthorized immigrants for any period of time while their cases are litigated. (The Department of Justice declined to respond to TIME’s request for comment.) In 2020, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled detainees are entitled to a bond hearing. Because Garland was brought as a class action lawsuit, the Ninth Circuit granted class-wide relief and extended the right to a bond hearing to every person named in the suit. On Monday, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit, ruling that detainees are not entitled to such a bond hearing and cannot be granted relief on a class-wide basis. Going forward, those asserting a right to a bond hearing, either on statutory or Constitutional grounds, will have to bring their cases individually. The court ruled 8-1 in Johnson v. Arteaga-Martinez on the question of bond hearings, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing the majority opinion and Justice Clarence Thomas filing a concurring opinion which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined in part. Justice Stephen Breyer also filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. In Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, on the question of class-wide relief, the court ruled 6-3, with Justice Samuel Alito writing the majority opinion. Justice Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Elena Kagan joined and Justice Breyer joined in part. Unlike people charged with a crime in the U.S., those in immigration detention centers are not entitled to counsel in immigration proceedings, says Leah Litman, a professor at University of Michigan Law School who filed a brief in support of Gonzalez. As a result, she argues that the decision is “just completely unworkable and unrealistic.”  “It makes it impossible to ensure that everyone who is potentially entitled to a bond hearing will get one,” she says.  On average, only about 21% of people in immigrant detention are able to access legal representation, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a research organization at Syracuse University. TRAC data also finds that lawyers increase the chance that a person can win their immigration case. As of June 5, more than 24,500 people were held in immigration detention, according to TRAC. Nearly 5,800 of them were held in facilities operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where, as of December 2019, the average length of stay is 55 days, according to the American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy and research organization. However, it is common for lengths of stay in ICE detention to last for several years as their case makes its way through an increasingly backlogged immigration court system. Read more: A Record-Breaking 1.6 Million People Are Now Mired in U.S. Immigration Court Backlogs Immigrants and advocates have long raised concerns about safety in immigration detention, and individual facilities have been the subject of controversy and federal investigations for how immigrants are treated. In May 2021, the Biden Administration shut down two ICE detention centers in Georgia and Massachusetts after launching investigations into allegations of abuse, including the Irwin County Detention Center, where women have accused a gynecologist of conducting forced sterilizations. Matt Adams, the legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project who argued the Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez case before the Supreme Court, said the ruling raises ethical concerns.  “To now find that the statute allows for indefinite detention is contrary to a fundamental principle upon which our system was founded—that government officials may not lock up a person without at least providing them their day in court to contest whether their confinement is justified,” Adams said in a statement to the ACLU. “But we are not done, and will return to court to address the constitutional claim that must now be resolved.”  Write to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com and Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com",https://time.com/6187133/supreme-court-immigrants-bond-hearings/
What to Know About the Arizona Supreme Court Abortion Ban Ruling,Solcyré Burga;What the Arizona Supreme Court decision says;What does it mean for women and abortion providers?;Will there be a ballot initiative?,U.S.;Arizona,"April 9, 2024 5:48 PM EDT","The Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year-old abortion ban on Tuesday that would prohibit nearly all abortions in the state except when “necessary to save” a pregnant person’s life.  The decision reversed a previous Arizona Court of Appeals ruling that allowed abortion to remain legal in the state up to 15 weeks, in accordance with a 2022 law, according to Planned Parenthood.  “Make no mistake, by effectively striking down a law passed this century and replacing it with one from 160 years ago, the Court has risked the health and lives of Arizonans,” said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes in a press statement Tuesday, before adding that her office would not be prosecuting any physician or woman under the “draconian law.”  The near-total abortion ban was written before Arizona was officially a state and before women could vote. The ban, which dates back to 1864, would sentence abortion providers to two to five years in prison for providing an abortion. Additional sanctions could be issued to physicians who perform abortions after 15 weeks.  The ban won’t go into effect just yet—as the court stayed its enforcement for 14 days.  “Arizonans deserve the right to make personal decisions about their reproductive health care, free from government interference. We are devastated by today’s ruling but we remain committed to defending reproductive freedom in the courts, at the legislature, as well as in communities across the state towards the passage of the Arizona for Abortion Access Act this November,” said Jared Keenan, legal director of the ACLU of Arizona, in a press release. “The urgency to enshrine the right to abortion in our state’s constitution has never been more necessary.”  The Arizona Supreme Court decision would make it so that “all abortions, except those necessary to save a woman’s life, are illegal,” according to the ruling. There are no exceptions for rape and incest.  “We conclude that [Arizona’s law] does not create a right to, or otherwise provide independent statutory authority for, an abortion that repeals or restricts [the law], but rather is predicated entirely on the existence of a federal constitutional right to an abortion since disclaimed by Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization,” the court said in its opinion. “Absent the federal constitutional abortion right, and because [the law] does not independently authorize abortion, there is no provision in federal or state law prohibiting [the law’s] operation. Accordingly, [Arizona’s law] is now enforceable.” The act has been criticized by several politicians, including the president. “Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest,” President Biden said in a Tuesday press release.  Planned Parenthood says that abortion through 15 weeks will remain accessible “for a limited period of time” because of a separate lawsuit filed in October 2022. In that case, the Maricopa County Superior Court ruled that the state cannot enforce the abortion ban until 45 days after the Arizona Supreme Court made a decision, per Planned Parenthood. That means the ban would not go into effect until June.    “This decision will result in a legal chilling effect on Arizonans who wish to obtain abortion services regardless of the circumstances that lead to their decision, and for those in the medical community who might provide them,” said Pima County Attorney Laura Conover, a party in the case in an emailed statement.“The result of this will ultimately cause an increase in unsafe abortions and threaten the liberties of those involved because the criminalization of abortions will not end the need or desire of those who seek services.”  Arizona for Abortion Access, made up of a number of reproductive rights organizations, is pushing for a constitutional amendment that would give a right to abortion care until fetal viability, or the 24th week of pregnancy. Abortions would be provided after that point if a health care provider says an abortion is necessary to “protect the life or the physical or mental health of the pregnant individual,” under the ballot initiative.  Arizona abortion advocates need to get 384,000 valid signatures by July 3 if they want to put abortion on the ballot this November. Organizers said they exceeded the signature threshold by more than 100,000, but have a goal of 800,000, according to NBC News. The signatures still have to be certified.  Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/6965338/arizona-supreme-court-abortion-ban/
Wisconsin Supreme Court to Consider Whether 175-Year-Old Law Bans Abortion,TODD RICHMOND / AP,U.S.;Wisconsin,"July 2, 2024 8:42 PM EDT","Madison, Wis. — The Wisconsin Supreme Court decided Tuesday to consider two challenges to a 175-year-old law that conservatives maintain bans abortion without letting the cases wind through lower courts. Abortion advocates stand an excellent chance of prevailing in both cases given the high court's liberal tilt and remarks a liberal justice made on the campaign trail about how she supports abortion rights. Wisconsin lawmakers enacted statutes in 1849 that had been widely interpreted as outlawing abortion in all cases except to save the mother's life. The U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nullified the statutes, but legislators never repealed them. The high court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade reactivated them. Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the statutes in 2022, arguing they were too old to enforce and a 1985 law that permits abortions before a fetus can survive outside the womb supersedes them. A Dane County judge ruled last year that the statutes outlaw attacking a woman in an attempt to kill her unborn baby but doesn't ban abortions. The decision emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after halting procedures when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, asked the state Supreme Court in February to overturn the ruling without letting an appeal move through the state's lower appellate courts. He argued the ruling will have a statewide impact and guide lawmakers and the case will ultimately end at the Supreme Court anyway. Days after Urmanski filed his request, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin sued Urmanski and asked the Supreme Court to take it directly. The organization is seeking a ruling that the 1849 statutes are unconstitutional, arguing that the state constitution's declaration that people have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness means women have a right to control their own bodies — essentially asking the court to declare a constitutional right to abortion. The court released orders indicating the justices voted unanimously to take Urmanski's appeal and voted 4-3 to take the Planned Parenthood case. The court's four liberal justices voted to take that case, and the three conservative justices voted against taking it. Urmanski’s attorneys, Andrew Phillips and Matthew Thome, didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Persuading the court's liberal majority to uphold the statutes looks next to impossible. Liberal Justice Janet Protasiewicz even went so far as stating openly during her campaign that she supports abortion rights, a major departure for a judicial candidate. Typically such candidates refrain from speaking about their personal views out of concerns they could appear biased on the bench. The conservative justices accused the liberal majority in their Planned Parenthood dissents of playing politics. “The signal to a watching public is that, when certain policy issues touch the right nerve, this court will follow the party line, not the law,” Hagedorn wrote. Liberal Justice Jill Karofsky countered in a concurrence that the state Supreme Court is supposed to decide important state constitutional questions. “Regardless of one's views on the morality, legality, or constitutionality of abortion, it is undeniable that abortion regulation is an issue with immense personal and practical significance to many Wisconsinites,” Karofsky wrote. Michelle Velasquez, chief strategy officer for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said in a statement that the organization was grateful the court agreed to take its case and Wisconsin residents need to know whether abortion is legal in the state. Wisconsin Watch, a media outlet, obtained a leaked draft of the order accepting the case last week, prompting Chief Justice Annette Ziegler to call for an investigation. Anti-abortion groups decried the Supreme Court's decision to take the Planned Parenthood case. “Every Wisconsinite should be troubled by this blatant weaponization of the court system to enshrine death on demand,” Heather Weininger, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, said in a statement.

5 Reasons Why Supreme Court Nominations Have Failed,Olivia B. Waxman;1. The Nominee’s Record Is Hiding Something;2. The Nominee Isn’t Qualified;3. The Nominee’s Politics Are “Wrong”;4. The Nominee Raises Ethical Concerns;5. It’s a Presidential Election Year;What’s Next,History;Courts,"July 10, 2018 6:31 PM EDT","President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he’s nominating Brett Kavanaugh, a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge, to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. But that announcement is only the beginning for Kavanaugh. Before he can serve on the court, he first needs to be confirmed by the Senate — where Democrats have vowed to put up a fight to block Trump’s second nominee to fill a seat on the nation’s highest court. What the Constitution says about that process (in Article II Section II) is simply that the President “shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.” Ironically, considering the polarized political climate today, a big reason why the Founders bestowed on the Senate the responsibility for “advice and consent” was to keep the process removed from the passions of the people, as the Senate’s members were chosen at the time by state legislatures. And, though hearings aren’t specifically required by the Constitution, the Senate has given Supreme Court nominees a hearing consistently since 1955. The 49 Democratic Senators can’t block Kavanaugh alone but, as TIME reported last week, they are hoping to get Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) to join in their effort. Still, pundits are confident about Kavanugh’s chances. After all, outright rejections of Supreme Court nominees are rare in modern U.S. history — though they do happen. Here’s a look at five red flags Senators have raised that derailed Supreme Court nominations in the past: According to the Senate’s Historical Office, between 1894 and 1968 the Senate only rejected one nominee to the Supreme Court: North Carolina judge John Parker, Herbert Hoover’s nominee to replace Edward Sanford, on May 7, 1930, by a 39 to 41 vote.  The Parker case is an early example of how interest groups can doom a Supreme Court nominee’s chances at confirmation by doing the work of digging up controversial statements in his or her past and bringing national attention to those matters.  General resentment of Herbert Hoover, who was blamed for the Great Depression, was at play with Parker, as well as “the deep controversy of Liberalism v. Conservatism,” as TIME put it. In that atmosphere, outside groups played a key role in finding damning skeletons in Parker’s closet. Labor activists pointed to an opinion in which he upheld a “yellow-dog contract,” in which an employee promises not to join a union as a condition of employment, and the NAACP found a statement he made during his 1920 campaign for Governor of North Carolina, in which he said that the participation of African-Americans in politics “is a source of evil and danger to both races.”  The work of these outside interest groups “torpedoed” Parker’s confirmation, says Barbara Perry, the Director of Presidential Studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center of Public Affairs, who spoke to TIME as part of a presidential-history partnership between TIME History and the Miller Center. Two later nominees rejected after their past decisions were questioned were Clement Haynsworth and George Harrold Carswell, both nominated by Richard Nixon and both denied seats in what was seen as an indictment of both his Southern Strategy — his picking Southern judges was seen as part of his appeal to Southern voters — and his competency as President. For Carswell, his past statements relating to civil rights helped doom his chances; for example, in a 1948 speech he had said that, “Segregation of the races is proper and the only practical and correct way of life.” But his record wasn’t the only problem. Senators also felt that Nixon weighed his political strategy over their qualifications. “The rejection actually reflected a widespread conviction that Carswell simply did not measure up to the stature of men the Senators wanted to see added to the Supreme Court,” TIME noted. “Even many Southerners felt insulted that Nixon had chosen Carswell to represent them.” The next month, the Senate would confirm Nixon’s third nominee 94-0: Harry A. Blackmun, who would go on to write the opinion for the majority in Roe. v. Wade. The partisan polarization of the confirmation process is often seen as reaching a new stage in 1987.  Then, as now, a swing seat was up for grabs. After Ronald Reagan nominated Robert Bork to the seat, Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy (D-MA) “seized the narrative,” Perry says, and painted him as too conservative for the Senate, which had gone Democrat during the 1986 midterms. The gist of Kennedy’s argument was that Bork’s view of the world was out of step with the rest of Washington and the country.  “Robert Bork’s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens’ doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists would be censored at the whim of government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is often the only protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy,” Kennedy said in a speech on the Senate Floor.  That speech — bolstered by Bork’s long paper trail of conservative opinions and his role in the Saturday Night Massacre during the Watergate scandal — galvanized liberal interest groups. Then, as now, the future of Roe v. Wade was seen as at stake; it was revealed that Bork had characterized the case as “unconstitutional” and a “serious and wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation of state legislative authority.” TIME reported back then that the Senate Democrats’ approach to Bork’s confirmation hearing shifted from “questions of their legal ability and ethical fitness” that characterized hearings of yore to “a frank confrontation over ideology.” Bork became a political liability and by the time his nomination came to a vote, his rejection was seen as a foregone conclusion. After Bork, nominees would aim to get through confirmation hearings without saying too much, answering Senators’ questions in a way that avoided ruffling feathers. “You don’t answer these questions directly. You hide behind language,” as David Yalof, author of Pursuit of Justices: Presidential Politics and the Selection of Supreme Court Nominees, summed up a legacy of the Bork controversy. For example, John Roberts likened judges to umpires who merely “call balls and strikes” during his 2005 confirmation hearings, asserting that he would not bring any personal agenda into play. The Bork process also empowered conservative legal organizations to get involved in the process. “Trump takes it to a new level by asking interest groups whom they want on the Supreme Court as a presidential candidate,” says Perry. Kavanaugh hinted at such input in his remarks on Monday when he said, “No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.” After Bork’s failure, President Reagan nominated Douglas Ginsburg, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. But Ginsburg withdrew his nomination after it was revealed that he smoked marijuana as a law professor, which put him at odds with the administration’s war on drugs and “Just Say No” public health campaign. That’s when Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy. In certain cases, the information that damaged the credibility of nominees had little to do with their judicial pasts. In the run-up to the 1968 presidential election, President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to replace retiring Earl Warren as Chief Justice. During the hearings, it was revealed that Fortas had accepted a teaching gig at American University’s law school that came with a privately-funded stipend of $15,000 — equivalent to 40% of his salary on the bench — “donated by five big businessmen who some day may well have matters of interest come before the court,” as TIME reported back then. He was also scrutinized for accepting a $20,000 consulting gig with the family foundation of Louis Wolfson, who’d been indicted on securities fraud. He also faced the appearance of conflict of interest in terms of the separation of powers; TIME reported that he remained a close advisor to LBJ while on the bench. Fortas is considered to be the first SCOTUS nominee to be blocked by a filibuster. After a vote to end debate came up short, LBJ withdrew the nomination at Fortas’ request. He stayed on the court as an Associate Justice, “in an attempt to vindicate himself,” as TIME put it, but his conflicts of interest created a cloud over him and he resigned in May of 1969. A new method of pushing against confirmation was introduced in 2016, when Merrick Garland, the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, became Barack Obama’s nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia, less than a year before a presidential election. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) did not schedule hearings for Garland, because, as he put it, “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.” Until 2016, “No nominee had been denied a hearing since hearings began,” says Perry. McConnell’s logic was new, according to Perry, who crunched the numbers and found that about one-third of U.S. presidents have nominated jurists to the Supreme Court and had those nominations accepted — 14 presidents putting forward 21 justices, to be exact. Of those, six presidents got nominees through as lame ducks. Not to mention, she points out, the Constitution doesn’t actually involve the people in the selection of justices; just the President to nominate people to the Supreme Court, “with the advice and consent of the Senate.”  So how can Supreme Court nominees get confirmed in such a polarized political climate? For Kavanaugh, who faces friendly numbers in the Senate, it’s unlikely to be an issue, but historically even candidates facing a hostile Senate have been able to make it work. As Geoffrey R. Stone, law professor at the University of Chicago, wrote in 2016 for TIME.com, since 1955, “even when the Senate is in the hands of the opposition party, nominees have been easily confirmed if they are (1) perceived to be very highly qualified; (2) they are perceived to be moderate in their views; or (3) their confirmation is seen as unlikely to have a significant impact on the ideological balance on the court.” There are reasons liberals could come to like Kavanaugh, but the vote is still likely to be close. For one thing, Kavanaugh was on the Republican legal team fighting the Florida recount in Bush v. Gore, which handed Bush the presidency over former Vice President Al Gore, and Democrats are still livid over the way Senate Republicans treated Merrick Garland. “I’ve had a hard time getting over the way Merrick Garland was treated,” said Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), a New York Times reporter tweeted Monday. “That was shameful.” In other works: let the showdown begin.

"Supreme Court Allows Texas Abortion Law to Stand, But Says Abortion Providers Can Challenge It",Abigail Abrams;Abortion rights before the Supreme Court;An unusual case,Politics,"December 10, 2021 11:02 AM EST","The Supreme Court will once again allow Texas’ law that bans most abortions after about six weeks to stay in effect, it said Friday, but it will allow a group of abortion providers to challenge the law. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that while the providers’ lawsuit could move forward against some state licensing officials, they would not allow the providers to sue other defendants. In a separate decision, the Court dismissed the U.S. Department of Justice’s challenge to the Texas law and rejected the government’s request to reinstate a federal district court order blocking the law. The decisions brought both hope and disappointment to abortion rights advocates. This marks the third time the high court has declined to halt the controversial Texas abortion law since it went into effect Sept. 1. The law will now continue to be in effect in Texas as the abortion providers’ case makes its way through the courts. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, wrote the majority opinion in the abortion providers’ case. Most of his conservative colleagues joined that opinion, but the justices’ opinions were split over details of the case.  Many of the justices wrote their own opinions. Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the majority in part, writing that he would not have allowed the providers’ lawsuit to go forward at all. Chief Justice John Roberts filed his own opinion, too, joined by the high court’s three liberal justices, concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by her two liberal colleagues Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, also filed a separate opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part. The high court’s decision comes at a critical moment for abortion rights in the United States. On Dec. 1, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in another abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which presents the most direct challenge to Roe v. Wade since that case established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973. While Dobbs likely won’t be decided until the end of the Court’s term next June, the justices’ questions seemed to signal they are open to completely overturning Roe v. Wade. Read More: Inside Mississippi’s Last Abortion Clinic—And the Biggest Fight for Abortion Rights in a Generation The Texas law directly contradicts Roe, which said that states cannot ban abortion before fetal viability, which occurs around 24 weeks into pregnancy. In the Texas cases, the Supreme Court justices did not directly consider the constitutionality of the state’s law, known as Senate Bill 8 (SB 8). Instead, they weighed complicated procedural questions about the law’s enforcement mechanism, which had previously allowed it to avoid federal judicial review. The law imposes the country’s most stringent abortion restrictions, prohibiting nearly all abortions after roughly six weeks, before many people know they are pregnant—with no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. SB 8 bars state officials from enforcing it and instead empowers private citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion, or aids someone in obtaining one. The law also offers at least $10,000 to anyone who files a complaint. This vigilante-style enforcement mechanism has made it difficult for those challenging the law to know who to sue. But for now, the abortion providers’ suit against some licensing officials in Texas will be allowed to return to lower courts and proceed from there.  During oral arguments over the two cases on Nov. 1, many of the justices seemed more interested in allowing the providers’ lawsuit to move forward than in the questions raised by the Department of Justice. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett appeared especially open to the challengers’ arguments that the law’s novel structure should not be allowed to insulate it from judicial review.  The Court’s decision came much more quickly than usual after the Justice Department and abortion providers each filed emergency appeals asking the high court to step in while the cases were making their ways through the lower courts. Still, SB 8 has been in effect for more than three months, and it will remain that way unless another court rules against it. While the Supreme Court is allowing the abortion clinics to move forward with their suit, it also limited the paths they can take to challenge the law. The conservative majority said that the abortion providers could sue several state officials but not state court judges or clerks, which would have allowed the providers to try to block the law more directly by targeting the people who accept SB 8 enforcement lawsuits. In his opinion, Gorsuch quoted a previous decision and said allowing those officials to be sued would be “a violation of the whole scheme of our Government.” In addition to the abortion providers’ narrowed suit, the justices noted that state courts could still block the law. Sotomayor strongly disagreed with Gorsuch and her conservative colleagues’ reasoning, arguing that by rejecting the lawsuits against Texas state court officials, the high court is essentially encouraging other laws similar to the one in Texas. If the justices had said none of the challenges against the Texas law could move forward, legal scholars warned that the enforcement mechanism of private citizen lawsuits could be used to target other civil rights regardless of ideology, including gun ownership or same-sex marriage—something Sotomayor warned could still happen. “By foreclosing suit against state-court officials and the state attorney general, the Court effectively invites other States to refine S. B. 8’s model for nullifying federal rights. The Court thus betrays not only the citizens of Texas, but also our constitutional system of government,“ she wrote. Abortion is likely to remain severely restricted in Texas for some time. The risk of expensive and time consuming lawsuits has so far prevented most doctors from performing abortions that would violate the law, effectively stopping most abortion services in the state. This has meant that many Texans have traveled out of state to seek abortions over the last three months, while others have been forced to continue pregnancies they did not want, and abortion clinics have struggled to retain staff and keep their doors open under the restrictive law. Read More: Inside The Small Group of Doctors Who Risked Everything to Provide Abortions in Texas Now that the abortion providers’ lawsuit challenging SB 8 will return to federal court, their case can focus directly on whether the law is unconstitutional, and the dispute could ultimately end up back at the Supreme Court.  In the meantime, other states are already following Texas’ lead. Conservatives in at least half a dozen states have said they want to introduce legislation modeled after the Texas law, and Florida, Ohio and Arkansas have already done so. Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate are also preparing for the Supreme Court’s decision in the Dobbs case, which centers on a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. If the Court ultimately upholds that law, it would also encourage other states to revisit previous laws or pursue new bills banning abortion early in pregnancy.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg Wishes This Case Had Legalized Abortion Instead of Roe v. Wade,Olivia B. Waxman,History,"June 24, 2022 1:40 PM EDT","Editor’s Note: This story, originally published in 2018, explores Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s views on abortion rights and Struck v. Secretary of Defense—the case that the late Supreme Court Justice argued that she wished legalized abortion, instead of Roe v. Wade. On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to overturn Roe v. Wade. When the U.S. Senate confirmed President Bill Clinton’s nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court by a 96-3 vote on Aug. 3, 1993 — precisely 25 years ago Friday — that decision set Ginsburg on the path to legal (and viral) history. That process was also noteworthy for her decision to take “the unprecedented step of strongly endorsing abortion rights” in a Supreme Court confirmation hearing, as TIME reported back then. “It is essential to woman’s equality with man that she be the decisionmaker, that her choice be controlling,” Ginsburg told Senators during her four days of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. “If you impose restraints that impede her choice, you are disadvantaging her because of her sex.” Read More: What the Supreme Court’s Abortion Decision Means for Your State Today, the idea that a judge’s views on abortion rights might be determining factor for his or her suitability for a seat on the Supreme Court is unsurprising. In particular, the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade is frequently referred to as a “litmus test” for a justice. So it might come as a surprise that, though she made history by endorsing abortion rights during her confirmation hearing, Ginsburg had well-known reservations about Roe. Her views on abortion came up during her confirmation hearings in part due to a lecture she’d given earlier that year at New York University School of Law, in which she discussed the topic. At one point during her talk, she critiqued the Court for the structure of its decision in Roe v. Wade: The seven to two judgment in Roe v. Wade declared “violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment” a Texas criminal abortion statute that intolerably shackled a woman’s autonomy; the Texas law “except[ed] from criminality only a life-saving procedure on behalf of the [pregnant woman].” Suppose the Court had stopped there, rightly declaring unconstitutional the most extreme brand of law in the nation, and had not gone on, as the Court did in Roe, to fashion a regime blanketing the subject, a set of rules that displaced virtually every state law then in force. Would there have been the twenty-year controversy we have witnessed, reflected most recently in the Supreme Court’s splintered decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey? A less encompassing Roe, one that merely struck down the extreme Texas law and went no further on that day, I believe and will summarize why, might have served to reduce rather than to fuel controversy. Kate Michelman, then president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, called on the Senators to determine “whether Judge Ginsburg will protect a woman’s fundamental right to privacy, including the right to choose, under a strict scrutiny standard.” The questioning was strong enough that Ginsburg’s husband Marty Ginsburg, one of the fiercest advocates for her judicial career, got academics to call the White House and clarify that she was talking about the Court’s thinking in 1973, not the ultimate decision. When Sen. Hank Brown (R-CO) asked about her remarks during her confirmation hearing, she clarified her stance: “Abortion prohibition by the State, however, controls women and denies them full autonomy and full equality with men. That was the idea I tried to express in the lecture to which you referred.” Ginsburg said that she believed it would have been easier for the public to understand why the Constitution protected abortion rights if the matter had been framed as one of equal protection rather than privacy. And in fact, there was a specific case she had in mind as one that should have driven the national conversation, instead of letting Roe carry that weight. She told the Senators that she “first thought long and hard” about abortion rights when, as a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), she took on Struck v. Secretary of Defense, a case that was on the Supreme Court’s calendar during the same term that Roe was decided. Susan Struck was an Air Force Captain who got pregnant while serving in Vietnam and sued the Air Force after it said she would have to either get an abortion at the base hospital or leave if she wanted to have the child. She told the Air Force that she didn’t want to get an abortion; she wanted to use the vacation days that she had saved up to give birth and then put the baby up for adoption because abortion violated her Roman Catholic faith. Here’s how Ginsburg explained her approach — that sex discrimination includes discrimination because of pregnancy — to the Senate Judiciary Committee: First, that the applicable Air Force regulations — if you are pregnant you are out unless you have an abortion — violated the equal protection principle, for no man was ordered out of service because he had been the partner in a conception, no man was ordered out of service because he was about to become a father. Next, then we said that the Government is impeding, without cause, a woman’s choice whether to bear or not to bear a child. Birth was Captain Struck’s personal choice, and the interference with it was a violation of her liberty, her freedom to choose, guaranteed by the due process clause. Finally, we said the Air Force was involved in an unnecessary interference with Captain Struck’s religious belief. So all three strands were involved in Captain Struck’s case. The main emphasis was on her equality as a woman vis-à-vis a man who was equally responsible for the conception, and on her personal choice, which the Government said she could not have unless she gave up her career in the service. In that case, all three strands were involved: her equality right, her right to decide for herself whether she was going to bear the child, and her religious belief. So it was never an either/or matter, one rather than the other. It was always recognition that one thing that conspicuously distinguishes women from men is that only women become pregnant; and if you subject a woman to disadvantageous treatment on the basis of her pregnant status, which was what was happening to Captain Struck, you would be denying her equal treatment under the law… The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself. When Government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices. Struck lost in the lower courts, and the Supreme Court agreed on Oct. 24, 1972, that the case should be heard — but that never happened, because the Air Force waived Struck’s discharge and allowed her to remain in the service before that date rolled around. (As Ginsburg told law students in a summer program in July 2008, according to the 2016 edited collection of her remarks and writings My Own Words, Solicitor General Erwin Griswold had recommended that course of action for the Air Force because he thought the government could potentially lose the case.) The Roe decision came out three months later.  Ginsburg has described calling Capt. Struck in December of 1972 to see if she had been denied anything else because she was a woman, “hoping to keep the case alive.” Struck told her she would have liked to become a pilot but the Air Force didn’t let women become pilots. “We laughed, agreeing it was hopeless to attack that occupational exclusion then,” Ginsburg recalled. “Today, it would be hopeless, I believe, to endeavor to reserve flight training exclusively for men. That is one measure of what the 1970s litigation/legislation/public education efforts in the United States helped to achieve.” Despite her impassioned response on the matter of abortion, Ginsburg’s confirmation hearings are also known for setting the precedent of the so-called “Ginsburg rule,” which refers to her refusal to comment on some pending cases or cases that could come before the court. Ironically, as President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces the process Ginsburg endured 25 years ago, some experts predict that he will rely on the Ginsburg rule to get out of answering questions about his views on just the very subject on which she spoke so memorably.

Here Are the Major Cases Left for the Supreme Court to Decide,MARK SHERMAN and LINDSAY WHITEHURST / AP;Presidential immunity;Social media,U.S.;Supreme Court,"June 28, 2024 12:10 PM EDT","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has four cases still undecided. In particular, the justices are still weighing whether former President Donald Trump is immune from criminal prosecution in the election interference case against him, roughly two months after hearing arguments. Though the justices typically issue all of their rulings by the end of June, this term they are expected to continue into early July. The court heard 61 cases this term. Here's a look at two of the major undecided cases: Donald Trump is arguing that former presidents are immune from prosecutionfor official acts they took in office and that the indictment he faces on charges of election interference must be dismissed. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that former presidents can’t be sued in civil cases for what they did in office, but it has never weighed in on criminal immunity. The timing of the decision may be as important as the outcome. Trump’s trial in Washington, D.C., may not take place before the November election, even if the court rules he is not immune. Two cases involve social media laws in Texas and Florida that would limit how Facebook, TikTok, X, YouTube and other social media platforms regulate content posted by their users. While the details vary, both laws aimed to address conservative complaints that the social media companies were liberal-leaning and censored users based on their viewpoints, especially on the political right.

Inside Mississippi’s Last Abortion Clinic—and the Biggest Fight for Abortion Rights in a Generation,Abigail Abrams;Stacy Kranitz,U.S.;abortion,"November 11, 2021 7:00 AM EST","Shannon Brewer’s eyes dart to a grid of grainy images on a wide, black screen above her desk at the Jackson Women’s Health Organization (JWHO). Live footage shows a large truck creeping into the clinic’s parking lot, its side emblazoned with a pair of blue, ghostly baby feet and the words Where are our children? Brewer doesn’t recognize the driver. Her spine stiffens. As the director and de facto head of security at the last abortion clinic in the state of Mississippi, Brewer is not easily spooked. In her two decades there, she has seen bomb scares and stalking incidents, and protesters getting in fights with her staff. She keeps the number of an FBI contact amid a sea of sticky notes beside her desk. But this year, she says, everything feels more intense. More dangerous. More consequential. Her clinic, known as the Pink House for its bubble-gum-colored exterior walls, is at the epicenter of the fight over abortion access, in Mississippi and the country. On Dec. 1, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, about a Mississippi state law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the court allows the law to remain in effect, the decision will effectively hollow out Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability. “This is not gonna just affect Mississippi,” Brewer says. “It’s gonna affect women everywhere.” Five years ago, this moment was unthinkable. Even the Supreme Court’s decision to take up a case that directly challenges Roe would have been considered outlandish, legal scholars say. But the landscape has shifted rapidly. Over the past year, GOP-controlled state legislatures have passed a record-breaking 106 abortion restrictions, including a Texas statute that bans nearly all abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Conservative state and federal judges have allowed some of those laws to stand, while President Trump’s appointment of three Justices—Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett—has put Roe at risk. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization will come before the most conservative bench in decades. Anti-abortion activists are energized. In a normal year, the Pink House has its share of regular protesters, but ahead of the December hearing, “abortion tourists,” as the clinic volunteers call them, have begun showing up on the sidewalk every day. Melissa Fowler, chief program officer at the National Abortion Federation, which tracks threats to abortion clinics, says she’s heard from members “who report an escalation in anti-abortion rhetoric, criminal activities and the intensity of activities” since last year. Brewer herself has become a lightning rod. “She thinks she’s doing a good thing,” says Barbara Beavers, who was trying to discourage patients from entering the Pink House in October. “But she’s killing babies.” Coleman Boyd, a local physician who regularly protests outside the clinic with his wife and children, also calls out Brewer by name. She and her staff, he says, “have a heart to kill.” It’s in this context that Brewer, one eye still trained on the security footage, walks out the clinic’s front door and strides over to the unfamiliar truck, idling a few yards from the building. She exchanges words with the driver, then rolls her eyes and flashes a nod of assurance to her staff. The truck is part of a national anti-abortion group’s protest that evening. Nothing to worry about. Back at her desk, in front of a sign reading Queen Warrior, Brewer considers the enormity of her role in the moment—the last director of her state’s last abortion clinic, just weeks before the most momentous high-court hearing on abortion in a generation. “I’m going to appreciate the time that we have,” she says. “Once we go to court, every day that we are open and see patients and get to talk to them—it’s like we don’t know if this is the last time.” Abortion wasn’t always such a partisan subject in America. Nearly a half-century ago, when the Supreme Court decided Roe, the ruling wasn’t as polarizing as it is now, says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and an expert on the legal history of abortion. Republicans kept the issue at arm’s length, wary of anti-abortion activists who they saw as “wild children,” she says; Democrats rarely discussed it at all.  That began to change in the 1980s, Ziegler explains, when a cadre of GOP strategists seized on abortion as a way to animate the religious right and win over voters who might otherwise lean left. These activists began to test the limits of Roe, working closely with state lawmakers to pass new abortion restrictions, such as mandated waiting periods or minimum measurements for clinics’ rooms and corridors. That legal strategy was supercharged by a 1992 Supreme Court decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the Justices ruled that states could restrict abortion so long as they did not impose an “undue burden” on patients. In the three decades since, the number of laws restricting abortion multiplied. Abortion opponents framed many of these new rules as protections for women’s health, but doctors often -described them as medically unnecessary. “It’s simply that the enforcement of these regulations would make it hard to keep clinics open,” says Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute, a research center that supports abortion rights. The plan worked. In 1992, there were 2,380 abortion providers in the U.S., according to Guttmacher. In 2017, the most recent year for which statistics are available, there were 1,587. Mississippi has been the tip of the spear in this strategy. In the ’90s and 2000s, state lawmakers passed more than two dozen restrictions on abortion, each of which came with new costs, paperwork, or staffing rules that pushed abortion clinics out of business. By 2004, JWHO was the only clinic in the state left standing. Brewer says it’s still struggling to stay afloat. “There are so many hurdles,” she says. For the patients at the Jackson clinic, navigating all of these hurdles is becoming increasingly impossible. They must take time off work, scrape together money for the procedure, which cannot be covered by Medicaid or Affordable Care Act marketplace plans in most cases in Mississippi, find money to travel to the clinic or to one out of state, pay for a hotel and potentially for childcare. A 21-year-old at the clinic on a Friday in October had driven six hours from Louisiana because she wanted the first appointment she could find. She already has two kids—a one-year-old and a three-month-old—and knew she needed to get an abortion as soon as possible because she couldn’t handle a third on her own. Brewer knows this struggle firsthand. She was first hired at the Pink House in 2001 as a sterilization technician. Back then, she says, she was not attuned to the national politics of abortion. Her outlook was guided by her own experience growing up in a poor family outside Jackson, where she received no sex education in school and no one ever talked about abortion. In her mid-20s, she tried to get an abortion, but was too far along, and had a baby when she didn’t feel prepared to do so. Brewer now has six kids she loves. When she talks about “reproductive justice,” she describes it as letting people decide if, when and how they choose to have a family.  In 2010, when Brewer was promoted to clinic director, the national politics of abortion found her. Brewer credits Diane Derzis, majority owner of the Pink House, for helping to guide her. “She taught me how to speak up and how to fight,” Brewer says. “In the South, we’re limited on who’s speaking out. This is not the time to be quiet.” Derzis, who became an outspoken advocate after getting an abortion in 1975, eventually bought clinics in four Southern states. (In addition to the Pink House, she now owns two more clinics, in Virginia and Georgia.) She has been on the front lines of the battle for decades. In 1993, an anti-abortion activist in Florida killed a doctor whom Derzis had known for years. Five years later, her Birmingham, Ala., clinic was bombed, killing a guard and permanently maiming a nurse. In 2012, a new Mississippi law nearly forced the Pink House to close, but a federal court blocked it the day it was set to take effect, setting off a legal battle that lasted until 2017. So for Derzis, this strange moment—in which her clinic is the plaintiff in a Supreme Court case that could result in overturning Roe—doesn’t feel strange at all. It feels inevitable. From her vantage, the anti-abortion movement’s long-term objective was always to capture politics at every level, from local city councils to state legislatures to Congress and the presidency, in order to reshape the court and relitigate Roe. Under Trump, who campaigned on the promise to appoint judges who would overturn Roe, Republican state legislators turned to passing a raft of laws designed to get the justices to finish the job. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, recognized the work that state lawmakers have done in passing anti-abortion bills to get the Mississippi case before the Supreme Court. “This is a landmark opportunity” for the anti-abortion movement, she said last spring. “This has been a campaign they have waged over 45 years,” Derzis says. With Trump, “they got their Supreme Court Justices.” It was game time. Over nearly 50 years, the Supreme Court has heard more than two dozen cases touching on abortion. (Earlier this month, it considered an enforcement mechanism embedded in the Texas abortion law.) But the Mississippi case that will come before the court on Dec. 1 is different by an order of magnitude. This one is not “biting around the edges” of abortion access, says Ziegler. It’s “going for the jugular.” Mississippi has explicitly asked the court to overturn Roe. It is, of course, impossible to predict how the court will rule. With six conservatives on the bench, a majority could well choose to overturn the nearly 50-year-old precedent. Such a decision would be audacious, but not unheard of. The court has reversed precedent dozens of times in the nation’s history. If it happens again, the fallout for people seeking abortions would be immediate. Twelve states, including Mississippi, have what are known as “trigger laws” that ban nearly all abortions immediately or shortly following such a court decision. Another nine states have already written strict restrictions that they could move quickly to implement. But legal scholars say it’s much more likely that the court would rule in a way that stops short of technically overturning Roe—while weakening the constitutional right to abortion so substantially that it’s largely hollow. For example, the Justices could hold that the “viability standard”—the idea, embedded in Roe, that states cannot restrict abortion before a fetus can survive outside the womb—is no longer central to the precedent. Such a decision, while formally leaving Roe in place, would render it nearly unrecognizable. If the court allows states to ban abortion before viability, there are dozens of other abortion restrictions currently blocked or being challenged in lower courts that could be reconsidered too. The Supreme Court could also decide that Mississippi’s law is constitutional because it allows people to access abortion prior to 15 weeks, and therefore does not present an “undue burden,” as defined by Casey. A decision like that would undermine the viability standard and redefine the court’s previous definition of “undue burden.” Whatever the court decides, legal experts say the justices may be likely to remand the case back to lower courts, asking federal judges to reconsider the law under a newly modified interpretation of Roe. Abortion-rights advocates say any ruling that does not explicitly find the Mississippi law unconstitutional amounts to a distinction without a difference. “The law has been absolutely clear for 50 years that bans on abortion before viability are unconstitutional,” says Julie Rikelman, the litigation director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, who will represent JWHO before the Supreme Court. And any decision that creates more legal uncertainty is bad for abortion access, as it leaves clinics—most of which are already operating on a shoestring—to fight costly legal battles or temporarily shut down while judges deliberate.  In recent weeks, as the Supreme Court hearing has drawn nearer, Brewer and Derzis have huddled to discuss contingency plans. Although only 10 to 15 of the roughly 300 patients at JWHO each month request an abortion after the 15-week mark, Brewer says that if the high court allows this law to stand, she fears what laws Mississippi will pass next. In the meantime, Brewer is focused on the fight. The day after we spoke was a Saturday, but she planned to be at the clinic bright and early—as she always is. She’s doing it for the next generation, she says, in hopes they take up the mantle for the ones who come next. “That’s kind of how it goes,” she says, turning her eyes briefly away from the security screen. “You have to have people to continue to fight.” —With reporting by Mariah Espada/Washington and Leslie Dickstein/New York Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6116072/mississippi-abortion-supreme-court-jackson-womens-health/
Supreme Court Opinions Don’t Have to Be the End of the Fight for Justice,Robert L. Tsai / Made by History,;History;Made by History,"June 28, 2024 10:00 AM EDT","As another season of last-minute U.S. Supreme Court opinions are handed down, Americans are faced with a perennial question: how much compliance is obligatory and how much room is there to disagree? It’s critical to keep in mind that the Supreme Court never has the last word, the people do. And thanks to structural concepts like federalism, differences of opinion on matters of fundamental importance such as equality are not only encouraged but essential to popular self-government. One thing is certain: jurisdictions can be more committed to equality than the justices themselves, a valuable fact to remember as the court’s priorities and ideological orientation are increasingly out of step with those of many citizens.  Consider one of the bleaker moments in court history: the 1987 case of McCleskey v. Kemp. In the early 1980s, a study revealed wide racial disparities in Georgia’s administration of the death penalty—including that people charged with killing white people were 4.3 times more likely to receive a death sentence than those charged with killing Black people. Lawyers introduced this evidence in the case of Warren McCleskey, a Black man convicted of killing a white police officer, to try to persuade the Justices that Georgia was denying Black citizens equal protection under the law. Read More: The Supreme Court Weighs Whether South Carolina Targeted Black Voters in Redistricting Instead, the Justices ruled 5-4 against McCleskey, a ruling that tried to insulate the criminal justice system nationwide from structural inequality lawsuits. To most observers, this looked like a resounding defeat for the cause of racial justice. In fact, Justice Lewis Powell told his colleagues privately that they had to find a way to avoid “statistical jurisprudence” that encouraged others to cast doubt on other aspects of the justice system—causing Justice William Brennan to accuse his colleagues of exhibiting “fear of too much justice.” Thus, despite the study demonstrating disturbing racial disparities in the administration of the death penalty, the court ruled that additional evidence of bias was needed to set aside a person’s conviction. McCleskey couldn’t satisfy this high standard and was ultimately executed. Justice Powell protected the prerogative of prosecutors because he believed that racial disparities were inevitable in any system that entailed discretion. In the wake of McCleskey, advocates could have acquiesced to the court’s exceedingly narrow concept of equality, one that refused to see structural inequality, but recognized only isolated acts of individual wrongdoing. Instead, realizing the Supreme Court was not going to protect their clients from exposure to unequal justice, some advocates doubled down on a more robust notion of racial equality. They ramped up their efforts to document structural inequality by demanding access to prosecutor’s files and shamed prosecutors and judges for eliminating people of color from jury pools. The Southern Center for Human Rights was at the center of this next stage of the struggle for racial justice. Bryan Stevenson, who later founded Equal Justice Initiative, was then a young staff attorney at the Southern Center. Stevenson was “heartbroken” about McCleskey and couldn’t believe that the same institution that had decided Brown v. Board of Education had just said that racism was inevitable in the legal system. But after talking to Executive Director Stephen Bright, Stevenson and the rest of the staff formulated a plan. Read More: The Supreme Court’s Decision on Affirmative Action Must Not Be the Final Word Bright agreed that McCleskey was “an everlasting blight on the Supreme Court” and akin to Plessy v. Ferguson by tolerating one kind of justice for white people and another for Black people. He advised his staff to turn a ruling that created a shield for prosecutors into a sword for the defense. They began filing so-called “McCleskey motions,” demanding opportunities to probe whether judges and prosecutors were capable of treating defendants fairly, insisting upon hearings to document forms of societal and official racism, and asking for access to other case files to look for patterns of bias against poor people and racial minorities. The strategy worked. In the 1987 retrial of George Dungee, a Black man charged in the slaying of a white family in Georgia, the Southern Center insisted that a judge recuse himself because he had used the N-word in open court when referring to a defendant, had supported a segregationist for governor, and was complicit in prosecutorial efforts to remove Black jurors. Accused of being part of a local “system of white dominance,” the judge was forced to step aside. When prosecutors saw that their judicial ally was no longer on the case, they offered Dungee a plea deal that ensured a life sentence. The same thing happened in the retrial of Willie Gamble: Southern Center lawyers called the judge “a rubber stamp racist,” and shortly after he recused, the state folded and took the death penalty off the table.   In the 1988 case, Berryhill v. Zant, the Southern Center successfully challenged a policy of allowing only “upright and intelligent” citizens onto master jury lists because it proved highly subjective and allowed local officials to disqualify women disproportionately. And during the retrial of William Anthony Brooks, a Black man accused of killing a white woman, the Center argued that Brooks could not get a fair trial because two of his prosecutors, who later became judges, had rigged an all-white jury and then made “lynch mob-like arguments.” They demanded a judge from another circuit. Instead of giving up on statistical evidence to prove racial discrimination, the Center continued to develop empirical evidence of structural inequality in two ways: first, by proving that particular counties still grossly underrepresented women and racial minorities in jury pools; and second, by showing how specific prosecutors—and sometimes an entire prosecutor’s office—manufactured all-white juries. The biggest payoff from this strategy came in 1991, when the Eleventh Circuit ruled in Horton v. Zant that a prosecutor had systematically used peremptory strikes to eliminate Black jurors from his cases, particularly in cases involving a Black person charged with killing a white person. The painstaking work of SCHR staff to document the state’s unequal valuation of Black and white lives over time convinced the court to order a new trial for Horton. In his ruling, Judge Frank Johnson wrote emphatically: “a prosecutor has a duty to do justice.” With the Horton decision, racial justice advocates finally had a legal victory that showed how prosecutors exploited the system of unequal justice. Importantly, the Southern Center never accepted the Supreme Court’s assumption that racial disparities were caused by bad apples, but insisted that an overlapping set of practices led to injustice. Beyond litigation, some have engaged in legislative defiance of the Supreme Court by seizing on stories of racial injustice and persuading elected officials to openly repudiate McCleskey. On these occasions, legislators have rejected Justice Powell’s advice to become comfortable with the inevitability of racism and insisted that ignoring racial disparities exacerbates a crisis of faith in the rule of law. A few states have enacted racial justice acts, none more far-reaching than one passed in California. Enacted during the pandemic, the California Racial Justice Act (CRJA) authorizes individuals to challenge their convictions based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. Proponents of this civil rights law described it as a “countermeasure to address a widely condemned 1987 legal precedent”—namely, McCleskey. We “simply cannot accept the stark reality that race pervades our system of justice,” lawmakers indicated, because “discrimination undermines public confidence in the fairness of the state’s system of justice.” Renouncing McCleskey for the people of California, the law empowers a person to introduce statistical evidence that might show “that the prosecution more frequently sought or obtained convictions … against people who share the defendant’s race, ethnicity, or national origin.” The law goes further than the Supreme Court by making it easier to show that a prosecutor used race-based peremptory strikes. Could the Supreme Court reverse itself and overrule McCleskey some day? Perhaps, but persuading the Justices that they made a grievous error would be easier with additions to the institution who are open to criminal justice reform. It will also take incremental gains to expand the people’s commitment to racial equality in the several states so that Justices sense that their decisions represent an outlier—at that point, they may feel pressure to adjust their thinking and join the rest of the political community.

9 Landmark Supreme Court Cases That Shaped LGBTQ Rights in America,"Tara Law;One, Inc. v. Olesen (1958);Baker v. Nelson (1972);Bowers v. Hardwick (1986);Romer v. Evans (1996);Boy Scouts of America v. Dale (1996);Lawrence v. Texas (2003);United States v. Windsor (2013);Obergefell v Hodges (2015);Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018)",History;Supreme Court,"October 8, 2019 6:54 PM EDT","The United States has witnessed a remarkable shift in LGBTQ rights and visibility in the 50 years since the Stonewall uprising — and in just the last few years, LGBTQ people have won the right to marry, have hit a record high in representation on television and have seen the first openly gay major presidential candidate begin his campaign. But the path of LGBTQ rights in America has not been a simple one. And just as advocates fought their battle American culture, they also did so in the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the last half a century, the court first denied and then affirmed that LGBTQ people have the right to consensual sex, and then the right to marry whom they choose. This fall, the Supreme Court will have another opportunity to make another statement about LGBTQ rights. In two cases heard Tuesday, the Court is set to consider whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — a federal civil rights law that blocks discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sex — covers LGBTQ people. The first case will consider the dismissals of a county government employee and a skydiving instructor, who were fired for being gay. The second case will consider the case of a funeral home director, who was fired after coming out as transgender. The cases come as the court appears to be moving in a conservative direction, following the appointments in 2017 and 2018 of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, respectively. The Trump administration has already made clear where it stands in these cases; the Department of Justice argued in a pair of amicus briefs that discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation should not be included under Title VII. As of Oct. 8, the fate of the cases appeared to be uncertain. After hearing arguments for the cases, Gorsuch said that there are strong arguments supporting the position of LGBTQ workers, but said that he was concerned about the “massive social upheaval” that could following ruling in their favor. Regardless of how the justices rule in the cases, the court’s decisions would not be the first time that the Supreme Court made major decisions impacting LGBTQ people’s civil rights in the United States. Below are nine of the most important cases. One of the first Supreme Court cases to consider LGBTQ rights concerned freedom of speech. In 1953, a publisher associated with the Los Angeles chapter of the Mattachine Society, one of the country’s first “homophile” groups, released something unique for its time: ONE: The Homosexual Magazine. The magazine, which is considered by One Archives Foundation to be America’s first widely-distributed magazine for gay readers, included articles, editorials, short stories and other content. Not long after publication began, its August and October editions were seized by the Los Angeles postal authorities. Authorities argued that the publication violated obscenity laws. In its decision, the Supreme Court tossed out a lower court’s ruling, and established that material aimed at a gay audience was not inherently obscene. The decision validated that people had the right to publish LGBTQ media. The Supreme Court considered the issue of marriage equality for the first time in 1972. The case was sparked when a young Minneapolis couple, Richard John Baker and James Michael McConnell, wanted to get married. The couple was reportedly so determined that Baker enrolled in law school to figure out a way how the two could legally wed, according to the New York Times. However, the couple’s effort seemed to fail when the Supreme Court decided to dismiss the case “for want of a substantial federal question.” The case did not end up changing much for people in Baker and McConnell’s situation.  Ultimately, the couple got married anyway by obtaining a marriage license in a different Minnesota county in 1971. Baker changed his name to Pat Lyn McConnell to obtain the certificate. The pastor who married them, Roger Lynn, told the Times in 2015 that he considers them to be “one of my more successful marriages” because they were still happy and love each other. A Minnesota judge ruled that the couple’s marriage is valid in 2018. The LGBTQ rights movement was dealt a major blow when the court decided to uphold a Georgia sodomy law in 1986. The subject of the case, Michael Hardwick, had been caught by a Georgia police officer in 1982 having oral sex with another man. The Supreme Court held in a 5-4 ruling, with an opinion by Justice Byron White, that the 14th Amendment’s promise of due process doesn’t prevent states from criminalizing private, consensual sex between people of the same sex. “Against a background in which many states have criminalized sodomy and still do,” White said in the opinion, “to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’ is, at best, facetious.” Karen Loewy, senior counsel Lambda Legal, which fights for LGBTQ legal rights, tells TIME that Court made a special effort to make clear that the case applied to LGBTQ people, despite the fact that the law didn’t refer to the genders of the people involved. “The court went out of its way to make clear that gay people could be criminalized under these provisions, and there was nothing wrong with that. The court actually turned it into an inquiry about same-sex intimacy where the statute wasn’t even that specific,” Loewy said. “It really labeled LGBTQ people as criminals in every sense. Employers would fire people and say, well… it has nothing to do with who you are. It has to do with the fact that you’re a criminal.” Robin Maril, associate legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, notes that the conversation about LGBTQ people during that period was shaped by the AIDS epidemic. Many people who feared the then-mysterious disease were “hyper-focused” on the idea that gay men were promiscuous and saw HIV-positive people as “sort of getting what they deserved,” says Maril. “I think AIDs brought out the worst in America.” Hardwick died from complications from AIDS in 1991, and one of his attorneys, Kathleen Wilde said that he had been “very bitter” about the case’s outcome, according to the New York Times. In this decision, the Supreme Court ruled that laws couldn’t single out LGBTQ people to take away their rights. The case revolved around an amendment to a Colorado law, which banned cities from passing anti-discrimination laws that would protect gay and bisexual people. In a 6-3 decision, Court ruled that the law didn’t adhere to the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, because of how it singled out a certain group. “Even if, as the state contends, homosexuals can find protection in laws and policies of general application,” Justice Anthony Kennedy said in the majority opinion, “[the Colorado law] goes well beyond merely depriving them of special rights. It imposes a broad disability upon those persons alone, forbidding them, but no others, to seek specific legal protection.” As Loewy explains, “In Romer, the Supreme Court recognized for the first time that carving LGBTQ people out of protections that everybody else could have access to violated equal protection.” The same year the court found that laws couldn’t single out LGBTQ people, the Supreme Court also considered whether a private organization could single them out with specific rules — and found in favor of that organization. In 1990, the Boy Scouts of America decided to expel James Dale, an assistant scoutmaster and Eagle Scout, after he was identified in a newspaper as a leader of Rutgers University’s Lesbian/Gay Alliance. The New Jersey Supreme Court initially found for Dale on the grounds that the Scouts had violated the state’s anti-discrimination law, but that decision was overruled in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court. The Court found that forcing the Scouts to readmit Dale would violate their First Amendment right to freedom of association. “The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values embodied in the Scout Oath and Law, particularly those represented by the terms ‘morally straight’ and ‘clean,’ and that the organization does not want to promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior. The Court gives deference to the Boy Scouts’ assertions regarding the nature of its expression,” Justice William Rehnquist said in the Court’s opinion. “It wasn’t until 2013 that the group decided to end its ban on gay children as members, but still continued its ban on gay adult leaders,” Dale wrote in a 2015 opinion piece in TIME. “This initiative was wrong in many ways: It was great that they weren’t excluding young members, but it was wrong to tell someone that you can be gay when you’re a child, but you’re immoral as an adult. That’s a horrifyingly destructive and damaging thing to say to anyone, especially a young person.” The Court ultimately eliminated sodomy laws in 2003, overruling Bowers v. Hardwick with a vote of 6-3. Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion, saying that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment gave the petitioners “the full right to engage in private conduct without government intervention… The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the individual’s personal and private life.” Loewy notes that her organization fought for this decision, and helped to popularize the idea that “public ideas about morality cannot justify infringing people’s constitutional rights.” Loewy says that this was an essential case because “the court really recognized that LGBTQ people are entitled to constitutional protections for intimate conduct. For private, consensual, intimate conduct.” This case was one of the major precursors to marriage equality. The Court decided to eliminate the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) of 1996 that defined marriage as a “legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.” The case considered the situation of Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer, who were married in Canada before moving to New York, a state that recognized their marriage. After Spyer passed away, Windsor’s attempted to claim a tax exemption for surviving spouses — only to be blocked by DOMA. In a 5-4 vote, Supreme Court ruled that DOMA violates due process and equal protection principles, and ordered the United States to refund Windsor’s taxes. “DOMA’s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency,” said Justice Kennedy in the opinion. A group of 14 same-sex couples and two men whose partners were deceased joined together and won one of the LGBTQ rights movement’s biggest victories: marriage. In a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court found for the petitioners, who argued that state officials violated the 14th amendment’s equal protection clause by prohibiting them from marrying or not recognizing marriages performed in other states. “It is demeaning to lock same-sex couples out of a central institution of the Nation’s society, for they too may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage,” Justice Kennedy said in the Court’s opinion. The court also extended them the benefits guaranteed to opposite-sex married couples. Maril argues that while she personally values the emotional aspect of matrimony, getting married in the United States is considered to be a legal status. “At the end of the day, it’s social security benefits, it’s survivor benefits. It’s healthcare. It’s super unromantic,” Maril says. Loewy argues that this decision also had a profound cultural impact, because it gave LGBTQ people a “common language” with straight people. Although by 2018 LGBTQ people could marry, the Supreme Court found that a baker was not required to make wedding cakes for same-sex marriages. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court found for Colorado baker Jack Phillips, who had refused to make a gay couple a wedding cake on religious grounds. Phillips argued that baking cakes requires his “artistic skills” and being forced to bake the cake would have infringed upon his freedom of speech and his rights to practice his religion. However, the Court’s argument in favor of Phillips hinged upon the state’s “impermissible hostility toward his sincere religious beliefs.,” noting that a commissioner compared Phillips’ religious beliefs to defending slavery or the Holocaust. “The government cannot pass judgment upon or presuppose the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices. The state’s interest could have been weighed against Phillips’ sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the requisite religious neutrality,” Justice Kennedy said in the opinion.

What the Supreme Court’s Immunity Decision Means for Trump’s Criminal Cases,Nik Popli;The Jack Smith election interference case;The other cases,Politics;Supreme Court,"July 2, 2024 3:55 PM EDT","The Supreme Court on Monday provided former President Donald Trump with significant legal protection against prosecution for actions taken during his tenure in the Oval Office. In a ruling split along ideological lines, the Justices held that Presidents enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts but remain susceptible to charges for unofficial conduct—a decision that has profound implications for Trump's pending criminal cases, particularly those stemming from his efforts to challenge the 2020 election results. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, said that a President “may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts.” In doing so, the Supreme Court left it up to the lower court to review which conduct is protected and immune from prosecution. Read More: Supreme Court Rules Trump and Former Presidents Have Some Immunity for Official Acts Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a fiery dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, criticized the majority's stance, arguing that it elevates the President above the law and undermines accountability. While the case is a landmark ruling on the powers of the American presidency, it will have immediate effects for Trump, the first former President in history to be indicted. At issue in the Supreme Court case was the charges brought by the Justice Department over Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, but he’s also facing two other criminal cases in Florida and Georgia, and he’s already been convicted in one in New York.  Here’s what to know about the next steps in Trump’s election interference case and how the ruling may affect all of the charges he faces. Instead of dismissing the federal election interference case, the Supreme Court sent certain elements of the indictment back to a lower court to review which conduct is protected and immune from prosecution. The Supreme Court offered some specific guidance on the conduct at issue in the case, which was brought by special counsel Jack Smith. Roberts wrote for the conservative majority that Trump is “absolutely immune” from prosecution for his alleged conduct relating to conversations with Justice Department officials about launching investigations into election fraud and potential fraudulent slates of electors. But the Supreme Court didn’t offer answers on other conduct alleged in Smith’s indictment, writing that further proceedings at the lower court level are needed to determine whether Trump can be prosecuted for his alleged attempt to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject the Electoral College vote, and his interactions with state officials, private people, and voters about election fraud and the violence on Jan. 6. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing that case and was appointed by former President Barack Obama, will be tasked with sifting through the allegations in the indictment to separate Trump’s official acts as President from private ones, when he was acting as a presidential candidate. Those acts include conversations Trump had with people outside the federal government, including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who famously rejected Trump’s pressure to “find” enough votes to flip the state’s 2020 vote. Norm Eisen, a senior fellow in governance studies at The Brookings Institution and former counsel to the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee during Trump’s first impeachment, says that we may see an evidentiary hearing, or a “mini trial,” take place this summer or fall that allows Chutkan to hear witness testimony and receive other relevant evidence.  Sending these questions back to a lower court all but guarantees that the trial in this case will be delayed until after voters decide in November whether to return Trump to the White House. And if Trump wins the election and returns to the White House, he could order the Justice Department to drop its case against him. Trump has claimed that the Supreme Court’s ruling should put an end to all four of his criminal cases, and his lawyers will likely use the ruling to argue that the cases should be dismissed because they involved official conduct Trump undertook as President. The ruling may already have affected the sentencing timeline in Trump’s recent state criminal conviction in New York on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump had been scheduled for criminal sentencing in that case on July 11, but the date was pushed to Sept. 18 so both sides can present arguments about how the Supreme Court ruling could influence the New York case.  Legal experts are skeptical that the conviction will be set aside because of the Supreme Court’s ruling. “I don’t see paying off a porn star and falsifying business records as anything other than personal capacity,” says Claire Finkelstein, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Read More: What Happens Next Now That Trump Has Been Convicted? Your Questions, Answered The high court’s ruling could impact Trump’s state election-interference trial in Georgia led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who charged Trump and 14 of his allies in a sprawling racketeering indictment for allegedly attempting to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. The indictment claims that Trump pressured state officials to tamper with vote counts and organized a fake slate of pro-Trump electors. Trump’s lawyers have asserted presidential immunity in that case, though there has been no ruling from Judge Scott McAfee yet and an appeals court recently halted that case while it reviews Willis’ involvement. (Any decision by McAfee on presidential immunity would likely be appealed.) The indictment in that case holds that Trump had conversations with people outside the federal government, including Raffensperger—alleged conduct also in Smith’s indictment. Since the Supreme Court’s ruling allows the federal district court overseeing the Smith case to determine whether or not that act—and other similar conduct in the indictment—qualifies as official or unofficial, the ruling could have bearing on the proceedings in Georgia, too. It’s less clear whether the Supreme Court’s ruling would affect Trump’s federal prosecution in Florida for allegedly retaining classified documents after leaving the White House and obstructing the government’s efforts to retrieve them, Finkelstein says. Trump has argued that the charges in this case should also be thrown out on the grounds that he is entitled to sweeping presidential immunity. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, is yet to rule on that claim, but the special counsel’s team is likely to argue that the conduct in the indictment—illegally retaining classified information—occurred after Trump left office and therefore is not entitled to immunity, Finkelstein says.

"Supreme Court Weakens Federal Regulators, Overturning Decades-Old Chevron Decision",MARK SHERMAN / AP,Politics;Supreme Court,"June 28, 2024 11:11 AM EDT","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday upended a 40-year-old decision that made it easier for the federal government to regulate the environment, public health, workplace safety and consumer protections, delivering a far-reaching and potentially lucrative victory to business interests. The court's six conservative justices overturned the 1984 decision colloquially known as Chevron, long a target of conservatives. The liberal justices were in dissent. Billions of dollars are potentially at stake in challenges that could be spawned by the high court’s ruling. The Biden administration’s top Supreme Court lawyer had warned such a move would be an “unwarranted shock to the legal system.” The heart of the Chevron decision says federal agencies should be allowed to fill in the details when laws aren't crystal clear. Opponents of the decision argued that it gave power that should be wielded by judges to experts who work for the government. “Courts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. Roberts wrote that the decision does not call into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron decision. But in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the assurance rings hollow. “The majority is sanguine; I am not so much,” she wrote. The court ruled in cases brought by Atlantic herring fishermen in New Jersey and Rhode Island who challenged a fee requirement. Lower courts used the Chevron decision to uphold a 2020 National Marine Fisheries Service rule that herring fishermen pay for government-mandated observers who track their fish intake. Conservative and business interests strongly backed the fishermen’s appeals, betting that a court that was remade during Republican Donald Trump’s presidency would strike another blow at the regulatory state. The court’s conservative majority has previously reined in environmental regulations and stopped the Democratic Biden administration's initiatives on COVID-19 vaccines and student loan forgiveness. The justices hadn’t invoked Chevron since 2016, but lower courts had continued to do so. Forty years ago, the Supreme Court ruled 6-0, with three justices recused, that judges should play a limited, deferential role when evaluating the actions of agency experts in a case brought by environmental groups to challenge a Reagan administration effort to ease regulation of power plants and factories. “Judges are not experts in the field, and are not part of either political branch of government,” Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in 1984, explaining why they should play a limited role. But the current high court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has been increasingly skeptical of the powers of federal agencies. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas all had questioned the Chevron decision. They were in Friday's majority, along with Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor joined Kagan in dissent. Opponents of the Chevron doctrine argue that judges apply it too often to rubber-stamp decisions made by government bureaucrats. Judges must exercise their own authority and judgment to say what the law is, they argued to the Supreme Court. Defending the rulings that upheld the fees, President Joe Biden's administration said that overturning the Chevron decision would produce a “convulsive shock” to the legal system. Environmental, health advocacy groups, civil rights organizations, organized labor and Democrats on the national and state level had urged the court to leave the Chevron decision in place. ""The Supreme Court is pushing the nation into uncharted waters as it seizes it seizes power from our elected branches of government to advance its deregulatory agenda,” Sambhav Sankar, a lawyer with the environmental group Earthjustice, said after the ruling. “The conservative justices are aggressively reshaping the foundations of our government so that the President and Congress have less power to protect the public, and corporations have more power to challenge regulations in search of profits. This ruling threatens the legitimacy of hundreds of regulations that keep us safe, protect our homes and environment, and create a level playing field for businesses to compete on.” Gun, e-cigarette, farm, timber and home-building groups were among the business groups supporting the fishermen. Conservative interests that also intervened in recent high court cases limiting regulation of air and water pollution backed the fishermen as well. The fisherman sued to contest the 2020 regulation that would have authorized a fee that could have topped $700 a day, though no one ever had to pay it. In separate lawsuits in New Jersey and Rhode Island, the fishermen argued that Congress never gave federal regulators authority to require the fisherman to pay for monitors. They lost in the lower courts, which relied on the Chevron decision to sustain the regulation. The justices heard two cases on the same issue because Jackson was recused from the New Jersey case. She took part in it at an earlier stage when she was an appeals court judge. The full court participated in the case from Rhode Island.

Neil Gorsuch Is Already Acting Like He’s Been on the Supreme Court for Years,Tessa Berenson Rogers,Politics;Supreme Court,"September 29, 2017 9:31 AM EDT","In its new term beginning October 2, the Supreme Court will consider many pressing questions. Can a baker refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding? Can states redraw districts to help a political party? And, does Justice Neil Gorsuch talk too much? Gorsuch has proven himself to be a forceful and dynamic presence on the bench, a jurist who cements the Court’s conservative tilt, infuriates liberals—not least because of the circumstances by which he got there—and breaks custom with his uncommon assertiveness. Considering Gorsuch in his robes is to grapple with what legacy President Trump will leave on the highest court, and he is inciting unusually strong reactions from both Republicans who love what they see, and Democrats who hate it. It didn’t take long for the newest member to make his presence known on the Court. Gorsuch, a conservative judge nominated by President Trump and confirmed in April, had been sitting in his first oral argument last spring for just 10 minutes before he asked his first question. Over the next hour, he asked 21 more, posing more questions at his first oral argument than any of his eight colleagues did at theirs. He blew past Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s previous record of 15 questions at her first oral argument, according to Adam Feldman, who runs a blog tracking Supreme Court data. That’s rare for a freshman justice. By the Court’s unwritten rules, new members are often seen more they are heard. “I think he has ruffled some feathers on the Court,” Garrett Epps, a professor at University of Baltimore School of Law, says of the newest justice. In his first month, Gorsuch wrote as many separate opinions as Justice Elena Kagan, the last justice to join the Court, wrote in her first two terms. In one, a 7-2 decision about statutory interpretation in which he and Justice Clarence Thomas were the only dissenters, Gorsuch’s pointed writing style was on full display. “If a statute needs repair, there’s a constitutionally prescribed way to do it,” he chided. “It’s called legislation.” In a religious liberty case, Gorsuch took on conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion. In his concurrence, which argues for a broader reading of religious liberty, Gorsuch wrote that, “respectfully, [he] harbor[s] doubts” about an aspect of the chief’s opinion. “He has not been shy,” says John Malcolm, vice president for the Institute for Constitutional Government at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “Sometimes you might expect a new justice to sit back for a while before wading in on significant issues, certainly in writing dissents and concurrences,” Malcolm adds. “But [Gorsuch] has shown none of that. He’s acting as if he’s been sitting on the high court for years.” Gorsuch is drawing criticism off the bench as well. Some court-watchers on the Left have complained about his appearances outside the stately halls of the Supreme Court. In September, the justice appeared with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at an event in Kentucky, McConnell’s home state. The following week, Gorsuch gave a speech at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., the symbolic focal point of the president’s business entanglements. Progressive activists held a protest outside the hotel during his remarks. Justices often give speeches to liberal or conservative groups, but Democrats are upset by the optics of Gorsuch’s recent appearances. “Generally, Supreme Court justices, whether appointed by Democrats or Republicans, do their best to avoid any outward support for an administration,” says Nan Aron, president of liberal judicial advocacy group Alliance for Justice, who argues Gorsuch has “erased any possibility that he is anything other than a partisan.” The vastly different reviews on the new justice from conservative and liberal groups are evidence of the nasty political battle that led to him taking the seat in the first place. Gorsuch, who spent a decade as a judge on the Tenth Circuit in Colorado, occupies a spot on the court that sat vacant for more than a year after Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016. President Barack Obama nominated moderate liberal Judge Merrick Garland to fill the seat. But instead of confirming a nominee during Obama’s final year in office, congressional Republicans refused to consider the nomination, stalling the process until Trump was inaugurated, and then quickly confirming Gorsuch over cries from Democrats. “He takes the seat under a cloud for a lot of people,” says Epps. “Not because they personally dislike him, but because of the circumstances under which he got it.” At just 50 years old, Gorsuch looks poised to cement a conservative majority on the Court for a generation. More immediately, he’ll affect the outcome of many of the significant cases the Court will hear this term. Gorsuch, whose judicial philosophy revolves around interpreting the text of the law as written, has already signaled that he’s sympathetic to religious liberty claims, which could put him on the side of the baker who refused to make a cake for a gay wedding in the case Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. And he recently was a deciding vote blocking a Texas court’s ruling that new districts drawn by the state legislature had to be redone, which may provide a clue to his thinking on the partisan gerrymandering case Gill v. Whitford, which will be argued before the court on Oct 3. So far, Gorsuch has proven to be most in the mold of Justice Thomas, agreeing with the conservative stalwart in each of the 15 cases he heard last term. That plants Gorsuch firmly to the right of his old boss, swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he clerked in the 1990s. Gorsuch has sided with Kennedy 73% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. But while he has made a bold entrance to his new job, Gorsuch’s style on the bench may simply make him a natural heir to the voluble jurist he replaced. “From the get-go, Justice Scalia changed the tenor of the court dramatically because he was such an avid question–asker,” says Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. “I know that some justices viewed that a little askance, like where’s this little upstart coming from?” “That doesn’t make [Gorsuch] unique,” she continues. “I think that’s always how the old guard reacts.” Write to Tessa Berenson Rogers at tessa.Rogers@time.com",https://time.com/4961416/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-term-controversy/
The Supreme Court Rejects an Appeal Over Bans on Conversion Therapy for LGBTQ+ Children,Associated Press,U.S.;Supreme Court,"December 11, 2023 11:16 AM EST","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday refused to take up a case about whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children. Over the dissent of three conservative justices, the court turned away an appeal from Washington, where the law has been upheld. An appellate panel struck down local bans in Florida as an unconstitutional restriction on counselors' speech. The high court often steps in when appellate courts disagree, and in separate opinions Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said that standard was easily met in the controversy over conversion therapy bans. Thomas wrote that his colleague should have taken up the Washington case because “licensed counselors cannot voice anything other than the state-approved opinion on minors with gender dysphoria without facing punishment.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh also voted to hear the case. It takes four of the nine justices to set a case for arguments. The court's decision to avoid the case from Washington comes as efforts to limit the rights of LGBTQ+ kids have spread across the country. About half the states prohibit the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling. A family counselor in Washington, Brian Tingley, sued over a 2018 state law that threatens therapists who engage in conversion therapy with a loss of their license. Tingley claims the law violates his speech rights. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld it in a split decision. The Supreme Court had previously turned away several challenges to state bans, but those cases reached the court before a 5-4 decision in 2018 in which the justices ruled that California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion. Since the 2018 ruling, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has voided the local Florida bans.

Supreme Court Unanimously Strikes Down Challenge to Abortion Drug Mifepristone,Nik Popli,Politics;abortion,"June 13, 2024 1:59 PM EDT","The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously rejected a challenge to curtail access to the commonly-used abortion pill mifepristone, with the Justices finding that a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations had no legal basis to challenge the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the medication. As a result, the lawsuit has been dismissed and the abortion pill can remain widely available. ""Because plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone, plaintiffs are unregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA’s regulation of others,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the unanimous decision. The case centered on the accessibility of mifepristone, the only drug approved specifically for terminating pregnancies, and whether the government applied a lawful review process of the drug when it first came out. The Supreme Court decided to hear the case after a lower court in 2023 revoked the FDA’s 23-year-old approval of mifepristone, a move that would restrict how the pill is delivered and distributed. The restrictions, if allowed to go into effect, included cutting off access to the pill through the mail, barring telemedicine prescriptions, and reinstating a seven-week limit on its use—even in states where abortion remains legal. Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California at Davis with an expertise in abortion, described the opinion as a “very narrow textbook ruling on standing” that “doesn’t tell you much beyond the narrow question in the case.” “I'm sure the abortion rights movement is happy that access to mifepristone is unchanged today,” she tells TIME. “At the same time, this ruling doesn't say anything about any of the substantive arguments made against mifepristone. All of the arguments are just as alive today as they were yesterday, if other plaintiffs can raise them.” Medication abortion has become an increasingly common and safe method for terminating pregnancies; more than five million women in the U.S. have used mifepristone for abortions since its approval, and six in 10 abortions last year were performed through medication, up from 53% in 2020, research published in March 2024 from the Guttmacher Institute shows. Although dozens of countries have approved mifepristone for use, including the U.S., its safety has come under scrutiny after the fall of Roe v. Wade. The plaintiffs in the case—led by a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations—argued that the FDA did not adequately study the safety risks of the drug before approving it for sale in 2000, claiming that doctors have had to treat patients who suffered from complications from mifepristone. The Justices, however, said that the doctors did not suffer the type of direct harm that would give them legal grounds to bring the lawsuit. The FDA has also countered safety concerns about mifepristone, pointing to data documenting the drug’s efficacy and safety, ​​terminating pregnancies successfully  99.6% of the time with a complication rate lower than Tylenol. “The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to elective abortion and to FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,” Kavanaugh wrote in the ruling. But “those kinds of objections alone do not establish a justiciable case or controversy in federal court.” Ziegler says the Court’s opinion could offer a potential roadmap to future plaintiffs who do want to establish standing in later cases. It could also enable former President Donald Trump, if he were to be elected to a second term, to prompt the Department of Justice to enforce the rarely used, anti-obscenity law known as the Comstock Act to curtail access to mifepristone, she says. Trump has publicly said that abortion rights should be left to the states, but he declined to comment when asked by TIME in May if he would enforce the Comstock Act. In their ruling, the Justices did not address the plaintiffs’ claim that the FDA’s approval of mifepristone and subsequent modifications to allow mail delivery violated the Comstock Act, which governs how the U.S. Postal Service handles the delivery of contraception and items considered “obscene.” Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas repeatedly invoked the Act during oral arguments. “This is a prominent provision. It’s not some obscure subsection of a complicated, obscure law,” Alito said. “Everybody in this field knew about it.” The ruling marks the first time that the Justices have considered efforts to restrict abortion since their 2022 decision to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. Following that ruling, 14 states completely banned abortion—including medication abortion—and six states began requiring patients to see their physicians in person before getting prescriptions for abortion pills. The issue has become a rallying point for Democrats, and polls show that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022 was met with disapproval by a majority of Americans. President Joe Biden, who has promised to restore abortion protections if Democrats win control of Congress, said in a statement that the Supreme Court’s decision “does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues” and criticized Republicans for allowing extreme abortion bans in certain states.

The Supreme Court’s Decision on the Mississippi-Tennessee Aquifer Conflict Will Change U.S. Water Wars,Madeleine Carlisle,Climate,"November 23, 2021 10:57 AM EST","On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected Mississippi’s claim that Tennessee was stealing its groundwater in a decision that legal experts say could have major implications for future battles over water amid the worsening climate crisis. If the Supreme Court had sided with Mississippi, it would have “created chaos in the long-established world of interstate water allocation,” says Christine Ann Klein, a professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law who specializes in water law. “[The ruling] is a very big deal.” The term “groundwater” refers to freshwater that’s stored beneath the earth’s surface. Groundwater makes up about 50% of municipal, domestic and agricultural water supply, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (The term “surface water,” on the other hand, refers to any body of fresh water that’s above ground.) Monday’s case stretches back to 2014, when Mississippi sued Tennessee for allegedly stealing its groundwater by allowing a Memphis water utility company to pump from the Middle Claiborne Aquifer, which sits below the Mississippi-Tennessee border. Mississippi argued that it had owned that water since it entered the United States in 1817, and sought $615 million in damages from Tennessee. The Supreme Court disagreed. Instead, the high court ruled that the legal doctrine of “equitable apportionment”—which has long been used to determine what states get control of interstate surface water—also applies to groundwater. Both Mississippi and Tennessee can use the Middle Claiborne Aquifer. But if they want an official decree dictating how they have to share it, they’ll need to go through an “equitable apportionment” process, in which they must go before a court and argue their case. That court will then divide up the water as it sees fit. In other words, the high court ruled that “states have to share,” writes Robin Craig, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law who specializes in water law. “They can’t claim all the water for themselves.” Monday’s ruling was the first time the Supreme Court has ever weighed in on the issue of interstate groundwater. The unanimous ruling not only ended Mississippi and Tennessee’s long-running dispute, but also provided a framework for other legal battles that may emerge in the coming decades, says Craig. Now, in order to claim legal ownership of both interstate groundwater and surface water, states will need to go through the “equitable apportionment” process to determine who gets what. As the climate crisis intensifies and droughts worsen, particularly in the American West, groundwater will only become a more precious resource—and interstate groundwater disputes will likely become more common, she argues. Craig points to the fact that Utah and Nevada have come close to litigation over the issue, and the High Plains (Ogallala) Aquifer, which runs through the Great Plains, is already being heavily mined. There are dozens of aquifers spread across numerous states. In Klein’s opinion, the case helps bridge the gap between the way litigation has historically treated groundwater and how scientists understand groundwater actually works. “The law often treats groundwater differently than surface water, partly as a relic of slow-developing hydrologic knowledge,” she says. But at this point in 2021, she adds, researchers have found “little justification” for the separate treatment of surface and groundwater. If Mississippi had been awarded the $615 million it sought, she says, “groundwater wars would have become very expensive, very fast,” says Craig. But instead, the high burden the Supreme Court set for proving injury in the case, might encourage states to negotiate amongst themselves to share aquifers, rather than immediately heading to court for damages.

Supreme Court Orders States to Recognize Same-Sex Marriage,Ryan Teague Beckwith;See Scenes of Celebration After Supreme Court Gay Marriage Ruling;Silent No More: Early Days in the Fight for Gay Rights,Politics;Supreme Court,"June 26, 2015 11:38 AM [ET]","The Supreme Court declared by a margin of 5 to 4 Friday that states must license same-sex marriages and recognize similar unions from other states, effectively ending a long legal battle over the marriage rights for gays and lesbians. “No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy, who delivered the opinion for the court. “[The challengers] ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.” The high court’s historic ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges will expand the recognition of gay marriages beyond the 37 states and Washington, D.C., where it is currently legal, to all 50, affording same-sex couples the same rights and benefits long conferred on heterosexual unions. Already, couples in the remaining states that had not yet recognized gay marriage have been planning weddings, and research from the Williams Institute indicates the ruling may even inspire couples who already could legally marry in other states to tie the knot as well. Speaking from the White House, President Obama praised the decision, arguing that it was a sign of progress. Progress comes “sometimes two steps forward, one step back propelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens,” Obama said. “But then sometimes there are days like this when that slow steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.” Among the Republicans running to replace Obama, the ruling was roundly rejected, with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio arguing that it was simply a poor decision the country must learn to live with, while former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as an act of “judicial tyranny” that must be resisted. The ruling finishes a project begun by Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1996 with a landmark decision that overturned an anti-gay rights ballot measure in Colorado. That opinion laid the groundwork for the Supreme Court to throw out sodomy laws in 2003 and invalidate a ban on federal recognition of gay marriage in 2013, also authored by Kennedy, which undergirded Friday’s 5-4 decision. Kennedy argued that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which promises equal protection for all citizens under the law, forced states to recognize same-sex nuptials. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the principle dissent, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas. They argued that the court was overstepping its bounds by taking an action better left to the democratic process. “This Court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us,” Roberts wrote. “In short, our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition.” Justices Scalia, Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote additional dissents. Scalia said he wrote “to call attention to this Court’s threat to American democracy.” “Today’s decree says that my Rular, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nice lawyers on the Supreme Court,” Scalia warned. “The five Justices who compose today’s majority are entirely comfortable concluding that every state violated the Constitution for all of the 135 years between the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification and Massachusetts’ permitting of same-sex marriage in 2003.” There will be other fights in courthouses and capitols across the country. Gays and lesbians still face discrimination in housing and employment, while the country has only recently begun to tackle the issues faced by transgender Americans. Debates over the tension between religious liberty and discrimination will continue. In the court of public opinion, the fight over gay marriage has been over since 2011, when Gallup first recorded a majority in favor, and the win has only become more decisive. A survey released in May showed a record-high 60 percent of Americans now approve of same-sex marriage.
