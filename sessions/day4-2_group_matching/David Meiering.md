Project Title: **BanGender**
<!-- Preferably one word or an abbreviation -->

General Topic: **Debates about banning gender neutral language in German State Parliaments**
<!-- What is your general topic / research field of interest (e.g., gender, extremism, social movements)? -->

Project Summary: **Since 2021, there has been a series of bans of gender neutral language in German State administrations and institutions (universities, schools, public administration). This projects wants to find out, whether it's the entrance of the AfD party in state parliaments that drove debate trends towards topics related to gender neutral language or if it is a trend independant of the AfD (driven by CDU or a general trend).**
<!-- What is your specific research idea, if you have one? -->

Probable Method: **keyword occurrences by party over time, maybe topic modelling for different legislative periods, maybe modelling interactions between parties over time (two-mode networks: party - topic/keyword/motion) **
<!-- What would your preferred method of analysis be? And how do you rate your own skill level with that method? -->

Data: ***I know where to get the data, but I am having trouble to use it: https://github.com/texttechnologylab/GerParCor** 
<!-- Delete the options that do not apply to you! -->

Preferred Output: **I am currently working on a paper where I qualitatively coded the debates in Saxony and Bavaria during 2014-2018 to see differences in related topic trends and I would want to try if an automated analysis of the debates of all 16 states is possible. In any case I would be interesting in working with the GERPARCOR corpus to get familiar with it**
<!-- What is your preferred outcome of this group work, i.e. do you want to continue working on this project after the Summer Institute and possibly develop it into a paper OR do you "just" want to use it as practice in the context of this Summer Institute? -->

What is your skill level in R (1-10)? **4**
