Project Title: **...**
<!-- Preferably one word or an abbreviation -->

General Topic: **Education**
Also interested in social class, income, gender, race/ethnicity, and also happy to work on topics outside of my general interest. 

Project Summary: **Education Inequality in the News**
--> How is education inequality conceptualized in American news outlets? Is it primarily in terms of social class/income, gender, or race/ethnicity? 

Probable Method: **Classification/Topic Modeling**
--> I think topic modeling (both identifying classes, in terms of the class/gender/race groups, and in identifying topics within those classes). 

Preferred Output: **...**
--> Could be a presentation just for this workshop, could be a paper depending on how interesting it is and if this idea makes sense. 

What is your skill level in R (1-10)? **4**
--> Okay. Good with basic tasks, okay with iterating on existing code, some struggles with problem-solving error messages.
