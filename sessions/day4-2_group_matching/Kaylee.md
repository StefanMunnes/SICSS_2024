General Topic: **Sociology of Education**
Also interested in social class, income, gender, race/ethnicity, and also happy to work on topics outside of my general interest. 

Project Summary: **Education Inequality in the News**
--> How is education inequality conceptualized in American news outlets? Is it primarily in terms of social class/income, gender, or race/ethnicity? 

Probable Method: **Classification/Topic Modeling**
--> I think topic modeling (both identifying classes, in terms of the class/gender/race groups, and in identifying topics within those classes). 

Probable Data: **I know where to get the data**

Preferred Output: **...**

What is your skill level in R (1-10)? **3**
