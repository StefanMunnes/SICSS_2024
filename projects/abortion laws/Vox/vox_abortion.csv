Oklahoma just passed its own 6-week abortion ban. Here’s what this one does.,Nicole Narea,2022-04-29T18:50:43+00:00,"Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma passed a bill on Thursday that would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, typically around six weeks into pregnancy and before many even know they are pregnant. The Oklahoma Heartbeat Act will take immediate effect as soon as Gov. Kevin Stitt signs the bill, which is expected as early as Friday. Stitt has committed to signing any anti-abortion legislation that comes across his desk and has previously described himself as America’s “most pro-life governor.” Earlier this month, Oklahoma enacted a different bill that nearly totally bans abortion except in cases where the pregnant person’s life is endangered. Under that bill, anyone who performs an abortion would face up to 10 years in prison and up to $100,000 in fines. It will take effect in August unless barred by the courts. The new bill, which was passed without debate or any questions allowed, is modeled after a Texas law that went into effect last year. It has exceptions for cases where the pregnant person’s life is endangered, but not for cases of rape, incest, or fetal conditions that make life unsustainable after birth. It also imposes additional reporting requirements on physicians and allows private individuals to seek civil penalties, including at least $10,000 in damages, against anyone who aids in or performs an abortion after the six-week term. That’s designed to circumvent current legal limitations on the government’s ability to go after abortion providers. “It’s identical to the bill that was enacted by the Texas Legislature last year, and that bill has passed muster with the United States Supreme Court,” Tony Lauinger, the chairman of Oklahomans for Life, told the AP. (The Supreme Court, however, never held a full hearing on the bill and merely dismissed a case challenging the bill in a brief order without explaining its reasoning.) “We are hopeful that this bill will save the lives of more unborn children here in Oklahoma as well,” Lauinger added. Abortion advocates challenged the bill in the Oklahoma Supreme Court late Thursday, arguing that it prevents Oklahomans from accessing constitutionally protected abortion care. “For those able to scrape together the necessary funds, [the bill] will force them to travel out of state to access abortion care. Others will attempt to self-manage their own abortions without medical supervision. And many Oklahomans will have no choice but to continue their pregnancies against their will,” they write in the lawsuit. It’s the latest in a series of anti-abortion laws passed in Oklahoma and in several other GOP-controlled state legislatures that make it all but impossible to obtain an in-state physical abortion, even while the US Supreme Court’s precedent in its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade still stands. The court will decide a case by early July in which it is expected to partially or completely overturn Roe, which recognized a pregnant person’s fundamental right to seek an abortion, but found that states could still impose restrictions on the procedure in the service of protecting the pregnant person’s health and the potential life of a fetus once it can survive outside the womb. But even if the court doesn’t overturn Roe, the latest Oklahoma bill will likely still stand given that legal challenges to the parallel law in Texas have failed. Many Texans have flocked to Oklahoma abortion clinics after their state’s heartbeat act went into effect in September. There are just four such facilities across the entire state of Oklahoma, which have seen soaring demand in the months since. Trust Women — which operates a clinic in Oklahoma City that provides medication and surgical abortions up to the current legal limit of 21.6 weeks — says it has seen a 2,500 percent increase in patients. Even though the clinic has doubled the number of days of the week that it’s open from two to four, patients still may have to wait two to four weeks for an abortion, sometimes forcing them to travel to other states if that puts them over the time period within which it’s legal to have an abortion in Oklahoma. The passage of the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act will make it even harder to meet that demand. “Planned Parenthood Great Plains’ providers have served thousands of Texans in the past seven months because of their state’s harsh bounty-hunting scheme, and we have been proud to stand with them and provide essential, constitutionally protected abortion services,” Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. “Now, rather than serving as a haven for patients unable to get care at home, Oklahoma politicians have made outcasts of their own people.”",https://www.vox.com/2022/4/29/23048887/oklahoma-abortion-ban-texas-six-week,11808
An Alabama Democrat’s attempt to defend abortion rights backfired. It could have serious consequences.,Anna North,2019-05-03T21:10:00+00:00,"A Democratic state representative from Alabama shocked listeners nationwide this week when he argued against an abortion ban by saying “some kids are unwanted, so you kill them now or kill them later.” “You bring them into the world unwanted, unloved, then you send them to the electric chair. So you kill them now or you kill them later,” state Rep. John Rogers said on Tuesday, apparently talking about black children in Alabama. Rogers was arguing against a bill that would ban abortion outright in Alabama, and allow punishments for abortion providers up to 99 years in prison. The bill passed the Republican-controlled House on Tuesday and now moves to the Senate, according to CNN. Rogers’s comments, which were captured on video by the local news channel WVTM, sparked criticism from observers across the political spectrum. “Not only were his remarks reprehensible, they are a complete distraction from the real work still left to be done in this state,” said Staci Fox, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates, in a statement to media on Thursday. “The people of Alabama deserve better.” Donald Trump Jr., meanwhile, described the comments on Twitter as “stomach curling.” Rogers then sparked further backlash by calling him “retarded” and saying he should have been aborted. Rogers’s comments come just a few months after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, also a Democrat, touched off a nationwide controversy with confusing comments on an abortion bill in his state. Northam said that after a baby is born, a “discussion” could occur between parents and doctors about what to do next, which some critics took as an endorsement of infanticide. His remarks helped give rise to a wave of bills to protect abortion “survivors” around the country, which abortion rights supporters say could criminalize doctors. Meanwhile, total abortion bans like the one in Alabama are also proliferating around the country, as are “heartbeat” bills that could ban the procedure as early as six weeks. It’s not clear whether Rogers’s comments will have the same reach as Northam’s. But they appear to have had the opposite of the effect he intended — drawing criticism of the abortion rights cause and pulling attention away from the problems, including lack of health care access, that are killing Alabamians. Rogers, who has represented Alabama’s 52nd District in the state House since 1982, made his comments on the House floor Tuesday in opposition to Alabama HB 314, which would make performing an abortion a Class A felony in the state. The bill does not include exceptions for rape or incest. He led up to his inflammatory remarks by talking about black children in the state who are taken from their parents by Child Protective Services and end up committing crimes, going to prison, and being executed. “They get in trouble, and we electrocute them,” he said. “Whether you kill them early, or kill them later, doesn’t matter.” Rogers also said that the decision to get an abortion should “be a woman’s choice” and that “some old men shouldn’t be sitting around telling a woman what to do with her body.” The backlash to Rogers’s comments about killing was swift. “Representative Rogers’ remarks are chilling,” said Alabama Senate Majority Leader Greg Reed in a statement on Wednesday. “His comments should be condemned at the state and national level.” “Americans are justly outraged by John Rogers’ vile comments, but we should be no less outraged by the reality that abortion kills children,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, in a statement on Friday. Donald Trump Jr., meanwhile, tweeted that “every Democrat running for President needs to be asked where they stand” on Rogers’s comments. Rogers, who has not responded to Vox’s request for comment, explained his comments on Thursday in an interview with Alabama news website AL.com. He implied that lawmakers were hypocritical for wanting to ban abortion when other policies and proposals in Alabama, such as hospital closures, mass incarceration, and forced drug testing for food stamp recipients, could result in the deaths of residents. “The state of Alabama is killing people every day,” he said. “You’re going to tell a woman she can’t make a decision about incest and rape? She can’t have an abortion? That’s a woman’s choice.” But Rogers was more combative in responding to Trump Jr. in an interview with WVTM. “His mother should have aborted him when he was born and he wouldn’t have made that stupid statement,” Rogers said. “He’s evidently retarded.” “Sadly, vile comments like this have become par for the course for the Democrat Party,” said a spokesperson for Trump Jr. in response, according to Newsweek. “I hope every elected Democrat in the country has the common decency and moral courage to disavow these types of grotesque statements from members of their party.” Democrats and abortion rights groups have disavowed the comments. Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones tweeted that Rogers “does not speak for the people of Alabama.” “As we speak, Alabamians are dying from real public health problems that need our attention and we will not allow one man’s repulsive rant to distract us from the real issues at hand,” said Fox, the Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates president. Rogers’s comments are reminiscent of comments made by Northam in January, over a bill that would have broadened the circumstances under which a patient could get an abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy. In an interview about the abortion bill, Northam was asked to respond to a state legislator’s statement that the bill would allow an abortion if a woman is in labor (experts say that abortions during labor essentially never happen, and the legislator later said she “misspoke”). “If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen,” the governor said. “The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” The comments were confusing, and some believed the governor was endorsing infanticide, though a spokesperson told Vox that was “absolutely not” the case. Northam’s comments became a nationwide controversy and helped lead to a Senate vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would have required doctors to provide the same care to an infant born alive after a failed attempt at abortion as they would provide for any infant born at the same gestational age. Critics said the bill could hamper doctors’ ability to practice, and was unnecessary because infants are already protected by existing laws. The bill failed, but similar bills have been proposed at the state level, and President Trump has repeatedly referred to Northam’s comments in speeches, as part of a misleading claim that doctors around the country are killing babies after birth. It’s hard to know whether Rogers’s comments will have the same staying power. But they come at a time when lawmakers around the country are pushing bills like the one in Alabama. Eight states have introduced total bans on abortion, and many others have passed or are considering “heartbeat” bills, which ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks’ gestation. Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is widely viewed as a potential deciding vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, and advocates on both sides of the abortion issue are preparing for a future in which abortion rights are no longer protected on a national level. Abortion rights advocates say Rogers is right about one thing: Alabamians are dying because of lack of access to health care. But, they argue, banning abortion in the state would only make matters worse. “Banning abortion care will put women’s lives at risk in a state that already sees some of the worst health outcomes for women in the country,” Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Vox in a statement. “If the politicians pushing this ban truly valued the lives and well-being of their constituents, they would work to address Alabama’s cervical cancer rates, a maternal and infant mortality crisis and an OBGYN shortage, all of which are some of the worst in the country.” With his comments, Rogers appears to have been intending to highlight the crises facing residents of his state. But he may have drawn attention to his own words instead, at a time when debate around abortion rights is exceptionally contentious and the stakes are exceptionally high.",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/3/18528256/john-rogers-alabama-democrat-abortion,11808
Abortion was a motivating force in Virginia’s primaries,Nicole Narea,2023-06-21T18:15:08+00:00,"Abortion continued to prove a motivating issue for Democratic voters in Tuesday night’s primaries in Virginia, suggesting that its potency hasn’t waned in the months since the midterms. The starkest evidence of that was incumbent Democratic state Sen. Joe Morrissey’s loss to Lashrecse Aird, a progressive former Virginia lawmaker backed by abortion advocacy groups and prominent Democrats including US Sen. Tim Kaine. Morrissey, who represents parts of Petersburg and Richmond, is among a dwindling few Democratic public officials across the country who describe themselves as “pro-life.” Though he said he would not have supported Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s failed attempt to implement a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, he did co-sponsor another bill that would have imposed a 20-week ban. Similarly, in the 55th state house district surrounding Charlottesville, self-described “champion for women’s rights” Amy Laufer also won her Democratic primary against ER nurse Kellen Squire after accusing him of being untrustworthy in his support of abortion rights. She had described abortion as a personal issue for her after experiencing a high-risk pregnancy. Abortion will likely continue to be top of mind for voters heading into the fall as they decide control of both chambers of the state legislature in a key swing state. Due to redistricting, every seat in both chambers is open. If Republicans consolidate power, they would be able to pass Youngkin’s proposed abortion ban, which was previously blocked by Democrats in the state Senate. Currently, Virginia allows abortions up to about 26 weeks of pregnancy and, after that, only in cases where three doctors attest that the pregnant person’s life is at risk. It’s become a regional abortion hub since other states in the South have moved to severely restrict abortion. Youngkin’s proposal for a 15-week ban includes exceptions for rape, incest, and to save the pregnant person’s life. Democrats have argued that the governor’s proposal could result in prison time for women and doctors, but Youngkin’s office has dismissed that framing as “political posturing” and said that he will not imprison women. Youngkin has also proposed barring state Medicaid from covering abortions when a fetus has an “incapacitating” physical or mental deformity, and preventing state funds from being used to support abortion services. “I think Virginia voters are unequivocally clear about the fact that they don’t want an abortion ban,” said Lauren Chou, a spokesperson for Emily’s List. “Given what we’ve seen in the primary, that momentum is only going to grow in the general.” Virginia’s elections, which come one year before presidential contests, are often seen as bellwethers — and as such, influence national party strategies for the year ahead. If Democrats are able to make gains in the state this fall, it would be another signal that abortion continues to be a winning issue for them even in states as closely divided as Virginia, which is the last remaining state in the South with access to abortion beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy. Nearly a year after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a vast and growing majority of Americans back abortion access. A quarter of Americans said that they had become more supportive of abortion rights due to state efforts to restrict access in a June USA Today/Suffolk University poll. In addition to the results of Virginia’s primaries, state-level contests in the months since the midterms have reflected that abortion rights are driving voters to the polls. Also in Virginia earlier this year, state Sen. Aaron Rouse won a special election by campaigning on abortion rights against a candidate who embraced Youngkin’s proposed ban. He ran multiple TV ads focusing on the issue and received more than $100,000 from Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. In Wisconsin, pro-abortion Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the state Supreme Court in an April blowout election that proved the most expensive judicial contest in US history. She gave the state’s highest court a liberal majority after breaking with convention for judicial candidates in making her support for abortion rights plain. The stakes were high: Wisconsin has a 173-year-old abortion ban that makes no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest but does allow the procedure when the pregnant person’s life is in danger. A case challenging that law is likely to come before the state Supreme Court soon. Pro-abortion and Democratic groups are already eyeing contests in Virginia’s fall elections that are also likely to hinge on abortion. That includes a battleground state senate race in Northern Virginia’s Loudoun County, where former CIA officer Russet Perry, who is backed by Emily’s List, is campaigning on preserving abortion access for her young daughter and other women. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) is also prioritizing protecting Rouse’s seat. The DLCC is continuing to advise down-ballot candidates to make sure that their constituents understand what it means to have abortion access and that “this is a private decision between families and their doctors,” said spokesperson Gabrielle Chew. But she also said that candidates are being encouraged to speak about abortion and family planning as an economic issue. “We think that this will definitely be an issue that can help showcase just how extreme the Republican Party has become. The only way to protect this right — as well as other fundamental rights, like voting access — is to elect Democrats,” she said. It’s not clear whether Republicans are receiving similar guidance. Some have refrained from speaking about abortion altogether, recognizing it as an issue that mostly activates the left and alienates swing voters and independents. But others have doubled down on anti-abortion rhetoric: Republican Virginia Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, who ran unopposed Tuesday’s primaries, is facing a tough reelection fight, but she’s made abortion restrictions key to her platform as a practicing OB-GYN, calling for a ban on abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy at the earliest.",https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/6/21/23768726/virginia-primary-election-2023-democrast-abortion-youngkin-2024,11808
Should I delete my period app? And other post-Roe privacy questions.,Sara Morrison,2022-07-06T16:50:00+00:00,"Tech companies are scrambling to adjust their data privacy practices in response to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and subsequent criminalizing of abortion in several states, as the larger public realizes that the data those services collect could be used to prosecute abortion seekers. Google, for example, recently announced that it will automatically delete location data if people visit medical facilities, including abortion clinics (it still, of course, collects that data). And the period tracker app Flo is introducing an “anonymous mode” that is supposed to let users delete any identifiable information from their profiles. If you’ve never cared all that much about how and why you’re constantly being surveilled online before, you probably have a lot of questions about how all of this works now — especially when it comes to reproductive health data and what can be used against you. We’ve answered some of those questions here, from how scared you should be of period apps to what you can do to keep your private life private … as much as that’s possible, anyway. This seems to be the biggest question people have about online privacy with regard to the Roe reversal. The short answer is: Yes. If you want to keep your reproductive health and menstrual data private — especially if you’re worried about that data being part of a criminal investigation — don’t put it in an app. The longer answer is that when it comes to online privacy and health privacy, deleting a period tracker app is like taking a teaspoon of water out of the ocean. The current anxiety about period apps is understandable, given the purpose that they serve. But it’s also myopic. There are countless and more effective ways that interested parties can track your pregnancy status (expectant parents buy a lot of things, so knowing when someone gets pregnant to target them with ads can be lucrative) and law enforcement can do even more if they’re investigating you for getting an abortion in a state where it’s illegal (more on that later). The data from a period tracker app will only tell them so much, and it will only tell them the information you’ve given it. That said, period tracker or fertility apps have a bad reputation when it comes to privacy, and they deserve it. Flo was once caught sending data to various third parties including Facebook and Google, despite privacy policies indicating that it wouldn’t. Glow was dinged for “serious privacy and basic security failures.” Stardust shared user phone numbers with a third party, and its “end-to-end encryption” claims have been walked back. Since a draft opinion indicating that Roe would be reversed leaked in May, and period apps got more scrutiny than perhaps ever before, many of them have scrambled to assure users that their data is safe or that they are implementing additional protections. While some period trackers are better than others, the only way to be sure that no one can get anything about you from a period app is not to use them at all. Yes. People have been menstruating for as long as people have existed. Period apps, smartphones, and even the internet have only been around for a fraction of that time. If you keep track of your cycle on, say, a paper calendar, that data isn’t going to be sent to third parties or stored in some company’s cloud for law enforcement to access. Digital calendars exist, too, like Google’s Calendar and Apple’s iCal. You might feel better about those because they aren’t expressly for period tracking, and Google and Apple don’t send your data to third parties like some of those period apps do. But that doesn’t mean that data is completely protected, as I’ll explain later. You can also use apps that don’t upload your information to a cloud, as Consumer Reports suggested. That data can still be accessed if someone gets control of the device it’s on, but that’s also true for paper calendars. It’s understandable why people are focusing on period apps. They specifically deal with reproductive health, and deleting an app gives people what appears to be a fast and simple solution and a feeling of agency. But the truth is that period tracker apps are very low on the list of things you should worry about when it comes to online privacy and abortions. You can delete an app, but that won’t make an entire ecosystem built on knowing as much as possible about you disappear. If abortion is illegal where you live and law enforcement is investigating you for possibly getting one, even the most privacy-centric company can be forced to give law enforcement whatever data they have on you. And you can be forced to give them whatever data you have, too. Let’s look at Google, because it likely has more data on you than anyone else. Depending on which of its services you use (or which of its services the apps you use or websites you visit use) Google knows a lot about you, such as where you go, what you search the internet for, the websites you visit, the emails you send and receive, the text messages you send, and the photos you take. Google doesn’t necessarily want to share this data with anyone else, because being the sole owner of it is one of Google’s competitive advantages. And it’s not going to hand it over to, say, an anti-abortion group that’s looking to weaponize it. But Google doesn’t have a choice if law enforcement demands it and gets the right court order for it. That’s in its privacy policy: “We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.” Every other company is going to have a version of that clause. Even Apple, which has a better reputation for privacy than its Big Tech peers, will give data to the police if it’s compelled to do so. When it refused to help the FBI access iPhones owned by suspected terrorists, that was because Apple didn’t have a backdoor into its devices and wouldn’t make one. But any data those people had uploaded to iCloud, like backups of those devices — that is, the data Apple itself possessed — it did provide. Google, for what it’s worth, has responded to the Roe news by announcing that it will automatically delete location data around certain places, like abortion or fertility clinics. That should mean that police can’t get it because there’s nothing for them to get. But there’s still plenty of potentially incriminating evidence left that they can find. We don’t know if and how law enforcement will go after abortion seekers, but we do know how they’ve obtained and used data to go after others. That includes the case of a woman who was suspected of killing her baby just after it was born, and another woman who was accused of intentionally inducing a miscarriage. In those cases, texts, web searches, and emails taken from the women’s own phones were used as evidence against them. There’s nothing to suggest that police won’t do the same when investigating people suspected of obtaining now-illegal abortions. When the Roe reversal decision first leaked, there were several stories showing just how much of your data is in the hands of random data brokers and how easy it is for that data to fall into the hands of anyone else. That data is “de-identified,” but depending on what data is collected and shared, it may be possible to re-identify someone from it. For example, last year, a priest was outed by data from Grindr. (One important caveat: While the publication that outed him said the data it used was “commercially available,” it never said it got that data from buying it.) The chances that a private party will purchase data and be able to figure out that you got an abortion and who you are is, frankly, pretty remote. It’s the people who have access to much more specific and sensitive data — the police — you have to worry about, if abortion is illegal where you live. But nothing is impossible, especially when so much of our data is sent to so many places. Probably not as much as you think. First of all, not every single medical or health-related service is covered by HIPAA. Those anti-abortion pregnancy centers collect plenty of sensitive, reproductive health-specific data, and they may not be subject to HIPAA’s privacy rules, even if they perform medical procedures — and even if they reference HIPAA in their privacy policies. But let’s say you see a provider who is a covered entity. Then, yes, your health information is protected. Unless you’re breaking the law, in which case police may be able to get those records or certain details in them. The Department of Health and Human Services, which enforces HIPAA, recently issued new guidance on reproductive health care disclosures in response to the Roe reversal, stressing that such disclosures can only be made under very select circumstances. Again, what data law enforcement or data brokers can get on you depends on what you give them. Google can only give the police what it has. Services like Signal and Proton that use end-to-end encryption and don’t store your data don’t have anything to give the police no matter how many warrants they’re served with. But if you have that data on your device and police get access to that, all the end-to-end encryption in the world won’t save you. That’s why Signal, for instance, offers a feature called disappearing messages, which will permanently delete messages in a chat after a set amount of time from every device in the chat. There are also things you can do to prevent your data from being collected, but these might involve more steps and technical knowledge than you’re willing, or know how, to take. That’s especially true if you’re only trying to figure it out when the need for privacy suddenly arises and you have other things to worry about — like when you’re dealing with an unwanted pregnancy. Which means your best bet is to read and get familiar with these measures now, when you have the time and emotional bandwidth to figure out what you can and want to do and practice incorporating them into your daily life. Some of them may not be as difficult or inaccessible as you think, especially when you do them often enough that they become automatic. The Verge recently published some good and clear advice. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a guide. And Gizmodo’s privacy how-to tells you all the things you can do and why you should do them. Nothing is foolproof in a world with few privacy protections and an economy based on furtive data collection, but these are measures you can take that should significantly reduce your data exposure. The best privacy protections are the ones our government has yet to give us: data privacy laws. The Roe reversal has made the consequences of not having them more clear than ever, and lawmakers have already introduced Senate and House bills specifically addressing health data in response to the decision. You can urge your representatives to support and push for those bills to be passed, as well as some of the broader consumer privacy bills that have been introduced (or are reportedly soon to be introduced). Those may limit the data companies can share or sell to other companies, and even the data they can collect in the first place.",https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/7/6/23196809/period-apps-roe-dobbs-data-privacy-abortion,11808
All the near-total abortion bans passed this year have now been blocked in court,Anna North,2019-10-29T17:34:38+00:00,"Near-total bans on abortion have swept the country this year, with state after state banning the procedure six weeks into pregnancy or even earlier. The laws inspired protests across the country and comparisons with Margaret Atwood’s dystopian The Handmaid’s Tale. But one by one, those laws have been blocked by courts. Alabama is the latest. On Tuesday, Judge Myron H. Thompson of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama issued a preliminary injunction blocking a law passed earlier this year that would ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. “Alabama’s abortion ban contravenes clear Supreme Court precedent,” the judge wrote. “It defies the United States Constitution.” Of course, Alabama’s ban and six-week bans in Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky, and elsewhere were designed to face a court challenge. They were part of a strategy by abortion opponents to pass legislation running directly counter to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established Americans’ right to an abortion. The goal was to force the Supreme Court to take up one of the “heartbeat” laws and use it to overturn Roe. But mainstream anti-abortion groups are becoming increasingly skeptical of that strategy, arguing that even with President Trump’s appointment of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court isn’t actually eager to get rid of Roe, especially by upholding a controversial abortion ban like Alabama’s. Instead, they’re returning to a previous strategy: backing incremental laws that restrict clinic operations or introduce new requirements for getting an abortion. And that strategy is about to face a big test: Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced it would hear a case concerning a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Depending on what the justices decide, the case could give states across the country the green light to pass stricter and stricter restrictions on clinics, forcing them to close and making abortion impossible to access — even if the procedure remains technically legal. The injunction against the Alabama ban is temporary and the legal challenges to laws in other states are also in progress. And, of course, no one except the nine justices knows exactly what the Supreme Court will do. But for now, it looks as though the biggest abortion news of 2019 might not be the near-total bans that swept the country in the first half of the year, but a slower, quieter strategy that’s been in the works for a long time — and that might be about to bear fruit. The law blocked in Alabama would have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, abortion would only be legal if the pregnant person’s life was at risk. Without the injunction, the law was scheduled to take effect on November 15. The Alabama law was the most restrictive to pass this year. But “heartbeat” laws, passed in Georgia, Ohio, and elsewhere, were meant to ban abortion as soon as cardiac activity can be detected on an ultrasound, which usually happens around six weeks into pregnancy. Abortion rights groups have argued that the “heartbeat” terminology is misleading since the fetus does not have a developed heart at six weeks and the cardiac activity comes from a structure called the fetal pole. They typically call the laws six-week bans instead. Whatever the terminology, the laws effectively ban abortion before most people know they are pregnant and would function as near-total bans on the procedure. The laws began sweeping the country last year, with Iowa passing one in May 2018. The process accelerated in early 2019, with Ohio, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Georgia all passing a version between the beginning of January and the end of May (Louisiana also passed a version of the law but it is designed only to go into effect if Mississippi’s law survives a court challenge). Georgia’s was the most high-profile, inspiring protests around the country and prompting some film production companies to pull out of the state. Many of these laws were explicitly crafted as challenges to Roe v. Wade. Their sponsors knew they would face legal challenges and hoped the case would make it all the way up to the Supreme Court, where the justices would use it to overturn Roe. “What I’m trying to do here is get this case in front of the Supreme Court so Roe v. Wade can be overturned,” Alabama Rep. Terri Collins, who sponsored her state’s bill, told the Washington Post earlier this year. One part of the strategy worked: The laws have all faced legal challenges. But some doubt whether the laws will ever make it to the Supreme Court. Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel for the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life, wrote in the National Review in May that if the Supreme Court wanted to revisit Roe it would be unlikely to choose the highly controversial “heartbeat” laws as the vehicle with which to do so. And in August, the National Right to Life Committee, which calls itself “the nation’s oldest and largest pro-life organization,” actually opposed a near-total ban on abortion in Tennessee. “There is no majority on the Supreme Court that we can identify that would uphold such a thing,” said James Bopp, the group’s general counsel, in impassioned testimony against the bill. The movement for near-total abortion bans isn’t entirely over — the Tennessee bill has yet to come up for a vote and a “heartbeat” bill is currently before the state Senate in South Carolina. But increasingly, mainstream anti-abortion groups seem to view these bans as expensive legal battles they’re unlikely to win. They may not have to win those battles, though, because there’s another way to make abortion essentially impossible to get. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the case of June Medical Services v. Gee. The case concerns a 2014 Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The law is one of many abortion clinic restrictions passed by Republican-controlled state legislatures since 2010. Abortion-rights supporters argue that the laws are medically unnecessary and aimed merely at shutting clinics down and they were responsible for closing half the clinics in Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, and Texas between 2011 and 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The Supreme Court ruled that an admitting privileges law in Texas was unconstitutional in the 2016 case Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. But as Vox’s Ian Millhiser has noted, that was a different time and a different court. With the addition of Kavanaugh, conservatives on the Court may have enough votes to reverse Whole Woman’s Health, deciding in favor of the Louisiana law in June Medical Services. That would open the door for Republican-controlled states to pass ever more stringent clinic restrictions, closing more clinics and effectively eliminating abortion access for many people, especially those too poor to travel to one of the few clinics remaining open. Significantly, the Court would not have to overturn Roe for states to greatly curtail abortion access. Nor would states need to ban the procedure outright to make it inaccessible to many of their residents. If the Louisiana law were to go into effect, two of the three remaining clinics in the state could close. Whatever happens with June Medical Services, abortion access for countless Americans hangs in the balance. And while near-total bans like Alabama’s were the ones making headlines earlier this year, a lesser-known Louisiana law is poised to make a much bigger difference. The governor of Alabama signed the nation’s strictest anti-abortion bill into law.

Why IVF looks different in the US than in the rest of the world,Rachel M. Cohen,2024-03-26T10:00:00+00:00,"Earlier this month the Atlantic ran an opinion piece describing the American fertility industry as “strangely undeveloped” from a regulatory perspective. The two authors — a conservative political analyst and an anti-abortion bioethicist — claimed the landscape for assisted reproductive technology has left “parents, children, clinics and practitioners” without basic protections and safety guardrails. Their ominous arguments are part of a much older debate over whether the US fertility industry is sufficiently regulated, a conversation that has reignited now that in vitro fertilization is back in the national headlines. In the wake of Alabama’s Supreme Court concluding that frozen embryos created through IVF count as “children” under state law, anti-abortion groups have jumped to say this moment offers a new chance to protect human life. When Alabama’s legislature moved to protect IVF providers from liability, the advocacy group Students for Life said it would amount to an industry “get-out-of-regulation free card.” Critics sometimes charge the $5.34 billion fertility sector with being a “Wild West” that places profit on a pedestal above ethics and safety. Defenders say there’s plenty of regulation; to the extent that other countries have more rules, it’s because they have more centralized government-run health care systems and far less rabid anti-abortion politics. “This specialized medical field is often criticized as being a ‘Wild West’ in which anything goes,” Kerry Lynn Macintosh, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, told me. “In my opinion, that criticism is inaccurate and unfair.” Untangling the various arguments thrown around in the discussion can get complicated. There are potential regulations for patient safety, such as inspecting cryogenic storage tanks and accrediting fertility clinics. There are potential regulations that some religious conservatives want to see in the name of protecting embryo “dignity” or heterosexual marriage — like rules around embryo disposal or who may be eligible to use the assisted reproductive technology at all. And there are other potential regulations that pertain to complex and divisive societal issues — like sperm donor anonymity and screening embryos for sex and other genetic characteristics. These regulatory questions are not new, but they’re resurfacing now within the new post-Roe era, where the technology continues to advance at a rapid clip and the risks of government overreach into reproductive health care are more acute than ever. There are more than 450 fertility clinics across the country, and like most aspects of US health care, the IVF industry is regulated by a patchwork of federal and state rules as well as professional self-governance, all with varying levels of penalties and enforcement mechanisms. Unlike many other aspects of US health care, though, insurance coverage for assisted reproductive technologies is rare, with companies generally ducking services like IVF due to its high cost. Some experts and insurers also reject the idea that infertility is a disease, despite bodies like the World Health Organization labeling it as such. The primary consumer protection law governing IVF is the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992, which requires clinics to report their live birth success rates to the federal government. Around 90 percent of clinics participate, though there is no real legal consequence for those that don’t. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also audits a sample of clinics each year to validate the self-reported data. Doctors who provide IVF must be licensed to practice medicine, and if they violate medical norms, they can lose their privileges. In one notorious example, the doctor who transferred multiple embryos into a woman who would give birth to the first surviving octuplets had his license revoked by the state of California. Another major mechanism for regulation is the courts: American tort law allows patients to sue clinics, doctors, and manufacturers for damages if they feel they’ve been injured by medical malpractice. Between January 2009 and April 2019, patients brought more than 130 lawsuits over destroyed embryos. One lawsuit in 2021 won a nearly $15 million judgment. “Believe me, fertility clinics and their suppliers heard that message loud and clear,” Macintosh, the Santa Clara law professor, said. Some states require fertility clinics to be accredited and inspected, while others do not. Louisiana is the only state to outright prohibit the destruction of embryos, requiring patients to either pay forever to store their unused embryos, or donate them to a married couple. Most states allow patients to decide what to do with any excess genetic material. Much of the standard-setting in IVF comes from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the professional association representing practitioners in the field. The ASRM provides influential guidance to members on appropriate conduct, and can censure, suspend, or expel members deemed unethical. It has a sister organization — the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology — which collects data on IVF cycles to report to the government and requires labs to get accredited if they wish to become members. (Most clinics are members.) Sean Tipton, the chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, disagrees that IVF in the US lacks oversight and accountability, and emphasized that IVF is the only medical procedure for which doctors must report their success rates to the US government. “The idea that this field is unregulated is completely wrong, and people who make that argument are either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading,” he told Vox. Tipton is proud of his group’s self-regulatory record, and pointed out that 20 years ago, when it became clear that too many IVF pregnancies were leading to twins and triplets, his group promoted data that showed one can reduce the number of embryos transferred without hurting the live birth success rate. Practitioners took note and there’s since been an enormous reduction in multiple births. Tipton also said the tort system is simply a fundamental differentiator for regulation of health care in the US compared to other countries. “In American medicine, we don’t try to have a 9,000-page set of regulations because the field changes way too fast for that,” he argued. “Instead we have patients who, if they feel they have been victimized by someone in accidental or malicious ways, they have the right to sue and get relief.” Despite the aforementioned guardrails, many critics maintain the US can do better. They fault a fertility industry they see as too freewheeling, chaotic, and profit-driven. They want to see more safety testing on FDA-approved storage tanks, and lament all the voluntary rules which they say will do too little to prevent the most unscrupulous actors from causing harm. The industry is “cavalier about rules, casual about paperwork, irritated by government interference,” David Plotz, a journalist who wrote a book about a mysterious sperm bank with highly elite and accomplished donors, once said. Naomi Cahn, a University of Virginia law professor who focuses on reproductive technology, told Vox she thinks more state and federal oversight is needed for cryopreservation tanks even once they’re approved by the FDA for use. “It may be difficult to determine just what that oversight should be: How often do tanks need to be inspected? What types of safety procedures must be implemented? It is impossible to protect against all errors, but it is so important to be able to have confidence that one’s reproductive material is being stored safely,” she said. Critics also note certain practices are allowed in the US that are frequently banned in other countries, like screening for sex or eye color, or allowing sperm donor anonymity. One survey found nearly 73 percent of US fertility clinics offer patients the ability to select their embryo’s sex. “IVF clinics have had pretty free rein, and some would look at their pathway as being a bit free and easy in terms of new developments,” Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institutes of Health, told the Washington Post in 2018. Many critics of American IVF like to point to the UK as a model for superior governmental oversight. There, an independent agency — the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority — oversees all clinic licensing, regulates storage of embryos, and sets national rules all clinics must abide by to use assisted reproductive technology. It was formed via a 1990 statute and originated in a national report published in 1984. But there’s a far less organized and aggressive anti-abortion movement in Britain, which allowed UK leaders to reach compromise positions on embryo research and creation that could not be replicated at the same time in America. As the technology was first being developed in the 1970s and ’80s, the US government made a significant effort to come together on some national policies around IVF. In the late ’70s, a 13-person national committee composed of seven doctors, two attorneys, one businessman, a philanthropy representative, a philosopher, and a religious ethicist took up the task of crafting recommendations for IVF research. This “Ethics Advisory Board” solicited testimony and held public hearings across the country. In its final report in 1979, it concluded research on IVF was ethically acceptable and recommended the federal government lift its research funding ban on human embryos up to the age of 14 days. Anti-abortion groups mobilized hard against this. Activists sent nearly 13,000 letters to Congress opposed to the Ethics Advisory Board’s conclusions and placed an ad in the New York Times calling IVF a “morally abhorrent technology.” The 1980s saw similar pushback to federal deliberation. “We found it impossible in this country to find common ground when there were congressional committees tasked with trying to come up with policies that could gain a consensus,” Margaret Marsh, a Rutgers historian who has studied IVF’s rise, told me. “Anti-abortion activists opposed the technology and some conservative politicians believed family law was the province of the state, not the national government.” By 1996, under pressure from anti-abortion groups, Congress passed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment — a rider that bans any federal funds going toward human embryo research. It’s been tacked onto appropriations bills annually since, leaving the American public sector effectively out of researching most fertility technologies and significantly limiting its oversight role. Tipton says what’s happening right now in Alabama and the “rabid anti-choice movement” are speaking loud and clear about present-day possibilities for federal rule-making. “In 2024, if anyone thinks they’re going to have a rational discussion about national [IVF] regulation they are gravely mistaken,” he said. Macintosh, who focuses on biotechnology law, echoed Tipton’s skepticism. “In the United States, anything to do with human reproduction is contentious, and I would not trust a federal agency to make decisions based on science alone,” she said. And some Republicans still just ideologically resist federal rules altogether. “I don’t see any need to regulate [IVF] at the federal level,” Republican Sen. Roger Marshall told Politico recently. “I think the Dobbs decision puts this issue back at the state level.” The debate over whether IVF is adequately regulated has resurfaced over the last month. After Alabama’s court ruling, Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth brought a bill to establish a national right to IVF up for a vote. Her Access to Family Building Act would override state limits on assisted reproductive technology and give individuals the right to decide how to use or dispose of their genetic reproductive materials, thus shielding patients and doctors from liability. It was blocked, however, by Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who claimed it had “poison pills” that would allegedly legalize human cloning and commercial surrogacy, subject anti-abortion groups to “crippling lawsuits,” and lift the federal ban “on the creation of three-parent embryos.” (The bill does not mention these things.) Conservatives and other groups affiliated with the anti-abortion movement echoed the opposition, insisting Duckworth’s bill would unleash untold consequences under a broad legal interpretation. Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council, blasted the bill as part of Democrats’ “radical, Frankensteinian agenda.” Jordan Boyd, a staff writer for the Federalist, called it an attempt “to stifle oversight and regulation of Big Fertility.” Duckworth and IVF advocates rejected these arguments. “The idea that my Access to Family Building Act would interfere with federal or state safety regulations surrounding IVF is a false claim aimed at distracting people from what my legislation would actually do,” Duckworth told Vox. “It is Republicans’ crusade to redefine the concept of a human being to include embryos that poses an existential threat to IVF — and any future questions surrounding safety regulations.” Other countries do have tougher federal rules and penalties governing their fertility sectors. For example, operating a non-accredited clinic in Australia can lead to up to a decade in prison. Countries like Norway, Finland, and New Zealand ban anonymous sperm donations. Other countries like Canada ban embryo sex selection except in rare medical circumstances. But in the US, with its much stronger culture of privacy and its more intense anti-abortion politics, similar policies have been largely off the table. Progressive activists have long raised concerns about how fertility regulations could hurt the most vulnerable Americans, just as abortion bans disproportionately affect low-income women and people of color. “What we have not done in this country, at least until the demise of Roe v. Wade, is have the government in the business of making decisions about people’s reproductive lives,” Marsh said. Defenders of the US regulatory landscape also note that many of the more heavily regulated countries have often left patients in those places without access to care. Thousands of couples travel to the US for fertility treatment (sometimes dubbed “reproductive tourism”) or rely on shipments of anonymous American sperm because their own countries have major shortages. Prominent anti-abortion groups have been going on offense since Alabama’s Supreme Court ruling, accusing Republicans of “sanctioning murder” for supporting IVF, and doubling down on “personhood” bills that threaten treatment access. Some activists have called for more regulation of embryos, like tracking where they go, how they’re stored, and what happens to them. Such tracking would amount to a significant increase in government oversight. Cahn, the University of Virginia law professor, said it could also fundamentally encroach on privacy protections. “While the government does keep track of the number of [assisted reproductive technology] cycles for legal purposes, it does not keep track of who is undergoing those cycles,” she told me. “And while births are reported, we don’t — and shouldn’t — keep track of each menstrual cycle that produces eggs nor each time someone tries to get pregnant.” Cahn co-authored a paper in 2022 proposing a new independent federal agency to oversee reproductive technologies, and others have suggested reforms like requiring all fertility clinics to obtain certification from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, rather than leave such accreditation optional. Many of these ideas sound reasonable, and some aspects of the rapidly growing reproductive technology sector really do warrant at the very least more public discussion. But such discussion is unlikely to come in practicable form any time soon, as some activists increasingly make their long-term hope of ending IVF known. And the politics of regulation look exceedingly difficult, too, when 126 House Republicans are currently co-sponsoring federal legislation to give constitutional rights to embryos.",https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/3/26/24104638/abortion-ivf-duckworth-regulation-reproductive-technology,11808
This life-threatening pregnancy complication is the next frontier in the abortion debate,Anna North,2019-09-11T16:30:00+00:00,"Ectopic pregnancies can be deadly. The condition happens in about 2 percent of all pregnancies, when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside the uterus — usually in the fallopian tube, a tiny structure connecting the uterus to the ovary. If the pregnancy continues to grow and develop, the tube can rupture, and the pregnant person can hemorrhage and die. In most cases, the only way to treat an ectopic pregnancy is to terminate it with medication or surgery. But now, some abortion opponents are arguing that patients with ectopic pregnancies can simply be monitored until they miscarry — or even that such pregnancies can be carried to term. “Knowing that a medical condition carries a very small chance of death is scary,” Georgi Boorman wrote at the Federalist on Monday. But, she asked, “is that very small chance enough to prompt you to suffer through purposely destroying your own child?” The argument is starting to make its way into legislation, with a recent Ohio law including a special provision for the surgical reimplantation of ectopic pregnancies into the uterus, something doctors say is not possible. Experts say failing to treat an ectopic pregnancy can put patients at serious risk. “It is really malpractice to watch a patient who is at risk for a tubal rupture from an ectopic pregnancy” without offering termination, Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive services at the University of California, San Francisco, told Vox. “There’s a real risk of death.” Claims that abortion isn’t necessary in the case of ectopic pregnancies may be part of a larger movement toward abortion bans with fewer and fewer exceptions, like a law in Alabama that bans abortion even in cases of rape or incest (the law does have an exception to save the pregnant person’s life). And even if such laws never go into effect — most have been challenged in the courts — false claims about ectopic pregnancy in the media could lead patients to delay treatment, Grossman said, potentially harming their future fertility or risking their lives. At first, the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are similar to those of a normal pregnancy, like sore breasts and a missed period, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But patients may also experience abnormal bleeding or abdominal or pelvic pain. Once a doctor has diagnosed an ectopic pregnancy, time is of the essence — fallopian tubes cannot stretch very much, Grossman explained, and if the pregnancy grows beyond a certain point, they will rupture. As long as the tube has not yet ruptured, doctors typically give patients an injection of methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug that can also be used to stop a pregnancy from growing. Then, according to ACOG, the body typically reabsorbs the pregnancy on its own. If the tube has already ruptured, and in some other cases, surgery is necessary to remove the pregnancy and sometimes a portion of the tube. Historically, anti-abortion groups have supported allowing abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy, arguing that it is morally distinct from abortion in other cases. For example, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG) said in a 2010 statement that the group “recognizes the unavoidable loss of human life that occurs in an ectopic pregnancy, but does not consider treatment of ectopic pregnancy by standard surgical or medical procedures to be the moral equivalent of elective abortion, or to be the wrongful taking of human life.” Others have argued that ending an ectopic pregnancy should not be considered an abortion at all. Anti-abortion activist Lila Rose, for instance, said in a recent video that removing an ectopic pregnancy “is not to intentionally kill that child; that’s not an abortion procedure.” And yet some abortion opponents have started making the argument that terminating an ectopic pregnancy by medication or surgery is not medically necessary. At the Federalist, Boorman argues that instead of abortion, patients with ectopic pregnancy should be closely monitored by their doctors (a process called “expectant management” or “watchful waiting”). Sometimes, she writes, the patient will miscarry with no need for intervention. If the tube ruptures, the patient can be treated with a blood transfusion procedure — though, she acknowledges, there is a small risk of death. She also argues that sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy can move on its own, reimplanting in a safer location and even resulting in a healthy birth. Doctors, however, say it is not possible to carry an ectopic pregnancy to term and have a child. “Once a diagnosis of ectopic is made, that pregnancy cannot continue,” Grossman said. Ingrid Skop, the chairman-elect of AAPLOG, agrees. She told Vox she would call what happens in an ectopic pregnancy “an inevitable spontaneous abortion.” But, she says, her course as a doctor is clear: “regardless of when I intervene, that pregnancy’s going to die, but if I intervene earlier, then I’m going to leave that mom a much better chance of doing well than if I leave it alone and wait for it to rupture.” In the case of an ectopic pregnancy, waiting can be very dangerous. In some cases, when doctors can tell that pregnancy hormones are dropping, it may be safe to let a miscarriage happen on its own, Grossman said. But those patients need careful monitoring, and they are in the minority. In general, “it’s critical that when the ectopic pregnancy is identified that treatment be given because this is a very serious condition,” he said. Overall, ectopic pregnancy is the top cause of maternal mortality in the first trimester, Grossman added. Boorman also argues that more research is needed to determine if embryos can be surgically removed from the fallopian tube and reimplanted in the uterus. But because the option of abortion exists, she writes, such research isn’t being pursued. “As long as abortion is legal, it is the go-to ‘preventative’ solution for ectopic pregnancies,” Boorman writes. “As long as the tiny life is expendable, why not just kill it to be on the ‘safe side’ and move on?” However, according to Grossman, “there is no evidence” that transplanting an ectopic pregnancy into the uterus is safe or effective. Meanwhile, Skop says that, “to my knowledge we are nowhere near having the technology to do that.” The idea of transplanting an ectopic pregnancy from the fallopian tube into the uterus has made its way into public policy debates. An Ohio bill introduced earlier this year to ban most private insurance coverage for abortion included a provision allowing insurance companies to cover “a procedure for an ectopic pregnancy that is intended to reimplant the fertilized ovum into the pregnant woman’s uterus.” The bill, which has not yet passed, may be an attempt to ensure coverage for the procedure in case it becomes possible at a later date, or to incentivize researchers to develop such a procedure. In general, though, doctors, including those who identify as pro-life, say the science is clear: ectopic pregnancies are not viable, there’s currently no way to transplant them, and if left alone, they can and do result in a pregnant person’s death. Misinformation about ectopic pregnancy could have real-world effects, doctors and reproductive-health advocates say. It’s connected to a larger anti-abortion argument “that abortion is never medically necessarily,” Grossman said. Indeed, Boorman writes that the “conventional wisdom” that ectopic pregnancies are dangerous and non-viable needs to be challenged in order to “wake up the whole world to the fact that abortion is never the answer and galvanize citizens to demand an end to the abominable practice — with no exceptions.” But doctors — and patients — say that abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy is very necessary indeed. “If you have never treated a woman with a belly full of blood from an ectopic you should shut the fuck up and sit down and learn before you get someone killed,” Dr. Jen Gunter, an ob-gyn and author of the recent book, The Vagina Bible, wrote on Twitter on Monday. She also retweeted doctor and patient stories of ectopic pregnancies, including stories of “shredded” fallopian tubes, massive blood loss, and friends and family lost to ectopic pregnancies caught too late. Meanwhile, false claims about ectopic pregnancies could put patients in danger, Grossman said. “Often these are desired pregnancies,” he explained, and claims that they can be viable “could lead some patients to really question the advice of their doctor and maybe wait longer before getting the necessary treatment and put their lives at risk.”",https://www.vox.com/2019/9/11/20859034/ectopic-pregnancy-abortion-federalist-intrauterine-ohio-surgery,11808
Men and women have similar views on abortion,Matthew Yglesias,2019-05-20T16:30:00+00:00,"It’s typical in progressive circles to assume that abortion politics is heavily driven by gender, reflecting the left’s conviction that the legality of abortion is fundamentally a question of women’s rights and bodily autonomy. Polls, however, tend to show only very modest gender gaps in views of abortion. Women and men in the United States and elsewhere generally hold similar opinions — even as Democrats and Republicans offer drastically different ones. This is particularly striking because gender-based opinion gaps are a widespread feature of politics both worldwide and in the US specifically. American women are far more likely to approve of the expansion of government programs than men, for example. Abortion just doesn’t happen to be one of the issues that display a notably large gender gap. In 2015, Vox and PerryUndem partnered on a polling project that tried to capture the full nuance of America’s views on abortion. One of the things it showed is that Americans do not understand broad ideological terms like “pro-life” and “pro-choice” in rigid ways or even necessarily see them as mutually exclusive. It also showed that men and women are equally likely to describe themselves as pro-choice, while women are slightly more likely than men to describe themselves as pro-life. Other polling that asks different questions reached broadly similar conclusions. In Gallup’s time-series data, women are modestly more likely to say abortion should be legal under all circumstances but also slightly more likely to say abortion should never be legal. And this is not a quirk of American politics. Pew has a big international comparison showing how many people say abortion should be legal “in all or most cases” across countries. It finds very large gender gaps in a handful of countries like Armenia and Portugal, but the much more common situation is for women to be friendlier to legal abortion but only very slightly so. There is some indication that this may be different at an elite level. It’s striking, for example, that both of the Republican senators who nominally support abortion rights are women. But this also could be a coincidence (Lisa Murkowski’s career has been very idiosyncratic) and may be better explained by the fact that Alaska and Maine have a demographically unusual combination of a very high white working-class population share and low church attendance. Be that as it may, the relative lack of gender gap on abortion is especially striking because much bigger gender gaps are a regular aspect of American politics. Pew’s polling, for example, shows a long-term gap between men and women on the basic question of whether the government should provide more public services — a gap that has been growing in recent years. Even before this Trump-era widening of disagreement about the desirability of a larger and more activist government, this was a bigger gender gap than was registered for abortion-related questions. Similarly, according to Augusta University’s Mary-Kate Lizotte, an expert in the gender gap in political behavior, “attitudes about military force exhibit a gender gap of 8 to 12 percentage points on average, with women less supportive of military interventions such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.” In a practical sense, women’s more left-wing views on economic policy and national security issues mean that women are substantially more likely to vote for Democratic Party politicians. And as elected officials tend toward more extreme views on abortion than the general public, this means that in practice, women’s political participation has a big impact on the legal status of abortion. But this is not driven by any particularly large disagreement between men and women on abortion policy itself.",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18629644/abortion-gender-gap-public-opinion,11808
The power and limits of using executive orders to protect abortion rights,Ellen Ioanes,2022-06-11T21:06:11+00:00,,https://www.vox.com/2022/6/11/23163781/roe-v-wade-scotus-biden-abortion-executive-orders,11808
7 governor’s races that are abortion battlegrounds,Nicole Narea,2022-11-02T18:17:09+00:00,"The US Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has raised the stakes of competitive governor’s races in 2022, with Democratic and Republican candidates advocating for competing visions of abortion access. In some states, Democrats hope to wield veto power over legislation from Republican-controlled state legislatures that want to curb abortion rights. Elsewhere, Republicans want to use governorships to defend existing state laws restricting abortion and are charting a path to further curb access to the procedure. As has been the case in many national races, GOP gubernatorial candidates have generally been less vocal about their stance on abortion than their Democratic opponents. But Democrats and their allies have been working to put abortion front and center in races for governorships, which represent a key bulwark against further state restrictions on abortion. Whether that’s an effective strategy for Democrats remains to be seen. Surveys have shown that abortion rights are a major galvanizing force among young women, many of whom see it as the most important issue influencing their vote. But likely voters overall, both Democrat and Republican, have consistently ranked abortion well below their other top motivating issues, including the economy and inflation. In battleground states, gubernatorial candidates are presenting a fairly binary choice between further restricting abortion rights and protecting access. But it’s not clear whether there’s enough enthusiasm around the issue to push Democratic candidates over the edge. Here are the governor’s races to watch: Incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a law in 2019 that he then called the “toughest abortion bill in the country.” While that may have played well with his base, it’s not in sync with most of his constituency: an October University of Georgia poll found that 62 percent of likely voters opposed the ban. Democrat Stacey Abrams is hoping that opposition can help her close a gap of just over 6 percentage points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average, between her and Kemp before Election Day. The 2019 law bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they are pregnant, with exceptions in cases involving rape and incest when a police report has been filed, where the pregnant person’s life is at risk, and where the fetus has a “profound and irremediable congenital or chromosomal anomaly that is incompatible with sustaining life after birth.” Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern has argued that it would allow prosecutors to file criminal charges against people who get abortions and target people who miscarry. The ban could be blocked by the courts, where a legal battle over its constitutionality is ongoing. Abrams, who supports legal abortion up to fetal viability, has vowed to work to repeal the law should she become governor, and has argued that Kemp could pose additional threats to women. “We know that Brian Kemp has already signaled his, at least an ambiguity, about how he feels about birth control and the laws that govern birth control access,” she said in June. “And so it is very, very dangerous for women in Georgia right now.” It’s not clear whether Kemp would support even harsher restrictions on abortion if reelected. In a debate Sunday, he said he had no “desire to go move the needle any further” on abortion restrictions, but would consider any law passed by state lawmakers “when the time comes.” Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, who is term-limited, has for years been a last line of defense against the GOP-controlled state legislature’s efforts to enact abortion bans. Most recently, the legislature has advanced a constitutional amendment that states there is no right to an abortion or state funding for abortions. Democrats are hoping they can replace Wolf with their candidate Josh Shapiro, the current state attorney general. Otherwise, the future of abortion rights in the state looks grim. State Sen. Doug Mastriano — the far-right Republican candidate who is trailing Shapiro by nearly 10 percentage points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average — sponsored a bill to ban abortion at about six weeks, has called the pro-abortion rights slogan “my body, my choice” “ridiculous nonsense,” and shared a cartoon that characterized the original Roe v. Wade decision as “so much” worse than the Holocaust. He also said during a primary debate that banning abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, was his “number one issue” and that he supports criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions. Democrats are counting on Pennsylvania voters being turned off by Mastriano’s extreme positions on abortion, as well as his efforts to amplify former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election lies. A New York Times analysis of several polls conducted over the past decade found that, on average, 53 percent of Pennsylvania voters believed that abortion should be mostly legal. And voters have ranked abortion as the second-most important electoral issue, after the economy and inflation, according to an October USA Today Network/Suffolk University poll. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has for months been fighting Michigan’s pre-Roe abortion ban, which was first enacted in 1931 and has no exceptions for rape or incest. Currently, abortion is legal in Michigan up to fetal viability, which is generally around 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy. However, Republicans in the state legislature have repeatedly voted against repealing the 1931 abortion ban and have gone to court to defend it. The ban is currently blocked from going into effect while the legal battle plays out. Whitmer herself has also separately asked the Michigan Supreme Court to strike it down and affirm that the state constitution includes the right to access an abortion. The majority of Michigan voters appear to be behind Whitmer on abortion: Between 52 and 64 percent of likely voters said they would vote for a ballot measure codifying abortion rights in the state constitution in polls conducted since September. Other polls dating back to 2018 (conducted by pollster Bernie Porn and EPIC-MRA) have shown that the majority of Michiganders consistently support abortion rights. Whitmer is favored slightly in a tough fight for reelection against Trump-endorsed Republican Tudor Dixon, who said in a debate last month that she is “pro-life with exceptions for the life of the mother,” but did not say whether she would allow prosecutions in cases of rape or incest. Dixon also argued during the debate that she wouldn’t have much power over abortion policy in Michigan if elected, especially if the abortion rights ballot initiative is approved by voters. She has said that she would respect the results of that ballot initiative, but Whitmer contested that claim during the debate. According to FiveThirtyEight, Whitmer is polling just 5 percentage points ahead of Dixon on average, and several October polls have shown her ahead by even smaller margins. Whitmer’s defense of abortion rights could give her something of an edge, since voters ranked it as their second-most important issue after the economy in an October Emerson poll. Incumbent Gov. Laura Kelly is one of four Democratic governors in states that voted for Trump in 2020, and she’s sought to make the race about kitchen table issues, rather than abortion. FiveThirtyEight slightly favors her to win over her Republican challenger, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, with a October Emerson College poll showing her up by 5 points. Kelly, who is pro-choice, has rarely spoken about abortion on the campaign trail, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a big issue. It’s impossible to ignore that roughly 47 percent of eligible voters — more than 900,000 Kansans — cast ballots on the issue during their August 2 primaries, and soundly rejected an anti-abortion ballot initiative, 59 percent to 41 percent, with turnout well exceeding expectations. The measure would have “affirm[ed] there is no Kansas constitutional right to abortion or to require the government funding of abortion.” It would have also codified the state legislature’s power to pass laws that regulate abortion, including in cases of rape or incest, or when necessary to save the life of the mother. The failure of the amendment might have energized Democrats in the state against Schmidt, who has said that he would “prefer a future with less abortion, not more,” and wants to preserve existing limits on late-term abortions, requirements that parents be notified when minors seek abortion, and prohibitions on using taxpayer funds to pay for abortion. But Kelly will also need independents and some disaffected Republicans to win. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Tony Evers — who is locked in a dead heat with his Republican opponent, Tim Michels — has called for a special legislative session to repeal existing abortion restrictions in the state. A 173-year-old abortion ban makes no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest but does allow the procedure when the pregnant person’s life is in danger. Under that ban, doctors who perform an abortion could face up to six years in prison and $10,000 in fines, though Evers has offered clemency to those doctors. That call for a special session was rejected by the GOP-controlled state legislature, which has repeatedly sent anti-abortion bills to Evers’s desk. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has said he will not enforce the ban, though he can’t stop local law enforcement officials from doing so. Should Evers lose reelection, it would mean that Republicans, who are expected to maintain control of the legislature, might actually be able to fully enforce the ban. But most Wisconsinites seem to oppose the idea: 60 percent oppose the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe, according to an October Marquette University Law School poll. Previous Marquette polls conducted over the past decade have consistently shown that about 6 in 10 Wisconsinites support abortion rights in all or most cases. Some 90 percent of Nevada voters believe abortion should be legal under some or all circumstances, according to an October 2021 Predictive Insights poll, and for now, it’s protected until 24 weeks of pregnancy under a 1990 referendum. A Pew survey from 2014 also found majority support for legal abortion. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who is running for reelection, has vowed to make sure abortion stays legal, especially given that abortion providers are expecting an influx of patients from neighboring states including Arizona, Idaho, and Utah that have banned abortion or are poised to do so. His GOP opponent, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, hasn’t embraced any specific restrictions on abortion but has said he would be a “pro-life governor” and that he believes most Nevadans want fewer abortions. Sisolak, who is neck-and-neck with Lombardo in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average, has gone on the offensive against Lombardo for saying that he would consider restrictions on contraception and waiting periods for abortions. Lombardo’s campaign has sought to walk back those comments, saying that he “never said he would limit contraceptive access, nor does he have any intention to.” That could make a difference in a race where nearly 18 percent of likely voters rated abortion as their top issue, according to a September Emerson College poll. Arizona’s GOP-controlled state legislature passed legislation earlier this year that banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest. But the state also has a 121-year-old total abortion ban on the books, which only has an exception for when the life of the pregnant person is in jeopardy. It went into effect immediately after the Supreme Court’s decision. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey is term-limited, and the Republican running to succeed him, Trump-endorsed Kari Lake, is avidly anti-abortion. She has supported the 15-week ban and the pre-Roe ban, which she has called “a great law that’s already on the books.” She has also called abortion “the ultimate sin,” said abortion pills should be illegal, and said she would support banning abortion around six weeks of pregnancy. The Democratic nominee, current Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, has called for the repeal of both the pre-Roe ban and the 15-week ban. The vast majority of Arizona voters appear to support abortion rights. A September OH Predictive insights poll found that 9 in 10 voters agree that abortion should be legal in at least some cases, and 64 percent see it as an issue that would impact their decision on who they’ll vote for.

The Supreme Incompetents,NA,2024-07-08T15:15:00+00:00,,https://www.vox.com/abortion,11808
Black women will suffer the most without Roe,Fabiola Cineas,2022-06-29T17:20:00+00:00,"The United States is now a country without a legal right to an abortion. In this new reality, Black women will suffer the most. Black women are more likely to live in areas where it’s harder to access contraception. They get abortions at the highest rates compared to women of other races, due to high rates of unintended pregnancy. The factors that lead some Black women to seek abortions are present from the day they are born, passed down from mothers who faced similar plights. Those born into poverty are less likely to have access to health care, let alone reproductive or maternal health care; when some Black women are able to seek care, they facemedical racism. For centuries, Black women have fought for autonomy over their bodies, against government-sanctioned abuse and abuse from intimate partners.The end of a constitutional right to legal abortion makes the fight harder. State-level abortion restrictions have already taken effect in at least eight states, and in total, 22 states have laws that impose very strict restrictions on abortions. Those states are home to 39 percent of the total US population, but 45 percent of Black women and girls under age 55. The consequences will be dire. The end of legal abortion will trap Black women in cycles of poverty. The consequences will also be deadly. Black women have the highest rates of maternal mortality and pregnancy complications, and those risks will only increase if more Black women have to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. Here are the numbers that show how alarming the situation is. Black women make up the largest percentage of all abortions performed and have the highest abortion rate, according to 2019 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most recent year for which the CDC reported this information. Out of 629,898 abortions reported to the CDC for 2019, Black women accounted for 38.4 percent of them. By comparison, white women made up 33.4 percent of those abortions. Abortion rates were 3.6 times higher among Black women when compared to white women. The disparity can be explained by inequities in rates of unintended pregnancies, as well as other factors:unequal access to quality family planning services, economic disadvantage, and distrust of the medical system. Black people are less likely to receive comprehensive sex education, a key factor in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Evaluations of sex education programs have found that they can help young people delay the onset of sexual activity, reduce the number of partners, and increase contraceptive use. One study found that teens who received comprehensive sex education were 50 percent less likely to report a pregnancy than those who received abstinence-only education. According to one report, Black youth, low-income youth, and youth from single-parent households were less likely to get formal sex ed, and Black youth were more likely to receive abstinence-only education, “which is ineffective and stigmatizing.” This is despite the fact that another survey found that most Black people favor comprehensive sex education for young adults. Access to contraception like birth control and condomsalso reduces the rate at which women have unplanned pregnancies and seek abortions. Yet Black women are more likely to live in “contraception deserts,” areas where barriers to purchasing contraceptives are higher. As a result, Black women ages 15 to 49 are less likely than other racial groups to use birth control regularly. They are also less likely to use prescription contraception, such as birth control pills and long-acting reversible contraceptives (like an IUD or a birth control arm implant), the most effective forms of birth control after abstinence and permanent sterilization. Those between 18 and 24 tend to prefer condoms, which are a less effective way to prevent pregnancy. The racial gap in contraception access and use is rooted in social and structural racism and discrimination. For one, it’s difficult to access prescription birth control without health insurance. Black women and girls are uninsured at roughly twice the rate of white women and girls, according to data from 2020. Black women in the South, where a number of abortion bans will take effect, have the lowest rates of health insurance coverage among all Black women. Some Southern states like Mississippi have refused to expand Medicaid coverage, which has prevented Black women in those states from having better health outcomes. Black women in Medicaid expansion states have experienced fewer maternal deaths than those in non-expansion states. Overall, Black women have less access to quality health care, and less trust in medical professionals who might recommend birth control. The medical profession has a history of pressuring Black women and other women of color to limit their family sizes and consider tubal sterilization. After all, the American “father of modern gynecology” experimented on enslaved Black women in the 19th century without anesthesia. More than one-third of Black women in a 2005 survey believed that “medical and public health institutions use poor and minority people as guinea pigs to try out new birth control methods.” Researchers in a 2019 study found that Black women tend to live near pharmacies that “impede the purchase of contraception.” The obstacles are many: limited hours, fewer female pharmacists, fewer patient brochures on contraception, condoms that are difficult to access, and fewer self-checkout options. And when they obtain contraception, it’s more likely to fail: Another report found that Black women and women with low socioeconomic status also have higher rates of contraceptive failure than white and high socioeconomic status women, even when using more effective forms of contraception. In 2011, the latest year for which data is available, 48 percent of all pregnancies in the United States were unintended, meaning they were unplanned, mistimed, or unwanted at the time of conception. Black women are disproportionally at risk for unintended pregnancy: 63 percent of all pregnancies for Black women were unintended, compared to 42 percent for white women. The study found that women who experience unintended pregnancy have a significant risk of sickness and death. They are also more likely to be poor and to have inadequate access to reliable and affordable contraception. The 13 states with trigger bans — locations where abortion will be prohibited within 30 days of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, whichoverturned 1973’s Roe v. Wade — are mostly located in the South, where nearly half of the country’s Black population resides. In Mississippi, the state that filed Dobbs, Black women got 74 percent of abortions provided in 2019. In Alabama, where an abortion ban went into effect the day the decision came down,it was 62 percent;in Georgia, where abortions after six weeks may soon be banned if a judge grants the state’s request to allow a 2019 lawto take effect, 65 percent. Black women are alsoless likely to have the financial means to afford out-of-state travel for a time-sensitive abortion. Four in 10 Black women ages 18 to 44 could not afford more than $10 for birth control, according to a 2017 survey, while 46 percent of Black mothers of children under 18 said they could afford $10 or less. Black women have the highest maternal mortality rate in the United States — 55.3 per 100,000 live births for 2020, according to CDC data — which means they are more likely to die while pregnant, during delivery, or in the postpartum period. That year, Black women were 2.9 times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related issue than white women. And the rate has only increased in recent years, growing from 37.3 per 100,000 births in 2018 to 55.3 in 2020. The CDC attributed Black women’s high maternal mortality rate to factors like access to care, quality of care, prevalence of chronic diseases, structural racism, and implicit biases. Pregnancy complications are the sixth leading cause of death among Black women ages 20 to 44, while pregnancy complications do not rank in the top 10 causes of death for any group of white women. Black women of all education and income backgrounds face the threat of dying in pregnancy and childbirth. A 2016 report found that Black college-educated moms were more likely to suffer severe complications in pregnancy and childbirth than white women who never graduated from high school. A full abortion ban could increase Black maternal deaths by 33 percent, compared to a 21 percent increase for the overall population, according to a recent study. Mississippi has some of the worst maternal mortality and infant mortality rates in the United States. The state’s maternal mortality rate is 33 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. For Black women, that number is 51.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, nearly three times the number for white women, 18.9. And when Black women don’t die from pregnancy, their pregnancies have riskier complications. This is why some abortions are performed to save lives, though some anti-abortion activists want these exceptions removed from legislation. Rates of ectopic pregnancies — pregnancies in which the egg does not make it to the uterus and instead implants somewhere outside of it, like in a fallopian tube — arehigher for Black women, and are the fifth top cause of maternal death. Black women face some of the highest rates of domestic abuse and violence, a factor that contributes to sexual and reproductive coercion — behaviors related to reproductive health that a partner uses to control the relationship. In one survey, 20 percent of Black women reported that they were made to have sex without a condom when they did not want to. The figure rose to 26 percent for Black mothers. The inability of Black women to get abortions can lead to greater intimate partner violence. One study found that homicide is the leading cause of death among pregnant and postpartum people and that Black women were at greatest risk. Black women had a “threefold higher partner rate of partner homicide victimization” than white women, a researcher told The Lily, and pregnant Black women were “eight times more likely to be killed by their intimate partner than non-pregnant Black women.” Researchers explained that Black women’s high rate of unwanted pregnancy is linked to “partner conflict, stress, and violence.” The landmark decade-long Turnaway Study,which studied women who wanted abortions but were unable to obtain them, found that women who were “turned away” from abortions were more likely to experience continued domestic violence. On top of this, Black women are less likely to report abuse since they are less likely to be believed, causing psychological trauma. Medical professionals also tend to systematically undertreat them for pain due to medical biases. Unintended pregnancies that lead to unwanted births create cycles of disadvantage for Black women. Since the pregnancies and births are unplanned, these women are often “forced to make compromises in education and in employment opportunities that subsequently lead to poverty and lower education attainment.” Being denied an abortion leads to an increase in financial distress that persists for years, according to a recent study. More than 80 percent of Black mothers are breadwinners, which means they are either the sole earners or earning at least 40 percent of their household’s income. Black women are twice as likely as white women to be the sole breadwinners for their families. Nearly one in four Black women lives in poverty and, though they make up only 12.8 percent of all women in the US population, represent 22.3 percent of women in poverty. The gender wage gap, the gender wealth gap, and segregation into low-paying jobs all limit their employment opportunities. The cycle affects their children. The infant mortality rate for Black babies is twice that for white babies. Pregnant Black women are more likely to receive inadequate or delayed prenatal care, and to have poor health outcomes such as low infant birthweight. Their children are also more likely to face developmental delays, poverty, poorer relationships with their mother, neglect, behavioral problems, and lower educational achievement. States with abortion restrictions tend to have fewer policies that support parents raising children. While the US ranks near the bottom compared to peer countries for many of these measures, states with abortion restrictions in particular tend not to have paid family leave legislation, to rank especially low on women’s income, to have a lot of uninsured women, and to lack quality child care. These trends are sure to worsen the intergenerational cycles of disadvantage that many Black women are stuck in.",https://www.vox.com/2022/6/29/23187002/black-women-abortion-access-roe,11808
"What two years without Roe looks like, in 8 charts",Nicole Narea,2024-06-24T11:00:00+00:00,"For 49 years after Roe v. Wade, Americans had the right to obtain an abortion if they became pregnant. Then, two years ago, with Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court put an end to it. The Biden administration and some blue states — supported by a network of nonprofits focused on reproductive care — aggressively sought to compensate, while many red states enacted near-total bans on abortion. But Dobbs has nevertheless had a devastating effect on pregnant people in huge swaths of the country. While the number of abortions across the country actually increased last year — thanks in large part to increasingly cheap and accessible medication abortion — that has not changed the fundamental realities of post-Dobbs America. Large reproductive care deserts have emerged in which there are no abortion providers for hundreds of miles. Pregnant people are being denied necessary medical care as their doctors fear the legal repercussions of providing it. All of this has exacerbated long-standing inequities. Both abortion bans and attacks on reproductive rights are broadly unpopular, and elections in the years since Dobbs showed that abortion rights were a potent motivating issue for voters. But in this year’s matchup between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump — both of whom have been reluctant messengers of their party’s stance on abortion — there’s a question as to whether the issue will continue to motivate American voters. This is part of Vox’s series exploring the realities of American life and policy as the presidential campaign ramps up. Read more: It is not too late for their votes to make a difference for reproductive access. It may seem like the worst has already come to pass for the abortion rights movement: though once protected by the constitution nationally, access now increasingly depends on where you live or whether you can afford to travel for the care you need. But Republicans have also made clear that they have no intention of stopping there. In the wake of Dobbs, 13 states immediately implemented “trigger” bans on abortion, while others sought to enforce abortion restrictions that were on the books before Roe v. Wade was even decided in 1973 or quickly moved to pass new bans on abortion. A new patchwork of abortion laws was established in the US within months. A total of 14 states have enacted near-total bans on abortion. Many of these bans involved narrow medical exceptions in which abortions could be performed when the health or life of the mother was at risk. But those exceptions have proved exceptionally difficult — in some states, nigh impossible — to qualify for. Kate Cox, a Texas woman, was notably denied an abortion even though her fetus was diagnosed with a rare and terminal genetic condition and forced to travel out of state to obtain one. Other women have been forced to carry to term fetuses doctors know will die shortly upon birth, or been denied abortion care even after experiencing a miscarriage that leaves them in medical distress. The Texas Supreme Court also ruled against a group of 20 women who claimed that they had been denied medically necessary abortions. Republicans aren’t stopping now that they have overturned Roe. They have continued to advocate for a national abortion ban, even though Trump has indicated that he would not sign it, and opened up new attacks on contraception and in vitro fertilization. If Trump wins the election, he could also order the FDA to rescind its approval of the abortion drug mifepristone after the Supreme Court left open that possibility in a recent ruling upholding access to the drug for now. In short: The dust has still yet to settle post-Dobbs, but it’s clear that abortion was only Republicans’ first target in a larger war on reproductive freedom. Despite the new restrictions on abortion in many parts of the country, the number of abortions performed nationally has actually gone up slightly since Dobbs. But it would be a mistake to see that statistic and say that everyone has improved access to abortion equally across the US. “While the numbers have gone up a bit nationally, in some states, there are virtually no abortions happening,” at least in a formal health care setting, said Usha Ranji, associate director for women’s health policy at KFF, a health policy research and news organization. The use of medication abortion, which can end a pregnancy during the first trimester, has gone up in particular. Though it was already the most common method of obtaining an abortion pre-Dobbs, it is now cheaper and easier to obtain quickly, especially via telemedicine. That’s because, amid the pandemic, the FDA suspended the requirement that mifepristone be dispensed in person, resulting in an explosion of telemedicine abortion services. However, 19 states have banned telemedicine abortion: Five do so explicitly, and the other 14 require that a prescribing clinician be physically present with the patient. Some states also require counseling or an ultrasound prior to administering an abortion, which can rule out obtaining medication abortion via telemedicine. That has caused some patients to turn to community networks or websites that sell abortion pills without interacting with a clinician or pharmacy. All of this is a reflection of the monumental effort in states without bans to scale up care, as well as the flood of donations to abortion funds post-Dobbs. New Mexico, for instance, dedicated $10 million to building a new abortion clinic that opened last year on its border with Texas, which has banned abortion with limited exceptions. But the question is whether this patchwork solution is sustainable in the long run, especially given that those funds are drying up. And it doesn’t entirely mitigate the impact of abortion bans, which have created maternal care deserts across large tracts of the southern US and Midwest. “There are still people who are not getting abortions that they would want in part because not everybody can travel,” Ranji said. Travel might be difficult for both logistical and financial reasons. And poor women are disproportionately affected: Those women (defined as those who live under 200 percent of the poverty line, which was $46,060 for a family of three in 2022) are concentrated in the 14 states that have banned abortion and the 11 states that have passed strict gestational limits on abortion. Though they may be candidates for medication abortion, they are less likely to know about it as an option — a messaging challenge that abortion activists are struggling to overcome. 
There is also growing evidence that the Dobbs decision has had an adverse effect on maternal health outcomes, including maternal mortality. However, only two years have passed since Dobbs and the number of annual maternal deaths is too small (even if maternal mortality is higher in the US than in any other high-income nation) to determine any trends that have emerged just yet. So for now, the best information is based on statistical modeling. Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder projected based on 2020 data on maternal outcomes that, if no abortions were performed nationally, there would be an overall 24 percent increase in maternal deaths after a year. Black mothers would see the biggest increase in mortality. “These communities that have historically been harmed will continue to bear the brunt of this abortion care crisis that we’re in,” said Candace Gibson, state policy director at Guttmacher, a nonprofit that researches abortion policy. Anecdotally, physicians have also reported concerns about their ability to provide adequate reproductive care since the Dobbs decision came down. A KFF national survey of OBGYNs found that significant shares of respondents were concerned about their ability to administer a level of care consistent with the medical profession’s standards, their potential legal liability in states where abortion is banned, and health outcomes for their patients. In states where abortion is banned or restricted, for example, six in 10 OBGYNs say their decision-making autonomy has become worse since the Dobbs ruling. “They’re in this place where they have to really contemplate whether they continue to provide care within that state, or whether they leave the state so that they can actually practice medicine in a way that complies with the standards of care,” Gibson said. Republicans’ opposition to abortion rights has proved a thorn in their side electorally ever since Dobbs came down. In 2022, Democrats running on abortion rights nearly swept the table. Every ballot initiative aimed at restricting abortion lost, including those in Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana. Meanwhile, ballot initiatives strengthening abortion rights prevailed in states including Michigan, Vermont, and California and even outperformed Democratic candidates in some cases. In 2023, Ohio also passed a ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in its state constitution. And Democrats were able to flip the Virginia House of Delegates and maintain control of the state senate after Republican Gov. Glen Youngkin committed to a 15-week abortion ban. Abortion has proved a key motivating issue in these off-cycle years. The question is whether it can continue to be the same force in a presidential election year. That may be the case in a handful of states, especially when it comes to the four upcoming ballot measures aimed at expanding abortion rights. In Florida, a six-week abortion ban that recently went into effect could be overridden by a ballot measure seeking to protect abortion until fetal viability, which is estimated around 24 weeks of pregnancy. But at the top of the ticket, the potential impact of abortion is less clear at a moment when other issues, including the economy and immigration, are dominating the national conversation. Critically, low-propensity voters — those who Biden is struggling with and who could decide this election either because they stay home or lean toward Trump — don’t rank abortion rights among the top issues they care about, even though they are broadly pro-abortion rights. But turnout in this election is projected to be lower than in 2020 due to voter apathy over a rematch between Biden and Trump. Some commentators argue that low turnout might actually help Democrats, in a turnabout for recent American politics. But abortion could help boost turnout in a way that helps Biden, said Tom Bonier, a Democratic political strategist and the senior adviser to TargetSmart, a data and polling firm. But first, he has to overcome a clear messaging problem: 17 percent of voters overall and 12 percent of Democrats blame President Biden for the end of Roe, according to New York Times/Siena College polls and a Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena poll in battleground states. Some less-engaged voters inaccurately associate the overturn with Biden because he was president when the conservative-controlled Supreme Court issued the decision. But it also shows that Biden — who as a Catholic has been at times an uncomfortable messenger of his party’s pro-abortion rights stance — has room to persuade voters. “One of the jobs in front of Democratic campaigns, including the president’s campaign, is [to] spend time communicating with these voters and make sure that they understand the reality,” Bonier said. “I don’t think that most voters are aware of what Republicans are doing, unless they’re in the states where it’s happening. But I do think those issues will have a substantial impact on the election as that is communicated to more voters.”",https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court,11808
The history of Arizona’s Civil War-era abortion ban,Nicole Narea,2024-05-01T21:15:00+00:00,"Arizona lawmakers voted Wednesday to repeal a Civil War-era state law that amounts to a near-total ban on abortion following an Arizona Supreme Court ruling last month that the law could be enforced. Democrats in the chamber — as well as both former President Donald Trump and Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake, in an election-year shift toward a more moderate stance on abortion — hadpushed the Arizona legislature to overturn the law. If it had gone into effect, it would have threatened access to reproductive care for about 1.6 million people of reproductive age. It’s one of several abortion laws enacted before the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that had been revived since the justices overturned Roe in 2022. Resuscitating these laws has created legal headaches, in part because they were written in a very different time for reasons that have little in common with the concerns of anti-abortion advocates today. Arizona’s ban, first passed in 1864 and codified again in 1901 and 1913, says anyone who “provides, supplies or administers” an abortion or abortion drugs will face a state prison sentence of two to five years unless the abortion is necessary to save the life of the person who is pregnant. Taken out of the 19th-century context in which it was passed, that language would seem to amount to a near-total ban on abortion. But that’s not how the law was originally enforced. Few people were prosecuted under the Arizona law or similar ones in other states. At the time, first-trimester abortions were widespread and widely accepted in the public conscience. Abortion laws of the mid-1800s were the product of discussions among lawyers and doctors and were designed to professionalize abortion services and medicine writ large — a seemingly noble cause, but also one driven by physicians’ self-interests and the desire to both boost (white) women’s birth rates and weaken a nascent feminist movement. There was no national abortion debate to speak of. Religion wasn’t yet a major factor in Americans’ views on abortion in the way it is today, and scientists had not yet developed methods to detect pregnancy during the first months of gestation. All of that meant abortion was a common, if not always safe, part of American life, despite what the old laws might suggest. “I think people imagine nobody did it because it was illegal. But we know that’s not true,” said Lauren MacIvor Thompson, a history professor at Kennesaw State University focusing on women’s rights and public health. For much of the first half of the 19th century, there were few laws in the US that were specifically concerned with abortion. Rather, abortion was understood in the tradition of British common law: It was only a crime after “quickening,” when a fetus’s movement could be detected — around four or five months of gestation. Before quickening, people could be ignorant (or have plausible deniability) about being pregnant. Generally, the American public at this time had few moral qualms about abortion before quickening. In particular, it was a service that many believed should be offered to unmarried women, who risked reputational ruin if they proceeded with the pregnancy and often came from poor backgrounds, as historian James Mohr writes in his 1978 book, Abortion in America. But around the mid-1800s, things started to shift. More people appeared to be seeking abortions, not just those who were unmarried. One estimate by physicians at the time that Mohr cites suggests that as many as one in five pregnancies ended in abortion. Partially because of this, birth rates fell dramatically: from 7.04 children per woman in 1800 to 3.56 by 1900, according to Mohr. Starting around the 1830s, abortion became a lucrative industry. It was still mostly unregulated but perceived as largely safe, especially when weighed against the risks of pregnancy. There is little available data on maternal mortality rates in the US at the time, but even by 1915, after the development of antisepsis, it was about 600 in every 100,000 births — higher than in some European countries at the time. In 2021, the US maternal mortality rate was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births. As Mohr writes, home medical manuals and midwifery texts advised readers on abortifacient substances (such as black hellebore) and practices that could bring about an abortion (such as bloodletting and “raising great weights”). Abortifacient tonics of varying effectiveness were prolifically advertised. Physicians, midwives, and even untrained practitioners offeredprocedures to clear “obstructed menses.” One abortion provider to the elites, known as “Madame Restell,” amassed a fortune estimated at up to $1 million. Increased access to abortion seen throughout the 19th century led to increased scrutiny, however, and that led to many of the laws and attitudes still with us today. The anti-abortion movement began to take off in the 1850s for a few reasons. For one, anti-abortionists resented the fact that wealthy, white Protestant women were starting to drive demand for abortions, usually to limit their family size or delay having their first child. These women were seen as shirking their duties to “republican motherhood” — a concept that involved raising the next generation of productive citizens instilled with the values espoused by the young American republic and that excluded nonwhite women. They were maligned for indulging priorities outside of the home at a time when the women’s suffrage movement was taking shape. Some men were seen as complicit in this phenomenon, urging their wives to get abortions and paying for them. Anti-abortionists argued that laws specifically restricting abortion were necessary because otherwise, “nice white ladies who don’t want to be pregnant just won’t fulfill their obligation,” as MacIvor Thompson put it. Around this time, there were also a few highly publicized trials involving botched abortions, typically cases where the pregnant person died. This raised the profile of abortion as a safety issue for legislators. A broader movement to professionalize the American medical system also contributed to the first laws restricting abortion in the US. The Civil War laid bare the need for more competent medical professionals, and credentialed physicians known as “regulars” lobbied for laws on abortion for the stated reason of protecting people from quacks. But they also had selfish motivations to essentially establish a monopoly over the market for abortions and sideline their competition. Physicians — who, at that point, were nearly all white and male — had lost income and stature as a result of this competition with other medical practitioners, and performing abortions was a way to attract loyal long-term patients, Mohr writes. “What they’re trying to do is consolidate their professional dominance because they don’t want to be competing with midwives or competing with what they call ‘the irregulars,’” MacIvor Thompson said. This was despite the fact, she added, that the “outcomes that doctors got in terms of treating patients were really not that much better than people who didn’t have medical training.” The first standalone law to specifically prohibit abortion in the US was passed in Massachusetts in 1845. It made performing an abortion a misdemeanor for which an offender could serve five to seven years in jail and face up to a $2,000 fine — about $74,000 in 2024 dollars — or a felony in cases where the person having the procedure died. But as would be the case with others that came after it, the law was rarely enforced: No one was convicted under it between 1849 and 1857, according to Mohr. Generally, such early abortion laws mostly did not create penalties for the pregnant person who sought an abortion but only for those who performed them — and messed up. “Historians have argued that a lot of these initial laws were meant to protect women. They’re either next to poisoning laws, or they’re framed in a way where it’s like, this is to protect women from quacks,” said Shannon Withycombe, a history professor at the University of New Mexico who studies early abortion laws. Few religious leaders wanted to get involved in abortion politics. Some Catholic bishops espoused the position, as the church does now, that abortion is wrong because life begins at conception. But at the time, Catholicism was associated with European immigrants who weren’t “welcomed into white middle-class American society,” MacIvor Thompson said. However, Horatio Storer, a Harvard physician who converted to Catholicism in his 40s, set out to consolidate support for anti-abortion laws in the 1850s. He ultimately led the charge to criminalize those who sought abortions and to make the punishment more severe if the person was married. He even pushed physicians and legislators to abandon the earlier understanding of abortion as acceptable before quickening and to suppress it at any stage of pregnancy. Storer’s writings came to inform anti-abortion legislation across the country, though the physician lobby didn’t agree with everything he wrote. Many believed he had gone too far in framing abortion as a religious and moral issue, insisting that it was really a medical issue, Withycombe said. But physicians latched on to one particular point Storer made in his 1860 book On Criminal Abortion in America: that “doctors need to be able to practice abortion because there are lots of reasons why an abortion is important for the health and life of a woman,” Withycombe said. This supported physicians as the definitive source of medical expertise about when and how an abortion should be safely administered over other abortion practitioners. And Withycombe notes that in her readings of medical articles and obstetrical teaching texts of the time, she has found a broad array of circumstances in which physicians believed it was their medical duty to perform an abortion — including circumstances in which failing to do so wouldn’t necessarily result in a pregnant person’s death, such as “pernicious anemia,” “obstinate vomiting,” and “advancing jaundice.” Withycombe said the 1864 Arizona law was part of a wave of legislation, all with similar provisions informed by Storer’s writings, that swept the West in the 1860s while the Civil War was raging. Colorado passed a ban in 1861, Nevada in 1861, Idaho in 1864, and Montana in 1864. At the time, these states were trying to prove that they were part of modern America, emulating medical licensing laws and protections that had already been enacted in more cosmopolitan parts of the country. In that sense, the passage of these laws was more about professionalizing medicine than the moralistic arguments that later motivated the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal anti-obscenity law that also prohibited the mailing of “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” However, Storer’s moral philosophy on abortion did eventually gain traction, and it influenced the next wave of anti-abortion lawmaking in the decades thereafter. About 40 states banned abortion by 1880. Arizona isn’t alone in dealing with a pre-Roe anti-abortion law. Oklahoma is currently enforcing a 1910 abortion ban. Wisconsin’s Democratic attorney general has asked the state Supreme Court to strike down that state’s 1849 ban. Delaware, New Mexico, and Michigan have repealed their pre-Roe bans only in the last few years. West Virginia’s 19th-century ban was blocked in court in 2022, but the state legislature moved quickly to codify a new abortion ban that allows few exceptions. As part of the Arizona Supreme Court ruling, the state was supposed to ensure the 19th-century law was “harmonized” with a ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy passed in March 2022. It’s not clear what that meant in practice.But now that the Arizona legislature has repealed the law, it’s a moot issue. If lawmakers had not intervened, though, its enforcement would have looked very different from the way the law was interpreted in the years immediately after its passage. As mentioned, enforcement was spotty in the 19th century, and unlike now, abortion providers continued to operate despite facing potential legal repercussions. Producers of abortifacients often circumvented bans by using euphemistic language to describe their products. Early abortion laws, including the Arizona ban, also empowered physicians to make decisions about abortion. “A lot of these laws were at least supported if not written by physicians,” Withycombe said. “Physicians agreed that they have complete discretion over whether an abortion is medically necessary.” However, doctors have often been sidelined in the enforcement of abortion bans post-Roe, with many choosing to leave states with restrictive laws because they feel they cannot perform lifesaving care. The medical and popular understanding of pregnancy and abortion has also evolved since 1864. We can now detect pregnancy much earlier than “quickening” using urine and blood tests. In the 1860s, early abortions were generally seen as morally equivalent to contraception, Mohr writes — a concept that the American right largely rejects today. “These laws are being upheld as proof that everyone was completely against abortion in all cases, from the moment of conception,” Withycombe said. “Given the understanding of human development at the time, that is not true in the 1860s.” Update, May 1, 5:15 pm ET: This story was originally published on April 14 and has been updated multiple times, most recently with news that the Arizona legislature has repealed the 1864 ban.",https://www.vox.com/politics/24128840/arizona-abortion-total-ban-law-roe-court-1864-repeal,11808
Abortion will be considered unthinkable 50 years from now,Karen Swallow Prior,2019-04-03T13:24:57+00:00,"Part of Hindsight 2070: We asked 15 experts, “What do we do now that will be considered unthinkable in 50 years?” Here’s what they told us. Karen Swallow Prior is Professor of English at Liberty University and a research fellow with the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. She is the author ofOn Reading Well: Finding the Good Life through Great Books. The list of those who have had few or no legal rights throughout history is staggering: women, children, orphans, widows, Jews, gays and lesbians, slaves, former slaves, descendants of slaves, those with leprosy, undocumented immigrants — to name a few. Nothing marks the progress of any society more than the expansion of human rights to those who formerly lacked them. I believe that if such progress is to continue, prenatal human beings will be included in this group, and we will consider elective abortion primitive and cruel in the future. The eradication of abortion may be difficult to imagine. But consider how difficult it would have been for our grandparents to foresee a culture in which nearly one in four women has an abortion by age 45. Certainly, some factors leading to this situation reflect real and substantial progress for women: greater equality, more work options, improved understanding of sexuality, and increased moral agency. But rights for women that come at the expense of unborn children aren’t true liberation; they merely, as one writer put it, enable the “redistribution of oppression.” Before the first trimester is over (when the vast majority of abortions are performed), a tiny fetus the size of a fig kicks her feet, yawns, sucks her thumb, and demonstrates her left- or right-handedness. Her heartbeat and brain waves are detectable just a few weeks after conception. Clearly, such beings are human — and all human rights begin with the right to life. The fact that many abortion rights supporters wish abortion to be “rare” is an implicit acknowledgment of these undeniable, if inconvenient, truths. So what will it take to disentangle the sexual, familial, economic, and political threads of legal elective abortion that have become so tightly woven into our cultural fabric? I think we are beginning to see that unraveling now. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that abortion hit its lowest rate since Roe v. Wade: 11.8 per 1,000 women ages 15-44, a dramatic decline from a peak in the early 1980s that approached 30 per 1,000 women. It’s unclear whether this decrease is owing to increased use of contraceptives; delayed sexual activity among young people; the declining number of doctors willing to participate in abortions; a growing inability to deny — thanks to ultrasound technology, prenatal surgical interventions, and extravagant gender reveal parties — the insuppressible personality of the child in the womb; or a combination of all these factors. Whatever the cause, however, abortion is becoming less necessary and less desirable. Recent attempts in several states to expand access to late-term abortions in anticipation of the possible overturning of Roe not only violate the view of the majority (who support greater restrictions after the first trimester) but will be seen by future generations as a last, desperate show of stubbornness in the face of human progress. Every age has its blinders, constructed, usually, through a combination of ignorance and self-interest. Many things such as bloodletting and wet nurses that are seen as good or indispensable in one age are unthinkable in another. Our modern-day willingness to settle for sex apart from commitment, to accept the dereliction of duty by men who impregnate women (for men are the primary beneficiaries of liberal abortion laws), and to uphold the systematic suppression of sex’s creative energy and function are practices that people of other ages would have considered bizarre. As we enter late modernity and recognize the limits of the radical autonomy and individualism which have defined it, the pendulum will correct itself with a swing toward more communitarian and humane values that recognize the interdependency of all humans. When we do, we will look back at elective abortion and wonder — as we do now with polluting and smoking — why we so wholeheartedly embraced it. We will look at those ultrasound images of 11-week old fetuses somersaulting in the waters of the womb and lack words to explain to our grandchildren why we ever defended their willful destruction in the name of personal choice and why we harmed so many women to do so.",https://www.vox.com/2019/3/27/18194710/abortion-will-be-considered-unthinkable-50-years-from-now,11808
Why conservative Chief Justice Roberts just struck down an anti-abortion law,Ian Millhiser,2020-06-29T16:14:27+00:00,"The Supreme Court just delivered the narrowest, most temporary victory for abortion rights. Though Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative who votes fairly consistently to uphold abortion restrictions, cast the key fifth vote to strike down a Louisiana anti-abortion law, his opinion makes it clear that his views about abortion haven’t changed. The best reading of the Court’s decision in June Medical Services v. Russo is that Roberts just gave the constitutional right to an abortion a potentially very brief reprieve. And he did so largely because Louisiana presented the weakest possible case in June Medical. As Justice Stephen Breyer notes in his plurality opinion, June Medical involves a Louisiana law that is “almost word-for-word identical” to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck down four years ago in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (2016). Both laws require abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital near the clinic where they perform abortions in order to continue to provide them — a credential that is very difficult for abortion providers to obtain and that does little or nothing to improve health outcomes. The Court voted 4-1-4, with Justice Stephen Breyer writing a plurality opinion for himself and his three liberal colleagues, and Roberts writing a separate opinion emphasizing the narrowness of his approach to this case. Only one thing has changed between June Medical and Whole Woman’s Health. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a relatively moderate conservative who cast the key fifth vote to strike down the Texas law, is no longer on the Court. And his replacement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, opposes abortion rights. Kavanaugh dissented in June Medical. So abortion opponents apparently bet that the replacement of Kennedy with Kavanaugh would allow them to litigate Whole Woman’s Health all over again — but with a different result. They bet wrong. The fact that June Medical is almost entirely identical to Whole Woman’s Health forms the basis of Roberts’s opinion. “I joined the dissent in Whole Woman’s Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided,” the chief justice writes. Nevertheless, “the question today however is not whether Whole Woman’s Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case.” Ultimately, Roberts concludes that the principle of stare decisis — the doctrine that courts should generally be bound by their prior decisions — compels him to strike down Louisiana’s law. “The result in this case is controlled by our decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law,” Roberts concludes. As a practical matter, that means the constitutional right to an abortion is likely to survive for at least another year or two. But Roberts also signals that he’s open to a lawsuit challenging this right on other grounds. The takeaway from Roberts’s opinion isn’t that the right to an abortion is safe. It’s that Roberts is reluctant to bend the Court’s ordinary procedures to hand abortion opponents a victory in this particular case. The admitting privileges laws at issue in both Whole Woman’s Health and June Medical are what abortion rights advocates often refer to as “TRAP laws” — laws that superficially appear designed to make abortions safer but that actually impose burdens on abortion clinics while doing little or nothing to improve health outcomes. The ostensible purpose of an admitting privileges law is to allow abortion doctors to swiftly admit their patients to a hospital if that patient experiences complications. But such complications are exceedingly rare in abortion clinics. As the trial judge hearing June Medical determined, Louisiana abortion clinics almost never need to transfer a patient to a hospital — “far less than once a year, or less than one per several thousand patients.” And even in these exceedingly rare cases where a patient does experience complications requiring hospital care, hospitals don’t require a doctor with admitting privileges to sign off before the hospital treats the patient. If a patient shows up at the hospital’s emergency room, they will be treated. Meanwhile, admitting privileges are difficult to obtain, especially if a doctor’s entire practice focuses on treatments like abortion that rarely lead to hospitalization. Often, for example, hospitals impose a quota on doctors — requiring them to admit a certain number of patients to retain their privileges. So a doctor that only admits a patient once every few years will not be able to achieve their quota. The upshot is that, if Louisiana’s law went into full effect, only two of the state’s six abortion providers were expected to be able to obtain admitting privileges. That matters because, under the Court’s existing abortion decisions, as Justice Breyer writes, “‘[u]nnecessary health regulations’” impose an unconstitutional ‘undue burden’ if they have ‘the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.’” Shutting down two-thirds of the state’s abortion providers for no reason other than their inability to obtain an arbitrary credential has “the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.” Moreover, if the Court had allowed TRAP laws to exist, states could have potentially imposed far more restrictive laws until clinics were unable to operate and had to shut down entirely. Roberts ultimately concludes that he cannot uphold a law that is nearly word-for-word identical to another law that the Court struck down four years ago. But his opinion is laden with hints that, in a future case, he is likely to vote to restrict — or even eliminate — the constitutional right to an abortion. Roberts opens his opinion by declaring that he still believes that Whole Woman’s Health was “wrongly decided.” He notes that “neither party has asked us to reassess the constitutional validity” of the Court’s seminal abortion rights decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey(1992) — a hint that, if future litigants directly attack Casey, Roberts will welcome such a challenge. And he spends as much of his opinion attacking Breyer’s approach to this case as he does explaining why he reluctantly voted to honor stare decisis. Whole Woman’s Health, Roberts notes, states that “the rule announced in Casey ... requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.” But balancing these burdens against these benefits, Roberts suggests, is entirely beyond the capacity of the judiciary. In this context, courts applying a balancing test would be asked in essence to weigh the State’s interests in “protecting the potentiality of human life” and the health of the woman, on the one hand, against the woman’s liberty interest in defining her “own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life” on the other. There is no plausible sense in which anyone, let alone this Court, could objectively assign weight to such imponderable values and no meaningful way to compare them if there were. . . Pretending that we could pull that off would require us to act as legislators, not judges, and would result in nothing other than an “unanalyzed exercise of judicial will” in the guise of a “neutral utilitarian calculus.” In this sense, Roberts’s opinion harks back to Justice Bryon White’s dissenting opinion in Roe v. Wade (1973) itself, which similarly argued that courts are not competent to weigh the difficult moral questions presented by the abortion debate. “In a sensitive area such as this, involving as it does issues over which reasonable men may easily and heatedly differ,” White wrote in that dissent, courts should leave the question of abortion rights “with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs.” So the right to an abortion survives another day, but Roberts’s opinion is less an endorsement of the right than it is a warning that litigants should not overreach. The chief justice is unwilling to overrule a very recent precedent simply because one of his colleagues retired. But that does not mean that he will preserve Roe or Casey when a litigant asks him to overrule those decisions outright.",https://www.vox.com/2020/6/29/21306895/supreme-court-abortion-chief-justice-john-roberts-stephen-breyer-june-medical-russo,11808
The new front in the right’s war on abortion,Rachel M. Cohen,2023-01-09T11:00:00+00:00,"The Biden administration helped expand access to medication abortion last week, with the US Food and Drug Administration finalizing a rule to make the pills more readily available in pharmacies. But this effort to help patients get pills to end a pregnancy could be dwarfed by a major push to restrict access to the medication from anti-abortion leaders and their Republican allies. As lawmakers head back to statelegislatures this month, many for the first time since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, Republicans face new pressure to restrict access to the combination of abortion-inducing drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, used typically within the first 10 to 12 weeks of a pregnancy. Medication abortion has become the most common method for ending pregnancies in the United States, partly due to its safety record, itslower cost, diminished access to in-person care, and greater opportunities for privacy. Restricting access to the pills is not a new goal for the anti-abortion movement; the Guttmacher Institute tracked 118 medication abortion restrictions introduced last year across 22 states, and many conservative states already have laws on the books for dispensing the drugs that go beyond what the FDA requires and what leading health organizations recommend. But efforts to crack down on abortion pills have taken on new urgency since the Dobbs v. Jackson decision. More women are finding ways to bypass abortion bans through organizations like Aid Access in Europe, pill suppliers from Mexico, and methods like mail forwarding from states where abortion is legal. While a study from the Society of Family Planning estimated that legal abortions nationwide declined by more than 10,000 in the two months following the Supreme Court’s decision, some or many of those abortions may have been replaced by pills women privately obtained and researchers couldn’t count. “Everyone who is trafficking these pills should be in jail for trafficking,” Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told the Washington Post in December. “It hasn’t happened, but that doesn’t mean it won’t.” Some of the restrictions onmedication abortion leaders areconsideringextend well beyond those pursued by lawmakers in previous years, when their focus was generally on banning telemedicine and adding more requirements fordispensing pills in person, like mandatory ultrasounds, waiting periods, and visits with doctors. Anti-abortion activists are exploring new strategies, such as laws to ban websites like Aid Access and Plan C and laws to make health care providers newly liable for disposing ofaborted fetal tissue. In a federal lawsuit filed in November, one religious conservative group has challenged the FDA’s approval of mifepristone writ large, alleging the agency abused its authority 23 years ago in authorizing the drug at all. Some lawmakers are looking to test the limits of their extraterritorial powers, exploring how and whether they could punish a resident for getting an out-of-state abortion, or retaliate against providers in other states who facilitate them. “Anti-abortion advocates are throwing the kitchen sink in an attempt to see what might work,” said Jenny Ma, a senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “That’s the same playbook the anti-abortion movement had before Dobbs ... but they’ve become emboldened.” Sue Liebel, the director of state affairs with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told Vox she expects states to pursue “creative” strategies for enforcement, including through state health departments, boards of pharmacy, and the police. “Everyone’s trying something different,” she said. “If there’s one thing I can anticipate, in this particular year of legislative sessions, when we’re not even quite 200 days from Dobbs, I think the keyword this year is ‘variety.’ While things are a little early right now, I know it’s going to explode very soon.” Some states have banned abortion entirely — including abortion pills — while others have banned telemedicine abortion, meaning individuals can only obtain the drugs in person from a doctor. But there are workarounds. If you live in a state like Texas, you can still order pills from Aid Access, which ships internationally to restrictive states. Or you could travel to a less restrictive state, connect with a provider there, and then pick up the pills from a discreet location. Others rely on friends, acquaintances, and activist networks in abortion-friendly areas to help them get the medication. To crack down on these options,anti-abortion leaders are exploring new ways to ramp up enforcement of existing rules and restrictions. With poorly regulated data privacy laws, aggressive prosecutors could amass a lot of evidence if they suspect a person obtained an illegal abortion, or an abortion that would not be legal in their home state. One proposal, which is expected to be introduced this week in Texas, would expand the ability of private citizens to bring civil lawsuits against anyone thought to have terminated a pregnancy illegally with abortion pills. This would build on a six-week abortion ban that took effect in Texas in 2021, which included the novel citizen enforcement mechanism. John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life, told Vox they’re looking to “utilize those civil liability tools” for abortion before six weeks, and his group is working to identify examples of people who might be distributing abortion pills illegally for local prosecutors to then charge. Seago said Texas lawmakers are also going to explore ways to hold groups with ties to abortion pill distributors “financially and criminally accountable.” Though some medication abortionproviders are outside Texas and outside the United States, Seago said elected officials are looking to target entities with connections to the providers that might have subsidiaries in Texas. “If there is still an affiliation or cooperation of other entities with that pharmacy or physician dispensing the pills, then legislators can look at our law and spread out the accountability,” he said. In October, Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma asked their state’s attorney general for a formal opinion clarifying whether self-managed abortions constitute murder under their strict abortion ban. A spokesperson for Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor told Vox that request is still “being evaluated.” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has been speaking with conservative governors regarding ways to restrict shipments of abortion medication. Liebel, the state affairs director, acknowledged that internet sales makes enforcement of existing rules difficult. “But we are also aware that states have requirements for parental consent that may or may not be followed by these [online] providers,” she said, adding that they’re working to craft legislation to address this. To crack down on medication abortion, experts anticipate more politicians will follow in the wake of Missouri lawmakers, who in 2021 and 2022 began testing the limits of restricting abortion outside their borders. Advocates expect to see more bills targeting out-of-state doctors who prescribe pills to their residents, and bills targeting those who may “aid and abet” a pregnant person in traveling out of state. “Anti-abortion states will not be satisfied with just banning abortion in their states and are looking to flex their extraterritorial muscles,” said Lorie Chaiten, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project. Medication abortion in the US haslong been subject to more rules and restrictions than other drugs with higher risks of death or adverse complications. Over the objections of groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the FDA has long had mifepristone on its Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) list, a designation used when the government determines that increased restrictions are necessary for a drug’s benefit to outweigh its risks. As a result, the FDA could require that only certified medical professionals in hospitals, medical offices, or clinics administer the pills, meaning someone couldn’t just fill a prescription at their local pharmacy. In 2017, the ACLU suedthe FDA, arguing its mifepristone restrictions were not medically justified. In part due to pressure from the ACLU’s still-pending lawsuit, during the pandemicthe FDA temporarily lifted its requirement that mifepristone be dispensed in person at a clinic or a hospital. In December 2021, the FDA announced it would permanently lift the in-person dispensal requirement, and last week the FDA officially clarified that certified pharmacies can dispense mifepristone. While that is still more restrictive than what leading health groups recommend, advocatespraised these changes as measures in the right direction toward expanding abortion access. But for many leaders in the anti-abortion movement, these actions were cast as proof that lawmakers are “lowering medical standards” and putting women at risk. In an op-ed published last year, Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life of America, laid out the case that loosening the REMS restrictions is “anti-woman and anti-science.” Hawkins emphasized that “more than 20” women have died of complications from abortion medication since 2000. (This is out of the nearly 5 million women in the US who have taken the drugs in that period. The FDA reports a total of 4,207 “adverse events” in that time, or a rate of 0.09 percent, less than one-tenth of 1 percent; overall,legal abortion by any method was found to be 14 times less deadly than childbirth.) Hawkins also argued that medication abortion “causes four times the complications as surgical abortion” and comes with a “risk of death that is ten times higher,” citingresearch from 2009 and 2006. Both studies are “outdated and rely on outdated medication abortion protocols,” Ushma Upadhyay, a professor with Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California San Francisco, told Vox. The 2009 study in particular, Upadhyay added, “is simply not credible or rigorous.” Anti-abortion leaders also claim that easing up on requirements for in-person doctor visits endangers women at risk of ectopic pregnancies, and threatens the fertility of women with Rh-negative blood type. (Approximately 1 to 2 percent of all pregnancies in the US are ectopic, and 15 percent of the population has Rh-negative blood type.) In a new citizen petition Students for Life filed last month, the activists called on the FDA to return to its previous REMS standard, partly for these reasons. “We have a long track record of working to restore the health and safety standards that the Biden Administration has stripped from Chemical Abortion Pills,” Kristi Hamrick, a spokesperson for Students for Life, told Vox in an email. “Chemical Abortion Pills lead to injury, infertility, and even death as well as exposing women to abusers who have used the drugs without women’s knowledge or consent.” Liebel of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America told Vox they are encouraging state lawmakers to pass “additional health and safety standards” around the distribution of medication abortion pills, citing the loosening of the REMS rules. In addition to requiring in-person screenings, Liebel said they’re pushing for more emergency room reporting requirements, to ensure that any complications from the drugs are not miscoded as miscarriages. “We think there’s a real public health threat there,” she said. “A lot of state laws on abortion-inducing drugs are pretty old, pretty stale, so [lawmakers] are playing a little bit of catch-up.” Health experts say the medical concerns raised by anti-abortion activists are not backed by evidence. Unknowingly treating a patient who has an ectopic pregnancy with mifepristone and misoprostol will not harm the patient, said Upadhyay, and “there is absolutely no evidence” that Rh in the context of abortion protects against future fertility.” The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintains that medication to manage Rh-negative pregnancies should not be a barrier to the provision of medication abortion. When it comes to safely ending pregnancies, medication abortion is over 95 percent successful, according to Guttmacher, with less than 0.4 percent of patients requiring hospitalization. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has also affirmed medication abortion as a safe method to terminate pregnancy, and concluded that there is no medical need for the drugs to be administered in the physical presence of a health care provider. Earlier this week, Patrizia Cavazzoni, the director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, sent a response to Students for Life’s December petition, denying its request. She noted the anti-abortion activists had provided no “new data or evidence beyond what was provided” in a similar 2019 petition the FDA also denied. Kirsten Moore, the director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access project, says she’s not surprised anti-abortion activists are trying to scare the public about mifepristone, especially since most people are still not very familiar with medication abortion, let alone how reproductive systems work. “I want policy that is grounded in evidence and data, but I don’t believe fighting it out at that level with antis, saying my fact is better than your fact, will really matter in the court of public opinion,” she told Vox. “What I know for sure is that when we just stick to the simple fact that this is an FDA-approved drug that has been in use for more than 20 years, with a complication rate of less than 0.5 percent and is a safe, non-invasive option for early abortion, people like that idea and feel comfortable with it.” While Students for Life’s December FDA petition was recently rejected, another citizen petition the group filed in November is still pending — and this one makes a more novel demand. As first reported by Politico, the group has asked the FDA to require any doctor who prescribes abortion pills to bag the fetal tissue as medical waste, rather than allow the remains to be flushed down the toilet. (There is no direct evidence that abortion pills contaminate water supply, and experts have dismissed the notion that flushing these drugs poses a legitimate environmental threat.) Students for Life is also working with Republican lawmakers to push bills, in state legislatures and in Congress, that would promote this new medical waste disposal requirement. “They are shamelessly co-opting the environmental movement’s messaging for their own agenda,” said Ma, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who raised concern about the chilling effect it may have on providers. Similarly, in November, Alliance Defending Freedom, the religious conservative group known for defending a baker’s right to refuse to make a wedding cake for an LGBTQ couple, filed a lawsuit before a Trump-appointed judge in Texas arguing that the FDA abused its authority when it approved mifepristone 22 years ago. The plaintiffs demandthe FDA withdraw its approval for mifepristone entirely. The judge overseeing the case, Matthew Kacsmaryk, “has shown an extraordinary willingness to interpret the law creatively to benefit right-wing causes,” as Vox has previously reported. Last month, Kacsmaryk handed down a decision claiming that Title X, a federal program that funds voluntary family planning services including birth control, “violates the constitutional right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children.” Lorie Chaiten, with the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, told Vox that with such politicized courts, the public can’t count on the case to disappear. “The lawsuit is completely and utterly baseless, and has so many procedural defects and in a normal world it goes away quickly,” she said. “But unfortunately, we may not be in a normal world.” Activists’ goal has never been to just allow abortions to continue in Democratic-controlled areas. Rather, anti-abortion leaders are organizing to make abortion illegal and inaccessible nationwide. To do that will require winningback the White House in 2024, especially as the Biden administration has shown willingness to use executive power to defend reproductive freedom, via agencies like the FDA, the Justice Department, the Postal Service, and Health and Human Services. One unsettled question looming for anti-abortion activists is whether stateshave the legal authority to pass rules that exceed what the FDA requires, or even outright ban drugs that the FDA has approved. Through the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Actin 1938, Congress empowered the FDA as the sole agency to approve drugs in the US. It’s responsible for reviewing a drug’s safety, weighing its risks and benefits, and regulating appropriate conditions for safe and effective use. The question is whether federal regulation of drugs would take precedence, or preempt, any state restrictions. For now, legal scholars say it’s unclear how these questions will play out in court. Courts often grant deference to the FDA, though there are relatively few examples involving drugs. The main precedent is a 2014 case where a federal judge struck down a Massachusetts effort to restrict the opioid Zohydro, since the FDA had approved the painkiller. As lawyers wrestle with these questions, anti-abortion advocates recognize they can bypass some of the confusion simply by gaining control over the federal government. As a result, they’re pressing Republican lawmakers who express presidential ambitions with questions about how they’d intend to crack down on medication abortion. An anti-abortion president could do things like pressure the FDA and other federal agencies to restrict access to abortion, or simply refuse to engage state preemption challenges.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/1/9/23540562/abortion-pills-medication-dobbs-roe-mifepristone,11808
The downfall of Roe v. Wade started in 2010,Anna North,2019-12-23T12:30:00+00:00,"This year, five states passed laws banning abortion before most people know they’re pregnant. Alabama passed a ban on the procedure at any stage of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. In Ohio, lawmakers introduced a bill that would create a crime called “abortion murder,” punishable by life in prison. For many, restrictions like these would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. But as we look ahead to 2020, the anti-abortion movement could be on the brink of its biggest success yet: dismantling the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade. To understand how we got here, you have to understand what happened in 2010. At the turn of the decade, statehouses went red across America. Republicans gained control of 11 state legislatures and increased their majorities in three more; in some places, like Alabama and North Carolina, they erased Democratic majorities that had existed since the 19th century. When the votes were counted, the GOP had added 680 seats in state legislatures around the country. On abortion, the impact was swift and powerful. Teresa Fedor, a Democrat who has served in the Ohio legislature since 2001, remembers that before 2010, “Democrats were able to really have an impact on policy.” After 2010, when Republicans took control of the state House of Representatives and the governors’ mansion, she told Vox, it was “a full-on assault against women’s reproductive rights.” In the next year alone, five anti-abortion bills passed in Ohio, Fedor said. The same thing happened around the country: Overall, more abortion restrictions were passed in 2011 than in any year since Roe established a right to the procedure in 1973. It’s easy to look at the current landscape of abortion law in America — Southern and Midwestern states passing restriction after restriction, abortion-rights groups fighting back in the courts — and assume that it’s always been this way. After all, abortion opponents have been backing restrictions on abortion for decades. But 2010 is when they really started winning — and when their victories began paving the way for getting rid of Roe. In fact, one of the laws passed in the wake of those elections is scheduled to go before the Supreme Court this spring, giving the justices an opportunity to revisit, and potentially gut, the protections for abortion set forth in the landmark decision. The result could be a country where people in blue states (or those with the money to travel) can legally end a pregnancy, while people in the South and Midwest (especially poor people and people of color) cannot. And what happened in 2010 doesn’t just explain how America got to this point — it’s a roadmap for what’s at stake in the 2020 election and beyond. Abortion opponents have been working to restrict the procedure since before Roe v. Wade was decided. The National Right to Life Committee, which describes itself as “the nation’s oldest and largest pro-life organization,” opened its doors in 1968. Three years later, Americans United for Life, which writes model legislation to help states pass abortion restrictions, was founded. Groups like these had successes in the wake of Roe, like the passage of the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which banned a medical procedure called intact dilation and extraction, a type of abortion performed in the later stages of pregnancy. Versions of this bill also passed at the state level. But the pace of restrictions was, by today’s standards, relatively slow. Then came the 2010 elections. There were a lot of reasons for Republican wins that year. The Great Recession was technically over, but Americans were still hurting — “people were losing jobs, and people were getting foreclosed on,” Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, told Vox. Around the country, Tea Party candidates ran on platforms of fiscal responsibility and low taxes, presenting themselves as an alternative to the Democrats who controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. Meanwhile, there was widespread racist backlash against the election of former President Barack Obama, stoked by then-reality TV host Donald Trump and other “birthers” — in August 2010, a CNN poll found that a full 27 percent of Americans thought the president was “definitely” or “probably” not born in the US. The result at the state level was a landslide. Republicans won majorities in 11 state legislatures, including Ohio, Indiana, and Alabama. They strengthened their majorities in Texas, Georgia, and Florida. They also won 11 governorships previously held by Democrats, including in Ohio and Iowa. Some candidates — like Sam Brownback, who was elected governor of Kansas — ran on a staunchly anti-abortion-rights platform, but many didn’t. In some cases, Nash said, “I think people didn’t necessarily know quite how conservative they were” on the issue. It soon became clear, however: “You started to see abortion restrictions just fly through state legislatures” once the new Republican majorities were seated in 2011, Nash said. Ohio is just one example. In 2011, the state passed legislation banning public hospitals from performing abortions in most cases, as well as prohibiting health insurance policies from providing abortion coverage to local government workers, Fedor said. The same year, Ohio lawmakers introduced the first “heartbeat” bill, which would have banned abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks’ gestation. It didn’t pass, but state legislators put it forth again and again. During debate of a bill in 2015, Fedor spoke publicly about her own abortion for the first time. She had become pregnant through rape, she told her fellow lawmakers in the Ohio House of Representatives. “I dare you to walk in my shoes,” she challenged supporters of the bill. “I understand your story, but you don’t understand mine.” That bill also failed, but a version of it passed earlier this year, along with others like it in states from Kentucky to Georgia. These bills have all been blocked by courts for now, but if allowed to go into effect, they would function as near-total bans on abortion. For Fedor, watching the march of restrictions in Ohio wasn’t just a political defeat — it was traumatic. “It really had an impact, like PTSD, for those of us who are serving [in] this capacity and experienced that life situation,” she told Vox. “It was very hard, very hard.” What happened in Ohio was happening all over the country. Between 2001 and the end of 2010, 195 state-level abortion restrictions were passed, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Between 2011 and today, states have passed another 483 abortion restrictions. While near-total bans like the one in Ohio — and one in Alabama that prohibits abortion at all stages of pregnancy — have captured a lot of attention this year, other laws passed in the wake of the 2010 elections have had even more impact on the ground. In 2011, Texas passed a measure requiring an ultrasound and a 24-hour waiting period before a person could get the procedure. A North Dakota law passed the same year required that patients be given information on a possible link between abortion and breast cancer, even though studies have shown no such link. Abortion opponents in state legislatures also introduced new provisions for clinics or doctors, such as the requirement that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital. In May 2011, for example, the recently elected Brownback signed an admitting privileges law in Kansas. Abortion opponents cast the new requirements around ultrasounds and admitting privileges as necessary to protect the health of people seeking abortions. “For 45 years, the Supreme Court has said that the states can protect maternal health and fetal life,” and such restrictions were a way for states to do that, Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel at Americans United for Life, told Vox. But abortion-rights groups have countered that the added requirements don’t actually serve any medical purpose. The result, meanwhile, has been to make it much harder to get an abortion in many of the places where Republicans came into power in 2010. Low-income Americans already struggled to pay for the procedure because Medicaid is barred from covering most abortions, Marcela Howell, founder of the group In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda, told Vox. Following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, many states added restrictions on abortion coverage to their exchange plans, and some added restrictions on private insurance coverage as well. Waiting period laws meant patients had to come to a clinic twice, often taking time off work and paying for child care for their kids, as a majority of people who get abortions are parents, Howell added. Meanwhile, new restrictions on clinics caused dozens to close across the South and Midwest. Between 2011 and 2017, those regions lost a total of 83 clinics, with about half of the clinics in Ohio and Texas shutting their doors. That means that many people seeking abortions now have to go to another city or even another state to get the procedure, adding yet another hurdle to the difficulties caused by waiting period laws and other restrictions. “The barriers sort of compound themselves to mean that people find themselves in the position where they aren’t actually able to access abortion care,” Howell said. Abortion-rights advocates were hopeful the tide was turning in 2016, when the Supreme Court ruled in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt that an admitting privileges law in Texas was unconstitutional. The decision was a blow to clinic restrictions nationwide, and admitting privileges laws in other states were struck down in its wake. This March, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in June Medical Services v. Gee, which concerns a 2014 Louisiana law that’s nearly identical to the one at issue in Hellerstedt. This time, though, many believe that the court — on which conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh now sits — will decide to uphold the law, paving the way for states to introduce more and more clinic restrictions and make abortion harder and harder to get. In some ways, the road to Gee started with Roe in 1973. Abortion opponents have been working to overturn the 1973 decision ever since, as well as to pass restrictions within its limits. “This is a long-term, coherent, consistent attempt to pass health and safety regulations,” Forsythe said. But 2010 was a crucial turning point in that road. For some, it’s also a reminder that even though presidential and congressional elections tend to get the most attention, state legislators are often the ones with the most control over abortion access in America. That could become even more true if the court finds in favor of Louisiana, which would give states broad leeway to restrict abortion, according to Nash. “Who’s sitting in those legislative chambers will be really important,” she said. For abortion-rights advocates, meanwhile, what happened in 2010 is a lesson in the importance of getting out the vote at state and local levels. To that end, In Our Own Voice has launched a campaign called I Am a Voter, aimed specifically at black voters, who have historically had high turnout rates in presidential elections but not necessarily in other races. The campaign is about “holding those people you vote for accountable,” Howell said. States like Virginia, where Democrats won control of both chambers this year, are an encouraging sign for legislatures around the country, she added. “I expect that we will see that some of them will flip as people pay more and more attention to how those elected officials impact their lives,” Howell said. Indeed, unusually high turnout in Virginia may have helped carry Democrats to victory this year. Fedor, too, is looking to the future, including the 2020 election. She believes that the current trend of abortion restrictions in Ohio goes against the character of the state. “Ohioans don’t go to extremes,” Fedor said. “We are down the middle and we honor and value fairness.” And, she added, “When things aren’t fair, the course can be corrected.”",https://www.vox.com/2019/12/23/21024312/abortion-laws-2019-ohio-georgia-roe-wade,11808
Graham-Cassidy would start banning abortion coverage in Obamacare plans in 3 months,Anna North,2017-09-21T18:40:02+00:00,"The eleventh-hour Obamacare repeal bill sponsored by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) would reduce Americans’ access to reproductive health care in a number of ways. But one particular provision would take effect fast, and could plunge patients, insurers, and state governments into chaos. Starting in 2018, the bill would bar the use of Obamacare’s premium tax credits to pay for plans that include coverage for abortion except in the cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the mother’s life, as health care analyst Charles Gaba notes at ACASignups.net. This would mean no plan offered on the exchanges could cover abortion. This is a problem in itself, as a lack of insurance coverage for abortion can cause a number of problems for patients, such as forcing them to choose between paying for the procedure and paying rent. But the timing could cause another problem. As Gaba points out, the deadline for insurers to sign up for participation in the 2018 exchanges is in less than a week. If Graham-Cassidy passes, it will most likely happen after that. So plans that were legal days before will suddenly become illegal, just over a month before the 2018 enrollment period starts. Twenty-five states already bar exchange plans from covering abortion, said Laurie Sobel, the associate director for women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. So this particular provision of Graham-Cassidy won’t change anything there. (In six other states, no plans available on the exchanges in 2016 included abortion coverage.) But in 25 states, plans that cover abortion are allowed, and it’s not at all clear how insurers will respond if their plans suddenly violate federal law. What’s more, California and New York require that all plans on the exchanges offer abortion coverage. So under Graham-Cassidy, all the plans in those state exchanges would become illegal. It’s unclear what the states would do to make sure their residents could get coverage, but as Gaba points out, they might decide to sue the federal government. (This issue brief from the Kaiser Family Foundation explains a similar conflict that would have been created by the American Health Care Act, the Obamacare repeal bill passed by the House in May.) It’s possible that Congress could tweak the bill, or the Department of Health and Human Services could change the deadline for insurers, so as to sidestep some of the timing issues. But absent such changes, the bill threatens to throw the exchanges in nearly half the country into a state of flux. Are you an Obamacare enrollee interested in what happens next?

What Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court means for abortion rights,Anna North,2020-10-27T00:17:23+00:00,"President Trump has repeatedly promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the right to an abortion in America. By putting Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the Court, he moved one step closer to that goal. Barrett, who was confirmed by the Senate on Monday, attracted praise from social conservatives for her religious faith as well as her strict interpretation of the Constitution. As a judge on the Seventh US Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, she issued conservative decisions in cases involving the Second Amendment and immigration, among others. But her views on abortion got particular attention during her confirmation process, given the president’s promise on Roe and the political importance of the issue in an election year. During her confirmation hearings, Barrett did not directly answer questions about how she would rule on abortion rights. But she has made her personal opinion on the issue clear in the past, signing her name to a 2006 newspaper ad opposing “abortion on demand.” She has twice voted in abortion cases, both times in ways favorable to abortion restrictions. And while she’s said she doesn’t believe Roe will be overturned outright, she’s also made clear that she’s open to reversing Supreme Court precedent if she thinks a previous decision goes against the Constitution. She might get that opportunity soon, with more than a dozen abortion cases just one step away from the Court. And while no one knows for certain what kind of justice she would be, her past certainly suggests she could be a deciding vote to reverse Roe and eliminate the legal right to abortion in America. At 48, Barrett doesn’t have a long judicial record, as the LA Times noted in 2018 when she was first floated as a replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy. Barrett was confirmed to the Seventh Circuit, her first judgeship, in 2017. Since then, she’s voted in two abortion cases, each time in ways that could be seen as friendly to abortion restrictions. In one, Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc., the Seventh Circuit voted to block an Indiana law requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Barrett joined a dissent saying the law should have been allowed to take effect, as ABA Journal reports. The second case, Commissioner of the Indiana State Department of Health v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc., concerned an Indiana law that would have banned abortions on the basis of race, sex, or Down syndrome diagnosis, as well as requiring that fetal remains be buried or cremated. A lower court struck down the law, and the state of Indiana appealed only the fetal remains portion. A panel of the Seventh Circuit declined to rehear the case, but Barrett joined the dissent, arguing that the case should be reheard and bringing up potential legal merits of the ban on race- or sex-selective abortions, even though that part of the law was no longer actually at issue. The dissenters called the law a “eugenics statute” and wrote that “none of the Court’s abortion decisions holds that states are powerless to prevent abortions designed to choose the sex, race, and other attributes of children.” In addition to these votes, Barrett has made a number of public statements on Roe and abortion over the years. Perhaps most notably, in 2006 she signed her name to an ad placed by the group St. Joseph County Right to Life in the South Bend Tribune, an Indiana newspaper. The ad stated that the undersigned “oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death,” the New York Times reported. The ad has raised additional concerns because St. Joseph County Right to Life opposes in vitro fertilization, and has stated that the discarding of frozen embryos generated through IVF should be criminalized, as BuzzFeed News reported. In response to concerns about this position, the White House directed BuzzFeed to a statement by Barrett on the day of her nomination: “Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.” Barrett, a Catholic and member of the religious group People of Praise, has also said that she personally believes life begins at conception, and that Roe “ignited a national controversy” by deciding the issue of abortion by court order rather than leaving it to the states. However, Barrett has also said several times that she believes the Supreme Court will not overturn Roe. “I don’t think the core case, Roe’s core holding that women have a right to an abortion, I don’t think that would change,” she said in a 2016 appearance at Jacksonville University. “But I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, you know, how many restrictions can be put on clinics, I think that will change.” The idea that the Court was more likely to let states chip away at abortion access than to reverse Roe outright was common for many years among advocates on both sides of the abortion issue. Indeed, conservative state legislatures have worked for years to restrict abortion within the bounds of Roe, with Louisiana, Texas, and other states passing numerous laws that have shut down clinics across the South and Midwest. But now the calculus is changing. As Nina Totenberg and Domenico Montanaro note at NPR, Trump has already appointed two conservative justices to the Court, moving it significantly to the right. And some believe that Chief Justice John Roberts may be more amenable to a direct challenge to Roe than to the kinds of incremental clinic restrictions that were at issue in the recent June Medical Services v. Russo, in which he voted to strike down a Louisiana abortion law. And, of course, the death of Justice Ginsburg leaves Trump the opportunity to pull the Court even further to the right. Should Barrett join it, conservative justices might well have the votes — and the will — to go after the right to an abortion directly. If they do, states would be able to ban abortion outright, rather than just passing laws making the procedure harder to get. Should such an opportunity present itself, Barrett has made clear that judicial precedent wouldn’t necessarily be an obstacle for her. The judge has said she believes the Supreme Court has the responsibility to revisit and potentially overturn old rulings that its current members feel conflict with the Constitution. “I tend to agree with those who say that a justice’s duty is to the Constitution and that is thus more legitimate for her to enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks is clearly in conflict with it,” Barrett wrote in 2013. Like previous nominees to the Supreme Court, including Brett Kavanaugh, Barrett declined to provide substantive answers about her thoughts on Roe during her confirmation hearing, arguing that to do so “signals to litigants that I might tilt one way or another on a pending case.” However, she did provide some clues. For example, she referred to a category of rulings she called “superprecedents” or “cases that are so well settled that no political actors and no people seriously push for their overruling,” as CBS News reported. That category included the cases Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down school segregation, and Loving v. Virginia, which invalidated laws against interracial marriage, she said — but not Roe v. Wade. In the case of that decision, “calls for its overruling have never ceased,” Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee. To many, that signaled that she saw Roe as a decision the current Court could revisit — and potentially reverse. Despite her past votes and writings, no one knows for sure how Barrett will rule in a Supreme Court abortion case until she gets to consider one. But one thing is clear: Barrett has no particular allegiance to Roe v. Wade, or to Supreme Court precedent more generally.And if she is given the opportunity to overturn the 1973 decision, nothing in her record suggests she won’t take it.",https://www.vox.com/21456044/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-roe-abortion,11808
"The “heartbeat” bills that could ban almost all abortions, explained",Anna North,2019-06-28T13:50:07+00:00,"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in early May signed into law a so-called “heartbeat” bill, banning abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Georgia is the fourth state to pass such a law this year alone. The bills prohibit abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. But reproductive rights advocates and doctors say the laws, which prohibit abortion before many women know they are pregnant, amount to a near-total ban on the procedure. “It’s basically a forced pregnancy bill. It’s a health care ban bill,” said Dr. Krystal Redman, the executive director of Spark Reproductive Justice Now, a group that works on reproductive rights and other issues for women of color and queer and trans people in the South. The bill also includes a penalty for those who perform abortions of up to 10 years in prison. It doesn’t explicitly exempt women who perform their own abortions with drugs, leading to speculation about whether they would also be subject to criminal charges. Some have suggested that it could even lead to murder charges for women who have abortions — but other experts say the consequences are far from clear. No heartbeat bills have yet gone into effect, and all have or are likely to be challenged in court. In May, for instance, a federal court blocked such a law in Mississippi. And on Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups challenged the Georgia law. Whatever happens in the courts, the rise of heartbeat bills in 2019 is a sign of where the abortion debate is today. A few years ago, such bans were considered too extreme even by some anti-abortion groups, said Rachel Sussman, the national director of state policy and advocacy at Planned Parenthood Action Fund. But with Donald Trump in the White House and Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, abortion opponents around the country are eager to challenge Roe v. Wade. And banning abortion just six weeks into pregnancy may be a way to do that. Heartbeat bills around the country are based on model legislation written by Faith2Action, which bills itself as “the nation’s largest network of pro-family groups.” “While not the beginning of life, the heartbeat is the universally recognized indicator of life,” the group states in an FAQ on its website. (Faith2Action has not responded to Vox’s requests for comment.) The model legislation says that if a patient is seeking an abortion, the doctor must use “standard medical practice” to determine whether the fetus has a heartbeat. If a heartbeat is present, the doctor is prohibited from performing an abortion, unless it is necessary to save the mother’s life or “to prevent a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” The legislation does not include an exception for rape or incest. “No other law allows for the killing of an innocent child for the crime of his or her father,” the Faith2Action FAQ states. The bills do not cite a specific gestational time limit for abortions, which has led to some debate. Reproductive rights groups say the bills amount to a ban on abortion at about six weeks’ gestation. That’s when a doctor can detect “a flicker of cardiac motion” on a transvaginal ultrasound, according to Dr. Catherine Romanos, a doctor who performs abortions in Ohio and a fellow with the group Physicians for Reproductive Health. Six weeks’ gestation is just shortly after most pregnant women miss their first period, meaning many women don’t know they are pregnant at this stage. Some reproductive rights groups argue that the term “heartbeat” bill is a misnomer, since the fetus does not yet have a heart at six weeks’ gestation — the cardiac activity detectable at that time comes from tissue called the fetal pole, as OB-GYN Jen Gunter has written. Planned Parenthood refers to the bills as six-week bans. Meanwhile, some supporters of the bills argue that they might allow abortion slightly later in pregnancy than six weeks. The Ohio heartbeat bill, signed into law in April, does not specifically require a transvaginal ultrasound, said Jamieson Gordon, director of communications and marketing at Ohio Right to Life. Some doctors, she said, might choose to perform an abdominal ultrasound instead, and such a test cannot detect a heartbeat until around eight to 12 weeks’ gestation. In Ohio, the precise requirements for determining the presence of a heartbeat will be up to the Ohio Department of Health. But, said Romanos, the law, which is slated to take effect later this year if not challenged by the court, will likely ban nearly all abortions in the state. “There will a small minority of people who know their body really well” and immediately recognize they are pregnant who will be able to get an abortion under the new law, Romanos said. They will also need to be able to travel to a clinic and get together the money for the procedure within the time allowed. The law carves out an exception if a patient’s life is in danger, but not for a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. In all other cases, abortion will be illegal in Ohio. “It’ll be really devastating to people,” Romanos said. “It’s patient abandonment.” The recently signed Georgia law does include exceptions for rape and incest, as well as for medical emergencies. But the law will hurt patients in Georgia, which has some of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country, said Redman, the Spark Reproductive Justice Now executive director. “People are dying because of the maternal health here in Georgia,” she said. “The fact that we’re eliminating a health care option, a service, will do a disservice to Georgians,” especially black, queer, and low-income people who are disproportionately likely to seek abortion care. Unlike other Georgia laws, the bill doesn’t include language explicitly exempting women who terminate their own pregnancies from the penalties meant to apply to doctors. Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, said it wasn’t clear if women would ultimately be prosecuted. Legal challenges if the ban is implemented in January 2020 will determine the reach of the bill, she said. “[The bill] was set up thinking you would have some sort of physician person, either providing a pregnant person with medicine or some medication or doing surgical abortions,” she said. “It doesn’t seem to take into account necessarily what happens if the patient self-manages an abortion.” Some have suggested even bigger ramifications: Because the bill gives “full legal recognition” to “unborn children,” Mark Joseph Stern wrote for Slate, the law could allow women who terminate pregnancies to be charged with murder. Nash said it may be too early to make these kinds of assumptions. “It seems to be a stretch to what’s actually in the law and I’m really confused as to whether or not this would be possible,” she said. The first bill based on Faith2Action’s model legislation was introduced in Ohio in 2011. It didn’t pass. While similar laws successfully passed in North Dakota and Arkansas in 2013, heartbeat bills were not embraced by all anti-abortion groups.Ohio Right to Life was neutral on the issue until 2018, preferring to back less sweeping restrictions like a 20-week ban. “We are proponents of the incremental approach,” Gordon said. But since the election of Trump, who promised to appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion groups have been backing more restrictive laws. “State legislators around the country are taking signals from Trump being in the White House and Kavanaugh being on the court that being radical and pushing legislation that really puts lives and health at risk is something they should be pursuing,” Sussman said. “Heartbeat” bills began to proliferate at the state level last year, with Iowa passing its version in May. And for Ohio Right to Life, the incremental approach had been so successful — the 20-week ban and a ban on a common second-trimester abortion method recently became law — that a heartbeat bill was now “the next incremental step,” Gordon said. The group threw its support behind the bill in December. Similar bills have passed in Kentucky and Mississippi in recent months. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, signed his state’s version in May. The North Dakota, Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, and Mississippi bans have been blocked by courts, and Ohio’s ban is being challenged. The Louisiana law is written so that it will only take effect if Mississippi wins the case over its law. On Friday, the ACLU and its Georgia chapter, along with the Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood, filed suit to challenge the Georgia law. “This legislation is blatantly unconstitutional under nearly 50 years of U.S. Supreme Court precedent,” said Sean J. Young, legal director of the ACLU of Georgia, in a statement. “Our lawsuit asks the court to block the law from taking effect on January 1, 2020.” But a court battle is precisely what some supporters of the bills are hoping for. Some legislators backing the heartbeat bills have said they see them as potential challenges to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that prohibits states from banning abortion before a fetus can survive outside the womb. A heartbeat bill, whether it bans abortion at six or 12 weeks, falls well before that limit. Sponsors of the Iowa law were explicit about their desire to challenge Roe. “The science and technology have significantly advanced since 1973,” said Iowa state Rep. Shannon Lundgren, the floor manager of the bill, in 2018. “It is time for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue of life.” In Ohio, “we’re just trying to pass pro-life legislation that will save lives,” Gordon said, “but also if it ends up being a good vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade, we would be thrilled about that as well.” Meanwhile, heartbeat bills may already be affecting patients, even though none have actually taken effect. “I think people are already confused,” Romanos said. “I worry that there are patients that heard about the bans passing and now just aren’t seeking care that they otherwise would seek because they think abortion is illegal already.”",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/19/18412384/abortion-heartbeat-bill-georgia-louisiana-ohio-2019,11808
"The Supreme Court’s new abortion decision, explained",Ian Millhiser,2024-06-26T21:45:03+00:00,"Editor’s note, June 27, 11:30 am ET: The Supreme Court officially released its opinion in Moyle v. United States on Thursday morning. It reaches the same result as the leaked draft. For the second time in two years, a major Supreme Court abortion decision leaked before the justices officially released it. This time, however, the most likely explanation is a clerical error by someone who manages the Court’s website. Two years ago, an early draft of Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case overruling Roe v. Wade, leaked to the press. The identity of the leaker remains unknown, as does the leaker’s motive. About two months after the leak, the Supreme Court released its final opinion in Dobbs, which was substantially similar to the leaked draft. On Wednesday, another significant abortion opinion leaked — although this time the leak appears to be an accident. According to Bloomberg, the justices’ opinions in Moyle v. United States were “briefly posted on the court’s website” before being taken down. A Supreme Court spokesperson said that “the court’s publications unit inadvertently and briefly uploaded a document to the court’s website,” and that the final decision will be “issued in due course.” Bloomberg posted the text of the leaked document at this link. Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser. Moyle asks whether states can ignore a federal law which requires most hospitals to provide emergency care to patients who need it — including abortions if that is the appropriate medical treatment. Specifically, whether Idaho’s near-total ban on abortions prevents doctors from providing medically necessary abortions. Assuming that the leaked document resembles the Court’s final decision, a majority of the justices have decided not to decide the Moyle case. Though the Court has seemingly splintered into four separate concurring and dissenting opinions, none of which garnered a majority of the justices’ support, five justices apparently decided that the Court was wrong to take up this case using an expedited process that bypassed an intermediate appeals court. The leaked document does contain some good news for abortion rights advocates. Last January, the Court temporarily blocked a lower court decision, which held that the state of Idaho cannot enforce its strict abortion ban against patients who need an abortion to save their life or to ward off catastrophic health consequences. In the leaked document, six justices voted to reinstate the lower court’s order — at least for now — which means that Idaho patients who require medically necessary abortions will no longer need to be airlifted to other states. Still, the primary effect of the decision, assuming it closely resembles the leaked draft, will likely be to punt the final resolution of this case until after the election. That means that patients outside of Idaho — who may have been hoping a decision in this case would set a precedent requiring ER doctors across the country to follow the federal law requiring care in the event of an emergency — may not be able to obtain abortion care that they need to save their life or to ward off very serious health consequences. The federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires all hospitals that accept Medicare funds — which is nearly all hospitals — to provide “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” of “any individual” who arrives at the hospital’s ER with an “emergency medical condition.” EMTALA, moreover, defines an “emergency medical condition” to include not just conditions that threaten a patient’s life, but also conditions that risk “serious impairment to bodily functions,” or “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part,” among other things. Thus, if a patient’s uterus would be destroyed if they do not receive an abortion, EMTALA generally requires hospitals to provide that abortion even if the patient is likely to survive without it. This federal law conflicts with an Idaho statute, which bans all abortions except when “necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.” When a federal law conflicts with a state law, the Constitution provides that the federal law “shall be the supreme Law of the Land” — and thus the state law is “preempted.” EMTALA also contains a provision stating that state and local laws must give way “to the extent that the [state law] directly conflicts with a requirement of this section.” So this should be an easy case. EMTALA imposes a broad requirement on nearly all hospitals to provide emergency care, and it does not include an exception for abortions. The statute, moreover, explicitly says that state laws must give way when they directly conflict with EMTALA. But, in this Court, nothing involving abortion can ever be easy. The Court’s three Democratic appointees, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, all argue in two separate leaked opinions that EMTALA means what it actually says — though they appear to have split on a procedural question. Ordinarily, the Supreme Court waits until at least one appeals court has weighed in on a case before taking it up. In Moyle, however, the Court invoked an unusual process known as “certiorari before judgment” to bypass the appeals court that was supposed to hear this case. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor, argues that the case should be sent back to the appeals court that should have heard Moyle in the first place. Jackson, meanwhile, argues that the Court should rule immediately that EMTALA means what it says. As she writes in the documents Bloomberg published, doctors “observing the different legal thresholds for action under state and federal law” will “surely be cowed into not providing abortion” that is required by federal law — especially because of the risk that they could be prosecuted under state law. A decision by the Supreme Court holding that EMTALA trumps state law would allow doctors to perform medically necessary abortions with certainty. At the Court’s rightward extreme, Alito, in a leaked opinion joined in whole by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justice Neil Gorsuch, argues for an abortion exception to the EMTALA statute. Alito primarily points to several provisions of the law which use the phrase “unborn child” (these provisions primarily require hospitals to offer stabilizing care to a pregnant patient’s fetus), suggesting that a statute which uses that phrase must not be read to permit abortions. Alito also makes a novel constitutional argument, claiming that the state of Idaho must consent before its abortion ban can be preempted by EMTALA. That leaves Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for herself, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in the middle. Barrett’s opinion, as it’s published in the Bloomberg leak, leaves nearly every important question raised by Moyle unresolved. She agrees with Kagan that the case should be sent back down to the lower court, thus creating a majority for that result. And she writes that Alito’s constitutional argument is “difficult and consequential” without taking a position on that argument. The thrust of Barrett’s opinion is that there is no longer a need to bypass the appeals court and decide this case on an expedited basis because of concessions made by lawyers on both sides. The Biden administration, which argues for EMTALA to be read according to its plain text, conceded that EMTALA could not be used to authorize abortions because a patient has a mental health condition. And it also conceded that federal laws permitting hospitals or doctors with moral objections to abortion to opt out of providing them still apply even under EMTALA. Idaho’s lawyers, meanwhile, claimed that its state law permits abortions for some medical conditions “even if the threat to the woman’s life is not imminent.” According to Barrett, the “parties’ positions are still evolving” in this case, and thus it makes sense for those positions to be refined in a lower court before the Supreme Court has the final word. So the good news for abortion rights supporters is that emergency room patients in Idaho will have the full benefit of EMTALA, at least while this case is working its way through the appeals court and back up to the justices. The bad news is that the leaked Moyle decision does nothing to help those same patients in the other 49 states. And that’s a serious problem for abortion rights generally. As Jackson notes in her opinion, one problem that’s emerged since Dobbs is that, while even the most anti-abortion states typically permit abortions in some cases — such as if the life or health of a patient is threatened — there are often no court precedents explaining when abortions are allowed and when they are not. That means that doctors cannot know, and their lawyers cannot advise them, on when it is legal to perform a medically necessary abortion. And that has created a reality where those exceptions are “exceptionally difficult — in some states, nigh impossible — to qualify for,” as my colleague Nicole Narea reported: Kate Cox, a Texas woman, was notably denied an abortion even though her fetus was diagnosed with a rare and terminal genetic condition and forced to travel out of state to obtain one. Other women have been forced to carry to term fetuses doctors know will die shortly upon birth, or been denied abortion care even after experiencing a miscarriage that leaves them in medical distress. The Texas Supreme Court also ruled against a group of 20 women who claimed that they had been denied medically necessary abortions. The Moyle lawsuit was an effort to solve this problem by allowing federal courts to develop precedents stating when EMTALA creates a right to an abortion. But that process cannot begin until the courts agree that EMTALA means what it says. Thus, if the leaked Moyle decision proves to be authentic, that means it may be months or even years before the federal courts can start generating the precedents that hospital lawyers need to advise their clients — and that’s assuming that Alito doesn’t ultimately have the votes to write an abortion exception into EMTALA.",https://www.vox.com/scotus/357302/supreme-court-leaked-abortion-moyle-united-states,11808
5 ways abortion bans could hurt women in the workforce,Rani Molla,2022-06-24T21:15:20+00:00,"Roe vs. Wade is now overturned, which will soon effectively make abortion illegal in about half of US states. If that happens, historical data tells us that not only will this affect women personally, but it will jeopardize their professional lives, too. That decision, a draft of which was leaked to Politico in May and was released in its final form Friday, affects a woman’s likelihood to work at all, what type of job she takes, how much education she receives, how much money she makes, and even the hopes and dreams she has for herself. In turn, her career affects nearly all other aspects of her life, from her likelihood to live in poverty to her view of herself. And taking away the ability to make that decision stands to upend decades of progress women have made in the workforce, which has cascading effects on women’s place in society. As Caitlin Myers, a professor of economics at Middlebury College, put it, “Childbearing is the single most economically important decision most women make.” We know all this because of decades of research on how abortion bans hurt women — research that Myers, along with more than 150 other economists, outlined in an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Mississippi case that’s responsible for upending Roe v. Wade. In addition to long-term studies specifically looking at outcomes of women who were unable to get an abortion versus those who did, there’s even more robust data around the negative causal effects of having children on women in general. It’s also just common sense, according to Jason Lindo, a professor of economics at Texas A&M University. “Anyone who has had kids or seriously thought about having kids knows it’s super costly in terms of time and money,” Lindo said. “So of course restrictions that make it harder for people to time when they have kids or which increase the number of children that they have is going to have serious impacts on their careers and their economic circumstances.” Even in the absence of a national ban, state anti-abortion measures have been a huge burden on women and society at large. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) estimated that state-level restrictions have cost those economies $105 billion a year in reduced labor force participation, reduced earnings, increased turnover, and time off among prime working-age women. An abortion ban won’t affect all women equally, either. Myers says that in regions of the country where abortion is banned and where travel distances will increase for women to be able to get an abortion, about three-quarters of women seeking abortions will still do so. That means roughly a quarter of women there — in Myers’s words, “the poorest, the most vulnerable, the most financially fragile women in a wide swath of the Deep South and the Midwest” — will not receive their health care services. As the US faces an ongoing labor shortage — one led in part by women who have left the workforce to care for children and elders during the pandemic — the Supreme Court’s expected decision will exacerbate the situation and potentially change women’s experience in the workforce for years to come. Abortion access is a major force that has driven up women’s labor force participation. Nationally, women’s labor force participation rates went from around 40 percent before Roe v. Wade was passed in 1973 to nearly 60 percent before the pandemic (men’s participation was nearly 70 percent at that time). Abortion bans could thwart or even reverse some of those gains. Using data from the Turnaway Study, landmark research that compares outcomes over time for women across the country who received or were denied abortions, University of California San Francisco professor Diana Greene Foster and fellow researchers found that six months after they were denied an abortion, women were less likely to be employed full-time than those who received an abortion. That difference remained significant for four years after these women were denied abortions, a gap that could affect their employment prospects even further into the future. Education rates are foundational for career prospects and pay. A 1996 study by Joshua Angrist and William Evans looked at states that liberalized abortion laws before Roe v. Wade andfound abortion access leads to higher education rates and labor-market outcomes. American University economics professor Kelly Jones used state abortion regulation data to determine that legal abortion access for young women who became pregnant increased their educational attainment by nearly a year and their likelihood of finishing college by about 20 percentage points. The evidence is largely driven by the impacts on young Black women. Other research by Jones and Mayra Pineda-Torres found that simple exposure to targeted restrictions on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, reduced young Black teenagers’ likelihood of attending or completing college. In turn, lower education affects which jobs women are qualified for. Having children significantly affects the types of jobs women get, often steering them to part-time work or lower-paying occupations. While broader abortion bans are now possible in any state that wishes to enact one, plenty of individual states have already enacted TRAP laws that make getting an abortion more difficult. This legislation has also provided a natural experiment for researchers like Kate Bahn, chief economist at research nonprofit Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who found women in these states were less likely to move into higher-paid occupations. “We know a lot from previous research on the initial expansion of birth control pills and abortion care in the ’70s that, when women have a little more certainty over their family planning, they just make choices differently,” Bahn told Recode. This could lead to more occupational segregation — women’s overrepresentation in certain fields like health care and teaching, for example — which reduces wages in those fields, even when accounting for education, experience, and location. Curtailing which jobs women get, taking time out of the workforce, receiving less education — all of these hurt women’s pay, which is already lower on average than men’s. One paper by economist Ali Abboud that looked at states where abortion was legal before Roe v. Wade found that young women who got an abortion to delay an unplanned pregnancy for just one year had an 11 percent increase in hourly wages compared to the mean. Jones’s research found that legal abortion access for pregnant young women increased their likelihood of entering a professional occupation by 35 percentage points. The IWPR estimates that if existing abortion restrictions went away, women across the US would make $1,600 more a year on average. Lost income doesn’t just affect women who have unwanted pregnancies, but also their families and their existing children. Income, in turn, affects poverty rates of not only the women who have to go through unwanted pregnancy, but also their existing children. Perhaps most insidiously, lack of abortion access seriously restricts women’s hopes for their own careers. Building on her team’s research in the Turnaway Study, Foster found that women who were unable to get a desired abortion were significantly less likely to have one-year goals related to employment than those who did, likely because those goals would be much harder to achieve while taking care of a newborn. They were also less likely to have one-year or five-year aspirational goals in general. Limiting women’s autonomy over their reproductive rights reinforces the unequal status of women in ways that are both concrete and ephemeral, C. Nicole Mason, president and CEO of IWPR, told Recode. “That’s a very psychic, emotional, psychological feeling — to feel and understand that my equality, my rights, are less than my male counterparts,” she said. ”The law is making it so. The Supreme Court is making it so.” Update, June 24, 5:30 pm: This story was updated to reflect the Supreme Court decision.",https://www.vox.com/recode/23074696/abortion-illegal-supereme-court-women-work,11808
The Supreme Court’s abortion pill case is only a narrow and temporary victory for abortion,Ian Millhiser,2024-06-13T16:00:50+00:00,"The Supreme Court’s decision in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine should be humiliating for the plaintiffs in this case, their lawyers, and for the lower court judges who signed on to this attempt to ban a commonly prescribed abortion medication. The decision is unanimous — even Justice Samuel Alito joined the majority opinion! — and it holds that no federal court had jurisdiction to hear this case in the first place. The case was an attempt to ban mifepristone, a drug that is used in over half of all US abortions. Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser. But while the Alliance decision is a victory against anti-abortion advocates’ attempt to ban mifepristone, it is only a temporary one. Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion leaves open two ways that Republicans who oppose abortion could still ban this drug. And it also makes it likely that the Supreme Court will have to hear this case again, despite their initial ruling that the federal judiciary should not have heard this case to begin with. Alliance is fundamentally a case about judge-shopping, a practice that sometimes allows litigants to choose which judge will hear their lawsuit. In this case, the plaintiffs — doctors who oppose abortion and organizations representing those doctors — selected Matthew Kacsmaryk, a longtime advocate for the Christian Right who then-President Donald Trump placed on the federal bench — to be their judge. The plaintiffs were allowed to choose their own judge because Kacsmaryk’s Texas-based court assigns all lawsuits filed in Amarillo, Texas, to him. So all that these plaintiffs had to do to get Kacsmaryk to hear their case was file their suit in his home city. Kacsmaryk’s opinion was, well, exactly what you would expect from a judge who is determined to fight abortion no matter what the law says. His 2023 decision struck down the FDA’s decision to approve the drug mifepristone in 2000, despite a six-year statute of limitations on such claims. He relied on discredited studies that have since been retracted by their publisher. And he relied on testimony from a “doctor” who isn’t actually a physician at all. Then his decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a court dominated by MAGA Republicans, which narrowed Kacsmaryk’s decision but still effectively banned the drug. It was this decision by the Fifth Circuit that a unanimous Supreme Court reversed on Thursday. Kavanaugh’s Alliance opinion rests on a legal doctrine known as “standing.” In order to bring a federal lawsuit of any kind, the plaintiff in that suit must show that they were injured in some way by the defendant. As Kavanaugh writes, “for a plaintiff to get in the federal courthouse door and obtain a judicial determination of what the governing law is, the plaintiff cannot be a mere bystander, but instead must have a ‘personal stake’ in the dispute.” But these plaintiffs were nothing but bystanders. They “do not prescribe or use mifepristone,” and the “FDA is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing anything.” Their sole reason for filing this lawsuit appears to be that they do not like abortions and would like the courts to prevent other people from using a drug that these plaintiffs find objectionable. That’s not allowed. In Kavanaugh’s words, “a plaintiff ’s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue.” To get around this requirement, the plaintiffs’ lawyers devised what Kavanaugh dismisses as “several complicated causation theories to connect FDA’s actions to the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.” But these complicated theories do not actually show that the plaintiff doctors were injured. One of their arguments, for example, is that if mifepristone remains readily available, a patient might take mifepristone, might then experience a complication that requires a doctor to complete the patient’s abortion, and that one of the plaintiff doctors might then have to perform this procedure even though it violates the doctor’s conscience. But, as Kavanaugh notes, “federal conscience laws definitively protect doctors from being required to perform abortions or to provide other treatment that violates their consciences.” So this unlikely chain of events can only occur if a plaintiff doctor fails to assert their legal rights. So the good news for abortion rights is that mifepristone remains legal for now. The bad news is that Kavanaugh’s opinion lays out two ways that anti-abortion advocates could still try to ban it. One path flows from a brief line near the end of the Alliance opinion: “[I]t is not clear that no one else would have standing to challenge FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone.” Last January, Kacsmaryk ruled that three red states — Idaho, Missouri, and Kansas — could join this lawsuit and press the claim that mifepristone should be banned. It is far from clear how these states are injured by the mere fact that mifepristone is legal. But Kacsmaryk’s (and the Fifth Circuit’s) behavior in this case and others shows that he’s willing to bend the law into pretzels in order to rule against abortion rights. It is likely, in other words, that Kacsmaryk will simply make up some reason why the red states have standing to sue and then issue a new order attempting to ban mifepristone. So this very same case could return to the Supreme Court in a year or two, forcing the justices to, at the very least, determine if these red states have standing. More ominously, Kavanaugh’s opinion also points to another way that abortion opponents could try to pull mifepristone from the market: “The plaintiffs may present their concerns and objections to the President and FDA in the regulatory process.” So long as Joe Biden, or any other Democrat, controls the presidency, the administration is unlikely to bow to these concerns. But if Trump (or any other Republican) should occupy the White House in the future, a Republican-controlled FDA could try to rescind the 2000 approval of mifepristone. So Alliance is a victory for abortion rights and the rule of law, and it is an embarrassing defeat for Kacsmaryk and his fellow abortion opponents. But it is also unlikely to be the last word in the fight over mifepristone.",https://www.vox.com/scotus/355175/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-alliiance-hippocratic-medicine-fda,11808
"In Texas, a temporary win for abortion rights",Ellen Ioanes,2023-08-05T21:15:15+00:00,"A Texas state court on Friday sided with a group of women and doctors suing the state, saying that exceptions to Texas’s stringent abortion restrictions are too vague and prevented or delayed people from getting abortion care when their lives or health were at risk. Texas’s SB 8, which passed before Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, bans abortions past six weeks with some exceptions and deputizes citizens to enforce the law by suing people who aid or abet abortion, putting health care providers at legal risk. Under the law, doctors can provide abortion care if the health or life of the pregnant person is at risk; but the lack of clarity around what those conditions meant had a chilling effect on doctors in the state — and had serious effects on patients’ health. Judge Jessica Mangrum of the Travis County District Court ruled Friday in Zurawski v. State of Texas that physicians could use their “good faith judgment” to perform an abortion for a patient who has “a physical medical condition or complication of pregnancy that poses a risk of infection, or otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe for the pregnant person; a physical medical condition that is exacerbated by pregnancy, cannot be effectively treated during pregnancy, or requires recurrent invasive intervention; and/or a fetal condition where the fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy and sustain life after birth,” according to the ruling. The Texas attorney general’s office filed an appeal in the case on Friday night, staying the injunction while the case is on appeal, according to the New York Times, and accusing Mangrum of trying “to override Texas abortion laws.” Mangrum’s injunction would block SB 8’s vigilante enforcement mechanism from being enacted against any patients seeking abortions for medical reasons or against the physicians who perform those procedures — and furthermore states that doing so would violate pregnant people’s rights under Texas’s constitution. Though Mangrum’s injunction is presently on hold, it’s important for two main reasons that are not exclusive to Texas: It forces clarity around abortion exceptions and protects doctors and patients; and it establishes that punishing people who seek or provide abortions under those circumstances is unconstitutional. Though the eventual, final ruling will apply only to Texas, it’s not the only state where unclear legislation is limiting access to medically necessary abortion. And it’s not the only state where reproductive health advocates are grappling with the right to abortion under the state’s constitution. As anti-abortion state legislators have enacted bans throughout the country, they’ve had to grapple with the complexities of abortion care and reproductive health. Mostpregnancies are safe and healthy, but some cause severe complications or are not viable. Overturning Roe v. Wade didn’t change those conditions or provide better prenatal health care, it just made pregnancy more dangerous in many states. “[Anti-choice legislators] could make whatever political points they wanted to because they had a backstop,” with Roe v. Wade in place, South Carolina Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto told Vox in September. “They knew nothing they passed was ever going to go into effect. They could pass all they wanted to, and it didn’t matter — and it allowed them to let their rhetoric just soar to the red meat of their party because they could gin up the party knowing that nothing they said was ever going to be enacted into law. Then, all of a sudden [...] it’s like the dog that caught the bus.” With SB 8, Texas legislators not only passed a restrictive abortion ban but they empowered ordinary Texans to interpret and prosecute the ban. That compounds the risk for physicians who provide abortion care, in some sense, because they don’t know the conditions under which they can do so — or who might bring a $10,000 lawsuit against them for doing their jobs. Meanwhile, the state argued in court that the law was clear enough — and if anyone who should have had an abortion was denied one, it was the physician’s fault, not the law’s or the state’s. “Physicians have been begging for guidance [...] since SB 8 went into effect,” Molly Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Vox in an interview. “No one from the state has provided any guidance, and in fact the only thing the attorney general’s office has done is file their own lawsuit challenging some guidance from Health and Human Services — the federal department that oversees the practice of medicine — saying that a federal statute called EMTALA which allows abortion care and any other care in an emergency, that that shouldn’t apply in Texas.” Like in Texas, Indiana’s legislature passed a near-total abortion ban that went into effect on August 1. It’s a hostile state for people who need abortions; medication abortion is illegal, and Attorney General Todd Rokita in June signed a letter opposing an amendment to HIPAA, the federal medical privacy law, which would prevent state officials from accessing information about patients who traveled out of state to get an abortion. Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, and Kentucky, told Vox in an interview that the lack of clarity in these laws is the point. “These laws, and this new law, are incredibly confusing,” she said. ”Extreme lawmakers are writing these laws intentionally to cause harm, to create chaos and confusion both for providers and for patients.” Gibron’s organization filed suit in the state Supreme Court to block the law from going into effect pending a case in trial court which would provide clarity specifically around the health exceptions to Indiana’s abortion ban. “It doesn’t stop the ban from going into effect, it simply is asking the court to clarify the health exception and to block the section of the ban that limits health care providers’ ability to offer abortions in cases where the health of the pregnant person is threatened,” she said. Without that clarity, not only are patients risking their lives with a pregnancy and doctors risking their practices, but it could cause a brain drain for reproductive health care providers who feel they can’t safely practice in the states where they live. That’s especially grave in a place like Indiana which has the third-highest maternal mortality rate in the country — and it’s increased 58 percent in the past three years. Zurawski v. State of Texas hinged on the testimony of 13 women and two physicians, who told the court about their life- or health-threatening pregnancies, and how difficult it was to get abortion care when they needed it. Their argument was that although Texas doesn’t have enshrined in the constitution a right to abortion, the plaintiffs and people like them — those who need an abortion for medical reasons — are protected under the state’s constitution. “Texas’s constitution has a right to life and liberty, plus they have an equal rights amendment — so, that guarantees equal treatment to women and men, something that does not exist in the federal Constitution,” Duane said. “We brought these life, liberty, and equality claims to the Texas state court because that is the source of the rights, is Texas law and the Texas constitution.” Duane and her team argued for clarification of the law, but they were also arguing, she told Vox, that “the bare minimum that we believe that pregnant people in Texas are entitled to is protection of their life and health, even while they’re pregnant.” The case will now go to Texas’s appellate court, and then to the state Supreme Court — which, Duane noted, is not known for its progressive stance on abortion. Other states have used the constitution more overtly to protect the right to abortion; Ohio will hold an election on Tuesday deciding State Issue 1, which could limit the ability to amend the state constitution through further ballot measures — including one that would enshrine the right to abortion in Ohio’s constitution. That measure will be voted on November 7 and would codify Ohioans’ right to “make and carry out [their] own reproductive decisions.” Abortion is presently legal in Ohio until viability despite a 2019 law banning the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy. A county court judge stayed that law last year after Roe v. Wade was overturned, ruling that Ohio’s state constitution grants the right to abortion because it gives women equal protection and benefit under the law.",https://www.vox.com/2023/8/5/23820360/texas-abortion-ban-medical-exception,11808
Mike Pence is one of the most anti-abortion Republicans in Washington. Here’s his record.,Emily Crockett,2017-01-27T16:25:01+00:00,"Anti-abortion protesters will march on Washington, DC, Friday as part of the annual March for Life. And for the first time, a sitting vice president, Mike Pence, will speak at the march. Pence is one of the most actively anti-abortion Republican politicians in the US today. He has said that he hopes to see Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, “consigned to the ash heap of history where it belongs.” Meanwhile, however, seven in 10 Americans oppose overturning Roe. Here’s an overview of Pence’s record on reproductive rights, both as a member of Congress representing Indiana from 2001 to 2013, and as governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2016. As Sarah Kliff explained for Vox, Pence started introducing bills to defund Planned Parenthood at the federal level in 2007. He did so every year until 2011, when his efforts finally got traction — and nearly caused a government shutdown. As I’ve explained, Pence wasn’t the first to think of the idea. Republicans have been trying to defund Planned Parenthood at the state level since the late 1970s, as part of a broader strategy to make abortion less affordable and accessible. But Pence is the one who turned defunding Planned Parenthood from a fringe issue into a mainstream GOP priority. Republicans voted nine times to defund the organization in the last Congress alone, and they’ve promised to try again this year. One bill would have essentially re-defined rape for the specific purposes of abortion access. The Hyde Amendment already blocks the use of federal funds to pay for abortions except in the case of rape, incest, or to save the woman’s life. But Pence’s bill would have limited that rape exception to cases of “forcible” rape — an outdated, overly limited definition of rape that the federal government no longer uses. Pence also introduced “personhood” legislation that would have defined a fertilized egg as a person. That would have outlawed abortion, and possibly some forms of contraception, as a result. Similar bills have repeatedly been rejected by voters as too extreme, even in states like Mississippi. Neither of those bills passed. As governor, Pence signed at least eight anti-abortion bills passed by the Indiana legislature. The most notable of these was a massive omnibus anti-abortion bill Pence signed in March of last year — which was later blocked by a judge because it unconstitutionally limited women’s right to abortion. That bill would have required all fetal tissue to be cremated or buried. Pence said this would ensure “dignified final treatment of the unborn.” In practice, however, the provision would have indirectly banned fetal tissue donation for research, and made abortion more expensive by essentially requiring funerary services for fetuses — no matter what stage of development. (That part of the bill inspired women to start a “Periods for Pence” campaign to call his office and tell staffers about their periods, just in case they were having a miscarriage the state would need to be notified about.) The bill also prohibited “discrimination” against a fetus “based only on the unborn child’s sex, race, color, national origin, ancestry or disability, including Down syndrome.” In practice, it kept women from choosing abortion in cases of serious anomalies, and encouraged doctors to unconstitutionally scrutinize a woman’s motives for seeking abortion. Other anti-abortion provisions Pence signed as governor of Indiana included: When Trump chose Mike Pence as his running mate he sent a strong signal to the pro-life movement, which had been wary about Trump’s record on abortion, that he would take their side. And from Trump’s promises to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade to his recent reinstatement and massive expansion of the global gag rule, it’s clear that Pence will have a strong influence on reproductive rights policy in the White House.",https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/27/14412660/mike-pence-record-abortion-reproductive-rights-march-for-life,11808
2020 is quickly becoming the abortion rights election. Here’s proof.,Dylan Scott,2019-06-10T20:10:00+00:00,"Iowa Democratic voters, who will get the first say in picking their party’s presidential nominee next year, prioritize a women’s right to abortion above any other major issue heading into the meat of the 2020 campaign, according to a new survey. CNN asked Iowa voters about what positions are must-haves in selecting a presidential nominee. More Democrats selected supporting a woman’s right to have an abortion as a must-have — 79 percent of in-person Iowa caucus-goers and 80 percent of virtual caucus-goers — than any other issue. (Iowa is letting people virtually participate in its caucuses for the first time for 2020, but that is an explainer for another day and another newsletter.) Abortion ranked slightly ahead of recognizing climate change as the greatest threat to humanity (about 75 percent of all caucus-goers) and well ahead of the other positions CNN asked about, like supporting the Green New Deal, expanding student debt forgiveness and breaking up big tech companies. Abortion rights also topped the other big health care issue the pollsters asked about: Medicare-for-all. Nearly but not quite half of Iowa caucus-goers said that supporting a shift to a completely government-run health care system was a must-have for them. It looks like abortion rights will be one of the most animating issues of the 2020 campaign, especially as Republican-led states pass aggressive abortion restrictions. It might not divide Democratic candidates in the same way single-payer does, but, after Joe Biden’s tortured reversal on the Hyde Amendment last week, it has quickly become a dominant issue in the 2020 debate. I spoke separately with NARAL Pro-Choice America’s Kristin Ford and Erin Davison-Rippey, state executive director for Planned Parenthood in Iowa, about the polling and why abortion has surged to the front of the political discourse. Those conversations have been combined and lightly edited for clarity and length. I was a little bit surprised by the CNN finding, to be candid. Not that abortion rights were important to Democratic voters, but that it outranked every other issue that the pollsters asked about as a must-have for presidential candidates. I think the reason behind that is the threats are so acute right now. They’ve ramped up in such a significant way in a period of just a few months across the country. Voters in Iowa see this firsthand because their state was really ground zero. Iowa passed a six-week abortion ban last year, which was struck down by the courts, but it really animated the electorate there. Those types of really extreme bans on abortion are sweeping the nation and really capturing public attention in an unprecedented way. There’s so much at stake right now given the way [President Donald] Trump has stacked the judiciary with anti-choice judges, the fact that Brett Kavanaugh sits on the Supreme Court. Anti-choice forces in this country feel really, really emboldened and voters know that they feel emboldened and they know what’s at stake. I think what we are seeing is people responding to what has now been in Iowa three years of relentless attacks on legal abortion, on access to reproductive health and birth control. It has reached a point where people absolutely are no longer willing to accept anything less than folks being in complete support of these issues. What has happened in Iowa that has made this such a salient issue for voters there? After the 2016 election, we have seen unrelenting attacks on a variety of issues related to sexual and reproductive health. In Iowa, there was a power shift in the Senate. Democrats had held a narrow majority until then, so we had seen a partisan balance in the legislature. The GOP controlled and continues to control the Iowa House, Senate, and governor’s office. The second bill out of the Iowa Senate in the 2017 legislative session was a bill to defund Planned Parenthood. They came out of the gate. That bill did take the entirety of session to make it to the governor’s desk because there was voracious opposition. What ended up passing first was a 20-week abortion ban and a forced 72-hour waiting period. That went to the governor’s desk and was passed. They eventually snuck the defunding into the budget. Planned Parenthood sued over the 72-hour waiting period. In the meantime, we ended up in another legislative session, in 2018. We then saw the introduction of what was at that time the country’s most restrictive abortion ban, banning abortion at six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many people know they are pregnant. So the attacks we are seeing across the country started last year in Iowa. Iowa was used as the test case for how far can we get the most restrictive bill. Again, it took them the entirety of the legislative session and they ultimately got enough votes to pass the six-week abortion ban. Again, Planned Parenthood sued and the courts put a temporary hold on that. In the meantime, the 72-hour case worked its way up to the Iowa Supreme Court. The Iowa Supreme Court, in the summer of 2018, came back and ruled in our favor on the 72-hour waiting period. They came out and said according to the Iowa Constitution, abortion is a constitutionally protected right held to the highest level of scrutiny. It was a really strong protection coming from the Iowa Supreme Court. So when we were successful at the district court level on the six-week ban, even the governor declined to appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court because everyone was very clear that based on that ruling that abortion was a constitutionally protected right. There is just no way the six-week abortion ban would be constitutional. What we have heard time and time again of people standing up and stepping forward and saying I can no longer stay silent. These issues are too important. You hear a lot of people say I took for granted that these rights would be safe. I never thought people would try to make abortion illegal. You see more and more people saying this has gone too far. Obviously, this has been a long-running debate since Roe v. Wade and even before that. Why do people view this as a pivotal moment? There’s this interesting tension, which is that the anti-choice GOP and the anti-choice activists have been working for decades in a really systematic, strategic, long-term way to gut Roe. This has been their master plan basically since the Supreme Court guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion. But with Trump in the White House, with the make-up of the courts being what they are thanks to Trump, they see a real opportunity and they’re leaning into it with all of their strength. I think voters see that and they’re very alarmed about what that means. They’ve been trying these attacks for years, but they’re really ramping up. The polling on abortion has always been interesting to me. My read on it has been that Americans do feel conflicted to some degree. There are a sizable amount of people who don’t oppose abortion altogether but who think that maybe some restrictions make sense. How do you balance those factors, recognizing that there are powerful political forces that would like to see abortion restricted as much as possible if not banned outright with this somewhat more modulated view that the American electorate sometimes seems to have? One of the things that can often happen is that the labels pro-life and pro-choice can confuse the question. Because there are a number of people who personally identify as pro-life. They may feel morally opposed to abortion or it’s not something they would choose for themselves. But 7 in 10 Americans don’t believe it’s their place to decide for other people. That’s where I think the conversation can get confused or muddied. It’s really the government’s role or the role of politicians. Sometimes, there’s a conflation between self-identifiers and what your stance is on preserving the access to abortion as a safe and legal choice, even if it’s a choice you wouldn’t make yourself as an individual. So you see it as important to maintain that delineation between personal choices and what the government actually mandates or restrictions it sets. Yes. Because Roe has been seen as the law of the land for 40-some years, it’s important to measure and gauge how people feel about that, and support for Roe has hit all-time highs. As it is increasingly under threat in ways it has not been in the past, it has become more and more clear that, regardless of personal orientation, strong majorities of Americans support what was enshrined under Roe v. Wade. So I have to ask about Joe Biden’s Hyde Amendment rollercoaster last week. I think it’s pretty clear people believe abortion should be safe and legal and accessible to people, regardless of their income. What we have seen over the years in chipping away at abortion access is that it is not enough for something to be legal on paper. If you look at the Hyde Amendment, what you are doing is you are discriminating against people who have lower incomes and we know this disproportionately affects people of color. Folks are realizing it is not just enough for abortion to be legal, and therefore safe, it must be accessible. The Hyde Amendment just does not align with that. We are glad that it appears folks are all on the same page across the board. Is that the kind of thing you think people can move past? Is it a warning sign that we had to go through that roller coaster in the first place? Or is it that he’s landed where he landed and we can move on? So Tim Ryan is an interesting example. When Tim Ryan got to the House, he was anti-choice and he experienced this evolution on the issue. We certainly want to encourage politicians who aren’t 100 percent where we would like them to be and where the American public would like them to be, to give people space to evolve and change in positive directions, to listen to women. I think that’s what we saw last week. During that news cycle last week, I think there was a risk of treating it as Joe Biden versus the rest of the Democrats, who are a monolith and they’re all exactly the same on this issue. Are there any other notable nuances in some of the other candidates’ positions on abortion or reproductive rights that voters should know about? On the question of Hyde, I think Biden was an outlier among the major candidates and now they’re all aligned. To your broader question, though, we are certainly encouraging strong leadership and concrete plans from all of the candidates on what they will do to safeguard reproductive freedom, especially in light of these unprecedented assaults. We’ve seen some candidates step up with pretty specific plans. Kamala Harris’s plan was similar to the Voting Rights Act in the role that the Justice Department would play in authorizing bills that are related to reproductive rights. It’s an interesting approach, and we’re certainly excited to see those kinds of plans. Elizabeth Warren has a concrete plan out. We’ve seen from Kirsten Gillibrand and Julian Castro a commitment to appoint judges who would pledge to uphold Roe v. Wade, which is also an important part of the equation. We would like to see all the candidates put forth concrete proposals on how they would protect and safeguard reproductive freedom in their administration going forward.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/10/18659919/iowa-abortion-laws-2020-election-biden-hyde-amendment,11808
Missouri could become the first state with zero abortion clinics. How did we get here?,Anna North,2019-05-31T19:18:27+00:00,"Missouri might be about to lose its last remaining abortion clinic. The clinic, in St. Louis, is in a dispute with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which has refused to renew its license unless its doctors agree to interviews about what it says are “deficient practices.” Planned Parenthood, meanwhile, says state officials haven’t explained what the deficiencies are — and they fear that interviews could lead to criminal prosecution in Missouri, which recently passed a near-total ban on abortion. Planned Parenthood has sued the state for the right to keep performing abortions at the clinic. On Friday, a judge at the Circuit Court of St. Louis issued a temporary restraining order that will allow the clinic to keep operating for now, with the next hearing in the case scheduled for Tuesday. If the clinic closes, Missouri would become the only state in the US without an abortion clinic. It would be the first time any state has lacked a functioning abortion clinic since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. The story of how Missouri got to this point is a kind of capsule history of the anti-abortion movement over the past 10 years. In the early 2000s, abortion opponents backed incremental restrictions on abortion clinics at the state level. These laws are largely responsible for the closure of four abortion clinics in Missouri since 2008. Today, Missouri has the highest ratio of women of reproductive age to abortion provider of any state in the country, with more than a million women in that age group for just one facility, according to Ushma Upadhyay, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California San Francisco who has studied abortion access. “The state makes it extremely hostile for an abortion facility to remain open,” Upadhyay, who works in the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) research group at UCSF, told Vox. Meanwhile, since the election of President Trump, anti-abortion advocates have pursued a more aggressive strategy, backing the near-total bans on abortion around the country that have passed in recent months. Missouri’s ban, which prohibits abortion at eight weeks’ gestation, was signed into law last week. Many proponents of near-total abortion bans hope they will lead the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that established the right to an abortion. But depending on what happens with Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit, the incremental strategy might prevail in Missouri before the aggressive one — and Missouri could enter a post-Roe reality before the Court even takes up the case. The current dispute began in March, when state officials started an audit of the clinic, Sabrina Tavernise reports at the New York Times. In the process, officials said they had found “deficient practices” and that all physicians at the clinic would have to submit to an interview. The state said consequences of the interview could include “criminal proceedings,” a clinic spokesperson told CBS. Planned Parenthood said it was not clear what “deficient practices” the state objected to. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has not yet responded to Vox’s request for comment. Planned Parenthood said state officials could interview two physicians at the clinic who are full-time employees of Planned Parenthood, but five medical residents who are not Planned Parenthood employees declined to be interviewed. On Tuesday, the clinic had reached “an impasse” with the state, according to Planned Parenthood’s head of litigation. Its license to provide abortions is set to expire at the end of this week. So Planned Parenthood filed suit, and a hearing was set for Thursday to determine whether the clinic could continue offering abortions while the case progressed. At a press conference on Wednesday, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, who signed the state’s eight-week ban, warned that it would be “reckless” for a judge to allow the clinic to keep offering abortions. “No judge should give special treatment to Planned Parenthood in this instance,” he said. He also said the state had identified “deficiencies” at the clinic but did not say what they were. Parson “has made it clear that his goal is to ban abortion care in the state of Missouri, and today’s comments confirmed that this is exactly what this is all about,” said Dr. Leana Wen, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement after the press conference. “Our health center meets the highest standard of care.” Abortion-rights supporters have been showing support for the clinic this week, attending a rally in downtown St. Louis on Thursday as well as holding a sit-in at a building in the city where Gov. Parson has an office. Several activists, including M’Evie Mead, director of policy and organizing at Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri, were arrested at the sit-in, according to the Riverfront Times. Regardless of what happens with the lawsuit, the clinic will stay open and provide non-abortion services like STI screenings and contraceptive care, a Planned Parenthood representative told CNN. The situation in Missouri is in large part a result of restrictions known as targeted regulation of abortion providers, or TRAP, laws. These laws, backed by anti-abortion groups in the 2000s, and especially after Republicans gained majorities in many state legislatures in 2010, include requirements that abortion doctors have admitting privileges at a local hospital or that abortion clinics have hallways of a certain width. Abortion opponents have said that these laws are necessary to protect patients’ health, but many doctors and researchers say they are medically unfounded. Upadhyay, the obstetrics and gynecology professor, says her team has studied admitting privileges restrictions and found no effect on patient care. But the laws do have an effect on clinics, often forcing them to close as the requirements prove too difficult to meet. It can be hard for abortion doctors to get admitting privileges, for instance, as hospitals often refuse to grant them. TRAP laws passed around the country in the 2000s, but they have had an especially big impact in Missouri. In 2008, the state had five abortion clinics. In 2017, it had two. In October 2018, one of those clinics closed after it couldn’t meet a new requirement that abortion doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital within 15 minutes of the clinic, according to the Washington Post. The Supreme Court in the 2016 decision Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt found TRAP laws in Texas unconstitutional. But the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Missouri in its jurisdiction, has failed to block such laws. The ongoing march of restrictions has left the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis to serve the more than 1 million patients of reproductive age in Missouri. Maine, the state with the lowest ratio of women of reproductive age to clinics, has one clinic for about every 13,000 women in the age group, Upadhyay said. Her team has identified two cities in Missouri, Springfield and Columbia, as “abortion deserts,” where patients have to travel 100 miles or more to get an abortion. The situation in Missouri is a reminder that while near-total bans in Southern states like Georgia and Alabama have gotten attention in recent months, clinic restrictions in the Midwest have already made abortion out of reach for many patients there. There are “huge swaths of the middle of the country where there is no access,” Upadhyay said. And while many of the near-total bans are meant as challenges to Roe v. Wade, Missouri could lose its last abortion provider without the Supreme Court saying a word.",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/30/18644611/missouri-last-abortion-clinic-2019-planned-parenthood,11808
Clinton and Sanders were asked about abortion. Their answers weren't the same.,Emily Crockett,2016-03-09T15:50:02+00:00,"Reproductive rights advocates are frustrated that none of the seven televised Democratic debates so far have asked any questions about abortion rights. But while it wasn't an official Democratic debate, Monday night's Fox News town hall finally asked both candidates direct questions about abortion in a public forum. This is important, because abortion in America is a lot more complicated than whether a candidate supports Roe v. Wade and the ""right to choose."" States have passed more anti-abortion laws in the past five years than they did in the previous two decades, and some of those laws are being challenged at the Supreme Court. These laws affect whether a woman can afford an abortion, how late she can get one, and whether she can access one in her own community or whether she'll have to cross state lines. And Clinton and Sanders's differing answers on abortion at the Fox town hall showed why it's important to ask candidates about the issue, even pro-choice Democrats.  ""Can you name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be okay with abortion being illegal?"" moderator Bret Baier asked Sanders during his time on stage. ""It’s not a question of me being okay,"" Sanders said. ""I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to do with her own body. I think, I believe, and I understand there are honest people. I mean, I have a lot of friends, some supporters, some disagree. They hold a different point of view, and I respect that. But that is my view."" Sanders pivoted to his frustration with Republicans who want to ""get the government off our backs,"" yet ""somehow on this issue, they want to tell every woman in America what she should do with her body."" Baier followed up: ""I guess the genesis of the question is that there are some Democrats who say after five months, with the exception of the life of the mother or the health of the baby, that perhaps that’s something to look at. You’re saying no."" Sanders's answer suggested that he had no interest in haggling over restrictions and exceptions: ""I am very strongly pro-choice. That is a decision to be made by the woman, her physician, and her family. That’s my view.""  ""Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it’s born?"" Baier asked Clinton. ""Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?"" Clinton started by discussing the Supreme Court decision ""that would shut down a lot of the options for women in Texas,"" as well as ""other legislatures that have taken similar steps to try to restrict a woman’s right to obtain an abortion."" The right to an abortion under Roe v. Wade is ""not much of a right if it is totally limited and constrained,"" Clinton said. ""So I think we have to continue to stand up for a woman’s right to make these decisions, and to defend Planned Parenthood, which does an enormous amount of good work across our country."" Baier pressed. ""Just to be clear, there’s no — without any exceptions?"" ""No — I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother,"" Clinton said. ""I object to the recent effort in Congress to pass a law saying after 20 weeks, you know, no such exceptions. Because although these are rare, Bret, they sometimes arise in the most complex, difficult medical situations."" Like ""fetal malformities [sic]?"" Baier asked. ""And threats to the woman's health,"" Clinton said. ""Under Roe v. Wade, it is appropriate to say, in these circumstances, so long as there's an exception for the life and health of the mother."" It's no accident that Baier asked about abortion restrictions after five months of pregnancy — or 20 weeks, which is halfway through the second trimester. Twenty-week abortion bans are very popular among anti-abortion lawmakers. Congress has repeatedly tried and failed to pass such a ban, and 12 states have succeeded — but several courts have blocked these laws on constitutional grounds. Roe v. Wade says you can't ban abortion before a fetus is viable, and the medical consensus is that 20-week fetuses are not viable. That's why if the Supreme Court ever decided to rule on 20-week bans, it could mean a new challenge to Roe. Supporters of 20-week bans say they're necessary because fetuses can feel pain by then. But the medical consensus doesn't support that view either, and doctors note that many serious fetal anomalies can't be diagnosed until the 20-week ultrasound. Sanders didn't explicitly say that he'd veto a 20-week abortion ban, but his answer and his record of blocking similar laws make it pretty clear that he doesn't support them. Clinton's answer on later abortion was less clear. For instance, by ""late pregnancy regulation"" did she mean after 20 weeks, or later? She said she opposed 20-week bans that don't have adequate exceptions for a woman's health — and most Republican-sponsored 20-week bans do indeed fall short on this. But it wasn't clear from Clinton's answer whether she'd support a 20-week ban that did have adequate health exceptions. The Clinton campaign later clarified to Vox: ""Hillary Clinton is on record and continues to oppose 20-week abortion bans, which are a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade and therefore unconstitutional. ... She also recognizes that Roe v. Wade provides that restrictions are constitutional later in pregnancy so long as there are clear exceptions for the life and health of the woman."" That's consistent with what Clinton has said in the past, both about 20-week bans and about later abortion restrictions in the third trimester that are consistent with what Roe v. Wade allows. Abortion opponents often ask pro-choice people about aborting 8- or 9-month-old fetuses to press them into drawing a clear legal line, which seems to be what Baier was trying to do. Marco Rubio did this more explicitly when he claimed during a GOP debate that Clinton supports abortion ""even on the due date."" She doesn't — and as OB-GYNs will tell you, ""due-date abortions"" are not actually a thing. Reputable doctors only end a very late pregnancy if there is a problem, either by inducing labor or performing an expensive four-day procedure. The differences between the candidates' answers on abortion were like the differences between their answers on a lot of issues. Sanders came across as more unwavering and moralistic, but also less specific. Clinton came across as more cautious and equivocal, but also more interested in nuance and policy. Given the realities of medicine and Roe v. Wade, it's not clear how different their positions on later abortion really are in practice — but Sanders seemed less willing to concede that any restrictions would be valid. Abortion rights advocates were pleased with both answers, but some thought that Clinton told a clearer story about how abortion rights are under attack. ""Both candidates unequivocally stated that they support a woman's right to make her own decisions, and that's a good thing,"" said NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue, whose organization has endorsed Clinton, in a statement. ""And we are so grateful to Hillary Clinton tonight for, once again, focusing the nation's attention on the current crisis in abortion access facing this country, even when asked a question that is not relevant to the experience of the vast majority of the one in three women in this country who have had an abortion."" It's true that the question only applied to the roughly 1.4 percent of abortions that happen after 21 weeks. But it was still revealing, and showed why moderators shouldn't ignore the issue.",https://www.vox.com/2016/3/9/11181870/clinton-sanders-abortion-questions-fox,11808
The coming legal showdown over abortion pills,Ian Millhiser,2023-01-22T13:00:00+00:00,"The Comstock Act is one of the most laughably unconstitutional laws that is still part of the United States Code. Named after Anthony Comstock, who the Supreme Court once described as “a prominent anti-vice crusader who believed that ‘anything remotely touching upon sex was ... obscene,’” the law is vague, overbroad, and purports to make it a felony to mail a simply astonishing array of material. Among other things, the act makes it a crime to mail any “lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article” (whatever that means). It prohibits mailing any “thing” for “any indecent or immoral purpose” (again, whatever that means). And, in a provision that largely sat dormant while Roe v. Wade was still good law, the Comstock Act purports to make it a crime to mail any “drug” that “is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply it for producing abortion.” But, of course, thanks to a Supreme Court dominated by Republican appointees, Roe is no longer good law. And that means that this prudish law named after an impossibly squeamish man is suddenly relevant again. Read broadly, the law could make distribution of abortion-inducing drugs incredibly complicated. Medication abortions — that is, abortions induced by pills — account for more than half of all abortions in the United States. As my colleague Rachel Cohen explained, medication abortion is also the next frontier in the anti-abortion right’s campaign against reproductive freedom. Even as the Biden administration attempts to expand access to abortion-inducing medication, mostly Republican lawmakers in mostly red states have ambitious plans to prevent patients from obtaining these drugs. According to the Guttmacher Institute, state lawmakers introduced 118 restrictions on medication abortions, across 22 different state legislatures, in 2022 alone. Inevitably, the future of medication abortion will end up litigated in the courts. And important questions such as whether abortion medications can be shipped within the United States could easily come down to how a Republican-dominated judiciary wants to interpret the newly relevant Comstock law. This uncertainty over an 1873 law, written by people who appeared unaware that the Bill of Rights exists, is a microcosm for a much broader problem facing abortion providers. When Roe fell, numerous state and federal abortion restrictions that were blocked by Roe suddenly came online. Many of these laws haven’t been interpreted by any court since 1973, when Roe eliminated the need to parse most anti-abortion statutes. Some of them were enacted when Roe was good law, and have never been interpreted by any court. That means that abortion providers, including clinics and pharmacies that provide abortion pills, have operated in a world of extraordinary legal uncertainty for months. They often cannot get reliable legal advice on what is or is not illegal, because there are no recent court decisions laying out what these abortion restrictions actually do. This problem is made worse, moreover, because not every judge hearing abortion-related lawsuits operates in good faith. The most ominous example of this problem, for anyone who needs a medication abortion, is a currently pending lawsuit seeking to force the FDA to withdraw its approval of mifepristone — an abortion drug it approved nearly 23 years ago. That case is currently pending before a Trump-appointed judge named Matthew Kacsmaryk. Kacsmaryk, who has a history of reading the law in outlandish ways to achieve conservative results, also shares Anthony Comstock’s obsession with other people’s sexuality. In a 2015 article, Kacsmaryk denounced a so-called “Sexual Revolution” that began in the 1960s and 1970s, and which “sought public affirmation of the lie that the human person is an autonomous blob of Silly Putty unconstrained by nature or biology, and that marriage, sexuality, gender identity, and even the unborn child must yield to the erotic desires of liberated adults.” So, to summarize, abortion providers face a crush of older and uncertain restrictions, many of which can at least plausibly be read to prohibit them from performing very basic tasks — such as receiving a supply of mifepristone in the mail. State lawmakers have prepped a wide range of bills adding new restrictions to medication abortions. And the federal judiciary and many state courts are dominated by Republican appointees who reasonably can be expected to read abortion restrictions expansively, regardless of what the law actually says. That’s bad news for anyone who needs a medication abortion. The debate over what restrictions the Comstock Act places on interstate shipments of abortion pills matters a great deal, because it is unclear how abortion providers and patients can get these drugs at all if they can’t be shipped. As legal scholar and abortion expert Mary Ziegler recently told NPR, “abortion clinics are not manufacturing their own pills; they’re purchasing them from drug companies, pharmacies or getting them in the mail.” If pharmaceutical makers cannot distribute their products to people who need them, then those products may as well not exist. In fairness, even the broadest reading of the Comstock Act probably wouldn’t prevent a major pharmaceutical company or a large chain of pharmacies from using its own trucks to distribute mifepristone, but, at the very least, a broad reading of the law could force drug companies, pharmacists, and abortion providers to construct supply chains that avoid the mail altogether. The Biden administration, for its part, is trying to make it easier to distribute abortion-related medications. In early January, for example, the Food and Drug Administration announced a new rule relaxing restrictions on pharmacists dispensing abortion-inducing medication. One upshot of these rules is that mifepristone will be more widely available through mail-order pharmacies. The FDA’s new rule, moreover, follows a Justice Department memo, released shortly before Christmas, which argues that the Comstock Act should be read narrowly to permit abortion-inducing drugs to be mailed “where the sender lacks the intent that the recipient of the drugs will use them unlawfully.” This memo signals that, at least as long as President Joe Biden holds office, the DOJ will not prosecute mifepristone manufacturers and mail-order pharmacies under the Comstock Act — although it remains to be seen what happens if a Republican takes over. (Disclosure: The Justice Department memo is signed by Assistant Attorney General Christopher Schroeder. I was briefly Schroeder’s research assistant when I was a law student.) The Schroeder memo makes a very serious, but hardly airtight, legal argument that the Comstock Act must be read narrowly. As the memo notes, for more than a century, federal appeals courts rebelled against the Comstock Act’s sweeping language, which purports to not just prohibit abortion-related medication from the mails, but also any “paper” or “writing” that may “be used or applied for producing abortion.” A 1915 decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that, although “the letter of the statute would cover all acts of abortion,” the Comstock Act must be given a “reasonable construction” to permit physicians to advertise that they will perform lifesaving abortions. Later decisions imposed additional limits on the Comstock Act. Most significantly, the Second Circuit’s decision, in the hilariously named case United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries (1936), held that the act should only be read to ban items used for “unlawful” abortions from the mails. Based on One Package and other cases that read the Comstock Act similarly, the Schroeder memo argues that the Comstock Act “does not prohibit the mailing of mifepristone or misoprostol where the sender lacks the intent that the recipient will use them unlawfully” (misoprostol is another drug that is commonly used in medication abortions). Thus, under the DOJ’s reading of the statute, even if a pharmaceutical company ships a supply of mifepristone to a state where abortion is illegal, a prosecutor targeting that company would need to prove that the shipper intended the drug to be used in an illegal abortion — and not for some other lawful purpose, such as terminating a life-threatening pregnancy or treating an illness unrelated to pregnancy. Of course, even under this reading of the statute, some prosecutions would still be allowed. Suppose, for example, that a student at the University of Texas calls her parents in a panic because she is pregnant and abortion is illegal in the conservative red state. Her parents, who live in the blue state of New York, obtain abortion-inducing medications and mail them to her, with the intent that she use them to terminate her pregnancy. Under the Schroeder memo’s interpretation of the Comstock Act, these parents might be vulnerable to a prosecution. Even in this hypothetical, however, it is unclear if such a prosecution would be successful — at least according to the Schroeder memo. As it notes, “some states that regulate the conduct of certain actors involved in abortions do not make it unlawful for the woman herself to abort her pregnancy.” So a prosecution of this Texas student’s parents could turn on the subtleties of state abortion law. And the Schroeder memo could provide a safe haven to companies that distribute mifepristone and similar drugs widely, since they cannot know how each individual dose of the drug will be used, and prosecutors would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they acted with unlawful intent. So long as a Democrat occupies the Oval Office, federal prosecutors are unlikely to bring criminal charges that are at odds with the Schroeder memo’s reading of the Comstock Act. Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone would be federallyprosecuted for distributing mifepristone in a Democratic administration. And if a rogue prosecutor did bring such a prosecution, Biden could use his pardon power to shut it down. But the fact that the DOJ interprets the law one way today is no guarantee that it will read it the same way in a Republican administration. And, while the Schroeder memo reaches an entirely reasonable conclusion based on existing case law, there is no Supreme Court decision interpreting the Comstock Act in the narrow way it was read in One Package and similar cases. The current Supreme Court, with its virulently anti-abortion majority, could simply ignore One Package and construe the Comstock Act to ban any shipments of mifepristone altogether. The troubling thing about the Comstock Act is that, if judges are willing to ignore more than a century of case law interpreting that act narrowly, the text of the law plausibly can be read to shut down public distribution of drugs like mifepristone. There are no shortage of judges, however, who don’t really need a plausible legal argument in order to implement the Republican Party’s policy goals. Foremost among them is Matthew Kacsmaryk. Just in case there’s any doubt, the plaintiffs’ arguments in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, the lawsuit attempting to force FDA to unapprove mifepristone, are ridiculous. For starters, the FDA originally approved mifepristone as a drug that can be marketed in the United States in 2000, and the statute of limitations to file a lawsuit challenging the FDA’s approval of a new medication is six years. As the Justice Department lays out in its brief explaining why the law does not permit Kacsmaryk to target mifepristone, there are also grave doubts that Kacsmaryk even has jurisdiction to hear this case in the first place. Even if these problems with the Alliance lawsuit could be ignored, the plaintiffs’ arguments fall apart on the merits. One of their primary arguments, for example, is that FDA didn’t follow its own regulations when it approved mifepristone in 2000. But even if that were true, Congress enacted a law in 2007 that deemed any “drug that was approved before the effective date of this Act” to be in compliance with the relevant federal legal requirements. I could go on, but really, what’s the point? The Alliance lawsuit rests on the extraordinary theory that an immensely controversial drug has been lawful for nearly a quarter-century — a period that includes the entire George W. Bush administration and the entire Trump administration — and, somehow, five different presidential administrations failed to notice that this drug was not properly approved. This all said, it is difficult to exaggerate just how little Matthew Kacsmaryk is likely to care about what the law actually says. Kacsmaryk is the same judge who unlawfully ordered the Biden administration to implement a Trump-era border policy, and then, after he was reversed by the Supreme Court, did it again. He is the same judge who recently claimed that fathers have a constitutional right to restrict their daughters’ access to birth control. So, while it is possible that this lawsuit will prove too much even for Kacsmaryk, his record suggests he might leap at this chance to impose his conservative personal views on others. As a matter of law, it’s unclear what would even happen if Kacsmaryk rules that the FDA acted unlawfully when it approved mifepristone as an abortion-inducing drug in 2000. As Nathan Cortez, a law professor at Southern Methodist University, told me over email, mifepristone has “other FDA-approved uses completely separate” from its use as an abortifacient — it’s “approved for patients with Cushing’s syndrome and Type 2 diabetes.” So doctors most likely could still write “off-label” mifepristone prescriptions for abortion patients even if the drug were no longer approved for that purpose. But what if Kacsmaryk issues a broad order that also purports to ban off-label use of the drug? Ultimately, the only thing we know for sure about the Alliance case is that, at some point, Kacsmaryk will issue an order concerning the legality of a very common abortion drug. And, if Kacsmaryk behaves as he has in past cases, the scope of that order will be limited only by his own desires and ambitions. If that were not bad enough news for patients seeking abortions, this drama is likely to repeat itself over and over again as states pass restrictions, and as other litigants try to use the courts to stop the distribution of mifepristone. The future of abortion rights in the United States, in other words, is likely to be chaos — and this is especially true for anyone seeking a medication abortion. Without Roe to protect abortion patients, those patients’ rights are subject to laws from another era, as well as newer abortion restrictions that have not been interpreted by any court. And those patients’ rights can be cut off at any time by the likes of Kacsmaryk.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/1/22/23539363/abortion-medication-mifepristone-supreme-court-pills-comstock-matthew-kacsmaryk,11808
Elizabeth Warren just announced her abortion platform. It’s aggressive.,Anna North,2019-05-17T12:02:59+00:00,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday released a statement calling on Congress to pass a slate of legislation aimed at guaranteeing abortion and other reproductive rights around the country, even if Roe v. Wade falls. The statement, posted on Medium, comes as a wave of strict anti-abortion laws are sweeping the country. On Wednesday, Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama signed into law a bill banning nearly all abortions in the state, with no exceptions for rape or incest. On Thursday, the Missouri state Senate passed a bill banning the procedure at eight weeks (the bill now goes back to the state House for approval). Many of these laws are aimed squarely at overturning Roe. “This is a dark moment,” Warren writes. “People are scared and angry. And they are right to be. But this isn’t a moment to back down — it’s time to fight back.” While many Democratic candidates have condemned restrictive anti-abortion laws in recent days, only a few, like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), have taken concrete positions on how they would defend abortion access. With her statement, Warren joins that group. She calls on Congress to enshrine the right to abortion in federal statute, in case Roe v. Wade is overturned and the current federal right to abortion is taken away. She also calls for a repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions, and federal legislation preventing states from passing medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion clinics. And she proposes a reversal of the Trump administration’s domestic gag rule, which bars providers that receive federal family planning funds from performing or referring patients for abortions. The legislation Warren supports has little chance of passage without a Democratic majority in Congress. But anti-abortion groups in recent years have abandoned an incremental approach in favor of a more aggressive one, and have seen major victories around the country. Now Warren is proposing an equally aggressive response. The Supreme Court has said in Roe v. Wade and in the 1992 decision Planned Parenthood v. Casey that states cannot ban abortion prior to viability, when a fetus can survive outside the womb. But there’s no federal statute guaranteeing the right to an abortion. That means that if Roe were to fall, the issue would be left up to the states, which could ban abortion as they see fit. Warren wants to change that, as well as passing other federal laws to help protect access to abortion and other reproductive health care. Here’s what her proposal calls for: “Polling data shows that 71% of Americans oppose overturning Roe — including 52% of Republicans,” Warren writes. “Congress should do its job and protect their constituents from these efforts by establishing affirmative, statutory rights that parallel Roe vs. Wade.” State TRAP laws, like requirements that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, proliferated in the years after 2010, when Republicans took over many state legislatures. Abortion opponents have argued that they are necessary to protect women’s health, but many doctors say they serve no medical purpose. In 2016, the Supreme Court dealt a blow to the laws, ruling in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedtthat two such laws in Texas did not have the medical benefit necessary to outweigh the burden they placed on patients seeking abortions. But that was before the appointment of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Court, and a new Court could reverse the decision in Whole Woman’s Health. To prevent a resurgence of TRAP laws, Warren is calling for the passage of an existing bill, the Women’s Health Protection Act, which bars states from passing restrictions on abortion clinics that do not “significantly advance women’s health or the safety of abortion services.” Warren calls on Congress to repeal the Hyde Amendment, allowing federal programs like Medicaid to pay for abortion care. She also calls for the passage of the EACH Woman Act, which would ban abortion restrictions in private insurance. And, she writes, “we should ensure that all future health coverage — including Medicare for All — includes contraception and abortion coverage.” Advocates of reproductive justice, a holistic approach that considers abortion access as part of a spectrum of health and other issues, have long pointed out that the right to an abortion doesn’t mean much if a person can’t afford the procedure. Warren’s recommendations on insurance are aimed at ensuring abortion is affordable as well as legal. The Trump administration in March released a rule barring groups that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving funding under Title X, which provides family planning funds aimed at low-income Americans. The rule would strip funding from Planned Parenthood, which currently serves about 41 percent of patients who get services under Title X, and reproductive health advocates say it will jeopardize low-income Americans’ ability to get contraception. The rule has been blocked by the courts for now, but Warren calls for getting rid of it. “We must undo the current Administration’s efforts to undermine women’s access to reproductive health care,” she writes — “including ending Trump’s gag rule and fully support Title X family planning funding.” She also mentions the reproductive justice movement directly, writing that the women of color who founded that movement “teach us that we must go beyond choice to ensure meaningful access for every woman in America — not just the privileged and wealthy few.” “We must build a future that protects the right of all women to have children, the right of all women to not have children, and the right to bring children up in a safe and healthy environment,” she adds. Warren’s recommendations are similar to those issued by Gillibrand on Thursday. Gillibrand also called for codifying Roe into statute and repealing the Hyde Amendment. And she went further by pledging to “create a funding stream to ensure reproductive health center access in every state and every region of the country.” Much of what Warren and Gillibrand propose can’t be accomplished with the current makeup of Congress. But both have set themselves apart from much of the rest of the Democratic field by calling for specific and far-reaching changes in response to a growing push, from legislatures around the country, to overturn Roe.",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/17/18628684/abortion-elizabeth-warren-platform-roe-v-wade,11808
"The Comstock Act, the long-dead law Trump could use to ban abortion, explained",Ian Millhiser,2024-05-27T12:00:00+00:00,"Donald Trump is speaking out of both sides of his mouth on abortion. On the one hand, Trump frequently claims credit for the Supreme Court’s decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion — and well he should, since the three Republicans he appointed to the Supreme Court all joined the Court’s 2022 decision permitting abortion bans. As Trump told Fox News last summer, “I did something that no one thought was possible. I got rid of Roe v. Wade.” At the same time, Trump at least claims that he has no interest in signing new federal legislation banning abortion. When a reporter asked Trump if he would sign such a ban last month, Trump’s answer was an explicit “no.” Behind the scenes, however, many of Trump’s closest allies tout a plan to ban abortion in all 50 states that doesn’t require any new federal legislation whatsoever. The linchpin of this plan is the Comstock Act, a long-defunct, 1873 law that, among other things, purports to ban “any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion” from being mailed or otherwise transported by an “express company” such as UPS or FedEx. Anyone who violates this law faces up to five years in prison — and the maximum sentence doubles for repeat offenders. Thus, anyone who delivers an abortion medication, or any device used in a surgical abortion, could potentially face such extraordinary sanctions that the transit of such goods would shut down. Many of the leading proponents of using Comstock to ban all abortions, moreover, are likely to be very influential within a second Trump administration, if such a thing occurs. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, for example, touts enforcing Comstock to ban abortion medication in its 920-page mega-white paper outlining policies for Trump. Similarly, Jonathan Mitchell, one of Trump’s personal lawyers and the architect of a Texas law that allows virtually anyone to collect bounties from abortion providers, bragged to the New York Times that “we don’t need a federal ban when we have Comstock on the books.” There are very strong legal arguments that Comstock cannot actually be used to effectively ban abortion, at least in places where abortion is legal. The law has not been seriously enforced for nearly a century, and a long line of court decisions stretching back to at least 1915 have read the Comstock Act narrowly to prevent it from being used as a general ban on all abortions. Still, these precedents are only meaningful if the Supreme Court chooses to follow them, and betting on the same justices who overruled Roe to honor previous pro-abortion decisions is always a dangerous bet. It will get even more dangerous if Trump gets to appoint more justices. And, even if the Court ultimately decided to follow past decisions reading Comstock narrowly, months or years would likely pass between the Trump Justice Department’s decision to file criminal charges under the Comstock Act, and a Supreme Court decision halting that prosecution. In the interim, few, if any, distributors of medications and medical supplies are likely to risk shipping anything that could lead to themselves being prosecuted. So, while there is a fair amount of uncertainty about whether a second Trump administration could permanently shut down all legal abortions in the United States by enforcing the Comstock Act, it is likely that, at the very least, a Trump Justice Department could shut down abortion care for months or even years while the courts were sorting out what to do with Comstock prosecutions. The Comstock Act is a relic, not just of a more prudish era in American history, but of an age when the sort of individual rights that modern Americans take for granted effectively did not exist. Much of the law is unconstitutionally vague. It purports to make it a crime to mail “every obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article, matter, thing, device, or substance,” for “any indecent or immoral purpose.” Comstock and similar laws inspired a century of litigation just to determine what the word “obscene” means, and it’s anyone’s guess which items are “lewd,” “filthy,” or “vile.” Similarly, the law imposes a strict censorship code, targeting any “writing” that can be used “for any indecent or immoral purpose” — a provision that violates any plausible understanding of the First Amendment right to free speech. The Comstock Act’s namesake is Anthony Comstock, a 19th-century anti-vice crusader who wielded it and similar state laws against artists, authors, and reproductive health providers as indiscriminately as he wielded it against actual pornographers. Comstock once successfully brought criminal charges against an art gallery owner for selling reproductions of famous nude paintings. He also bragged, after a woman he arrested for selling contraceptive pills died by suicide, that she was the 15th person targeted by one of his investigations to take her own life. The censorious values that produced the Comstock Act, in other words, are quite alien to most modern-day Americans. The law stems from an era when women could not vote, when reproductive health care was far cruder and less reliable than it is today, and when Congress thought it was a good idea to ban books and fine art. A 2022 memo by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel lays out the very strong case for reading the Comstock Act narrowly. This memo argues that the law does not prohibit mailing or otherwise transporting abortion medications “where the sender lacks the intent that the recipient of the drugs will use them unlawfully.” Thus, under the current Justice Department’s reading of the law, abortion-related materials may still be shipped to states where abortion is legal. They may also be shipped if the sender is unaware that the recipient intends to use the item for an illegal purpose. As the memo notes, federal appeals courts have held for more than a century that the Comstock Act should not be read as a general ban on shipping any abortion-related item. In Bours v. United States (1915), for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the law must be given a “reasonable construction” to permit physicians to advertise in the mail that they will perform a lifesaving abortion. Later decisions read the law even more narrowly. One of the seminal court decisions interpreting the Comstock Act, the hilariously named Second Circuit decision in United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries (1936), held that the law only applies when someone ships an item intending it to be used for an illegal purpose. The Comstock Act, One Package concluded, “was not to prevent the importation, sale, or carriage by mail of things which might intelligently be employed by conscientious and competent physicians for the purpose of saving life or promoting the well being of their patients.” Accordingly, the court ruled that the statute must only be read to target “unlawful” activity. Though the Supreme Court never explicitly embraced the reasoning of Bours or One Package, that’s most likely because the Court’s constitutional decisions rendered the Comstock Act irrelevant for many decades. The Court’s decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) and Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972) established a constitutional right to contraception, thus preventing Comstock from being used to target birth control. And Roe, of course, until very recently prevented the government from banning abortion. Nevertheless, there are powerful legal arguments supporting the proposition that cases like One Package remain good law today and should prevent nearly any prosecution under the Comstock Act. As the Justice Department notes in its memo, the Postal Service “accepted the courts’ narrowing construction of the Act in administrative rulings, and it informed Congress of the agency’s acceptance of that construction” when Congress amended the law after Griswold to largely remove its provisions targeting contraception. Ordinarily, when Congress amends a law that has been consistently interpreted in a particular way by the courts, Congress is understood to ratify the courts’ reading of that law. As the Supreme Court held in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project (2015), “if a word or phrase has been ... given a uniform interpretation by inferior courts ... a later version of that act perpetuating the wording is presumed to carry forward that interpretation.” Many states, meanwhile, apply a doctrine known as “desuetude” to criminal laws that remain on the books, but that haven’t actually been used for a very long time. As the West Virginia Supreme Court said in a 1992 opinion, “a law prohibiting some act that has not given rise to a real prosecution in 20 years is unfair to the one person selectively prosecuted under it.” That said, this same West Virginia opinion also warned that the desuetude doctrine does not encompass particularly reprehensible acts — “if no one had been prosecuted under an obscure statute prohibiting ax murders since Lizzie Borden was acquitted, we would still allow prosecution under that statute today” — so even if the US Supreme Court were inclined to embrace this doctrine, the Republican-controlled Court might look upon abortion as morally similar to murder. Ultimately, in other words, the fate of a Comstock prosecution is not likely to rest upon whether Congress ratified One Package, or on whether there is legal support for the proposition that long-defunct criminal laws cease to function. The Supreme Court is made up of political appointees, some of whom are quite willing to ignore the law to achieve partisan goals, and the only way to definitely shut down Comstock prosecutions is to convince a majority of the justices to do so. Many Republican judges, meanwhile, have been quite willing to revive long-dead abortion bans now that Roe is no longer around. Just last month, for example, Arizona’s Supreme Court reinstated a Civil War era ban on abortions — although the state legislature quickly moved to repeal that ban. All of which is a long way of saying that the current status of the Comstock Act is highly uncertain, and will depend on who sits on the Supreme Court if and when the Justice Department decides to bring a prosecution under this law. And, even in the best-case scenario, if a future Justice Department is willing to do so, the mere threat of a Comstock prosecution is likely to shut down access to abortion pills (and potentially to surgical equipment used to perform abortions) throughout the country.",https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained,11808
"How the abortion debate moved away from “safe, legal, and rare”",Anna North,2019-10-18T10:50:00+00:00,"“I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing,” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said at the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night. “Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.” Clinton used this language in her 2008 presidential campaign; Bill Clinton, meanwhile, had introduced it into Democratic politics back in 1992. The language was likely meant to appeal to people who supported the right to an abortion in principle but still felt morally conflicted about the procedure — a large group, according to some polling. But many abortion rights advocates argued that calling for the procedure to be “rare” placed stigma on people who seek it. “There’s a fundamental notion of bodily autonomy that we’ve been fighting for as advocates and activists on this issue for years,” Destiny Lopez, co-director of the All* Above All Action Fund, a nonprofit that works to expand abortion access, told Vox. Saying abortion should be rare “completely negates all the work that we’ve done to really make this about the ability to decide what’s best for your body, for your family, for your community,” she said. Over the years, Democrats have become more sympathetic to this view. By 2016, Hillary Clinton had changed her message, saying only that abortion should be “safe and legal.” It was part of a broader shift in the party toward more full-throated support of abortion rights. During the 2016 primaries, both Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders called for a repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. Today, all the Democratic presidential candidates, including Gabbard, support allowing federal funding for the procedure — along with a slate of other reforms aimed at increasing access. But as Gabbard showed, the framing of “safe, legal, and rare” isn’t gone. Her comment, and the conversation surrounding it, were a reminder not just of how much the Democratic Party has changed in recent years on abortion rights, but of the divisions that still remain. The phrase “safe, legal, and rare” entered common usage during the 1992 campaign, when Bill Clinton frequently used it, according to the New York Times. “We have to remind the American people once again that being pro-choice is very different from being pro-abortion,” he told the Congressional Women’s Caucus that year. During her 2008 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton echoed her husband’s message, emphasizing that “by rare, I mean rare.” But over the years, abortion rights advocates have pushed back against the phrase. “Safe, legal, and rare” implies that getting an abortion is something that “you should be apologetic for,” reproductive justice activist Renee Bracey Sherman told Vox. “It places the blame on the person who’s had an abortion, as if they just did something wrong to need one, rather than addressing the systemic issue as to why someone might not be able to have access to consistent health care or contraception.” The push to destigmatize abortion has been part of a larger rise in people who have had abortions being open about their experiences. “Prior to 2016, we did not have a lot of people publicly saying the word abortion” or talking about their first-hand experiences, Lopez told Vox. But “there has just been this seismic shift” in the last few years “where we’ve seen more public conversations about the realities of abortion access in this country.” Those realities have changed a lot since 1992. Opponents of abortion have long sought to restrict the procedure, but after 2010, when Republicans took over many state legislatures, they successfully passed a slate of restrictions on abortion clinics that caused many facilities in the South and Midwest to close. Between 2011 and 2017, half of the clinics in Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, and Texas shut their doors. In 2017, 89 percent of counties had no abortion clinic, and six states had just one. That made it much harder for many Americans to get an abortion, especially if they couldn’t afford to travel to a far-away clinic. Meanwhile, Trump’s election in 2016 was soon followed by the appointment of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Many advocates on both sides of the issue believe that conservatives on the Court now have enough votes, if not to overturn the landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade, then at least to significantly weaken it. Earlier this month, the Court announced it would take a case that could give states the green light to pass even more clinic restrictions, possibly legislating clinics out of existence. In a time when access is dwindling and Roe is at risk, advocates have argued that calling for abortion to be “rare” just makes it even harder for people who already struggle to get the procedure — who are disproportionately likely to be poor, people of color, LGBTQ, immigrants, or belong to more than one of these groups — to push for their right to get it. “If there are barriers put in front of a person,” the “safe, legal, and rare” framing implies “that it does not matter because that procedure should be rare,” Lopez said. “So it essentially is denying these folks the ability to really access the care that they deserve.” For that reason, the All* Above All Action Fund says that abortion should be “safe, legal, accessible, and affordable,” not rare, Lopez said. Democratic candidates have been listening to concerns like these, and in recent years, they’ve moved away from “safe, legal, and rare.” The word “rare” was removed from the Democratic party platform in 2012, Bracey Sherman said, and in 2016, Clinton no longer used it on the campaign trail. A discussion of abortion in her 2017 book What Happened showed how much the former candidate’s language had changed on the issue. “We can debate the morality of abortion forever,” Clinton wrote, “but at the end of the day, who decides whether a woman gets or stays pregnant?” Her answer: “I say let women decide.” Clinton’s shift was part of a bigger move in the Democratic Party toward more outspoken and less equivocal support of abortion rights. In particular, advocates had been calling for a repeal of Hyde for years because the amendment, first passed in 1976, blocks Medicaid coverage for almost all abortions. As a result, many low-income Americans are blocked from getting the procedure or forced to go into debt or forego necessities to pay for it. In 2016, the Democratic Party added a call to repeal Hyde to its official platform. Today, all the Democrats running for the 2020 presidential nomination say they support allowing federal money to pay for abortions. Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who earlier this year supported leaving Hyde in place, now calls for its repeal. The move to repeal Hyde and the move away from “safe, legal, and rare” are linked, Bracey Sherman said. “This is just a general shift in moving away from stigmatizing people who need and have abortions.” But “safe, legal, and rare” isn’t completely gone. Gabbard — who once identified as pro-life but now says she supports abortion rights — used the phrase at the fourth presidential debate on Tuesday night, when she was asked how she would stop states from restricting abortion access. “We see how the consequences of laws that you’re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place,” Gabbard went on. “I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.” Many abortion rights advocates criticized her response, but one — former Planned Parenthood president Dr. Leana Wen — praised her, arguing that “we should reduce the need for abortions by investing in prevention.” Wen broke with other abortion rights advocates some time ago. When she was removed as Planned Parenthood’s president in July, she said in a statement that, “I believe that the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one.” Some said the group ousted her because it was looking for “a more aggressive political leader” on abortion rights, while others said she had management issues. Since she left Planned Parenthood, Wen has argued that the best way to build public support for abortion rights is to seek common ground with people who may be uncomfortable with the procedure, but want it to remain legal. She wrote in a New York Times op-ed shortly after her departure that while leading the group, “I reached out to people who wrestle with abortion’s moral complexities, but who will speak out against government interference in personal medical decisions.” “We need to stop treating those whose views differ from our own with scorn and suspicion, and instead work together to safeguard our health, our rights and our future,” she concluded. And after Tuesday’s debate, Wen made clear that she saw the “safe, legal, and rare” framing as a way to reach out to people with different views on the issue. “Pro-choice & progressive movements will lose unless we allow more people to join who do not agree 100% with the most extreme ideology,” she tweeted. (Wen declined, through a representative, to be interviewed for this story.) She isn’t the only abortion-rights supporter to use “safe, legal, and rare” in recent months. In an interview with NPR’s Sarah McCammon earlier this year, Pamela Maraldo, a former president of Planned Parenthood who resigned in 1995 under circumstances similar to Wen’s, said that she wanted Planned Parenthood to return to that framing. “I think that people that are pro-choice are afraid of stigmatizing abortion when they say it should be rare,” she said. But “that’s not where I’m coming from. I’m coming from a place that too many trips to the doctor’s, medical procedures, surgical procedures, could be and should be prevented.” In general, those who argue on behalf of prevention say that better access to contraception would naturally lead to abortion becoming rarer. Indeed, the abortion rate has hit an all-time low in recent years, and experts say better access to long-acting reversible contraceptives like IUDs is likely the reason why. But moves by the Trump administration, like increased restrictions on Title X family planning funding and a weakening of the mandate that employer-based insurance cover birth control, could threaten access to contraception, especially among low-income Americans. Even if access were perfect, “contraception is not foolproof,” Lopez said. “People will always need abortion care in this country, period.” The disagreement between Wen and other activists, and among Gabbard and other candidates, is a reminder that even among people who generally support abortion rights, there are a lot of differences in approach and priorities. That’s why advocates like Bracey Sherman, who started the hashtag #AskAboutAbortion in 2016, have been pushing for moderators to ask questions about abortion rights in Democratic debates. Tuesday was the first time in four presidential debates (two of them spread across two nights) that moderators asked anything about abortion, Lopez noted. “For so long we heard, ‘well, they’re all pro-choice, it doesn’t really matter,’” Bracey Sherman said. On Tuesday night, though, “it was clear: they actually don’t all have the same stance.”",https://www.vox.com/2019/10/18/20917406/abortion-safe-legal-and-rare-tulsi-gabbard,11808
"9 questions about abortion in America, answered",Rachel M. Cohen,2023-06-24T10:30:00+00:00,"It’s been one year since the Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that there was no constitutional right to an abortion in the US — a decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and 49 years of precedent. Since then, states have moved to restrict abortion rights. People seeking to end pregnancies across a wide geographic swath of America have wholly or nearly lost the right to do so. Doctors have said that the restrictions endanger their ability to care for patients. New battlegrounds have emerged over medication abortion, the most common form of abortion in the United States. And abortion, always a contentious political and social issue, has become a defining issue in national politics. The 2022 Dobbs decision and subsequent court cases have also generated enormous confusion across the country about abortion and the legal status of abortion access. That uncertainty isn’t surprising, since abortion laws vary widely and are still changing as bans and other restrictions work their way through state and federal courts. Here are some common questions people might have about abortion and the state of abortion access, and their actions. Medically speaking, this might seem like a basic question. Abortion occurs when a pregnancy ends before the birth of a baby. But the reality is a lot more complicated than that. While abortions, and the right to choose them, are closely associated with unwanted pregnancies, not all abortions happen for that reason. The same procedure is also part of how health care providers treat pregnancy complications, and it’s often done when a pregnancy threatens the life of a pregnant person, or when there is little chance that a pregnancy will end in a living baby.And it can be initiated by the body all by itself — in fact, the medical term for a miscarriage is “spontaneous abortion.” Abortion is also less separate from other medical procedures than you might think. Many of the medications, tools, and techniques used in the course of performing abortions are also used to treat other medical conditions. The drugs used to perform medication abortions also treat uterine fibroids and stomach bleeding, for example, and there’s a lot of overlap between in-clinic abortion procedures and the treatment of uterine bleeding and certain uterine cancers. —Keren Landman There are two types of abortion: medication abortion and in-clinic abortion (which is also called “surgical” abortion, although it doesn’t typically involve cutting tissue or getting stitches). Medication abortion, which is the most common, can be done at home any time within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. Typically, patients take two different medicines, mifepristone and misoprostol. As of 2022, more than half of all abortions in the US — about 54 percent — were medication abortions. These medications are currently only available by prescription (although some health care providers think they should be available over the counter). Abortion pills can also be shipped through the mail through a range of telehealth services. US telehealth providers are subject to some of the same restrictions that brick-and-mortar providers are: Online pharmacies won’t mail pills to addresses in states where the procedure is not legal. That means this form of access has not made abortions easier to get in states with abortion bans. But that may be changing soon: A New York state law passed this week would allow the state’s abortion providers to prescribe and mail the pills to people in states with abortion bans. (As of June 22, the law was awaiting signature by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.) And some providers ship to all 50 states anyway, such as the overseas provider Aid Access; Plan C and Mayday Health provide additional information on how people in the US access medication abortion online. In-clinic abortions usually involve a procedure that’s done in a medical facility. The procedures themselves typically take around 5 to 10 minutes. These methods can be used at any time until the beginning of the 24th week of pregnancy. They generally involve having a health care provider remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus through the cervix, which is the opening to the uterus that sits at the end of the vagina. This is usually done by inserting a thin tube into the cervix and sucking out the contents of the uterus through it (aspiration abortion), although sometimes, providers need to use medical tools to take out the pregnancy tissue (dilation and evacuation, D&E, sometimes called dilation and curettage, D&C). Most states prohibit abortion after 24 weeks, and few abortion providers offer abortions in this later stage of pregnancy. Crisis pregnancy centers are facilities that market themselves as offering reproductive health care but that actually try to dissuade people from getting abortions. These facilities often obscure the fact that they do not provide abortion care, but resources like the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map can help abortion seekers identify them. —KL Abortion — for which safety has been closely scrutinized for decades — is an extraordinarily low-risk procedure. It’s safer than giving birth or getting a colonoscopy. An extensive 2018 review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that complications of abortion are extremely rare. When they do happen, they take place in less than 1 percent of people who get abortions: In medication abortions, prolonged heavy bleeding happens in only one to three of every 1,000 people, and infection in one to five of every 10,000 people. Rarely — in about 2 percent of cases — people who get a medication abortion need to have an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion. In-clinic abortions are also very safe. Complications that lead to hospital admission, surgery, or blood transfusions happen in only one to two of every 1,000 aspiration procedures. Death due to abortion is extraordinarily rare. Fewer than one of every 100,000 people who get an abortion die of a complication of the procedure — lower than the number who die from giving birth, getting a colonoscopy, or having some plastic surgery procedures. The safety consequences of denying abortion, meanwhile, are dire. In the Turnaway Study, which followed 1,000 women from around the US over five years, those who gave birth after being denied abortions had higher rates of life-threatening pregnancy complications and more economic hardshipthan those who received abortions. They were likelier to stay in contact with a violent partner, and their children were more likely to grow up in poverty with developmental challenges. Notably, despite some claims from anti-abortion groups, the mental health of women who had abortions was no worse than that of women who didn’t. —KL Broadly, the legal landscape around abortion in America now breaks down into a few categories: states where abortion is prohibited (generally with exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person, and sometimes for rape or incest), states where access is limited (for example, by a 12-week ban), and states where abortion is legal with few restrictions. People living in states where abortion is banned can still travel to another state for the procedure; no bans currently criminalize crossing state lines for an abortion (though Idaho has made it a crime to help a minor leave the state for the procedure without a parent’s consent). In his concurring opinion in Dobbs, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh stated that he believed banning interstate travel for the purpose of abortion would be unconstitutional. Someone who is actively seeking abortion care can visit INeedAnA.com or AbortionFinder.org to learn about options in their area, said Elisabeth Smith, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. For people who want to understand the larger legal landscape, the center maintains an interactive map of state laws. The New York Times, KFF (formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation), and the Guttmacher Institute also maintain trackers that list current abortion laws in each state. Two states, South Carolina and Nevada, explicitly ban self-managed abortion, in which people take pills at home using medication ordered online. In other states, prosecutors have used laws against mishandling human remains and other crimes to prosecute people suspected of self-managing abortions. “The important thing for people to consider is who they are sharing information with, how they are sharing information,” Smith said. “Information about self-managed abortion that is shared with law enforcement is the way that those prosecutions have happened.” People with legal questions about self-managed abortion can contact the If/When/How legal helpline or the Abortion Defense Network. —Anna North Historically, abortion has been a very common procedure in America. According to a 2017 analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, nearly one in four women in the US (23.7 percent) will have an abortion by age 45. Pre-Dobbs research can give us some basic information about who is most likely to get an abortion. The majority of abortion patients are already parents — 60 percent have at least one child, according to 2019 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “One of the main reasons people report wanting to have an abortion is so they can be a better parent to the kids they already have,” Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California San Francisco, told the New York Times. Most are also in their first trimesterof pregnancy, with 43 percent of abortions taking place within the first six weeks, shortly after most people find out they’re pregnant,and 92 percent occurring in the first 13 weeks. However, abortion rights advocates say they are concerned that the increasing number of bans and other restrictions will force more patients to delay their procedures until later in pregnancy, when they can carry a higher risk of severe side effects. Most people who get abortions are in their 20s — 57 percent, according to the CDC, compared with just 9 percent who are in their teens and about 35 percent who are over 30. They are also disproportionately likely to be low-income and to be women of color, largely because of inequities in access to birth control. Low-income patients and people of color are also most likely to be affected by abortion bans. Black women, in particular, are likely to face multiple overlapping impacts, because they are disproportionately likely to have unintended pregnancies and to live in states with bans, and are less likely to be able to afford travel to states where the procedure is legal, as Vox’s Fabiola Cineas has reported. Black women are also three times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes; one 2021 study found that a nationwide abortion ban could increase Black maternal deaths by 33 percent. —AN Unpacking public opinion on abortion can be tricky, especially post-Roe, as Americans continue to learn more about the non-hypothetical consequences of losing access to abortion. Sometimes views Americans express in surveys appear to be contradictory, and there’s also a fundamental difference between support for abortion and support for abortion rights. Many people who identify as pro-choice, meaning they believe people should have the right to make the choice for themselves, say they personally are against the procedure. Polls conducted over the past few months indicate that voters seem to have grown even more supportive of abortion rights than they were before Dobbs. Experts say it will be important to continue tracking public opinion in the coming months and years to see how the loss of Roe informs public sentiment, and that so far we don’t have a clear picture. Broadly speaking, though, most Americans tell researchers that they support access to legal abortion, though they also support some restrictions on its availability. Americans are most supportive of abortion for women who have been raped or who face a serious health concern if they continue their pregnancy. Americans are also more supportive of abortion during the first trimester. But pollsters also find respondents are generally opposed to politicians passing abortion bans, andsay pregnant women should be able to make decisions about abortion in consultation with their doctor. —Rachel M. Cohen No one knows exactly how many fewer abortions occurred after the Dobbs decision because self-managed abortions are not tracked in the same way as abortions obtained through the formal US health care system. In other words, while a woman living in Arkansas might have ended her pregnancy in 2021 at a local abortion clinic, in 2023, with that option no longer available to her, she may have ordered or obtained pills internationally, from activist networks in Mexico, the European-based organization Aid Access, or some of the other online suppliers based in India. Researchers who track incidences of abortion generally do not have great access to that data, and even if someone orders pills online, it’s not clear if they actually took the medication. And some people order pills as an insurance policy, to store at home in case they, or a friend, need them for an unwanted pregnancy in the future, complicating counts further. There is data, however, that suggests abortions done in US clinics and hospitals, or with pills taken at home prescribed by a US doctor, declined since Dobbs. The Society of Family Planning, a group that supports abortion rights, launched a national reporting effort to try to evaluate changes in abortion access and estimated these kinds of abortions declined by more than 24,200 between July 2022 and March 2023, compared to a pre-Dobbs baseline. Some states’ data also shows an increase in out-of-state abortions in the last year, meaning more people are traveling across state lines to get their care. For example, there were 38 percent more non-Floridians who ended pregnancies in Florida in 2022 compared to 2021. There has also been some anecdotal reporting of women who wanted to end their pregnancies in states where it’s now banned but couldn’t afford the cost of traveling to a state where it’s legal, and so ended up giving birth instead. It will be important for researchers to try and gather more information about how many people fall into this category. —RC In the Dobbs Supreme Court hearing, Chief Justice John Roberts claimed a 15-week ban on abortion mirrors “the standard that the vast majority of other countries have.” In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito cited a study published by a leading anti-abortion group that argued the US was out of step with the rest of the world in terms of abortion after 20 weeks. The study, published by the think tank arm of the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said 47 out of 50 European nations limit “elective” abortion before 15 weeks, meaning before then doctors are not required to attest to a particular justification for the abortion. But differences between the US and European countries are more complex than that simple comparison suggests. In practice, abortion limits in the United States are far more restrictive than what exists in most of the Western world, including in nations with gestational age limits at 12 weeks, like Germany, Denmark, Belgium, and Italy. Moreover, European countries that have 12-week limits on “elective” abortions still make it fairly easy for women to get abortions later on, with relatively broad exceptions for mental health or socioeconomic circumstances. Republicans have aggressively fought similar exceptions, and in particular have worked to bar consideration of mental health risk — even the risk of suicide if a pregnancy continues — as a factor. And in other ways, European countries make it easier to get an abortion than in even relatively permissive jurisdictions in the United States.Across Europe, abortion services are coveredunder national health insurance, meaning the cost of accessing care is a far lower barrier for pregnant people facing time constraints. By contrast, in the US, cost is one of the biggest hurdles to ending a pregnancy. Even though more than 90 percent of abortions occur within the first 13 weeks, roughly 75 percent of all US abortion patients are low-income, according to 2014 numbers, and researchers find Americans needing abortion care in the second trimester tend to be those with less education, Black women, and women who have experienced “multiple disruptive events” in the past year, such as losing a job. Across the globe, the clear trend has been to expand access to abortion, decriminalize the procedure, and loosen restrictions. While restrictive policies, including earlier gestational limits, still present barriers for international abortion care, per the Center for Reproductive Rights, nearly 60 countries have liberalized their laws and policies on abortion since 1994. Only four — the US, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Poland — have further restricted rights. Even with earlier gestational limits, abortion in Europe is broadly affordable and accessible. This is not the paradigm Republicans are proposing in the United States. They are fighting to keep abortion expensive, particularly for low-income patients who rely on Medicaid; to limit the reasons, like mental health, for which patients can access legal abortion; and to restrict access to care, all while imposing bans on telemedicine, ramping up criminal penalties for providers, and shortening the legal timeline for pregnant people to raise funds, arrange travel, and book mandatory medical appointments. —RC Dobbs is not the end of the road on abortion in America — opponents of the procedure continue to work toward more and broader restrictions, while reproductive rights advocates are backing efforts to shore up access in states where it remains legal, as well as keeping options open for patients in states with bans. On the anti-abortion side, advocates are working to restrict the use of abortion medication. A federal lawsuit by the anti-abortion Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine seeks to rescind Food and Drug Administration approval of mifepristone, one of the two drugs most commonly used in abortions in the US. However, mifepristone remains available as the case works its way through the courts. Abortion opponents are also working on legislation targeting websites that offer abortion medication, out-of-state doctors who prescribe the pills, and private citizens who help people obtain them. Dobbs also opens up the possibility of a nationwide ban on abortion, and in September 2022, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a bill that would ban the procedure across the country after 15 weeks. However, Republican leaders in the House as well as Republican presidential candidates have declined to endorse a nationwide ban, likely a reflection of the fact that such legislation would be both difficult to pass and politically unpopular. Meanwhile, abortion rights advocates are working on ways to maintain or expand access. At least 15 states and the District of Columbia have passed “shield” laws that protect abortion providers and patients from investigation or prosecution by authorities in states with bans; an increasing number of states specifically shield doctors who prescribe abortion medication by telehealth to patients in states where the procedure is banned. Authorities in several states, including Washington, have also amassed stockpiles of mifepristone in case it becomes unavailable. Other states and localities are expanding funding or insurance coverage for abortion. At the federal level, Democrats in Congress have introduced legislation to codify the right to an abortion in law, though it has so far been unable to pass. Some reproductive rights advocates believe Dobbs could one day be reversed by the Supreme Court. “The text of the decision is really an outlier, and so some future court would really easily be able to overrule Dobbs and distinguish it from the history of liberty and privacy rights that the court has decided,” Smith said. However, that would most likely require a liberal majority on the Court — something that would require Democrats to win several presidential elections in a row and hold on to the Senate, as Vox’s Ian Millhiser has written. Some abortion rights advocates remain optimistic for the long term, even while expressing deep concern for the coming months and years. “There will be a new federal right, either through statute or a future court decision,” Smith said. “The question is really how much pain and suffering and loss will occur in the states that have banned abortion between now and then.” —AN",https://www.vox.com/23771559/abortion-medication-dobbs-roe-pill-law-cost,11808
"Obria, the anti-abortion group that’s tapping into “wellness” culture, explained",Anna North,2019-08-29T17:30:00+00:00,"Head to the clinic’s website and you’ll find a slideshow of images meant to make you feel welcome — a smiling woman in scrubs with a stethoscope around her neck, a diverse group of young people perhaps planning for their future, a college-aged patient in a flannel shirt looking anxious but hopeful. In a linked video, a young woman with a tear-stained face gazes at the camera as a warm female voice reassures her: “Sex, fertility, pregnancy, questions about your body? Those are the things we’re here to help you with.” “We’re here to listen to you,” the voice goes on. “To take every breath with you. Because your health matters to us.” The young woman takes a deep breath. She smiles in relief. This is the public face of Obria, a network of facilities in California and other states that purport to offer reproductive health care. Earlier this year, Obria received a $1.7 million federal grant through Title X, a program aimed at providing family planning services to underserved Americans. The program was designed, in part, to help people get affordable contraception like birth control pills and IUDs. But critics say Obria clinics don’t actually provide those things. Instead, the group encourages “natural family planning,” a method of birth control that relies on tracking the monthly menstrual cycle and is generally less effective than hormonal contraception. Obria is run by an anti-abortion activist and has long been positioning itself as an anti-abortion competitor to Planned Parenthood. But instead of taking an explicitly religious or ideological tone, its public-facing materials seem calculated to court not just abortion opponents, but a wider millennial audience interested in “wellness” and “natural” remedies. The group positions itself as “holistic and anti-hormones,” Alice Huling, counsel for the Campaign for Accountability, an anti-corruption watchdog group that has produced a report on Obria, told Vox. “That is obviously something that has general appeal well beyond folks who have the same narrow view of reproductive rights and birth control access.” Now, thanks to the Trump administration, Obria’s influence is poised to grow. In addition to awarding the group a grant, the administration earlier this year gave Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health care providers an ultimatum: stop performing and referring for abortions, or give up Title X funding. Planned Parenthood decided to exit the Title X program, and now Obria is closer than ever to its goal of supplanting the group in the hearts and minds of Americans — and in the federal budget. For Obria, that means “transforming health care with a compassionate and holistic mindset.” But for reproductive-health groups and other critics, it means that patients around the country are going to get advice that’s not backed up by science, and may have more unintended pregnancies as a result. The organization that became Obria started in the 1980s in California as a crisis pregnancy center, providing anti-abortion counseling to pregnant women. Such centers have been criticized for appealing to patients seeking abortion, then trying to convince them not to have the procedure, sometimes using misleading information to do so — one study found that 80 percent of crisis pregnancy center websites contained at least one item of misinformation. The center that would grow into Obria went by a variety of names, including Birthright of Mission Viejo, according to the Campaign for Accountability. Obria’s CEO, Kathleen Eaton Bravo, says she became an anti-abortion advocate after having an abortion. Afterwards, she told the website Aleteia in 2016, “I ended up telling God, ‘Just bring me one woman that I can share what I’ve been through and tell her she doesn’t have to do this — that she has options, then maybe I can start to forgive myself.’” In the 1980s and ’90s, Birthright of Mission Viejo operated under a variety of names. But around 2014, it took the name Obria, and began constructing the neutral public image it projects today. “The Obria medical clinics are now kind of whitewashed,” said Huling. Their websites look like those of any medical provider, with people in scrubs and an absence of overtly religious content. “They talk about homeopathic remedies, as opposed to really pushing a lot of the religious ideology and talk that you hear about at a lot of CPCs,” Huling said. After 2014, Obria began to expand, with the goal of not just opening its own clinics, but partnering with clinics in other states and rebranding them with the Obria name, Huling said. On its website, Obria says it currently has 45 clinics around the country, with locations in Oregon, Washington, Iowa, Texas, and Georgia as well as California. As it expanded, Obria also sought government funding. The group applied for Title X funding in 2018 but its application was denied — likely because, according to Huling, it does not provide birth control. But this year, it proposed sharing some of its grant money with non-Obria clinics that do provide birth control, and its application was successful — it now has nearly $2 million of federal funding to continue its work. It’s not clear exactly how many patients Obria currently serves, but in its 2019 Title X grant application, it asked for funding to see 36,000 California patients over three years, or 12,000 annually. Planned Parenthood, by contrast, until recently served more than a million Title X patients every year. Obria has more plans to expand, though: According to its website, the group aims to add 200 clinics around the country, and serve “more than 125,000 women,” by 2022. By law, Title X funding is supposed to help grantees provide low-income and other underserved patients with “a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services” — and even under President Trump, the Department of Health and Human Services has said that this range should include hormonal contraception. But Obria CEO Kathleen Eaton Bravo said in an email to supporters earlier this year that the group would “never provide hormonal contraception,” according to the Campaign for Accountability report. To the Campaign for Accountability’s knowledge, the group’s facilities also do not provide condoms, Huling said. Obria has not yet responded to Vox’s request for comment. What Obria does provide, at least according to its 2019 Title X grant application, is training in natural family planning, also known as the rhythm method or the fertility-awareness-based method of birth control. This method involves tracking the monthly menstrual cycle and avoiding sex — or using a backup method, like condoms — on the most fertile days. There are several ways of tracking the cycle, including following the calendar and taking one’s body temperature daily (it can rise around ovulation), and they are most effective when combined. According to Planned Parenthood, fertility awareness methods are about 76 to 88 percent effective. Condoms, meanwhile, are about 85 percent effective with typical use and 98 percent effective with perfect use; birth control pills are 99 percent effective with perfect use and 91 percent effective when used as most people use them (with the occasional missed pill, for instance). Fertility awareness methods can be hard to use because they require a lot from the user. “You have to literally take your temperature the same time every morning, first thing, and if you don’t, then you can’t believe it will be accurate,” Lauren Streicher, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, told Vox last year. What’s more, something like a cold can throw the temperature readings out of wack, and menstrual cycles can vary for a variety of reasons. Still, fertility awareness methods have been gaining popularity in recent years — about 3 percent of contraceptive users employed these methods in 2014, up from 1 percent in 2008. Natural Cycles, an app to help people track their cycles, received FDA approval last year. One possible reason for the increase in interest is a growing concern about side effects of hormonal birth control, which for some people can include depression and anxiety. As Eliza Brooke wrote at The Goods, these side effects are poorly understood, and patients aren’t always taken seriously when they report them. Meanwhile, there’s a growing interest in “natural” or “holistic” solutions to health issues, a movement Jezebel’s Molly Osberg calls “wellness creep.” A response, in part, to a medical establishment that really does often ignore women’s concerns, the rhetoric of wellness promotes natural products instead of medicine, regardless of whether there’s any science to back them up: “The promise of the wellness industry and the ideology it’s advanced is that every health problem is ultimately an issue of individual choice, and that a woman’s intuition is the most valuable medical currency,” Osberg writes. “Natural” alternatives to hormonal birth control fit right into this narrative. Carol-Ann Farkas, an English professor who studies health and pop culture, likens Obria’s endorsement of natural family planning to Gwyneth Paltrow’s embrace of alternative medicine (though she notes there’s no evidence to suggest Paltrow would support Obria’s politics). “There’s the same kind of messages,” Farkas said. “I can steam my vagina and I can use the rhythm method to prevent pregnancy and I’ll be all-natural, and I’ll have my kale smoothie and I will be a better person.” It’s not clear how many devotees of natural remedies or wellness Obria is drawing in. But Farkas says that Obria’s “very pleasant-looking website” may resonate with people who are confused or frustrated by their experiences with the medical establishment. “There’s so much information coming from so many different sources, and it has not been part of our education up to this point to be able to sift through all this information to make meaningful decisions,” Farkas said. “You tend to trust those warm, approachable, accessible voices more than the doctor who you have to wait a week and a half to see, and she’s got 10 minutes with you and uses language you don’t understand.” On its website, Obria claims to provide “services with a holistic view characterized by the treatment of the whole person.” But much of the group’s messaging isn’t backed up by science. Obria pitches many of its services as “for women who don’t want to use hormones,” Huling said. But Obria’s website also prominently advertises “abortion pill reversal,” an unproven technique in which patients are treated with progesterone after the first pill in a regimen of abortion medication. No controlled studies have shown that the method works, and Huling likens it to experimentation on patients. Progesterone, Huling points out, is a hormone. In its application for Title X funding, Obria said it planned to use an app called Femm to provide education in fertility awareness, according to the Guardian. Femm, a product of the nonprofit Femm Foundation, initially looks somewhat like Natural Cycles, or any of a number of period-tracker apps on the market. But a few days of use turn up some unusual features. For one thing, Femm seems to avoid mention of other methods of birth control, like condoms. When I signed up for the app and input some data, like the date of my last period, it told me, “The best way to learn about your cycle in order to avoid pregnancy is to focus on your body without having intercourse for one entire cycle. This will allow you to gain confidence in your own pattern, fertile time, and understanding of cervical mucus before adding in the complication of understanding seminal fluid.” The app did not mention that use of a condom would also remove the complication of seminal fluid. At one point, the app also provided me with the “tip” that “consistent lack of ovulation can put women at greater risk for ovarian cancer and bone mineral loss.” This felt like a veiled criticism of birth control pills, which suppress ovulation. Some research has found that irregular periods are linked to ovarian cancer. Use of birth control pills, however, actually lowers the risk of this type of cancer. Femm has not responded to Vox’s request for comment about some of its advice. The app’s developers say it has been downloaded more than 400,000 times, the Guardian reports. While Obria may draw users in with promises of holistic care, critics say its messaging is likely to be harmful to public health. “Whenever you reduce evidence-based, medically sound family planning services,” said Michelle Kuppersmith, director of the reproductive-rights research group Equity Forward, “you end up with more unintended pregnancies.” “Relying on an app like Femm,” she added, “is only going to lead to poor outcomes for people who do not want to get pregnant.” Many crisis pregnancy centers maintain public-facing websites without explicitly religious or ideological language. But what’s unique about Obria, Kuppersmith said, is its goal “of copying Planned Parenthood and being a nationally recognized chain that people will go to for health care.” Obria makes its desire to compete with Planned Parenthood explicit on its website: “Some of the main reasons for Planned Parenthood’s success is its national brand recognition and unified front,” the site states. “Effectively offering compassionate, reproductive health care to more Americans requires the same concept.” Obria may also be working harder than most to appeal to a broad audience, including younger and non-religious Americans. On its website, Obria touts its “modern approach to healthcare,” noting that “nearly three-fourths of millennial women prefer a virtual interaction with a doctor, as opposed to an in-person appointment.” In addition to its work with the Femm app, Obria has an app of its own that allows users to chat with a nurse by video or text. Whether or not Obria can appeal to large numbers of millennial and younger Americans with its digital strategy remains to be seen. As of this writing, its app had just seven ratings in Apple’s app store. One reviewer praised Obria’s “comprehensive information” and said “I’m glad they’re getting more exposure.” Another cautioned, “This is a Christian ‘Pregnancy Crisis Center’ app that will never help you if you are seeking an abortion and may even mislead you.’” But in one way, Obria’s plans are working. Around the same time that Obria received its Title X grant, the Trump administration finalized a new rule banning grantees in the program from providing or referring patients for abortions. In response, Planned Parenthood pulled out of the program earlier this month. That leaves Obria and groups like it in a prime position to take Planned Parenthood’s place providing federally subsidized family planning services to low-income Americans — except that those services won’t include birth control pills, IUDs, or possibly even condoms. “Now that Obria has Title X money,” Kuppersmith said, “people who traditionally would have gone to a Planned Parenthood for subsidized care might be forced, almost, to go to an Obria.” Over the years, Planned Parenthood has become perhaps the best-known and most-trusted name in reproductive health care — when patients around the country need an abortion, birth control, or other reproductive health services, they often think of Planned Parenthood first. But by seeking federal funding, courting a millennial audience, and, perhaps, by tapping into trendy “wellness” culture, Obria is hoping to change that, becoming a nationwide brand people look to for care. “Everyone has an important role to play in this battle,” Obria’s website says, inviting visitors to discover theirs.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/29/20828866/obria-medical-clinics-birth-control-planned-parenthood,11808
Why adoption isn’t a replacement for abortion rights,Anna North,2021-12-08T12:00:00+00:00,"Americans don’t need abortion because adoption exists. That, at least, was the implication of comments made by Justice Amy Coney Barrett last week, as the Supreme Court appeared to edge closer than ever to overturning the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade and stripping Americans of the right to an abortion before viability. During oral arguments December 1 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which concerns Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks, Barrett noted that all 50 states have safe haven laws, allowing a baby to be surrendered for adoption shortly after birth without criminal consequences for the parent. If abortion rights advocates are worried about the burdens of forced parenthood, she asked, “Why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?” The idea that adoption is a panacea for unplanned pregnancy and a substitute for abortion is far from new. Anti-abortion activists “have been making this argument for decades,” says Marcela Howell, president of the nonprofit partnership In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda. According to researchers and people who work with parents and adoptees, it’s always been wrong. The argument that adoption can effectively replace abortion assumes that people who choose the former are able to simply sidestep all the challenges associated with parenthood. But people who choose adoption still become parents — they just don’t raise their children. They often experience significant grief and loss, for which they struggle to get support in a culture that views adoption through rose-colored glasses. Barrett seemed to be “assuming that people who terminate their rights are moving quickly past this termination,” says Gretchen Sisson, a sociologist with Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a group at the University of California San Francisco. But “that is not something that I have ever seen in my research.” Thinking of adoption as a stand-in for abortion also ignores the very real dangers people face when they carry any pregnancy to term. Maternal mortality has been rising in the US for 20 years, and the most recent data places the country a dismal 55th in the world when it comes to the safety of childbirth. All of this, reproductive justice and adoptee advocates say, makes the argument that adoption can replace abortion at best a distraction, and at worst a willful misrepresentation of the facts. “As an adoptee, it’s infuriating,” says Joanne Bagshaw, a psychology professor at Montgomery College in Maryland who also works as a therapist with other adoptees. Promoting adoption has long been a mainstay of the anti-abortion movement, with conservative groups like Focus on the Family providing resources on adoption and anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy centers” sometimes steering pregnant people toward the practice. It’s not just conservatives, however, who support adoption as a good alternative to abortion — “adoption has been understood as this common ground in the abortion debate by both parties for a very long time,” Sisson said. Both Democrats and Republicans have embraced the view that even if they can’t agree on whether abortion should be legal, they can agree that more people should choose adoption instead. There are multiple problems with thinking of adoption as a substitute for abortion, however, researchers and advocates say. In order to choose adoption for a child, someone still has to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth. Both are risky propositions in America, which ranked 10th out of 10 comparable countries in a 2018 study of maternal deaths. Black people are at especially high risk, dying in childbirth at three to four times the rate of white patients. “For Black women, carrying pregnancies to term is very dangerous in this country,” Howell said. Beyond the medical risks, there are social consequences to consider, from fielding unwanted questions to potential abuse from family members or partners who find out about the pregnancy. Homicide is a leading cause of death for pregnant people, with Black women and women and girls under 25 at the highest risk, according to a study published last month by researchers at Tulane University. Though pregnancy discrimination is illegal, it also remains widespread — “many of the country’s largest and most prestigious companies still systematically sideline pregnant women,” Natalie Kitroeff and Jessica Silver-Greenberg wrote in a 2018 New York Times investigation. Then there’s “the emotional toll that goes on if someone is forced to carry a pregnancy to term that they didn’t want in the first place,” Howell said. “I felt as if I were carrying my son for them, for everyone else,” Merritt Tierce wrote in the New York Times Magazine of her unplanned pregnancy when she was 19 years old. “I was afraid, and I was estranged from myself, and I felt an unbearable load of guilt for being the mother my son had to have. He didn’t get to choose, either.” Barrett did seem to acknowledge some of the burdens of unwanted pregnancy last week, calling it “an infringement on bodily autonomy, for which we have another context like vaccines” (never mind that the side effects of vaccines, for most people, last a mere few hours). She did not acknowledge, however, that any sort of burden might continue after a person gives birth. Just give up the baby for adoption, her questions seemed to suggest, and everything will be fine. That’s far from the case, many experts and advocates say. Surrendering a baby for adoption can be traumatic, Sisson says. “A lot of birth mothers feel pretty intense grief and mourning right after their adoption.” As the years go by, that initial grief can be compounded by a sense of alienation. On the one hand, “there’s a lot of politicized and religious messaging around adoption that tells birth mothers that they have made a very courageous, brave, and loving decision,” Sisson says. But those messages don’t come with support for birth parents when it comes to negotiating and managing contact with their biological children (increasingly common as open adoptions become the norm), or in understanding and dealing with their ongoing sense of loss. Many birth parents “feel very alone,” Sisson said. Pregnant people often anticipate some of this, which is why adoption is a relatively rare choice in America. They may know, too, that their child may not find a home quickly — there are more than 400,000 children in foster care in the US, and the average child spends nearly two years in the system. In one study of people who wanted an abortion but were turned away, just 9 percent chose to place the baby for adoption, Sisson and her team found. The other 91 percent chose to parent the child. “There were a lot of women who said, ‘If I couldn’t have an abortion, I was going to parent; there was no way I was going to give up my child,’” Sisson said. In general, “Women are not often choosing between abortion and adoption,” Sisson said. “Adoption is always the second choice to either parenting or abortion.” In addition to grief and loss for birth parents, adoption has an impact on children as well. “Relinquishment is traumatic for adoptees, even for adoptees who had a good adoption experience,” Bagshaw said. Adoptee clients who come to her often deal with “lifelong issues of feeling abandoned,” as well as “a lifelong search for identity.” And the question of whether and when a child is adopted at all is influenced by systemic racism. Research shows that Black children take longer to be adopted than white children, and dark-skinned Black children take longer than children with lighter skin, Howell said. Choosing adoption, then, is no guarantee that a child will soon find a permanent home. There will likely always be a need for adoption, advocates say. They argue that what’s needed is not a blanket promotion of adoption over abortion but reforms to make adoption itself more just. That would include a requirement that adoptees be able to access their original birth certificate and information about family history for medical and other purposes. “All information about an adoptee’s identity should always be available,” Bagshaw says. “This is a human rights issue.” (Safe haven laws, which allow people to relinquish a baby anonymously, can make it harder for adoptees to access this information.) Beyond that, what’s needed is “transparency about how a person gets in a situation where they’re deciding adoption,” Bagshaw said. “Why are we not assisting that person to keep their baby if they can and want to?” These are complicated questions that will require a hard look at America’s social safety net and the politics and economics of adoption. But Dobbs v. Jackson isn’t about any of those things. It’s about abortion, and whether a state has the right to ban it prior to viability, usually dated at about 24 weeks. According to Vox’s Ian Millhiser, all signs currently suggest that next year, when the Court hands down a decision in Dobbs, it will rule that a state does have that right, at least in certain circumstances. Shortly thereafter, it’s likely that states across the South and Midwest, armed with the decision, will so heavily restrict abortion access that their residents will no longer be able to get a legal abortion unless they have the money and time to travel out of state, perhaps thousands of miles, to a place where abortion is still allowed. Many abortion opponents argue — and Barrett, with her questioning, has implied — that it won’t really matter because anyone who doesn’t want to have a child can simply give that child up. To many reproductive justice advocates and people who study adoption, that argument is a red herring. It ignores, they say, a simple truth: that carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term irrevocably alters the course of a person’s life. Banning abortion will take some of the power to determine that course away from pregnant people and give it to the state, and the availability of adoption does nothing to change that.",https://www.vox.com/2021/12/8/22822854/abortion-roe-wade-adoption-supreme-court-barrett,11808
Rape and incest abortion exceptions don’t really exist,Fabiola Cineas,2022-07-22T20:20:00+00:00,"The case of a 10-year-old Ohio rape survivor who traveled to Indiana to obtain an abortion drew national attention to Ohio’s near-total abortion ban, which does not allow abortions even in cases of rape or incest. Ohio isn’t unusual. Despite broad agreement among Americans that victims of rape should be allowed to obtain an abortion, nearly all of the states with abortion bansdo not make exceptions for rape or incest. Out of the 13 states with abortion bans in effect, only a few of them have these exceptions: Mississippi has an exception for rape but not for incest, while South Carolina’s and Georgia’s exceptions extend to both. (Oklahoma has passed multiple bans — some with exceptions, some without — and it’s still unclear which takes precedence.) Another nine states have passed bans that are on hold. Four of those states include exceptions, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health rights think tank. The modern rape and incest exception dates back to 1959 when a legal research group, the American Law Institute, wrote model abortion legislation for states. Republicans adopted the language as a compromise as they reformed their abortion legislation, while most anti-abortion groups opposed the rape and incest exceptions outright. They have argued that the manner in which a child is conceived does not matter and have been suspicious of women who claim to be victims of sexual assault. “The anti-abortion movement wanted to preserve the status quo, which was at the time that abortion was a crime throughout pregnancy unless a pregnant person’s life was at risk,” said Mary Ziegler, an expert on US abortion history and a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law. Over time, some anti-abortion groups came to tolerate the politicians who opposed abortion and paid lip service to exemptions out of political necessity. And it was politically useful: Every Republican presidential candidate since Roewas decided in 1973, including Donald Trump, has said they support the exception. There’s overwhelming public support for allowing victims of rape to obtainabortions. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 69 percent of Americans, including 56 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats, said that abortion should be permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape. But anti-abortion activists, who have been influential in state abortion debates, have pushed for legislation that defies public opinion. Students for Life of America urged Republicans in 2019 to rethink the exception: “A child conceived in rape is still a child. We don’t blame children for other matters outside their control. Why should we do so here?” The Republican Senate candidate in Ohio, J.D. Vance, said last fall that “two wrongs don’t make a right,” to explain his opposition to abortion in cases of rape or incest. In 2019, former Iowa Rep. Steve King defended abortion bans without exceptions by arguing that without pregnancies from rape or incest, there wouldn’t be “any population of the world left.” The exceptions have been more useful as a political fig leaf, one that makes draconian bans seem less punitive, than as a way of meaningfully guaranteeing access to abortion for anyone. The vast majority of people who seek abortions in states with restrictions won’t be eligible under these exceptions. Abortion rights advocates are leery of the exceptions’ implication that there are“good” and “bad” reasons for receiving an abortion. And as carveouts meant to protect “the life of the mother” have shown, the existence of an exemption doesn’t make it easy or uncomplicated to get an abortion, even for those who theoretically qualify. It’s unclear how many people seeking abortions need them due to rape and incest. Many states don’t require clinics to collect or submit this information, and survivors are typically reluctant to report that they’ve been abused. A 2005 analysis of two surveys involving about 1,200 women from the Guttmacher Institute found that 1 percent of women who had obtained abortions said they were victims of rape, and less than half a percent reported that their pregnancy was a result of incest. “The ambiguity of these laws is a real barrier to access,” said Elizabeth Nash, a reproductive rights policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute. “Exceptions are narrowly tailored and difficult to interpret, which is scary for providers and patients. Abortion opponents see exceptions as loopholes — limiting access to abortion is the point.” One example: When asked whether the 10-year-old Ohio rape survivor should have been given an abortion in her home state, Jim Bopp, general counsel for the National Right to Life, the country’s largest anti-abortion organization, said, “She would have had the baby, and as many women who have had babies as a result of rape, we would hope that she would understand the reason and ultimately the benefit of having the child.” Most of the rape and incest exception clauses in abortion bans say that an abortion seeker must report the sexual assault to the police and then give the policereport to their abortion provider, a process advocates say creates added stressors and hurdles for pregnant people. In Mississippi, where a ban is in effect, the law states that, “No abortion shall be performed or induced [...] except in the case where [...] the pregnancy was caused by rape. For the purposes of this act, rape shall be an exception to the prohibition for an abortion only if a formal charge of rape has been filed with an appropriate law enforcement official.” The law does not specify who an “appropriate” law enforcement official is. In Utah, where a judge is keeping the state’s abortion ban on hold due to a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood, the trigger law would ban almost all abortions but allow them in the case of rape or incest. Under this ordinance, the responsibility to verify that there was a rape falls on the health care provider. The law states that the “physician who performs the abortion verifies that the incident [...] has been reported to law enforcement.” The physician would also have the responsibility to report any known child abuse. Physicians must comply “with requirements related to reporting suspicions of or known child abuse,” the law says. In Idaho, where the state’s Supreme Court put its trigger law on hold, the ban would make the narrow exception for rape and incest only if police documentation is given to the provider. But that law, unlike the others, says that in the case of a minor or someone subject to guardianship, a parent or guardian has to be involved in reporting the incident to law enforcement or child protective services, and then have that documentation provided to the physician. Idaho’s trigger ban has also gotten significant attention because it would deputize private citizens to file lawsuits against abortion providers — even family members of a rapist if the abortion resulted from sexual assault. In South Carolina, one of two states with an abortion ban in effect that makes an exception for both rape and incest, the exception only applies within a certain time frame. The law states that “a physician may perform, induce, or attempt to perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant woman after a fetal heartbeat has been detected [...] if the pregnancy is the result of rape, and the probable post fertilization age of the fetus is fewer than twenty weeks; [and] the pregnancy is the result of incest, and the probable post fertilization age of the fetus is fewer than twenty weeks.” Georgia’s abortion ban, which took effect on July 20 following legal challenges, sets a similar requirement. A person cannot pass the maximum 20-week “gestational age of the unborn child” and be covered under the rape and incest exception. Laws in states like South Carolina and Wyoming do not specify how doctors are to determine a patient’s claim of rape or incest. Abortion advocates see all kinds of issues with these requirements. They create additional roadblocks for abortion seekers who are already facing challenges in a country where anti-abortion advocates want to ban the procedure outright,and who have undergone a traumatic experience already. The majority of sexual assaults — two out of three — are not reported to the police, and rape victims are often assaulted by someone they know, which further complicates their decision to file a report since they fear retaliation or believe the police won’t help, among other reasons. And when people do report having been sexually assaulted, they are often not believed by law enforcement: The story of the 10-year-old Ohio rape survivor wasn’t believed, with Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost claiming that “there was not a damn scintilla of evidence” to support the story. Onlookers only believed the story when news broke that the 27-year-old perpetrator came forward and confessed to raping the child at least twice. In the states where official reports are required, some advocates have argued that police reports are difficult to acquire while an incident is still under investigation. This creates complications since abortions are safer when performed during a certain window of time. Additional requirements could mean delays. “The reality is that we don’t know what the numbers would look like if the only way you could get an abortion in that type of case is through the trauma of having to establish that publicly,” Ziegler said. “So I don’t think these exceptions are symbolic because they’re going to affect a lot of people. But the symbolism is important, too, in the sense that it’s a sign that Republicans don’t care about public opinion. That’s disturbing because the Supreme Court told us that the reversal of Roe would mean that voters would get to have their say.” The exceptions also present challenges for abortion providers, who must now interpret the law to determine whether they can provide services. Authorities in Indiana initially falsely claimed that the abortion provider who helped the 10-year-old Ohio rape victim did not report the abortion to authorities. The provider is now suing the state for maligning her name. And in states where the exceptions exist, that’s no guarantee that patients will be able to access abortion.Some abortion clinics in states with bans cannot afford to keep their doors open to serve patients who are pregnant due to rape or incest. “In order to be able to keep our doors open — and I’m not saying there’s not a lot of people assaulted — for the people who are assaulted, get pregnant, want to disclose it and want to have an abortion, it would be impossible for us to maintain a staff, maintain a facility and all of that,” Tammi Kromenaker, director of the Red River Women’s Clinic in North Dakota, told Politico. As health care providers in Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Wyoming told the publication, it’s easier for patients to travel across state lines to seek an abortion than to try to navigate vague rape and incest exceptions. “We know that well over half of people in the United States support abortion rights, so there is clearly a mismatch with what legislators are doing,” Nash said. “Abortion bans are unworkable, as are these exceptions.” If you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault or abuse, there are people who want to help.

Here’s where all the 2020 Democratic candidates stand on abortion rights,Li Zhou,2019-06-22T20:54:59+00:00,"With near-total bans on abortion passing in state after state — and others responding by loosening restrictions on the procedure — the right to terminate a pregnancy is emerging as a major election issue in 2020. When CNN pollsters asked Iowa Democratic voters earlier this month what issues were must-haves in a presidential candidate, support for abortion rights came out on top, with 79 percent of in-person caucus-goers listing it as crucial. And on Saturday, voters got to hear 20 of the 24 Democratic presidential candidates speak on abortion and broader issues of reproductive justice, including sex education and contraceptive access, at a forum convened by Planned Parenthood. Earlier this year, many candidates condemned the restrictive anti-abortion laws passing in Alabama and elsewhere, but fewer put forth specific policies for defending reproductive rights. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker stood out from the field by issuing detailed plans for safeguarding abortion access. Since then, more candidates have made policy statements, like expressing support for the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would enshrine in federal statute the right to an abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. But Vox wanted to take a holistic look at the abortion rights policies of all 24 candidates in the race. So we asked all of them what their positions were on abortion rights and access, and what policies they’d support to make this a reality. While not every candidate responded to Vox’s direct inquiry, all 24 have discussed their position on abortion rights in some capacity in the past. For the candidates who did not respond to our request, we examined statements they’ve made in interviews, town halls, and reports in other publications including BuzzFeed, ThinkProgress and HuffPost. Some of the candidates offered Vox more details than others about how they’d protect reproductive rights. Booker, for example, said he would create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom, while Harris said she’d require states that have passed laws that violate Roe in recent years to obtain DOJ approval for any abortion-related laws they’d like to implement down the line. But what stands out at this point in the Democratic primary campaign — and was highlighted at the Planned Parenthood forum on Saturday — is the extent to which the candidates have converged around a series of policies on abortion that would have seemed remarkably progressive just five years ago, especially when it comes to the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. As the Republican Party has backed increasingly restrictive laws, the Democratic Party has responded by moving toward increasing and multilayered support for abortion rights. “What’s going on in this country right now is not just an attack on women,” Warren said at the Planned Parenthood forum on Saturday. “It’s an attack on women who have fewer resources. It’s a class attack on women. It’s a race attack.” Her words encapsulated what has, at this point, become a shared position among virtually the entire Democratic field: that abortion should be not just legal but affordable and accessible for all Americans. In our survey, a few commonalities quickly emerged. Many of the candidates we heard from support the following policies: Given how similar the candidates’ response are overall, we spoke with NARAL, an advocacy group that’s fought for stronger protections for abortion rights, about how to best differentiate them. The key thing to look out for, according to NARAL vice president of communications Adrienne Kimmell, is more specifics. Since repealing Hyde and codifying Roe have become baseline positions, candidates who are able to offer more details in their proposals suggest that they’ve engaged with the issue further. “Voters should look for candidates who step up with concrete plans to protect access to care and guarantee reproductive freedom for every American,” she says. “We’re heartened to see that candidates like Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand are already leading the way by announcing specific plans laying out how they would defend reproductive freedom.” Some of the Democratic candidates support abortion rights policies beyond the commonly shared positions on Hyde and Roe as well. It’s also important to note that while we chose to focus on abortion for the purpose of this survey, many advocates see that right as part of a larger spectrum of issues, including maternal health (the subject of another survey to be published soon) and equal access to health care for people of all races and genders. “I believe in Roe v. Wade,” the senator said at a Fox News town hall in May. “Of course, there are limits there in the third trimester that are very important,” she added. “But I think overall, what we want to do is make sure women have the right to make their own decisions.” In an interview with Fox News later that month, she said, “If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade I would make sure that we are codifying Roe v. Wade into law.” She has also co-sponsored legislation to repeal the Hyde Amendment. At the Planned Parenthood forum, she added that if elected, she would repeal the domestic and global gag rules. She also mentioned the importance of “making sure that we have judges that follow the law of the land” when it comes to Roe v. Wade. The entrepreneur supports codifying Roe, repealing Hyde, and providing “safe and affordable abortion services” to all Americans. “I have the feeling that if men became pregnant instead of women, there would be absolutely no restriction on reproductive rights,” he said in a statement on his campaign website. At the Planned Parenthood forum, Yang also said that his plan to give all Americans a universal basic income of $1,000 a month would help low-income people afford abortion care. “Bernie believes that abortion is a constitutional right for all women,” said Sarah Ford, deputy communications director for the Sanders campaign. The senator supports a Roe litmus test for judges, and his Medicare-for-all plan would make abortion free to all patients, effectively making the Hyde Amendment moot. “Abortion rights are part of what Medicare-for-all is,” he said at the Planned Parenthood forum. Sanders is also a co-sponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe in federal statute. The former Congress member from Texas has released a reproductive rights plan that includes repealing Hyde and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion, codifying Roe in statute, and “appointing judges who respect Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land.” He also promises, if elected, to reverse the Trump administration’s domestic gag rule. And he says he would direct the Food and Drug Administration to remove “labeling regulations that impose barriers to the use of medication-based abortions.” “Beto would mobilize the full force of the federal government to protect women’s reproductive rights and access to abortion,” a spokesperson for the campaign told Vox. “Throughout Beto’s career, he has fought to protect women’s access to health care and their right to make their own decisions about their bodies, dating back to his first run for Congress where he took on a Democratic primary opponent who opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood.” The mayor has supported repealing Hyde. He’s previously called out former Vice President Joe Biden for his prior position backing Hyde. “If you don’t support repeal, you shouldn’t be the Democratic nominee,” de Blasio tweeted. New York City has also been at the forefront of expanding abortion rights during de Blasio’s tenure. Most recently, it became the first city in the country to directly fund abortions. The senator released a reproductive rights plan on May 22, amid the passage of state-level abortion bans around the country. In it, he pledges to work to repeal Hyde and codify Roe in statute, as well as to nominate judges who are supportive of Roe. In addition, he promises to take a number of executive actions to protect reproductive rights, including ending the domestic and global gag rules, reversing the Trump administration’s guidelines prioritizing abstinence-based programs for federal teen pregnancy prevention funding, and undoing the administration’s rules allowing health care providers to refuse to perform abortions on the basis of their “conscience” or religion. If elected, the senator says he would also create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom, “charged with coordinating and affirmatively advancing abortion rights and access to reproductive health care across my administration  —  addressing all barriers to full reproductive autonomy, such as access to health care, including maternal and infant health, quality, affordable child care, and comprehensive paid family leave.” At the Planned Parenthood forum, Booker called on men to stand up for reproductive rights. “This is not a woman’s issue,” he said. “Don’t tell me just because you have a wife or a mother or a daughter, that that’s how you relate to this. You have a body.” Warren was among the first candidates to put forth a detailed reproductive rights plan. The plan, released May 17, calls for codifying Roe in statute, repealing Hyde and the domestic gag rule, and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion. “We must build a future that protects the right of all women to have children, the right of all women to not have children, and the right to bring children up in a safe and healthy environment,” Warren wrote in announcing her plan. Swalwell is an original co-sponsor of the EACH Woman Act, which would repeal Hyde. He is also a co-sponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act and of legislation to repeal the global gag rule. As president, he would support codifying Roe in statute, according to his campaign. “We will defend Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to choose at all costs,” Swalwell said in a statement to Vox. “As president, I’ll work with Congress to protect women’s control of their own bodies without government interference and ensure women in every state retain access to abortion care. But I also want to encourage America’s young men to stand up and link arms with women in this fight — we need to be vocal, active allies in defending freedom.” “I will be a president who negotiates up on this issue rather than down,” he promised at the Planned Parenthood forum. Inslee supports repealing Hyde and codifying Roe in statute, his campaign said. As governor, he signed Washington state’s Reproductive Parity Act, which guarantees public and private insurance coverage for abortion, and he would support similar legislation as president. He would also repeal both domestic and global gag rules; the attorney general of Washington state was one of several to sue the Trump administration to block the domestic rule. After stating in early June that he supports Hyde, Biden changed course and says he now believes the amendment should be repealed. At the Planned Parenthood forum, he said that he had changed positions on Hyde because his health care plan would need to include coverage of abortion. “I laid out a health care plan that’s going to provide federally funded health care for all women and women who now are denied even Medicare in their home states,” he said. “It became really clear to me that although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here, to make sure women still had access, you can’t have access if everyone’s covered by a federal policy. That’s why at the same time I announced that policy, I announced that I could no longer continue to abide by the Hyde Amendment.” The former vice president also supports codifying Roe in statute and repealing the global gag rule, according to his campaign. A practicing Catholic, Biden has said he is personally opposed to abortion. But, he said at a vice presidential debate in 2012, “I just refuse to impose that on others.” Delaney supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, according to his campaign. His universal health care plan, BetterCare, would cover reproductive health care, including abortions. The former Colorado governor supports repealing Hyde and increasing and protecting Title X family planning funding. “Governor Hickenlooper always has been a strong advocate of a woman’s right to choose,” a spokesperson for his campaign said. “He believes that all decisions should be made between a woman, her faith, and her doctor.” The former housing and urban development secretary has committed to nominating judges and Cabinet members who are “pro-choice.” Additionally, he backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe v. Wade. “All women should have access to reproductive care, regardless of their income or the state they live in,” he previously tweeted. Harris is among the Democrats who’s offered a more detailed plan on abortion rights that seeks to curb state laws attempting to infringe on them. Under Harris’s proposal, which is modeled after the Voting Rights Act, states whose abortion-related laws have recently been struck down by courts for violating Roe would have to obtain federal approval from the Justice Department before they’re able to implement any new abortion laws. “As president, I will stop dangerous state laws restricting reproductive rights before they go into effect,” Harris said in a statement. She also backs undoing Hyde, making Roe v. Wade law, and appointing judges that support abortion rights. At the Planned Parenthood forum, Harris pledged “to do the work on the defense, and to fight, but also work on the offense” when it comes to abortion rights. Gillibrand has made gender equity and reproductive rights a central piece of her campaign and is considered a leader on the issue. She was the first 2020 Democrat to commit to appointing judges that support Roe, and in the wake of state laws restricting abortion access laid out a wide-ranging plan to protect abortion rights. In addition to repealing Hyde and codifying Roe, Gillibrand supports undoing the gag rule the Trump administration has imposed. She would also establish a new funding stream in order to ensure that every state has a reproductive health center. “We must come together to declare, loud and clear, that reproductive rights are human rights. They are civil rights. And they are nonnegotiable,” she wrote in a Medium post. The author and spiritual adviser, who has described herself as “one hundred percent pro-choice,” backs codifying Roeand repealing the Hyde Amendment. “I believe the decision of whether or not to have an abortion lies solely with the pregnant woman, according to the dictates of her conscience and in communion with the God of her understanding,” she notes on her campaign website. “I do not feel the government has an appropriate right to deny or restrict that decision.” Bennet supports “enshrining Roe v. Wade into federal statute, preempting states that try to interfere with women’s health rights, repealing the Hyde Amendment, and standing up against other efforts to undermine access to necessary care,” according to a campaign spokesperson. “Women’s reproductive rights are under assault all over the United States. Women’s health care is under assault all over the United States,” he said during a CNN town hall earlier this year. Bennet has also said he would only appoint judges that back Roe. Former Alaska Sen. Gravel, a candidate who’s notably in the race in order to prompt debate, has an expansive and unique abortion rights agenda. Gravel’s landmark provision would tie an individual’s ability to become a specialized physician with a commitment to providing abortions. “Our signature point on abortion access is mandating the ability and willingness to provide an abortion as a condition of obstetrician licensing,” according to a campaign spokesperson. “In addition, we support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to an abortion, as well as lawmaking through the People’s legislature, a fourth branch of government that Mike Gravel supports setting up that would allow direct lawmaking by the American people.” Gravel also backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe into law. Buttigieg supports repealing Hyde, codifying Roe into law, and appointing judicial nominees who would support Roe. “The mayor is pro-choice and trusts women to make their own health care decisions. He also recognizes the harm in having men legislate women’s bodies,” said a campaign spokesperson. Buttigieg has previously called for more men to speak out about abortion. “I think it’s particularly important from a political stance for men to stand up,” he said during a campaign event earlier this year, according to HuffPost. Moulton backs the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and enshrining Roe in federal law. He’s said undoing Hyde ensures that all women have the funding they need for health care and compared it to the funding the military needs. “It’s sort of like saying, you know, I support the troops but don’t want to pay them,” Moulton said of Hyde in a CNN interview. “That’s the analogy here, and I think it’s wrong.” Moulton has also said he will exclusively appoint judges that support Roe and added that he backs Harris’s proposal to require DOJ review of certain state laws. Bullock supports ending Hyde, codifying Roe, and strengthening Title X funding, which provides money for family planning and preventive health care clinics (though the domestic gag rule currently restricts it to institutions that do not provide abortions). “As governor, Bullock has stopped every single effort to restrict reproductive health care, and made Title X funding permanent so it would no longer be a political football,” a campaign spokesperson said. “It’s not what I think, it’s what does an individual woman need to do with her body and with her health care,” Bullock recently told CNN. Ryan supports codifying Roe and repealing Hyde. He had previously expressed opposition to abortion rights but explained in a 2015 editorial why he’s changed his position. “I came in as a Catholic school kid from northeast Ohio who didn’t think a whole lot about the issue and went into Congress pro-life,” Ryan told BuzzFeed. “My opinion changed that there should not be anyone from the federal government between a woman and her doctor.” Gabbard is supportive of abortion rights, according to a campaign spokesperson, and would back using federal money to provide abortions. Gabbard has previously been anti-abortion but has since changed her position. Messam supports codifying Roe and using federal money to provide abortion services. He emphasized, in an interview with WBUR, that he sees Roe as “settled law.” “I think when a woman is faced with a tough decision to abort a pregnancy, it’s tough enough by itself to have to make such a personal decision — a tough decision to make — and currently right now in our country this issue has been demagogued, and I think that primarily us men are making the decisions in the laws,” he said.",https://www.vox.com/2019/6/22/18693279/abortion-rights-2020-democrats-hyde-amendment-roe,11808
The new Obamacare repeal bill is the worst yet for women’s health,Anna North,2017-09-20T13:43:46+00:00,"Republicans’ latest effort to repeal Obamacare may look a little different from previous attempts — sponsors argue, for instance, that the plan lets states keep Obamacare if they want to. But when it comes to reproductive health care, the bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is a lot like previous repeal bills, except in areas where it’s much harsher. Like previous bills, Graham-Cassidy imposes new restrictions that would make it harder for people to get insurance coverage for abortion, and for low-income patients to visit Planned Parenthood. Also like the other bills, it threatens Medicaid coverage and makes it easier for states to get rid of maternity care requirements. A new element in this bill is that its program of block grants would create new ways for the federal government to restrict abortion coverage. Republican-led state legislatures have been working to curtail abortion access and pull funds away from Planned Parenthood for years now; Graham-Cassidy would accomplish both goals on a national scale. The bill includes a provision, similar to those in previous repeal bills, that would effectively bar the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for care at Planned Parenthood clinics. This would mean low-income patients who rely on Medicaid wouldn’t be able to get care at Planned Parenthood.Backers of such provisions have often claimed that community health centers would be able to fill in the gaps left by Planned Parenthood, but many reproductive health experts say this is unrealistic, since those centers would have to double or even triple the number of patients they saw for certain services. In order to replace Planned Parenthood’s contraceptive services, one of the many services they offer, health centers would have to see 2 million extra patients nationwide, according to the Guttmacher Institute. What’s more, Planned Parenthood is a trusted and familiar provider for many patients, who may not necessarily know anything about their local community health center. As Dan Ramos, a state representative from Ohio, told the New York Times last year, “If someone doesn’t know where to turn, they know that Planned Parenthood provides a service that they might need.” Like its forebears, Graham-Cassidy also includes restrictions on abortion coverage. Patients who got a tax credit to buy insurance on the individual market wouldn’t be able to use it to purchase insurance with abortion coverage, and small businesses that received a tax credit for providing insurance to their employees wouldn’t be able to offer plans covering abortion. Over time, this would mean fewer people would be able to buy individual plans that covered abortion, and so fewer insurers would offer them. Patients who can’t get insurance coverage for abortion are sometimes forced to forgo food or other necessities to pay for the procedure and may try to self-induce an abortion, which can be dangerous. Graham-Cassidy would let states cut requirements that insurers cover essential health benefits, meaning insurance companies could stop offering maternal care or prescription drug benefits. Thirteen million women could lose access to maternal care. Finally, the bill would end the Medicaid expansion, potentially depriving millions of low-income Americans of coverage. (The Congressional Budget Office announced on Monday that it would release a “preliminary” analysis of the bill early next week, but that won’t include an estimate of how many would lose coverage.) One in five women of reproductive age get their health insurance through Medicaid, and cuts to the program would put essential reproductive health services out of reach of many low-income Americans, especially black and Latino patients. More than half of all births and three-quarters of publicly funded family planning services are currently covered by Medicaid. The new concerns for reproductive rights in Graham-Cassidy largely stem from its block grant program. As Vox’s Sarah Kliff explains, the bill would repeal Obamacare’s individual tax credits and the Medicaid expansion in 2020, and replace them with grants to the states. Those grants could then be spent in a variety of ways — on high-risk pools, for instance, or on programs “to help individuals purchase health benefits coverage.” But, crucially, none of the money from the grants could be spent on insurance coverage for abortion. Many states already have restrictions on insurance coverage for abortion. But Graham-Cassidy would require all states to ban abortion coverage in any program that gets federal block grant money. If it took money to offer subsidies for individual coverage or otherwise bolster the individual market, then it would have to restrict abortion coverage on that market. If it used federal funds to offer subsidies to employers, the ban on abortion coverage would affect the employer market too. Essentially, the federal government would have the states over a barrel — if they wanted money to help keep their residents covered, they’d have to sacrifice abortion coverage to get it. Because there’s no telling yet exactly what states would do with the block grants, or how the law would be interpreted, it’s not clear what the impact of the abortion restrictions would be. But the block grant program would certainly offer the federal government a new and powerful tool to restrict abortion coverage, including in states that have few restrictions in place now. It’s also worth noting that spending for the bill would expire in 2026, meaning that unless Congress acted to replace the block grant money somehow, anybody who relied on that money for any reproductive health care — or, indeed, any health care at all — would be out of luck. Moderates in the Senate have expressed reservations over past repeal bills that would have left millions of low-income Americans uninsured. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have opposed stripping funding from Planned Parenthood — and have voted against every repeal bill so far. As Vox’s Dylan Scott reports, the bill still needs a CBO score and the approval of the Senate parliamentarian before it can come to a vote, and in order to pass it, the bill’s sponsors can only afford to lose two Republican votes. Graham-Cassidy would leave millions without coverage and severely curtail reproductive health coverage nationwide. It remains to be seen if that’s enough to kill it. Correction: This article originally stated that the Graham-Cassidy bill would require states that got federal block grant money for their Medicaid programs to stop using state Medicaid funds to cover abortion. The bill would not do this.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/19/16328928/obamacare-repeal-cassidy-graham-health-care-women,11808
Why Hollywood keeps getting abortion wrong,Alissa Wilkinson,2022-08-09T17:00:00+00:00,"We’re a screen-soaked culture, and that means that what we see on TV and in movies often serves as a framework to look at the world around us. That’s certainly true for abortion. It’s still rare to see an abortion depicted, and even more rare to see it in a situation that matches the circumstances of most abortions in America; research has found that the most common abortion patient is a low-income, unmarried young mother, without a college degree, who is seeking her first abortion. The majority of abortion patients in America are non-white. Yet that’s not the average depiction. And this affects not just what people think about abortion, but how viewers treat people who seek abortions, as well as how they think about public policy. Steph Herold is an analyst with the Abortion Onscreen initiative at UC San Francisco’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health research group. She’s been speaking with people from across the job spectrum in Hollywood — writers, showrunners, directors, and many more — about their experiences depicting abortion onscreen. Herold spoke by phone about her findings, the truth about Hollywood’s leanings on abortion, and why it matters that its depiction more closely matches reality. Our conversation has been edited for clarity. You’ve talked to a lot of people who work in the industry — tell me about your findings. My colleagues and I study how abortion is portrayed on TV and film. We do a lot of thinking about popular culture and abortion, and what these portrayals tell us about how Americans understand abortion, what messages we receive, where we receive them from, what impact these portrayals have on our beliefs, on our attitudes, on the way that we think about abortion. There’s this general sense that there aren’t depictions of abortion on television and film, but really that’s not true. Hollywood has always found ways to depict abortion — ways that reflect the politics of the time, going back to the early 20th-century silent films to today’s TV streaming dramas, and movies, and comedies. What’s been problematic is not the absence, but about how abortion has been portrayed. That’s where a lot of our research comes in. Abortion is one of the safest outpatient procedures in the US. Less than a quarter of 1 percent of abortions result in any kind of major complication. If you compare that to a similar outpatient procedure, like a tonsillectomy, that has a 9 percent complication rate. Abortion’s extremely safe. On TV, about 18 percent of abortions result in some major complication, or result in the person being infertile, or even dying sometimes. It’s more than 70 times the actual complication rate. That really suggests that abortion is dangerous or risky, in ways that it isn’t in reality. A lot of people hear that and say, “Well, we don’t expect TV to be an exact representation of reality.” Which of course is true. But because abortion is so stigmatized, and such a polarizing issue in our society, people don’t have that common reference point, where they see something on TV and can recognize it’s an exaggerated depiction. If someone gets in a car accident on TV, you don’t think, “Wow, everyone gets in car accidents.” People have the experience of driving and know how it could be safe. But they don’t have the same thing with abortion, a common reference point. You’d have to imagine one reason for this is that an ordinary outpatient procedure with no complications doesn’t inherently make for great television. Are there any other reasons, like ideological ones? We really wanted to understand why all these different kinds of problematic tropes kept emerging. We found that most of the TV characters who get abortions are white, young, wealthy, and not parenting. Compare that to actual abortion patients, who tend to be women of color, parenting, and struggling to make ends meet. We wanted to investigate why showrunners, producers, and writers keep telling this story about a certain patient. [The typical onscreen patient] also often has a surgical abortion, not a medication abortion, when now we know that the majority of abortions in the US are medication abortions. We did 46 in-depth interviews with showrunners, producers, writers, executive producers, and story editors who’ve all been involved in writing or producing plots about abortion over the last 20 years or so. We asked, “What motivated you to include abortion in your story?” We were trying to get behind some of it — is this for drama, or is there some political reason? What barriers did you face in getting abortion from the page to the screen? What did you hope the audience would take away? Their answers were really fascinating. Part of what we found is that, at least among the people that we talked to, there was this real desire to counter the stigmatizing narratives that we’ve found in our research. A lot of the writers we talked to have the sense that abortion is often portrayed as a tragedy, as a decision that’s made out of desperation. They have this sense that they wanted to write something new, where abortion is just a certain routine medical procedure. Some people really wanted to represent more characters of color. One person even pointed out that where you see abortion stories, they’re about a pretty rich white girl getting pregnant. I was like, “Oh, okay, so people are really noticing these things that we’re finding, too.” They talked about having to argue in their writers’ rooms and with their producers, about finding alternative sources for drama and conflict, taking the emotion out of the medical procedure itself, and putting the emotion on getting access to the abortion, or figuring out who to tell about the abortion. Some also talked about abortion as a plot device — not wanting to do an abortion plot line for political reasons, per se, but using it as a way to bring characters closer together, or to cause conflict between characters, or to showcase something about a relationship or a marriage. People kept talking about a particular challenge between men and women. That’s what I often heard about [happening] in writers’ rooms, or between women writers and male showrunners. One person said, “Once a male showrunner decides the direction of an abortion plot line, it’s hard to get him to change his mind, even if he had the details about the abortion wrong.” Another said, “You can hire as many women as you want, but if the people in power don’t listen to them, it doesn’t matter.” “You can hire as many women as you want, but if the people in power don’t listen to them, it doesn’t matter” There was a sense that male colleagues would tamper with an abortion plot line or would make it more dramatic for the sake of drama. They felt they had to explain over and over why it’s important to have a normal, simple abortion portrayed on TV, saying, “Okay, yes, we can put the drama somewhere else. We can have the conflict be somewhere else.” Class and racial disparities in Hollywood had something to do with this too, I’m sure. It has a lot to do with it. Class, race, and gender all play a really big role in which stories get written, which stories get approved, and what eventually makes it to the screen. From what I heard, it sounds like you have to have a really supportive showrunner who then is willing to go to bat for this plot line and for these characters and stories with the networks, with the executives who may be a little more fearful about any blowback from audiences or from advertisers. It seems like the people who want to write these stories tend to be people who’ve had personal experiences with abortion, or have friends who do, or the writers that are just getting started, who want to share these different stories than we’ve seen on TV before. That of course tends to be the writers of color, the writers coming from different types of class backgrounds, the women in the room. It’s all of these issues coming to a head. Have there been trends in how abortion is portrayed over time? Good question. I talked to writers who have been working in the industry for over 20 years. The majority of people we talked to had an average of about 10 years of being in Hollywood. Some people have been working for even longer, since the ’80s and from the ’90s. Those folks said to me, “It was impossible. There was no way you were going to get an abortion plot line on TV.” The best that you could do would be to have a character consider it. Then that character would either change their mind, or have a miscarriage on the way to the clinic. If you had a character even talk about it, that was huge. Networks were just not interested at all. Showrunners would say, “Okay, this character needs to suffer a little bit more after she has her abortion.” It seems like that has changed quite a bit. Now, people say networks are more supportive, although it seems like there’s a certain kind of story that they’re willing to tell and risks that they’re willing to take. A character who has an abortion seems okay. An entire series about abortion, not okay. It’s still risk-averse — doing what someone has already done, maybe with a slight twist, instead of taking a risk on a bigger, bolder kind of show. One person said they had a really big producer on board for their series that was all about abortion, focused on an abortion clinic and its staff. They had a couple of big-name actors and producers on board, and they took it from network to network. No one wanted to touch it. They asked why, and got the same feedback that the writing was great. The setup that they had was great. But the topic — they would never touch that topic. They would never have a show that focused entirely on abortion, that it was too sad, that it was a downer, that it was a bummer. There was this sense that audiences would never tune in for something like that. A character who has an abortion seems okay. An entire series about abortion, not okay. To me, that really conveys this fundamental misunderstanding of American attitudes about abortion, a misunderstanding on the part of networks and executives. The majority of people have some experience with abortion, whether it’s having one themselves, or holding someone’s hand having an abortion, driving them to the clinic. Most people are supportive of abortion, and want to see these kinds of stories told on TV. Studio and network executives in general, I find, don’t really have a great idea of who’s actually in the audience and what their experiences are! And this is a strange assertion when a show like Law and Order: SVU, which is literally about victims of assault, is a huge hit. Then again, I also find that most people consider Hollywood to be this liberal, progressive paradise, and the reality is that the only real ideology in Hollywood is money. Exactly. Right. I’m curious, because now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, I know that there are show writers, and producers, and folks in all kinds of roles who really feel called to tell bigger and bolder stories right now. The question is if networks will give them the resources to do it, and if they will be willing to take on whatever risk they think it is to their business, to advertisers and audiences. Can they give them the same resources that they would give other shows? Can we see billboards about them? Can we see commercials about them? I think you said it: At the end of the day, these networks are businesses. From what I understand, anyway, it’s mostly about: is this going to sell, or is this going to turn people off? And I know a lot of the streaming networks also have other things that they sell. You can imagine Amazon, Disney, Apple: Are people going to protest at Apple stores? Will they not buy their diapers on Amazon anymore? Will they not go to Disney parks? Are there films and TV shows that have managed to break through these institutional barriers? One that comes to mind is HBO’s Unpregnant, which is very similar on paper to the film Never Rarely Sometimes Always, in which a young white girl from a rural town needs to travel to get her abortion. The movies themselves couldn’t be more different. Never Rarely Sometimes Always is very solemn, almost a horror movie. Unpregnant is a hilarious buddy comedy with lots of hijinks. The director Rachel Lee Goldenberg has talked in interviews about wanting to see her own abortion experience represented on screen. In another movie, Saint Frances, the producer and writer talked about having a medication abortion and wanting to see that portrayed on screen. That is also a funny, but very poignant movie where there’s a medication abortion. And Obvious Child comes to mind — really the first rom-com in which a character had an abortion. It was also poignant, funny, and touching. Grandma is also a road trip abortion story. A lot of times, what we’re seeing is a white character who wants an abortion, and ultimately, she’s able to get it. In all of the movies I mentioned, the characters talk about money and they have to travel, so barriers are being portrayed more than they have been in the past. A trend we’ve seen over the last decade is that barriers to abortion are often underportrayed, compared to reality. But some movies and shows are starting to portray the barriers that real people face. What do you think will turn the tide? Mostly it’s if people watch the abortion content. It shows that there is an audience for this, that there are people who want to watch these types of stories, that get excited about these types of stories. A lot of writers do scroll on Twitter and other social media to see the reaction to a TV episode. If you see an abortion plot line that you really liked, talk about it publicly. Say what you liked about it. Tag the writers or tag the producers, so they can see what you’re saying. For the people in charge, seeing that there is no blowback is good, but also seeing that there is actually excitement and enthusiasm would go a long way, too.",https://www.vox.com/culture/23298225/hollywood-abortion-tv-portrayal,11808
Republicans are eyeing a nationwide abortion ban. Can they pull it off?,Nicole Narea,2022-06-25T17:20:00+00:00,"In the wake of Friday’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, Republicans made clear that their ambitions don’t stop there: Some are already lining up to support a nationwide abortion ban if they recapture control of Congress in November’s midterm elections. Former Vice President Mike Pence tweeted Friday that Republicans “must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land.” House Republican leaders — including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican Study Committee chair Jim Banks, and Judiciary Committee ranking member Jim Jordan — also said that they would back a nationwide ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, CNN reported. “In the days and weeks following this decision, we must work to continue to reject extreme policies that seek to allow late-term abortions and taxpayer dollars to fund these elective procedures,” McCarthy said in a statement Friday. “As we celebrate today’s decision, we recognize the decades of advocacy from the pro-life movement and we acknowledge much work remains to protect the most vulnerable among us.” The repeal of Roe v. Wade left the United States with a patchwork of state laws governing abortion. In parts of the South, someone seeking an abortion would need to travel hundreds of miles to get one. But a national ban would supersede even permissive state laws in states that have been working to expand access to abortion. One estimate found that denying all wanted abortions would increase pregnancy-related deaths by 21 percent nationwide if there aren’t effective means for pregnant people to self-manage their abortions. A national ban has been a longstanding goal of anti-abortion advocates, who have for months been trying to plot out a strategy to rally Republicans around the issue in this year’s midterm elections and push 2024 GOP presidential candidates to endorse the policy. The Supreme Court has now put that goal potentially within reach. But it’s not clear how politically feasible a nationwide ban is. Embracing such a broadly unpopular policy could carry electoral costs for Republicans by further activating Democratic voters. And the party would need to consolidate power in Congress and the White House to actually make it law. Republicans are widely expected to recapture the majority in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, meaning a ban could pass. But it probably wouldn’t win support from a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, even if the GOP regains control of the chamber as projected, though Republicans could choose to eliminate the filibuster to pass the ban. A Democrat in the White House would veto any such legislation. But there’s no such guarantee after 2024, especially given that most Americans don’t want President Joe Biden to seek reelection. Still, it’s not clear that Republicans would have the votes. They have previously introduced bills that would recognize life from the moment of fertilization, effectively banning abortion nationwide. But only 19 senators and 164 House members have supported the legislation, far short of the numbers it would need to pass. A 15-week ban, as House Republican leadership have floated, might have better prospects. That’s because the vast majority of abortions — about 93 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — already happen at or before 13 weeks of pregnancy, and Americans are generally less supportive of abortion further into pregnancy. But it’s still an earlier cutoff than currently exists in most states where abortion is legal. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been cautious to entertain the idea publicly. After a draft version of the Supreme Court opinion was leaked to Politico in May, he said that a nationwide ban was “possible,” but later backtracked, saying there wasn’t a veto-proof majority in the Senate for abortion-related legislation of any kind. Embracing a nationwide ban could ultimately backfire for Republicans, given that 85 percent of voters think abortion should be legal in some or all circumstances. This year, there are other factors at play, including inflation and an unpopular Democratic president, and the November elections are still months away — a long time for Democrats to sustain momentum around the issue. Still, the prospect of a ban could be a motivating factor for voters this fall. “I definitely think it’s a jolt for the Democrats, and that it’s not really a jolt for Republicans. Republicans are already fired up and ready to show up to vote. So I don’t think it helps Republicans at all,” Jay Williams, a Georgia-based GOP strategist, told me when the draft opinion leaked. Former President Donald Trump has also reportedly predicted that the Supreme Court’s decision could ultimately hurt Republicans politically, especially among suburban women who helped propel him into office in 2016, suggesting that he would be skeptical of embracing a nationwide ban. But abortion advocates have argued that those concerns may not stop Republican efforts, pointing to Texas lawmakers who didn’t suffer any significant political backlash for passing a ban last year on abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, typically about six weeks into pregnancy.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/25/23182779/nationwide-abortion-ban-roe-republicans,11808
Blue states have been preparing to become abortion safe havens,Nicole Narea,2022-06-24T16:59:23+00:00,"Blue states have been preparing for months for the possibility that the US Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade. Now that the Court has made its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, there’s still more blue states can do to shore up abortion access for their own residents — and for those who now live in states where the procedure is or will soon become illegal. So far in 2022, at least nine Democrat-controlled legislatures have passed legislation affirming that abortion is a legal right, protecting those who seek abortions and perform them, and expanding access to the procedure, sometimes using considerable public funding. “State legislators have rightfully been preparing for this moment, and they have done a ton of proactive work. And that needs to continue. Solidifying the right to abortion is great, but it’s actually the bare minimum that we need,” said Kelly Baden, senior vice president at the State Innovation Exchange, a resource and strategy center for progressive state legislators. “This is a very dark day and we’ve got to do more.” Some blue states will soon face a surge in demand given that at least 13 states have enacted “trigger laws,” meaning that abortion clinics there will be shuttered now that Roe has been overturned. They have, and will continue to, take steps to prepare for an influx of out-of-state patients, but nothing they do will be able to make up for critical gaps in abortion access across the US that will only deepen in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision. And abortion opponents have been eyeing a nationwide abortion ban in the longer term. “They’re about to have to shore up access for 26 other states. It’s an impossible burden to put on these states that believe in a woman’s right to choose,” former Democratic Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis, a longtime abortion rights advocate, told Vox. “It’s going to require a cohesive national effort to try to fill that gap, understanding that it’s never going to completely fill the gap.” Here’s what those efforts have looked like so far. Anticipating the absence of a federally protected right to an abortion, some states have passed their own laws codifying Roe and abortion rights in state law. States including Illinois, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Massachusetts have had those laws on the books for years. New Jersey, Colorado, Connecticut, and California enacted such measures earlier this year. Other measures to protect abortion rights have passed at least one chamber in several states, but actually enacting them may be difficult. In Washington state, for instance, abortion rights are protected under the law, and lawmakers have considered an amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. But Democrats don’t have a supermajority in either chamber of the state legislature, and state law requires a two-thirds majority to put an amendment on the ballot. Democrats are also working to ensure that laws restricting abortions that were on the books in their states before the Supreme Court decided Roe in 1973 will not be enforced going forward. One such Michigan law, enacted in 1931, criminalizes abortion without exceptions for rape or incest. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has acknowledged that the GOP-controlled state legislature isn’t likely to overturn it, so she asked the Michigan Supreme Court in April to strike it down and affirm that the state constitution includes the right to access an abortion. Pending a lawsuit, the Michigan Court of Claims also temporarily blocked the law from going into effect in May. “The due process clause of the Michigan Constitution protects the right to abortion in the same way that the United States Constitution does per Roe, and the equal protection clause prohibits the state from adopting laws based on paternalistic justifications and overbroad generalizations about the role of women in the work force and at home,” Whitmer wrote last month in the New York Times. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has also said that he will not enforce a state law passed in 1849 that makes abortion a felony with penalties of up to six years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. However, it’s possible that local officials could still choose to enforce the law, likely prompting legal challenges. While Roe still stood, Republicans were generally cautious not to penalize people for receiving abortions. Some states have also explicitly exempted people who receive abortions from criminal homicide charges. But there’s no guarantee that won’t change now that Roe has been overturned, so Democratic legislatures in several states are working to give pregnant people additional protections. At least six states have introduced legislation that protects people who self-induce an abortion, primarily by means of FDA-approved pills. Washington, DC, already barred prosecution for self-induced abortion in 2020. The state of Washington also recently passed a law that prohibits the state from criminalizing pregnancy outcomes, which went into effect earlier this month. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, vetoed a similar measure, and other such bills in Minnesota and Michigan aren’t likely to move forward. Criminalizing pregnancy outcomes, including abortion, can have far-reaching consequences. In the decades after Roe was decided, at least 1,200 women were arres­ted and prosecuted for miscar­riage, still­birth, or attempt­ing to end their own preg­nancy. Pregnancy outcomes have been criminalized through fetal assault laws (which can be enforced at any stage of pregnancy in 29 states), policies that penalize pregnant people for substance use, and legal attempts to force pregnant people to undergo medical treatment to benefit a fetus. Expanding criminalization would disproportionately affect Black and work­ing-class women and have collateral consequences not just for the pregnant person but also, in many cases, their existing children. Democrats have also sought to protect people who perform or aid in abortions. At least eight states have introduced bills to protect abortion clinics from violence, though Maine is the only one to enact such legislation. Effective in July, the state will establish an eight-foot buffer zone around health facility entrances, including abortion clinics, to prevent anti-abortion protesters from blocking the entrance or harassing patients or staff. Even in the most progressive states, there are still gaps in abortion accessibility, as a California state government report outlined in December. Ramping up access quickly will be critical as blue states take steps to become havens for out-of-state abortion patients. Sixteen states already fund abortions through state Medicaid programs, since federal law doesn’t allow the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the pregnant person’s life is endangered. Earlier this year, Maryland also removed some administrative barriers to Medicaid coverage of abortion, and Oregon allocated $15 million to its state and local health departments for abortion services. New York and California joined Maryland in enacting legislation to expand abortion coverage through private health plans. But those measures expanding Medicaid and private insurance coverage of abortions won’t help out-of-state patients. Some states have also been working to expand access to abortion training and broaden the categories of medical professionals who can perform abortions. Washington started allowing physician assistants, advanced-practice nurses, and other health clinicians to perform abortions earlier this month. Maryland will also establish a training program for abortion clinicians with $3.5 million in annual funding starting in July. There are pending proposals in three states to expand access to medication abortion — the method used in about half of US abortions and that has become preferred during the pandemic — but none have passed yet. They could be critical in helping abortion clinics increase their capacity quickly since women would not necessarily have to go to a clinic to be prescribed the pills, which are a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol and authorized for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. Still, those measures can’t make up for abortion clinics suddenly closing across half of the US. “You have 36 million women of reproductive age who would be living in a state without abortion access,” said Elizabeth Nash, a state policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights advocacy organization. “And you can’t imagine that the states that are protecting abortion access will be able to meet that need.” Update, June 24, 1 pm: This story has been updated in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v.

What Americans think of abortion,Sarah Kliff,2015-04-08T11:00:00+00:00,"“Abortion is killing a baby. But I’m not saying it’s always wrong.” This was the first thing David King told me when I called him in late March and asked him talk to me about his views on abortion. King and I didn’t know each other when I called. He’s a former dairy farmer who now works at a Walmart in rural Ohio. A few weeks earlier, he’d been among the 1,067 adults randomly selected for a Vox poll on abortion policy. He gave our pollsters, communications and strategy firm PerryUndem, an answer that interested me. When asked whether he identified as pro-life or pro-choice, he didn’t pick one. He picked both. “From my point of view, I believe all babies go to heaven,” King told me when I asked him to explain how both labels fit his viewpoint. “And if this baby were to live a life where it would be abused ... it’s just really hard to explain. It gets into the rights of the woman, and her body, at the same time. It just sometimes gets really hazy on each side.” King’s perspective is, in a way, unique: he has a distinct and nuanced view on when abortion should and shouldn’t be legal, one that takes in all sorts of personal and circumstantial factors. He’s generally anti-abortion, but not completely. He doesn’t fit neatly into either side of the debate. In another way, though, King’s viewpoint is common: in our poll, we found that 18 percent of Americans, like King, pick “both” when you ask them to choose between pro-life and pro-choice. Another 21 percent choose neither. Taken together, about four in 10 Americans are eschewing the labels that we typically see as defining the abortion policy debate. I’ve covered abortion for about eight years now at four different publications. The beat has put me in touch with doctors who provide abortions and those who travel to Washington each year to protest the procedure at the March for Life. I’ve talked to abortion rights advocates struggling to appeal to a new generation. I’ve been in the doctor’s room as the procedure is done. Abortion usually gets framed as a two-sided debate: Americans support abortion rights, or they don’t. They think Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in America, was a good ruling, or a terrible one. There are the pro-choice groups and the pro-life groups. But I’ve spent a lot of time talking to friends and family and the people I meet in my reporting about how they view the issue. Here’s what I’ve learned: they don’t live in this world of absolutes. Abortion views are indeed strongly held, but what most discourse misses is the nuance — the personal factors and situations that influence how each individual thinks about the issue. Our poll confirms my anecdotal findings: 39 percent of Americans don’t choose a label in the debate. We also found that how you ask the question matters — a simple wording change can significantly alter whether Americans say they support legal abortion. Our pollsters, Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, gave a different question to the two halves of our polling panel. They asked one half whether they agreed with the statement “Abortion should be legal in almost all cases.” The other half got a different wording of a similar idea: “Women should have a legal right to safe and accessible abortion in almost all cases.” Twenty-eight percent of the public agreed with the first statement — and 37 percent with the second. That’s a jump of nine percentage points in who thinks abortion ought to be generally legal, just by highlighting the fact that a woman is involved in the situation. This is especially notable when you consider that most of the people we polled — more than three-quarters — said they held their views on abortion strongly. I spent considerable time looking at our findings and trying to understand them. What does it mean to identify as both pro-choice and pro-life, and what does that say about how Americans view abortion? Why do opinions on such a controversial issue swing so significantly just based on the wording of a question? I couldn’t answer these questions on my own, so I called some of our poll’s respondents. I reached out to people who told us they identified as both pro-life and pro-choice. Here’s what I learned: the public has diverse views on abortion. But it’s rarely a split between “abortion is right” and “abortion is wrong.” Instead, there is a nuance that the public conversation typically misses: a factoring in of personal circumstances and beliefs that manifest themselves in deeply held individual views. We’ve framed our abortion debate all wrong. It isn’t black and white — it’s thousands of different shades of gray that exist somewhere in the middle. This matters because by ignoring that gray space, we miss something important: there are abortion policies that a majority of Americans could agree on. King was among the first people I reached, catching him at home on a Thursday morning. He was certain in his opposition to abortion. But at the same time, he didn’t like the idea of protesting abortion or donating to groups that advocate on the issue. “I don’t go out protesting or nothing like that,” he said. “Never will.” King and I talked a bit about whether there’s a situation in which he could ever see abortion as the right option for him, personally. He wasn’t totally sure. “I think of myself as pro-choice in a way, because it’s such a personal matter for each individual,” he says. This is an idea that turned up in our poll, when we asked respondents to think not about themselves, but about someone else seeking to terminate a pregnancy. We asked respondents: if a woman had decided to have an abortion, what they would want that experience to be like for her? We found a surprising amount of agreement on these questions. As King put it to me, “There are my personal beliefs, but you can’t blanketly say, ‘You can’t do that.’ I can voice my opinion, but I won’t protest. I think that’s ridiculous.” Meghann August, a 31-year-old mother of one in Florida whom I spoke with, told me something similar. She had a clear view on when she thought abortion was appropriate. “I guess if you’re raped or in a desperate situation, then abortion would be the way to go,” she says. “But if you’re just being careless and irresponsible, then I don’t think it’s the right decision.” We got to talking about a friend of hers who had had an abortion. Our poll found that those who had talked to a friend or family member about an abortion experience or decision tend to be more supportive of abortion rights. Of course, it’s hard to know which way this relationship runs. People might have their views changed by a discussion — or those who support legal abortion already might be more likely to have those discussions in the first place. August says her views didn’t change as a result of talking to her friend. She believes what her friend did was wrong — but that she also understands why she did it. “I don’t agree with her decision, because she was being reckless,” she says, “but at the same time I understand it. I’m not accepting, but I don’t condemn her. She couldn’t take care of it.” These are the type of conversations I kept having again and again — ones where lines exist, but they aren’t the ones that we typically think of in the abortion policy debate. And they’re different for each individual. “I’ve seen little babies and tiny toddlers with teenage mothers or older women who have been abused by their child’s father and reject their newborn,” Elaine Beldsoe told me, when I asked her to tell me how she developed her views on abortion. She’s a 90-year-old retiree in Texas who used to work at a Christian nonprofit. “There are bad things I’ve seen over the years. And I don’t see any real change — or think that [anti-abortion laws] can change human nature.” Bledsoe said she’s become increasingly supportive of abortion rights as she’s become older. Still, she said she doesn’t think the procedure should become completely legal and knows exactly where she would draw the line on regulation. “There’s a point when we know the fetus is viable, and at that point the abortion would be unacceptable,” she said. “Even if the woman doesn’t want the child, it can go to an adoption agency.” These conversations surprised me in two ways. First was the fact that they happened at all: I expected to have the phone slammed down, at least once, when I asked someone I never met to discuss abortion rights. That never happened. All the people I spoke with were willing to talk about an issue that we typically consider taboo — sometimes for nearly an hour. Then there were the opinions themselves, which didn’t fit clearly into any particular label. The people I spoke with had strong but nuanced views. Those who leaned in favor of or against abortion rights didn’t do so absolutely — they all had lines, drawn in different places, about when abortion is and is not appropriate. There are two things we get the most wrong about abortion in the United States. First, that it’s a rare experience, and second, that it’s a policy area where the public simply cannot agree. Abortion is a common experience in the United States, much more so than most of us realize. There are just over 1 million abortions annually, as of 2011. Put another way: 1.7 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 44 have an abortion each year. The best statistics say that one in 10 women will have an abortion by age 20 — and one in four by age 30. By age 45, one in three American women will have terminated a pregnancy. Twenty-one percent of pregnancies in the United States end in abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute. If you find the one-in-three-women statistic surprising, you’re not alone: when we told participants in our poll this figure, 73 percent of them said it was higher than they expected. One possible explanation for why this shocks people: we don’t talk much about abortion. The one-in-three figure suggests there’s a decent chance that most of us know a woman who has terminated a pregnancy. But only four in 10 of our poll respondents tell us they’ve talked to someone about their abortion experience or decision. I find myself in a similar situation. As a reporter, I’ve talked to multiple women who’ve terminated pregnancies. But as a friend or family member? That conversation has never come up — even though, with the numbers where they are, it’s almost certain I know someone who has been through that experience. Abortion is common — and, in certain ways, there is surprising agreement in the United States about what the process of obtaining an abortion ought to be like. There is a clear split between people who think abortion should be legal in most or some situations and those who disagree. Most poll questions don’t probe any deeper than that. We accept the divide. Our poll tried something different: it asked respondents to think about women who had decided to have an abortion and how that experience ought to be. And there, we found agreement. Seventy-two percent want the experience to be comfortable. Seventy-three percent want it to be supportive, and 74 percent want it to be nonjudgmental. Most Americans (70 percent) think women shouldn’t have to travel more than 60 miles to obtain an abortion. These numbers are higher than those who support the Roe v. Wade decision (68 percent) and much higher than those who think abortion ought to be legal in most or some situations (46 percent). Women are traveling further to obtain abortions as some clinics have closed in the face of new regulations. In Texas, for example, the number of clinics has fallen from 43 in August 2013 to eight in October 2014. (Data for these charts come from the Texas Tribune) Taken together, our poll and my ensuing interviews changed how I saw Americans’ opinions on abortion. In most of my coverage, I find it rare to see leaders of the pro-life and pro-choice movements having a productive conversation. When put into debate, they often talk past each other. This makes sense: these are the people who exist at the more polarized ends of the issue. But I could easily see the people I interviewed — people like David King and Elaine Bledsoe and Meghann August — having a productive discussion about how our country regulates abortion. It’s not hard for me to envision these people, from diverse backgrounds and with significantly different views on abortion, still finding space where they agree. They might get behind similar abortion laws — ones that protected women from aggressive protesters, for example — in a way I could never see Washington lobbying groups collaborating. These aren’t the voices that set abortion policy; they don’t vote on laws or run lobbying campaigns. But they do live under those laws — and even though they come from different backgrounds and live in different states and hold different views, they have way more in common with one another than most of us realize. PerryUndem Research/Communication conducted the survey among n = 1,067 adults 18 and older nationwide, March 4 through 12, 2015. The survey was administered among a nationally representative sample of adults, using GfK’s Knowledge Panel. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percentage points.

Why abortion politics might not carry Democrats again in 2024,Rachel M. Cohen,2024-03-15T13:30:00+00:00,"It’s no secret that Democrats are leaning hard into running on abortion rights for the 2024 cycle. Joe Biden has promised to bring back “the protections of Roe v. Wade in every state” and Congressional Democrats say abortion rights will be their top issue this coming year. Democrats’ decision to center the overthrow of Roe is rooted largely in the massive success they’ve had running on abortion rights over the last two years, which helped them win a slew of special elections and outperform expectations in the 2022 midterms, staving off a red wave and keeping control of the US Senate. Pro-abortion ballot measures won in all seven states in which they appeared on the ballot since Dobbs, even in red states like Kentucky, Montana, and Kansas. The party can point to critics who warned incorrectly that Democrats had erred in focusing so much on reproductive freedom, and public polling also underestimated the extent to which abortion rights motivated the midterm electorate. Given this strategy’s success in the midterm and special elections, centering abortion rights seems like a safe bet for Biden in 2024. But the special circumstances of presidential elections — and the masses of voters they tend to attract — suggest this strategy is more of a gamble than it first appears. Though abortion rights helped mobilize the kinds of voters likely to cast ballots in midterm and special elections, the presidential electorate generally looks different from those in off-cycle years. Roughly 160 million Americans cast ballots in the 2020 election, or 67 percent of the voting-eligible population. By contrast, just 112 million people voted in 2022, or 46 percent of those eligible. Those who turn out every two years to vote — for primaries, midterms, presidential contests, and even special elections — are what scholars refer to as “high-propensity” voters. These people tend to be more highly educated and less diverse than those who only turn out once every four years. So-called “low-propensity” voters, meanwhile, are generally not following politics closely and are less likely to have gone to college. They’re unlikely to be watching Fox News or MSNBC, probably not posting any Instagram stories about the Middle East or sending money to candidates. They are often less sure about what each party stands for, but they do generally turn out to vote, partly because voting is habitual, and for many it is seen as a civic duty. These particular voters (also referred to as “infrequent” voters or “less engaged” voters) have not yet turned out since 2020, or 18 months before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Polling indicates that it’s these voters that Biden is now struggling with, those who cast ballots for him four years ago but now are leaning toward Donald Trump or considering staying home on Election Day. Things have grown especially dire for the president among young, Black, and Hispanic low-propensity voters. Nate Cohn, the chief political analyst for the New York Times, said in October these less engaged voters “might just be the single biggest problem” facing Biden. And for these voters in particular, abortion rights are simply not among the top issues they say they care about. First, the good news for Democrats: Low-propensity voters also support abortion rights. Broadly speaking, they even tend to identify as slightly more “pro-choice” than the rest of the electorate, according to Bryan Bennett, a pollster with the progressive polling firm Navigator. (Per Navigator’s data, infrequent voters are about 67 percent pro-choice and 27 percent anti-abortion, compared to the rest of the country that’s 64 percent pro-choice and 31 percent anti-abortion.) But while low-propensity voters are largely pro-choice, they don’t rank abortion rights anywhere close to a top issue. Among most voters — high-propensity and low — inflation and jobs top the list of issues they say are most important to them. Among low-propensity voters in particular, Bennett told me, jobs and inflation rank even higher than among the country overall. “So the high-level takeaway is that these are deeply economically focused folks,” he said. Abortion access “just isn’t a top issue for infrequent voters,” Ali Mortell, the research director for the progressive polling shop Blue Rose Research, told me. When Navigator asked low-propensity voters which issues they feel are most important for Congress to focus on, those voters ranked inflation and jobs highest, followed by health care (34 percent), then corruption in government, immigration, climate change, crime, Social Security and Medicare, and education all between 27 and 22 percent. Only after that did 17 percent of low-propensity voters rank abortion a top issue for Congress. Meanwhile, among all voters likely to cast ballots in November, most don’t see Trump as a major threat to reproductive freedom. The progressive polling firm Data for Progress found in February that, while likely voters are “somewhat” or “very concerned” about restrictions on abortion rights, less than half see Trump specifically as a threat in that regard. Only 48 percent think Trump will try to pass a national ban, and less than a quarter blame him for Roe’s demise, despite Trump himself taking credit for it. Perhaps most concerning for Democrats is that just 52 percent of respondents said they thought the 2024 election was “very important” to abortion rights. What do voters who are abandoning Biden or waffling on him say they care most about? I asked Data for Progress if they could glean information about voters who cast ballots for Biden but are now saying they’re likely to vote for Trump in 2024. Per Vox’s request, they pooled about 12,000 survey responses from 10 national likely voter surveys they’ve run since the start of the year. Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, said their initial findings showed among likely Biden-to-Trump voters that the economy was their most commonly cited important issue. “Abortion almost ranked dead last in terms of issue importance, tied with race relations and education, and just ahead of LGBTQ+ issues,” Deiseroth added. While pollsters agree abortion mattered in the 2022 midterms, it appeared to matter to varying degrees depending on whether you’re looking at state ballot measures or at contests for governorships to the US House and Senate. Abortion rights ballot measures won in all seven states, largely because Republicans crossed the aisle to vote for them. Looking at the crosstabs, experts found that abortion ballot measures tended to over-perform with white Republican voters and underperform with non-white Democratic voters. In Michigan for example, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was much more popular with Black voters than the state’s winning abortion rights ballot measure. Likewise in Kentucky, the abortion rights ballot measure did well relative to partisanship in white suburbs and underperformed slightly in the major, Blacker metropolitan areas. According to the New York Times, Biden appears to be struggling most with young, Black, and Hispanic working-class voters — those who identify as Democrats but did not turn out in 2022. Abortion rights tend to rank lower for Black voters. These voters have become more liberal on abortion over time, but they are still more conservative on the issues relative to their partisanship, as the vote-splitting in Michigan indicated. As Democrats campaign on abortion rights, they’ll have to be careful about how they talk about the issue. An Ipsos poll released in February on behalf of the abortion rights advocacy group All* Above All found that just under half of Black male respondents (48 percent) said they “personally supported a person’s right to abortion and believe it should be legal and available.” If Democrats stick to language about fighting government interference in abortion decisions, however, they’ll be on safer ground. The poll found 43 percent of Black men said they were personally against abortion but didn’t believe the government should prevent others from deciding. Still, only 17 percent of Black men said they’d only vote for a candidate who shares their view on abortion, and 38 percent said abortion rights were a small or nonexistent factor for them when determining their 2024 vote choice. Biden and Democrats are making a political bet that women, who make up a slight majority of the electorate, will be particularly motivated to vote in November to protect abortion rights. Besides inspiring independents and first-time female voters, they hope some Republican women will cross the aisle, as they did in the midterms for abortion rights ballot measures. “Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women,” Biden declared in his recent State of the Union. “But they found out. When reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2023. And we’ll win again in 2024.” But this, too, is a gamble, as presidential contests tend to be much more polarized than off-cycle elections. The pull of partisanship is stronger; there is less ticket-splitting. Recent focus groups with Trump-voting women in Pennsylvania found just one out of 15 participants said their feelings over the gutting of Roe v. Wade would drive them to vote for Biden in November. The Bulwark said while the women soundedlike Biden voters on abortion rights, they also explained the issue didn’t carry the same weight for them as the economy or immigration. “I’m going to vote for who I think is going to be the best for my family,” said one 35-year-old woman. Only one respondent worried a second Trump presidency could lead to a national abortion ban and a limit they did not support, like six weeks. There are a few reasons why the abortion rights strategy could still pay off for the president in November, despite signs that the issue is not as resonant with the low-propensity voters he’s now trying to reach. Mortell, the research director with Blue Rose, said their data shows that their top abortion messaging (around freedom from government interference and control) still resonates with lower-turnout voters and that it can be a powerful idea to leverage across all voter subgroups. “It’s essential to talk about kitchen-table issues that voters care most about, not just abortion alone, but there’s no reason to exclude abortion in order to talk about those issues,” she told me. “In fact, during the 2022 midterms, we saw that some of the most effective ads used GOP positions on abortion to prove their extremism on other issues, like Social Security. It’s not the only issue, but it’s deeply interrelated with other personal freedoms and contextualizes each party’s values.” During Biden’s State of the Union, he talked about other issues, leaning into messages that Republicans were beholden to the rich and that Democrats wanted to support the working class. More recently, Biden has gone after Trump about his comments on slashing Medicaid and Social Security. Bennett, at Navigator, said he thinks it’s too early to know what the “issue landscape” will look like for voters by November, especially with the new attacks on IVF and the upcoming Supreme Court case attacking mifepristone. He noted that in recent national and battleground research they conducted, among the top issues and most intense concerns about both Donald Trump and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson was their record on abortion. Joey Teitelbaum, a pollster with Global Strategy Group who worked on the winning abortion rights ballot measure campaigns in Ohio, Colorado, Kansas, and Kentucky, told me that polls that ask voters to rank issues by importance often fail to capture how a respondent is truly weighing the topic in their mind. “If the question is, ‘Do I personally think that I’m going to need to have an abortion in the next four years under a Trump presidency,’ that’s very different from, ‘Am I concerned about Republicans trying to control the decisions of my friends and family where they decide what’s best?’” she said. “These issue battery questions don’t capture that.” Moreover, on low-propensity voters in particular, Teitelbaum noted there’s a big difference between not following the news closely and not knowing about what’s affecting your loved ones. “Voters might be low-information about campaigns and candidates but they’re high-information about what’s happening in their lives and their friends’ lives,” she said. “Those kinds of stories are not going to get lost.” It’s also possible that the polls in 2024 are once again failing to capture abortion’s salience as an election issue. In 2022, public polls seemed to underestimate how much abortion rights ultimately mattered to midterm voters, and it’s becoming harder and harder for pollsters to get sufficient response rates to their questions. “Poll after poll seemed to tell a clear story before the election: Voters were driven more by the economy, immigration, and crime than abortion and democracy,” Nate Cohn of the New York Times wrote last fall. “In the end, the final results ... told a completely different story about the election.” Another reason the strategy may still work is because by and large fewer than usual low-propensity voters may turn out in November this year, and there’s little doubt abortion rights remain a salient issue for high-propensity voters who lean Democratic. As of now, fewer people seem to be following the 2024 election compared to the presidential primary in 2020, and as my colleague Eric Levitz recently wrote, the Republican Party also remains interested in various forms of voter suppression, even though polls suggest the GOP may be doing better with non-white voters now in particular. Thirteen red states enacted new voting restrictions in 2023, and Trump continues to rail against mail-in voting. In the end, even if they don’t change their campaign focus, Democrats may benefit from their advantage with high-propensity voters. A Grinnell College survey from October found 2020 Trump voters were four points less likely to say they were definitely going to cast a ballot this year than 2020 Biden voters, and surveys from Marquette University found Biden performing better among likely voters than registered ones. Researchers I spoke with said they expect the president’s polling performance with college-educated voters and self-identified Democrats to improve as the campaign stretches on. If these voters turn out for the president, and overall turnout remains on the lower end, Biden has a better chance.",https://www.vox.com/politics/24101209/abortion-reproductive-freedom-biden-2024-election,11808
"Thanks, Obama! The hilarious reason why a judge just blocked Wyoming’s abortion ban.",Ian Millhiser,2023-03-23T20:20:36+00:00,"On Wednesday, a judge in the deep-red state of Wyoming temporarily blocked a state law that would make performing nearly any abortion in that state a felony. She relied on a 2012 amendment to the state constitution that was intended to spite then-President Barack Obama. Obama’s early years in office were marred by a scorched-earth political campaign Republicans wielded to try to thwart what became the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare’s opponents warned of a “government takeover of health care” that would strip many Americans of their ability to make their own health decisions. Many of these allegations were downright ludicrous, such as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s (R) false claim that Obama’s health bill would require “my baby with Down Syndrome ... to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society’ whether they are worthy of health care.” These attacks did not succeed. The bill became law, and Obamacare is popular now that it has been in full effect for nearly a decade without anyone being forced to stand before a death panel. But there is at least one lasting legacy of these attempts to characterize the Affordable Care Act as an attack on patients’ right to decide whether and when to seek health treatments. In many states, opponents of Obamacare effectively took the GOP’s talking points and turned them into state constitutional amendments protecting patients’ ability to obtain health care that the government might not want them to have. Wyoming’s amendment, for example, provides that “each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” According to Quinn Yeargain, a law professor at Widener University, similar amendments are on the books in several other states. It remains to be seen whether the highest courts in these states, some of which are extremely conservative, will ultimately agree that these anti-Obamacare amendments prohibit abortion bans. And, in at least some cases, the amendments contain language that could mitigate their impact. Wyoming’s amendment, for example, also provides that, under certain circumstances, the state legislature may “determine reasonable and necessary restrictions on the rights granted” by the health care amendment. But abortion advocates have had two early successes: the Wyoming judge’s order temporarily blocking that state’s abortion ban, and a similar decision by a trial judge in Ohio. Wyoming district court Judge Melissa Owens’s Wednesday decision temporarily halting her state’s abortion ban is the second time she intervened to prevent this ban from going into effect. Wyoming’s abortion ban is quite strict, although it does provide exceptions for rape, incest, or when either a pregnant patient or the fetus has certain medical conditions. Last summer, shortly after the Supreme Court’s decision overruling Roe v. Wade, an array of patients, doctors, and nonprofit groups brought a suit arguing that Wyoming’s abortion ban violated the state’s constitutional provision protecting each adult’s right to individual health care decisions. That case is known as Johnson v. Wyoming. Judge Owens handed down a decision in August halting the law. Among other things, she rejected the state’s argument that the health care amendment was “only adopted to push back against the Affordable Care Act,” and should not be construed to protect abortion rights. Regardless of the political circumstances that led to this amendment being written into the state constitution, Owens reasoned that the amendment “unambiguously provides competent Wyoming citizens with the right to make their own health care decisions,” and she was bound by that unambiguous text. “A court,” she wrote, “is not at liberty to assume that the Wyoming voters who adopted” the amendment “did not understand the force of language in the provision.” Just as significantly, Owens construed the amendment to give people in Wyoming a “fundamental right” to make their own health care decisions, including the decision to seek an abortion. This designation matters because fundamental rights can only be abridged when the state seeks to advance a “compelling state interest” and when it uses the “least intrusive” means to do so. Thus, even though the amendment permits the state legislature to impose “reasonable and necessary restrictions” on individual’s health choices, Owens concluded that Wyoming’s broad ban on abortion access sweeps too far because it intrudes into pregnant patients’ health care decisions even when a “fetus has a genetic abnormality that is incompatible with life.” (The state has since amended its law to permit abortions when “there is a substantial likelihood that the unborn baby has a lethal fetal anomaly,” a change that could undermine Owens’s legal reasoning.) There is precedent for Owens’s conclusion that this Wyoming health care amendment establishes a fundamental right that the legislature may only abridge under very limited circumstances, even though that same amendment gives the legislature some authority to enact laws. The US Constitution’s 14th Amendment has long been construed to protect many fundamental rights, such as the right to marry or the right to choose your own sexual partners. But the 14th Amendment also contains language permitting Congress to enforce its provisions “by appropriate legislation.” Nevertheless, the fact that the 14th Amendment permits Congress to enact laws it deems “appropriate” typically does not permit Congress to abridge the fundamental rights it guarantees. In response to Owens’s August decision blocking the state’s abortion ban, the state legislature enacted a new law decreeing that abortion “is not health care” and thus is not protected by the state constitution. Owens’s Wednesday order blocked that law as well, declaring that “the legislature cannot make an end run around” around a constitutional amendment, and that it is up to the courts to decide whether abortion meets the state constitution’s definition of “health care.” Yet, while the state legislature appears eager to restore the state’s abortion ban, the Wyoming Supreme Court has thus far resisted the urge to rush in and overrule Owens. Last December, after a case reached the state Supreme Court that it could have used to reject Judge Owens’s reading of the state constitution, Wyoming’s justices chose instead not to decide that case. That left Owens’s August order in effect. So, while there are plausible legal arguments on either side of this dispute, there appears to be a real chance that the state’s highest court will agree with Owens if and when they weigh in on whether the state constitution protects abortion. If the state Supreme Court shared the legislature’s view that abortion must be banned in Wyoming, it could have intervened last winter. At least one other state court, in Ohio, relied on that state’s anti-Obamacare amendment in an opinion temporarily blocking a law that bans nearly all abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy. That 2022 decision, in a case known as Preterm-Cleveland v. Yost, argued that a few provisions of the state constitution, including the state’s health care amendment, work together to protect abortion rights. Last December, a state appeals court decided that the trial court’s order in Preterm-Cleveland may remain in effect, at least for now. Ohio’s amendment provides that no state law “shall prohibit the purchase or sale of health care or health insurance.” Nor may it “impose a penalty or fine for the sale or purchase of health care or health insurance.” Thus, as long as a patient seeking an abortion pays for that treatment, the Ohio amendment appears to provide very robust protection to abortion rights. Like the Wyoming amendment, Ohio’s permits the legislature to enact some restrictions on the right to purchase health care but the Ohio amendment uses less expansive language to describe when such restrictions are allowed — though one provision of the Ohio amendment does permit state laws that are “calculated to deter fraud or punish wrongdoing in the health care industry.” An abortion opponent would no doubt argue that abortions are themselves a form of “wrongdoing.” In any event, the Ohio Supreme Court has a 4-3 Republican majority. So there’s no guarantee that the state’s justices will agree with the trial court’s ruling and allow abortion to remain legal in Ohio. (Until recently, the swing vote on the Ohio Supreme Court was held by Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, a relatively moderate Republican. But O’Connor recently retired and the Court’s new majority hasn’t developed much of a record. So it is difficult for a lawyer to assess with certainty how it is likely to rule on a case like Preterm-Cleveland.) But what about other states that enacted health care amendments as a statement of defiance against Obamacare? The short answer is that a lawsuit seeking to protect abortion rights in these states would turn on the same questions that are in play in Wyoming and Ohio: What does the state’s health care amendment actually say? And who controls the state Supreme Court? Alabama’s amendment, for example, is unlikely to help abortion advocates very much, even setting aside the fact that Alabama’s Supreme Court is dominated by Republicans. That’s because Alabama’s amendment primarily prohibits the state from requiring “any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in any health care system.” That language cannot reasonably be construed to protect abortion rights. Other states, including Arizona, Missouri, and Oklahoma, enacted similar amendments preventing the state government from compelling individuals to “participate in any health care system.” These amendments are also unlikely to help proponents of abortion rights. So this largely forgotten legacy of a failed Republican effort to spite Obamacare is only likely to matter in a very small number of states. And it may not even have a lasting impact in Wyoming and Ohio, depending on how their state Supreme Courts rule on whether the state constitution protects abortion. For the moment, however, the Obama-era amendments writing anti-Obamacare talking points into two state constitutions have proved to be a thorn in the side of Republicans who hope to ban abortions. Let that be a lesson that a state constitution is a foolish thing to change for the sake of a political stunt.",https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/23/23653183/abortion-wyoming-obamacare-barack-obama-supreme-court-johnson,11808
Two new Supreme Court cases ask if there is a right to medically necessary abortion,Ian Millhiser,2023-12-04T20:10:00+00:00,"A federal law, known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), requires hospitals that accept Medicare funds to provide “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” of “any individual” who arrives at the hospital’s ER with an “emergency medical condition.” The language unambiguously requires these hospitals to provide an abortion to such patients when an abortion is the appropriate medical treatment to stabilize their emergency medical condition. And a federal court in Idaho held more than a year ago that this statute requires hospitals to provide medically necessary abortions even if the procedure would ordinarily be banned under state law. Now we’re about to find out whether the Supreme Court will follow the text of EMTALA, in a pair of cases known as Idaho v. United States and Moyle v. United States. (Both cases present similar issues, but the Idaho case was brought to the Supreme Court by Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, while the Moyle case was brought by the state’s GOP-controlled legislature.) The trial court that heard these cases held that EMTALA trumps (or “preempts,” to use the appropriate legal term) Idaho’s sweeping abortion ban, which generally allows doctors to perform abortions only when “necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.” This trial court decision did not fully legalize abortion in Idaho, nor did it come close to doing so. But it did hold that federal law requires Idaho hospitals to provide abortion care to patients who are at risk of “serious impairment to bodily functions,” “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part,” or other nonfatal consequences that are defined as medical emergencies by EMTALA. In both the Idaho and the Moyle cases, Idaho officials ask the Supreme Court to block this lower court’s decision, despite EMTALA’s unambiguous language, and there’s at least some risk that the Court’s GOP-appointed majority will do so. This is, after all, the same majority that recently overruled Roe v. Wade and abolished the constitutional right to an abortion. In September 2023, a panel of three Trump-appointed judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit briefly stayed the lower court’s decision enforcing EMTALA. That order was swiftly withdrawn by the full Ninth Circuit. But the willingness of those three Trump judges to reinstate Idaho’s ban on providing medically necessary abortions to many patients suggests that at least some members of the Supreme Court may also be willing to do so. EMTALA is a fairly straightforward statute. It only applies to hospitals with emergency rooms, and it only applies to hospitals that take Medicare funds (which is most hospitals because Medicare provides health coverage to Americans over the age of 65). Under EMTALA, those hospitals generally must provide emergency care to any patient who requires it. The primary purpose of EMTALA is to prevent hospitals from refusing to treat patients with medical emergencies who are unable to pay for their care, but the law is written in expansive terms. It provides that “if any individual ... comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition,” the hospital typically must “stabilize the medical condition.” (In limited circumstances, the hospital may transfer the patient to a different facility that will provide this stabilizing treatment.) EMTALA, moreover, defines the term “emergency medical condition” to include not just life-threatening illnesses or injuries, but also conditions that place someone’s health “in serious jeopardy” or that threaten “serious impairment to bodily functions” or “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.” So, for example, if a pregnant patient arrives at a hospital emergency room with a medical condition that could destroy her uterus but that does not threaten her life, EMTALA generally requires that hospital to perform an abortion if the patient’s doctors determine that an abortion is the appropriate treatment to prevent this outcome and if the patient consents to this medical procedure. The Constitution, moreover, provides that federal law “shall be the supreme Law of the Land,” meaning that it preempts any state law that conflicts with it. EMTALA also contains a provision stating that state and local laws must give way “to the extent that the [state law] directly conflicts with a requirement of this section.” So Idaho and Moyle are easy cases. There is a federal statute that explicitly requires most Idaho hospitals to stabilize “any individual” who presents with an emergency medical condition. The law contains no exception for patients who require an abortion to stabilize their condition. And the law explicitly states that Idaho’s laws must give way, to the extent that they conflict with EMTALA. The Idaho officials seeking to reinstate the state’s strict abortion ban make two arguments in favor of allowing their state to continue to ban abortions that are protected by federal law. First, the state’s lawyers point to a provision of federal Medicare law that says EMTALA should not be read “to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided.” They claim that this provision prevents EMTALA from being read to require hospitals to provide care that is not permitted under state law. But, as the DOJ explains in its brief to the justices, this provision has nothing at all to say about whether EMTALA limits Idaho’s abortion ban. For one thing, this provision only applies to “any Federal officer or employee.” As the DOJ explains, “EMTALA’s stabilization obligation was enacted by Congress, not imposed by a ‘Federal officer or employee.’” Additionally, the purpose of this provision is not to safeguard state bans on certain medical procedures. It is to prevent federal officials from second-guessing medical decisions made by doctors and their patients. But the DOJ does not argue that EMTALA requires doctors to perform abortions when they deem those abortions unnecessary. It merely provides that, when a doctor doesdetermine that an abortion is medically necessary and the patient consents to that treatment, then the hospital must provide it. Idaho’s lawyers also point to provisions of EMTALA that often require a hospital to stabilize a pregnant patient’s “unborn child,” if the fetus is also experiencing a medical emergency. Idaho’s interpretation of these provisions is stark: “EMTALA’s regard for the unborn child’s life and health precludes interpreting it as a mandate to kill that child.” This apparent tension in the EMTALA statute is resolved by a provision that lays out each hospital’s precise obligations under the law. A hospital is not required to perform an abortion against a patient’s wishes. Nor does it require the hospital to choose who lives and who dies in a tragic case where either the mother or the fetus will die no matter what treatment is provided. Rather, EMTALA states that a hospital meets its obligations if it “offers” the patient stabilizing treatment and informs that patient “of the risks and benefits to the individual of such examination and treatment.” So, in the sad case where a patient is forced to choose between an abortion, which would stabilize their own medical condition, or a treatment that would save their fetus but leave them at risk, EMTALA requires a hospital to offer the patient either treatment and to explain the terrible choice the patient must make. And then it requires the hospital to honor the patient’s choice. What EMTALA does not do is express a preference between treating a pregnant patient or treating that patient’s “unborn child.” That choice rests with the patient and the patient alone (or, if the patient is unable to make this decision, with “a person acting on the [patient’s] behalf,” such as their next of kin). All of which is a long way of saying that Idaho and Moyle should be very easy cases. The statute is quite clear that most Idaho hospitals must provide medically necessary abortions. The only question is whether this Supreme Court will follow the text of the law.",https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/12/4/23984674/supreme-court-abortion-emtala-emergency-medically-necessary-idaho,11808
The Supreme Court’s likely to make it more dangerous to be pregnant in a red state,Ian Millhiser,2024-04-24T18:00:00+00:00,"A federal law requires most US hospitals to provide an abortion to patients experiencing a medical emergency if an abortion is the proper medical treatment for that emergency. This law is unambiguous, and it applies even in red states with strict abortion bans that prohibit the procedure even when necessary to save a patient’s life or protect their health. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court spent Wednesday morning discussing whether to write a new exception into this federal law, which would permit states to ban abortions even when a patient will die if they do not receive one. Broadly speaking, the Court seemed to divide into three camps during Wednesday’s argument in Moyle v. United States. The Court’s three Democrats, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, all argued — quite forcefully at times — that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) means what it says and thus nearly all hospitals must provide emergency abortions. Meanwhile, the Court’s right flank — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch — left no doubt that they will do whatever it takes to permit states to ban medically necessary abortions. That left three of the Court’s Republicans, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, in the middle. Kavanaugh and Barrett both asked questions that very much suggest they want states to be able to ban medically necessary abortions. But they also appeared to recognize, at times, that the arguments supporting such an outcome are far from airtight. Realistically, it is highly unlikely that EMTALA will survive the Court’s Moyle decision intact. The Court already voted last January to temporarily allow the state of Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, despite EMTALA, while this case was pending before the justices. And Kavanaugh and Barrett have both taken extraordinary liberties with the law in the past when necessary to achieve an anti-abortion outcome. Still, federal law is crystal clear that states cannot outright ban medically necessary abortions. So there is a chance that two of the Court’s Republicans will reluctantly conclude that they are bound by the law’s clear text. EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms that accept Medicare funding to provide “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” of “any individual” who arrives at the hospital’s ER with an “emergency medical condition.” Though the law does not specifically mention abortion, it is written in capacious terms. So, if a patient has an “emergency medical condition” and the proper treatment to stabilize that condition is an abortion, the hospital must provide an abortion. Though the law only applies to Medicare-funded hospitals, that’s nearly all hospitals because Medicare provides health coverage to Americans over the age of 65. EMTALA conflicts with an Idaho law that bans abortions in nearly all circumstances. While Idaho permits an abortion when “necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman,” it does not permit such an abortion if the patient faces a catastrophic health consequence other than death, such as the loss of her uterus. EMTALA requires emergency rooms to stabilize any patient who is at risk of “serious impairment to bodily functions,” “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part,” or other nonfatal consequences that are defined as medical emergencies by EMTALA. So the federal law applies in many cases where the patient is not at risk of death. Additionally, EMTALA includes a provision saying that state and local laws must give way to the federal requirement to stabilize patients “to the extent that the [state law] directly conflicts with a requirement of this section.” So, if the Supreme Court were concerned solely with the text of EMTALA, they would hand down a unanimous decision holding that Idaho’s law is preempted by EMTALA, at least to the extent that Idaho prohibits medically necessary abortions. EMTALA does not purport to override most restrictions on abortion, but its explicit text requires hospitals to perform an abortion when necessary to stabilize a patient’s emergency medical condition. Members of the Court’s Republican majority proposed three possible ways they could try to justify a decision permitting Idaho to ban many medically necessary abortions. The weakest of these three arguments was proposed by Justice Samuel Alito, author of the Court’s 2022 decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. Alito pointed to a provision of EMTALA that requires hospitals to also offer stabilizing care to a pregnant patient’s “unborn child” if a medical emergency threatens the fetus’s life, though Alito did not really make a legal argument. He just expressed indignation at the very idea that a statute that uses the words “unborn child” could possibly require abortions in any circumstances. “Isn’t that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions?” Alito asked US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. As Prelogar told Alito, EMTALA reconciles the dual obligations it imposes on hospitals to treat both a pregnant patient and the patient’s fetus by only requiring the hospital to “offer” stabilizing care for both patients — so, in the tragic case where only the mother or the fetus could be saved, the hospital must offer both treatments and honor the mother’s choice. A second argument for limiting EMTALA, which was at times floated by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett, is that reading the statute according to its actual text would raise a constitutional problem. EMTALA imposes an obligation on hospitals that accept Medicare funds, and the Supreme Court has long held that Congress may impose requirements on parties that voluntarily accept federal funding. The constitutional argument is that Congress could not use federal funding provided to a private hospital to neutralize a state ban on abortion because the state of Idaho must also consent to having its law altered in this way. There is some case law that provides theoretical support for this argument, but the bulk of the Court’s case law already establishes that a federal grant program that provides money to private parties may displace state law. Thus, for example, in Coventry Health Care v. Nevils(2017), the Court held that the federal government’s decision to offer its own employees health plans that violate Missouri law preempts that state law. And in Bennett v. Arkansas (1988), the Court held that federal Social Security law overrides an Arkansas law that allowed the state to seize an incarcerated person’s Social Security benefits. The Court could conceivably repudiate precedents like Coventry and Bennett, but that would have unpredictable consequences for all sorts of federal programs. Federal spending programs like Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid are riddled with provisions that might conflict with one state law or another. And if the Supreme Court declares that these state law provisions overcome federal Medicare, Social Security, or Medicaid law, that is likely to disrupt those and other programs in erratic ways. That leaves one other way to achieve an anti-abortion outcome in the Moyle case, whose biggest proponent was Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh noted that Idaho has weakened its abortion ban since this litigation began and that it’s done so in ways that theoretically make it easier for doctors to claim that they needed to perform an abortion to protect a patient’s life. In light of these changes, he suggested that maybe “there shouldn’t be an injunction” against Idaho because it’s not clear that the state’s law still conflicts with EMTALA. But this argument is hard to square with the facts on the ground in Idaho. As Justice Kagan pointed out close to the end of the argument, hospitals in Idaho are still so uncertain when they can perform an abortion that many of them are flying patients to other states. She noted that just one Idaho hospital had to do so six times so that those patients could receive an emergency abortion in a location where everyone could be sure it was legal. Idaho’s lawyer, moreover, struggled so hard to explain when Idaho’s law permits a doctor to perform a medically necessary abortion that Barrett accused him of “hedging.” Kavanaugh’s argument, in other words, would require the justices to ignore what’s happening in Idaho and to pretend that Idaho is somehow complying with EMTALA, despite the fact that Idaho’s own lawyer could not explain how its abortion ban works. So the ultimate question looming over the Moyle case is whether two of the Court’s Republican appointees will be so troubled by the weakness of the anti-abortion arguments in this case, and so embarrassed by the fact that there’s really only one plausible way to read EMTALA, that they will begrudgingly apply the law as written. That’s not the most likely outcome in this case. But, at the very least, the Court’s Republican majority does not appear to have settled on a way to explain a decision creating an abortion exception to the EMTALA statute.",https://www.vox.com/scotus/24139251/supreme-court-abortion-emtala-idaho-united-states-moyle,11808
One Texas case shows why women can’t rely on legal exceptions to abortion bans,Li Zhou,2023-12-12T16:35:00+00:00,"The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against Kate Cox, a 31-year-old woman who sought an abortion in the state. Previously, Cox argued that the lethal condition impacting her fetus and health risks she’d face during the pregnancy meant she qualified for the exemptions outlined in Texas’s abortion ban. The court decision, which comes after Cox left Texas to obtain an abortion, sets a disturbing new precedent in a state that already has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country. It’s a notable ruling because it further narrows what Texas law considers medical exceptions to its abortion ban, and could have implications for other states with similar policies. Currently, abortion is broadly banned in the state, and there are limited exceptions for conditions that endanger the life of the mother or that cause “substantial impairment” of bodily functions. Given how opaque the law is, it was not clear exactly what those exceptions entailed, and though the court didn’t explicitly clarify that ambiguity in its ruling, its decision suggests that health challenges like those Cox faced — including risks to future pregnancies — don’t qualify for the exemption. “Some difficulties in pregnancy … even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses,” the court concluded, noting that Cox’s doctor hadn’t effectively affirmed that the complications she could face — including threats to future fertility — reached the threshold for an exception to the ban. The justices also maintained existing uncertainty when it came to providers’ prerogative to conduct abortions in the state. Some providers have refrained from giving abortion care due to fear of legal consequences: Medical professionals found in violation of Texas’s abortion law can face up to 99 years in prison as well as large fines, while those who are found to have aided in providing abortion access can face civil suits. The court ruled that the decision about whether a condition constituted a medical emergency, and thus qualified for an exemption, should be left up to physicians and not the courts. “Under the law, it is a doctor who must decide that a woman is suffering from a life-threatening condition during a pregnancy, raising the necessity for an abortion to save her life or to prevent impairment of a major bodily function,” the decision reads. The court didn’t resolve the legal tension inherent in the fact that Cox’s doctor felt an abortion was warranted in her case while the court said it was not. “The court is trying to get out of the business of construing the Texas abortion statute, but by doing so, it simply leaves the statute in place to continue deterring doctors from taking a risk that might end their practice,” Northeastern University law professor Martha Davis tells Vox. The ruling — and the legal challenges Cox endured — make clear that any exceptions to the Texas ban are extremely restrictive, and suggest future attempts to get an abortion by petitioning the courts could be struck down in the state. It’s also the latest in a series of cases that highlight how abortion bans disregard serious health risks that women face, and how they establish a confusing legal minefield for patients and providers. Earlier this month, Cox, a mother of two, requested an emergency abortion because her fetus had been diagnosed with a lethal genetic condition called Trisomy 18. The condition frequently means that fetuses don’t survive to full term or that pregnancies result in stillbirths. Cox has spoken about being devastated by this news and how she feared that carrying the pregnancy to term would endanger her future fertility. “An abortion was not something I ever imagined I would want or need,” Cox — who was 20 weeks pregnant — wrote in an op-ed in the Dallas Morning News published last week. “I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health, for parenting my children, and for a future pregnancy.” During a Thursday court hearing, Molly Duane, one of Cox’s attorneys, emphasized that Cox is at “high risk for multiple pregnancy complications, including hypertension, gestational diabetes, and infection.” Because both of Cox’s prior pregnancies resulted in cesarean sections, she’d likely need a third surgery if she carried this fetus to term, increasing her risk of complications. After hearing these arguments, district court Judge Maya Guerra Gamble approved a temporary restraining order allowing an exception to the state’s ban, which would have enabled Cox to receive an abortion and protect the physician performing it. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, however, filed a petition to stay the district judge’s order. In it, he argued that Cox hadn’t demonstrated that she was navigating a “life-threatening” medical condition, or that the complications she would endure put her at risk of major bodily harm. The Supreme Court issued the requested stay, which meant that Cox was effectively in limbo until the panel made its ruling on the order. Additionally, Paxton emphasized that any physicians who performed the procedure for Cox in Texas could face felony prosecution. Because of how urgent her health concerns were, Cox left the state to obtain an abortion on Monday. “This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate. Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer,” said Nancy Northup, the head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox. The Texas Supreme Court ultimately issued its ruling on the case after Cox had already left the state on Monday night. Cox’s case could have a number of legal implications. Prior to Cox, no pregnant patients had brought their case to court in an attempt to obtain an abortion since Roe was overturned, something that experts see happening more on a national basis moving forward. Whether this approach will be effective in other states remains to be seen. “It may set a precedent for a new way individual plaintiffs can challenge abortion bans. To date, we’ve seen cases focused on harms experienced in the past — cases that argue that state laws are unworkable or unconstitutional or both,” says UC Davis law professor Mary Ziegler. “This is the first case in which we’ve seen a plaintiff seek a court-ordered abortion since Dobbs, but it will not likely be the last.” In Texas, the case also suggests that abortions in circumstances similar to Cox’s could remain illegal, highlighting just how hollow and limited medical exceptions are. “It … reveals just how ineffective the ‘health and life’ exceptions to abortion bans are in practice,” Wake Forest law professor Meghan Boone told Vox. “If doctors cannot reasonably interpret these exceptions, they will understandably refrain from providing care — even when they believe it would be the correct treatment for their patient.” The state’s primary goal, Aziza Ahmed, a Boston University law professor, told Vox, is “to ensure that the medical exceptions are read narrowly,” a result that Boone argues will “further hamper the already extremely limited ability of pregnant people to access care when they need it.”",https://www.vox.com/23997727/kate-cox-texas-abortion-ban,11808
Let’s talk about Cecily Strong’s game-changing “clown abortion” skit,Aja Romano,2021-11-09T19:20:00+00:00,"There’s an idea, particularly popular with some comedians, that the very point of comedy is to say the unsayable, to push boundaries and envelopes by articulating uncomfortable truths. Dave Chappelle embodied this recently in his controversial Netflix comedy special The Closer, his sixth for the streaming giant in which he (once again) takes up the question of how we should treat trans people and concludes (once again) that the answer is “none too carefully.” Saying the presumably unsayable is often the milieu of male comics such as Joe Rogan (whose 2016 Netflix special was called Triggered) or Bill Burr (whose last special was titled Paper Tiger). For the most part, comedy titan Saturday Night Live has sidestepped that tendency, sticking to its long-running habit of doing straightforward comedic imitations and letting the real-life, absurdist politics speak for themselves under cover of parody — until this past weekend. Cast member Cecily Strong’s recent “clown abortion” sketch for “Weekend Update” — in which she plays “Goober the Clown,” a red-nose-wearing balloon-animal maker under pressure to discuss her abortion thanks to Texas’s debilitating ban on abortions after six weeks — may well go down as one of the starkest political critiques in the show’s recent history. What becomes clear over the course of the bit is that this may well be Strong’s own personal anecdote, too. As it’s related between clown gags, it’s a reminder that some things do go unsaid in American life, but they might not be the ones we hear the usual suspects yell about. Throughout the skit, Strong ineffectually tries to clown — her spinning bow tie winds up tilting vertically, her attempt at making a balloon animal results in failure, and her clown horn refuses to honk. This plays out alongside her visible agitation over being a “clown” who must continually discuss abortion because of increasingly restrictive abortion legislation around the country. The effect is twofold: As she continues the sketch, the words “clown abortion” become increasingly discomfiting and absurd, arguably highlighting the absurdity of extreme anti-abortion rhetoric. The clown conceit itself becomes increasingly flimsy and hard to maintain. When she realizes her horn isn’t working, she riffs for a few seconds, then apparently ad-libs “I’m not a clown” before soldiering on. The admission, tossed out as an aside, lands like a small explosion, a sobering release of tension. Rattling off her story in between fun clown gags, Strong discusses the unnecessary gravitas attached to the entire subject and the shame and stigmatizing effects it has on women. She points out that “one in three clowns” will have a clown abortion in their lifetime, but that we don’t know that because most of her peers “won’t even talk to other clowns about it.” When they’re able to — despite the barriers in place — there’s a real kind of relief and communion, and the retelling of her experience seems cathartic. The tone of the sketch shifts into a gentle reminder that the abortion debate impacts real people, human beings whose voices and stories are rarely heard as the war over their bodies rages on around them. On one level, Strong’s sketch plays directly into the hands of people who think modern comedy has lost its edge — that woke culture has changed the art form into humorless political lectures. But on another level, Strong arguably shows that comedy can not only withstand the political lectures but also be made stronger by them, if done well. There’s something about the phrase “clown abortion” that inevitably evokes laughter. If anything, the contrast between Strong’s clown antics and the topic she’s discussing, along with her clear emotional investment in the narrative (and, perhaps, some degree of personal discomfort), becomes a way to emphasize the serious stakes for people who lack access to safe abortions. Strong’s final joke — “The last thing anyone wants is a bunch of dead clowns in a dark alley!” — is barbed and hilarious. The entire skit, from the way Strong wrestles with her props to the actual jokes themselves, strikes an uncomfortably raucous note. We’re laughing, but the more we laugh, the more uncomfortable we are, which just drives home the rawness of the subject under discussion. The sketch unforgettably illustrates that we’re sometimes pushed to treat abortion like something unspeakable, a tragedy or a mark of permanent shame (or both). In an environment where a topic is so stigmatized that having reasoned debate around it becomes impossible, the addition of clown goggles and a spinning bow tie highlights how ludicrous the controversy has become — all while making us laugh despite ourselves. The sketch also doubles as a response to the Chappelle philosophy of comedy. He and many other comedians have argued passionately that the targets of a joke need to learn to laugh at themselves even when the quip is cruel and dehumanizing. But Strong frames the sketch around the concept of empathy and kindness, using something her — sorry, Goober’s — abortion doctor told her. It’s her “favorite joke,” she says, a warm-hearted zinger about how relatively early she was in her pregnancy (“Did you get pregnant on the way over?” the doctor asked.) It’s not “a funny ha ha” kind of humor, she clarifies, but a “funny ‘you’re not an awful person and your life isn’t over’ kind of joke — the best kind.” The best kind indeed. There’s nothing dehumanizing about Strong’s performance, even though she does it in a clown suit. It’s not “funny ha ha” humor, but humor that spotlights the vulnerability and humanity of the comedian and her audience. It’s something unsaid that we could stand to say more often.",https://www.vox.com/culture/2021/11/9/22772533/saturday-night-live-goober-the-clown-abortion-cecily-strong,11808
"Joe Biden’s evolution on abortion, explained",Anna North,2019-06-07T15:11:50+00:00,"Joe Biden’s positions on abortion have evolved over time, and recently, they seem to be changing at an increasingly rapid rate. The latest shift happened on Thursday, when the presidential candidate announced that he no longer supports a ban on government funding for abortion. The Biden campaign told NBC News earlier this week that the former vice president didsupport the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for the procedure in most cases— a position that put him at odds with most of the 2020 Democratic field. But at a gala in Atlanta on Thursday night, Biden said that recent moves to restrict abortion at the state level had caused him to change his position. “I can’t justify leaving millions of women without the health care they need,” he said, according to HuffPost. “If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support [the amendment].” Though the Biden campaign characterized the candidate’s new position as a response to recent near-total bans on abortion at the state level, it’s not clear how allowing federal funding for abortions would mitigate the effects of those state laws. If abortion is banned in states like Alabama, residents wouldn’t be able to access the procedure, and the question of who pays for it would be moot. Reproductive rights groups applauded Biden’s shift, but others criticized the reversal, with some noting that Biden campaign spokespeople were defending the candidate’s support for Hyde on television mere hours before he announced the change. Given his already-checkered history on abortion — he once voted for an amendment to allow states to overturn Roe v. Wade — some may see the change as too little, too late. It is, however, significant that a centrist Democrat like Biden has now come out against Hyde. That shows that calling for a repeal of the amendment has become a mainstream position in the Democratic Party, something that was hard to imagine even five years ago. Given that, Biden’s shift may say more about Democrats’ changing position on abortion rights than it does about the candidate’s own views. The Hyde Amendment, first passed in 1976, bans federal funding for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the pregnant patient. The exceptions for rape and incest were added in 1993, when Bill Clinton was president. As a senator in the 1970s and ’80s, Biden supported the federal funding ban and opposed efforts to add the rape and incest exceptions, according to NBC. Biden’s positions on abortion have changed over time. A Catholic who has said he is “personally opposed to abortion,” he voted in the early 1980s in favor of a constitutional amendment to allow states to overturn Roe v. Wade. But more recently, he has expressed support for Roe, calling it in a 2007 interview “the only means by which, in this heterogeneous society of ours, we can reach some general accommodation on what is a religiously charged and a publicly charged debate.” Campaign spokesperson Bill Russo told the New York Times earlier this year that Biden supports Roe, but would not say whether he still supports the ban on federal funding for abortions. On Wednesday, the campaign told NBC News, and confirmed to Vox, that Biden still supported the Hyde Amendment. The campaign told Vox that if recent efforts to restrict abortion access — including near-total bans on abortion in Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and elsewhere — succeed, Biden would be open to repealing Hyde. On Thursday, Biden reversed course,announcing that he no longer supports the amendment. “State after state, including Georgia, are passing extreme laws in clear violation of the constitutional right protected by Roe ― some going so far as to deny exceptions even for rape and incest,” Jamal Brown, national press secretary for the Biden campaign, told HuffPost. “It’s clear these folks will stop at nothing to get rid of Roe ― and it’s clear we have to be just as strong in our defense of it.” None of the near-total bans on abortion passed in recent months have gone into effect yet, and all have been or are likely to be challenged in court. But if they do take effect, abortion would be banned in the affected states as early as six weeks into pregnancy — or, in Alabama, at all stages of pregnancy, with few exceptions. It’s not clear how allowing federal funding for abortions would help patients in that event, since the procedure would be banned in nearly all cases — paying for it would no longer be the issue. A spokesperson for the campaign could not clarify on Wednesday how Biden saw a repeal of Hyde impacting patients in the event of near-total bans at the state level. Biden’s change of position on the Hyde amendment marks a bigger shift in Democratic politics. Supporters of the amendment argue that taxpayer funding shouldn’t be used to pay for abortions. But opponents argue that the amendment, which bans Medicaid coverage for most abortions, creates a two-tiered system where middle-class and affluent patients can access the procedure and poorer patients cannot. The amendment, which is popular in polls, was long regarded as untouchable by Democratic candidates. But more recently, thanks in part to grassroots activism arguing that abortion needs to be not just legal but affordable, candidates have begun calling for repeal. Hillary Clinton did so in 2016, and a number of Democrats, including Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren, have done so this year. Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized Biden’s position on Wednesday. Reproductive rights groups praised Biden on Thursday for getting in line with an emerging consensus within the Democratic Party. “We’re glad that Joe Biden listened to the voices of millions of women and further clarified his position on the Hyde Amendment,” Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement on Thursday. “We’re pleased that Joe Biden has joined the rest of the 2020 Democratic field in coalescing around the Party’s core values — support for abortion rights, and the basic truth that reproductive freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of equality and economic security in this country.” Biden does support codifying Roe in state law, so that federal protections for abortion will stand even if the decision is overturned, Brown, the Biden campaign national press secretary, told Vox. “Vice President Biden believes we must protect the progress we’ve made and has called on codifying the decision in Roe to ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor,” he said. A number of other Democratic candidates, including Gillibrand and Warren, have also called for legislation codifying Roe. Abortion opponents, meanwhile, criticized Biden’s change of position on Hyde. “Joe Biden’s support for taxpayer funding of abortion after decades of opposition is just the latest example of Democratic extremism on abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, in a Friday statement. “Long gone are the days of ‘safe, legal, and rare.’” She was referring to statements made by Bill Clinton in 1992, and Hillary Clinton in 2008, that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare.” While some statements accusing Democrats of extremism on abortion have been misleading, it’s true that the party has indeed moved on from “safe, legal, and rare” and is coalescing around a position that requires abortion to be not just legal but affordable to all. Biden’s shift is the latest evidence of that.",https://www.vox.com/2019/6/5/18653660/joe-biden-hyde-amendment-bernie-sanders-2020,11808
How TV lied about abortion,Tanya Melendez,2021-10-14T15:20:00+00:00,"In the second season of Mad Men, perpetually desperate Harry Crane needs to prove himself useful to his colleagues at Sterling Cooper. When he hears the CBS drama The Defenders is losing advertisers because of an abortion plot line — a 1962 real-world event — he tries to convince a lipstick company to buy airtime. The Belle Jolie executive balks at “entering the debate,” leaving Harry aghast at the lack of foresight. “Women,” he says incredulously, “will be watching!” He was right, but so was the Belle Jolie exec. For decades, abortion on television was largely depicted as a debate in narrative form, one that pitted melodramatic anti- and pro-abortion rights stances against each other through characters audiences knew and loved. Gretchen Sisson and Katrina Kimport, researchers at the University of California San Francisco, argued in 2014 that, over time, these narratives collectively created “common cultural ideas about what pregnancy, abortion, and women seeking abortion are like.” The result, according to Sisson and Kimport, was an inaccurate picture of who seeks abortions, and why. Fictional abortions were also overdramatized. From the origins of television all the way through the past decade, overwhelmingly male TV writers created plot lines that framed abortion as a moral issue, amping up conflict for maximum emotional journeys. It isn’t hyperbolic to say that television significantly changed the way America understood abortion and, as a result, deeply influenced public policy. Andrea Press, a communications professor who documented this relationship in a 1991 study, concluded that “when the moral language adopted by television differs from that of viewers, television viewing influences viewers to adopt its terms.” The medium is not a passive bystander in our social debates; it is an active participant, shaping attitudes and action. In other words, the stories we see on TV help create who we are. Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. In fact, the beginning of the end of accessible abortion in Texas began with a story. On May 5, 2021, state Rep. Shelby Slawson introduced Senate Bill 8, a law that the Supreme Court allowed to go into effect that bans abortion after six weeks, by telling her mother’s pregnancy story. Doctors had believed the fetus was developing abnormally, but Slawson’s mother chose to carry to term after hearing the fetal heartbeat. Slawson concluded, “Forty-four years later, that little baby girl is standing in this chamber.” Narratives like these are common in hearings happening in the many state legislatures considering abortion restrictions in 2021. Abortion rights activists have also embraced the power of storytelling as a strategic tool, launching hashtags, Instagram accounts, websites, podcasts, and more to encourage women to share their abortion stories in the hope of swaying the public to their side. Yet for all those thousands of competing real-life tales, none has been or will be as widely told as the television abortion narrative. Looking back on how abortion came into our living rooms starting in the 1960s and persisted into our audience-fragmented streaming era can teach us how these stories taught, shaped, and contributed to today’s public discourse about abortion. From the first broadcast in 1928 through 1980, only two abortions seem to have happened in all of primetime television. The Defenders was the first series to mention abortion, although the procedure did not include a main character. Then, in 1972, came Maude. Writers for the Bea Arthur show only included the plot because they wanted to win a $10,000 contest prize for storytelling from an organization called Zero Population Growth. Original drafts focused on vasectomies, but showrunner Norman Lear wanted his main character to carry the humor, so writers switched to the now-legendary tale. An estimated 65 million people, or nearly one-third of the American population at the time, watched as 47-year-old married grandmother Maude discovered she was unexpectedly expecting and debated whether to keep the pregnancy. In the end, Maude had an abortion. Off camera, yes. Never mentioned on the show again? Also yes — but it happened. A main character wouldn’t make that choice again for a very long time. The 1980s saw an increase in television that embraced more realistic storytelling, bolstered by eager audiences and more relaxed social mores. Issues like breast cancer, domestic violence, single motherhood, rape, working life, dating, and abortion were all explored from 8 to 11 pm. But the business of television relied on advertiser support, and programs couldn’t upset their sponsors or their conservative viewers any more in 1982 than they could in 1962. After all, Catholics buy cars, too. Since narratives are driven by conflict, in an abortion plot line writers typically used the choice itself to drive the story. This approach created high-stakes, emotionally driven drama around making the decision and framed having an abortion as the worst possible outcome of pregnancy. It also established an inaccurate profile of a typical abortion seeker by linking the procedure to a particular archetype: typically young, white, and middle-class or affluent women who had no other children and who rarely struggled to find an abortion provider. The real story is vastly different. Many abortion seekers are women of color, religiously affiliated, and already have children, and in recent years most are low-income or below the federal poverty line. That’s not what we saw on our screens. Instead, for roughly 20 years — from 1980 to 2000, with a few early-aughts examples joining in — three major abortion plot lines dominated TV. Family (1980), Call to Glory (1984), Spenser for Hire (1985), Webster (1985), MacGruder and Loud (1985), Dallas (1985), 21 Jump Street (1988), A Different World (1989), Melrose Place (1992), Roseanne (1990), Party of Five (1996), Grey’s Anatomy (2005) This trope — in which a character considering an abortion avoids the difficult decision due to either a miscarriage or a false positive — gestured toward pro-abortion-rights viewpoints while simultaneously making sure that no main character actually had to go through with the procedure. Party of Five did a classic version of this plot. In “Before and After,” which aired in 1996, 16-year-old Julia gets pregnant with her high school boyfriend. Over the next few days, she shares scenes with every other character as each gives their opinion on whether she should have an abortion. Julia’s boyfriend and two brothers are on board with terminating the pregnancy, but her younger sister Claudia is angry because their little brother Owen was also a “mistake.” Julia’s friend Sarah says she can’t support abortion since she is an adoptee who could have been aborted by her birth mother. Throughout the episode, Julia is deeply emotional while weighing her options but ultimately decides she is too young to become a parent and sacrifice her college plans. And then, just hours before her appointment, she miscarries. When her boyfriend expresses “a tiny bit of relief,” Julia protests. She is relieved, too, but still feels guilty for wanting the abortion at all. Co-creator of Party of Five Amy Lippman later told New York magazine that the episode’s original script included Julia receiving her abortion, but the show’s network, Fox, vetoed that ending. As Lippman put it, “That was distressing to us because we thought there was real value in showing what a character in that family under those circumstances would do.” Instead, Julia’s story framed a miscarriage or false positive as a relief because it allowed the woman to avoid making the choice at all, preserving her innocence and morality. Melrose Place (1992), Murphy Brown (1992), Beverly Hills, 90210 (1994), Roseanne (1994), Felicity (2000), Sex and the City (2001), Scrubs (2006), ER (2006), Weeds (2009), Sons of Anarchy (2010), Mad Men (2010), True Blood (2010) Characters getting pregnant or having babies can add exciting new avenues for storytelling, and this was especially true for shows that centered more complex, nuanced female characters in the 1990s and early 2000s. Here, TV attempted to have their feminist cake and eat it, too: Familiar characters were given the space to express and explore viewpoints that support abortion rights, but by them eventually relenting to parenthood, showrunners could still have the comedy of watching Murphy Brown navigate having a baby and doing the news. In execution, these plots often created an unintentional binary that sanctified motherhood and villainized abortion. In “Thanksgiving 1994” and “Maybe Baby,” the ’90s sitcom Roseanne tackled unexpected pregnancy from a perspective that in many ways reflected real life. The show’s title character was a white mother of three from a lower socioeconomic status, and the Guttmacher Institute confirms that in 1994 the majority of abortion seekers already had children, worked, and had not completed college. About half made less than $55,000 per year in today’s dollars. This approach created high-stakes, emotionally driven drama around making the decision and framed having an abortion as the worst possible outcome of pregnancy “Thanksgiving 1994” opens with a bit of foreshadowing as Roseanne establishes her perspective by pranking anti-abortion protesters outside a clinic. The 40-year-old is there to find out the sex of an unexpected pregnancy, but the unclear results of the test signal a potential developmental issue that will need to be confirmed by a second amniocentesis. While Roseanne and her husband Dan had previously agreed that they would abort an abnormal fetus, Roseanne immediately becomes unsure about the decision, telling her sister, “I heard the heartbeat. I always thought I could have the abortion, but now I don’t know if I can.” Roseanne’s ambivalence causes conflict with Dan, but by the end of “Maybe Baby,” a second test shows a normally developing fetus and abortion is no longer discussed as an option. Baby Jerry arrives the following season, during Roseanne’s Halloween special. Communication researcher Celeste Condit emphasizes that despite such plots articulating positions of choice, most of them “explicitly highlighted the values of childbearing, family, and mothering in the face of the potential threat to these values abortion represents.” The message is that abortion is the enemy of motherhood, and motherhood is the natural desire of women. The Facts of Life (1982), Cagney & Lacey (1985), Hill Street Blues (1985), St. Elsewhere (1986), 21 Jump Street (1988), China Beach (1990), Beverly Hills, 90210 (1996) Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, many television shows endorsed a position on a variety of social issues through their characters, making it clear they considered one side “right.” Topics such as race, gender equality, rape, HIV/AIDS, sexuality, addiction, mental illness, and more were all explored in primetime, typically in progressive fashion, and eventually, society moved toward those beliefs. Whether it was Tom Hanks playing Elyse Keaton’s alcoholic brother on Family Ties, Ellen DeGeneres coming out in “The Puppy Episode” on her eponymous sitcom, Denzel Washington navigating racism as a doctor on St. Elsewhere, Chad Lowe playing an HIV-positive character on Life Goes On, or the late, great Dixie Carter’s Julia Sugarbaker delivering a stinging monologue about workplace sexual harassment on Designing Women, shows were not shy in writing strong, clear messages about where they stood on the biggest social debates of our time. Except abortion. Those stories went out of their way to show “both sides” in the best possible light. One of the most vivid examples comes courtesy of the CBS crime procedural Cagney & Lacey, in the show’s 1985 episode “The Clinic.” Detectives Christine Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey — who is pregnant — are charged with helping a married Latina woman, Mrs. Herrera, cross a violent picket line at an abortion clinic. Mrs. Herrera wants an abortion so that she can continue attending business school and avoid needing to rely on government assistance programs. The clinic is bombed by a violent anti-abortion protester, killing another patient. The bomber threatens to kill the two detectives and herself, but stops when she learns that Lacey is pregnant. The right to disagree with a woman’s choice was depicted as equal in value to the purposeful attempt to stop her from making that choice — a dangerous false equivalency On the side of abortion rights: Mrs. Herrera, obviously, but also a doctor who argues for victims of rape, incest, and desperate circumstances. Lacey also firmly supports abortion rights, and is revealed to have had an abortion in Puerto Rico as a teenager. On the anti-abortion side: Cagney questions the morality of the procedure, and her Catholic father is vehemently against it when they discuss the case. The detectives also meet the leader of an anti-abortion group, presented as reasonable and nonviolent, who compares her work to preventing the Holocaust. After the episode came under fire from some viewers, the network issued a statement that read in part, “CBS’s program-practices department has carefully reviewed this episode and feels it presents a balanced view of the issue.” Indeed it was! The score was a carefully calibrated 3 to 3, a “both sides” balancing act. The right to disagree with a woman’s choice was depicted as equal in value to the purposeful attempt to stop her from making that choice — a dangerous false equivalency. These three tropes couched abortion in terms of high moral conflict, making for good stories but inaccurate portrayals. Abortion was frequently represented as medically dangerous, as happening much more rarely than in actuality, and as mostly sought by demographics that don’t match national trends. Meanwhile, the complex elements of real public discourse were oversimplified into a pro/anti debate, where “reasonable” people on both sides framed the issue in moral terminologies. Abortion was shown as morally ambiguous, a necessary evil, regrettable, a consequence, a binary choice against parenthood, and/or reserved for specific examples of desperate need. Offscreen, this morality framework helped challenge a pregnant person’s right to the power of choice, creating a blueprint for how to take a private medical decision away from individuals and make it open to debate, because morality can be debated and judged in a way that medicine and access to medicine cannot. Like we saw on Party of Five, everyone gets a turn to give their opinion. Like we saw on Roseanne, it’s assumed all women are hardwired to want motherhood. Like we saw on Cagney & Lacey, “both sides” get equal time. These are the stories we’ve seen and heard over and over again, and now they are canon. In the early 2000s, some changes did come to abortion storytelling. Bird on Showtime’s Soul Food (2003) and Claire on HBO’s Six Feet Under (2003) both had abortions that were remarkable for their straightforwardness and centering of the characters’ desires. Becky’s abortion on NBC and DirecTV’s Friday Night Lights (2010) was a refreshingly honest look at a teenager’s options in a small town and what impact a supportive adult could have (if only everyone had a Mrs. Coach to guide them!). Notably, however, almost those examples all aired on cable/satellite. Broadcast would largely have to wait for the Power of Shonda Rhimes. In a 2011 episode of Rhimes’s hit ABC medical drama Grey’s Anatomy, Dr. Cristina Yang has to struggle to get her partner Owen to understand that she does not want children. She spends most of “Unaccompanied Minor” justifying her position, but by the end, the abortion happens with her partner at her side. Grey’s provided a welcome portrayal of personal agency on primetime. But it was on Scandal that Rhimes radically changed the script. In the 2015 episode “Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” Olivia Pope discovers she is pregnant. This being Scandal, the father is the current president of the United States. Olivia does not tell anyone, and we do not see her schedule the procedure. Instead, there is a one-minute scene where she visits a clean, modern medical facility. She wears a hospital gown and hair cap. The camera looks down and focuses on her face as we hear the vacuum aspiration machine work. The scene is respectful, unapologetic, and medical. Olivia, a Black woman, does not ask for permission or input from anyone, even when the father is the most powerful man in the world. Most critically, Scandal portrayed the procedure and not the decision-making process. The message is clear: A woman’s autonomy is sacrosanct. Soon, other shows like Girls (2015), Jane the Virgin (2016), GLOW (2017), Empire (2018), Veep (2019), and Shrill (2019) — among many others — also showed abortions by main characters that did not dramatize the decision-making process to increase angst or conflict, a fundamental shift. They also portrayed more realistic abortion seekers — people of color, people who already had children, who were in the working class. The television landscape still isn’t perfect, of course. There are still plenty of shows regurgitating the same tired tropes from the 1980s, but it is better … at least onscreen. On December 1, the Supreme Court will consider Mississippi’s restrictive abortion law in a case that directly challenges an individual’s right to control their own reproductive choices. It is not an exaggeration to believe that the United States could soon become a post-Roe nation. Television, the most powerful meaning-making medium of the past 60 years, played a role in getting us here. It also has a role to play moving forward, one that writers and showrunners are increasingly willing to take on — to shape our national understanding of what abortion is, why it matters, and how to protect individuals’ access to reproductive medicine. Because if it is true that stories create us, then there is a future that is being written right now. Whatever that future is, women will be watching.

Most Alabama voters don’t support their state’s exemption-free abortion ban,Rachel Withers,2019-05-18T17:53:50+00:00,"A previously unreleased poll shows that a majority of Alabamians do not support the kind of extreme abortion ban passed by their state legislature this week, AL.com reports, revealing that Alabama lawmakers seem to be out of step even with their own highly conservative electorate. According to the 2018 statewide poll, conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research on behalf of Planned Parenthood, only 31 percent of Alabamians were in favor of an abortion ban that lacks a rape/incest exception. As Vox’s Anna North reported, the ban signed into law by Alabama’s Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday does not have an exception for rape or incest. A minority of respondents said they believe in bans that go further than Alabama’s current law; 15 percent responded that abortion should be illegal in all cases, including in cases in which a pregnancy would threaten the pregnant woman’s life. Slightly more — 16 percent — said abortion should be banned in all cases, except for when a pregnant woman’s life is in danger. Overall, however, the numbers reveal that while a majority of Alabamians do oppose abortion, most believe in a rape or incest exception at the very least (as do most Americans, as Vox’s Anna North explains). The plurality of respondents (29 percent) said abortion should be legal only in cases of rape, incest, or if the life of the woman is in danger; 20 percent said abortion should be legal in most cases, and 16 percent said that abortion should be legal in all cases. In other words, the poll found 65 percent of Alabamians think rape and incest victims should have access to abortion. Even among the most conservative Alabama subgroups, outlawing abortion without an exception for rape and incest has only minority support: Among Republicans, 41 percent of people said there should be no rape or incest exception; 39 percent of Ivey voters and 40 percent of evangelicals said the same. The data, which was originally collected ahead of Alabama’s Amendment 2 vote (on abortion funding and whether the state constitution conferred the right to an abortion) was sent out to “interested parties” in a memo on Wednesday, although it’s not clear why it wasn’t revealed previously. As Vox’s Jane Coaston reported, many anti-abortion conservatives think Alabama’s abortion law goes too far, and that it may actually damage their cause: To be clear, most Republicans oppose legal abortion, though the majority support limitations on abortion that would still permit the procedure in the case of rape or incest. So those expressing alarm about the Alabama bill are doing so because they think the legislation might ultimately prove counterproductive to their cause. Counterproductive because there’s a good chance the law won’t get before the Supreme Court, and because the unpopularity of the law nationally could put anti-abortion advocates on the defensive after, in their view, a decade of wins. While Alabamians may disapprove of the severity of the new abortion ban, it’s clear many still disapprove of abortion in general, as both the survey and the Amendment 2 results show 60 percent think access to abortion should be, at most, limited. They’re not alone. A new YouGov-Cambridge Globalism survey revealed the US has a more negative view of abortion than any other developed country, the Guardian reported. US views on abortion were found to be similar to those in India and Turkey; 46 percent of Americans said they believe abortion is unacceptable, compared to 38 percent who said they find it acceptable. Respondents in India and Turkey said they oppose abortion at 48 and 47 percent, respectively. In Great Britain, 17 percent of respondents said they believe abortion is unacceptable; in Sweden and Denmark, only 10 percent of people were against the procedure.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/18/18630562/alabama-abortion-ban-voters-exemption-for-rape-incest,11808
The astonishing radicalism of Florida’s new ban on abortion,Rachel M. Cohen,2024-04-30T13:37:49+00:00,"In spring 2022, just months before the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republicans in Florida passed a law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, down from the previous legal threshold of 24 weeks. It took effect that summer, but advocates for reproductive rights challenged it in state court as unconstitutional. One year later, Republicans in Florida took even more aggressive action against reproductive freedom: Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a new bill to restrict abortion at six weeks of pregnancy. But the fate of that law rested on what the court would decide about the 15-week ban. If it decided that ban was legal, the six-week ban would be, too. In early April, nearly two years after challengers first filed their lawsuit, the Florida Supreme Court finally issued its ruling: The 15-week ban is constitutional under state law, and therefore the six-week ban would take effect 30 days later, on May 1. In practical terms, six weeks is a total ban. Many people do not even know they’re pregnant by then. Even if they are aware, Florida requires patients seeking abortions to complete two in-person doctor visits with a 24-hour waiting period in between, a challenging logistical burden to meet before 15 weeks and a nearly impossible one before six. Not only will the six-week ban decimate abortion access for Florida residents, but it will also significantly curtail care for people across the South, who have been traveling to Florida from more restrictive states since Roe was overturned. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group, there were 8,940 more abortions in Florida in 2023 compared to 2020—a 12 percent increase that researchers attribute largely to travel from out-of-state patients. Residents of Florida’s bordering states face either a total ban (Alabama) or a six-week ban (Georgia). More broadly, the Guttmacher Institute has found that six-week bans have massive impacts on the provision of abortion. In South Carolina, the number of abortions provided in the formal health care system decreased by 71 percent the month after the state started enforcing a six-week ban on abortions in 2023. Prior research found declines of close to 50 percent in abortion caseloads in Georgia and in Texas after their six-week bans went into effect. When the six-week ban takes effect this week, Florida will become one of the most restrictive states in the country on abortion access. Florida’s law not only bans abortion after six weeks but also bans abortion by telemedicine and requires any medication abortion to be dispensed in person, which effectively outlaws mail orders of the pills. (Researchers have affirmed there is no medical need for abortion pills to be administered in the physical presence of a health care provider.) At the time it was passed, no other statehad a six-week ban with a requirement for two in-person doctor visits and no option for telehealth. While the law includes exceptions for rape and incest, it requires anyone claiming those exceptions to provide a copy of a police report, medical record, or court order — even though victims often do not involve law enforcement. The executive director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence has called these exceptions “meaningless” and “harmful.” Six weeks is simply not enough time for the vast majority of people to get abortion care, especially if remote options are off the table. In medical terms, pregnancy is measured from the date of the last menstrual period, not from the date of conception, and up to 25 percent of women don’t have regular menstrual cycles, meaning a missed period wouldn’t signal anything unusual. It can take at least three weeks for a pregnancy hormone to appear on a home pregnancy test, and while blood tests can also confirm pregnancies, Florida health care professionals testified that it can take weeks to months to get an appointment with an OB-GYN, with wait times particularly long for low-income and Black Floridians. Once a pregnancy is confirmed, a patient, under Florida law, would need to schedule an ultrasound with an abortion provider. Scheduling these appointments takes even more time. Annie Filkowski, the policy director of Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, told Vox in 2023 that wait times at their clinics average about 20 days. These barriers would prove virtually insurmountable for most people, and even harder for minors in Florida, who are required by law to either get parental consent to end a pregnancy or petition a judge to bypass their parents. The Republican state senatorwho sponsored the six-week ban, Erin Grall, conceded a teenager would be unlikely to go through that legal process within six weeks. “I think the purpose of this bill is to say that when there is life, we are going to protect it,” Grall said. “There are 4.6 million women of reproductive age in Florida, along with trans and nonbinary people who may need an abortion,” said Kelly Baden, the vice president of public policy at the Guttmacher Institute. “With the regional clustering of bans in neighboring and nearby states, Floridians will have to travel across at least two state lines to get care after six weeks.” Kris Lawler, the board president of the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, announced Monday that their network stands ready to help people access care in the wake of this decision. “Abortion is essential healthcare, and while they might make it significantly harder to do so, no politician can stop us from accessing our basic right to abortion,” they said. The abortion bans in Florida will add strain to an already restrictive landscape that people in neighboring states like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama have been contending with since the overturn of Roe. When the six-week ban takes effect, people in the South will need to travel even farther for care. In 2023, North Carolina reduced access to legal abortion from 20 weeks down to 12, and also passed rules requiring patients to make two in-person doctor visits, with a 72-hour break in between. The only Southern state that allows abortion past the first trimester is Virginia, and beyond that the closest options are Washington, DC, and Illinois. Total incidence of abortion has actually gone up since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, butan underlying reason is because travel out of state for abortion has also gone up, offsetting some of the newer restrictions in states with bans. Yet such travel is difficult and expensive, and it’s no guarantee that every patient looking to end a pregnancy will all be able to make a trip that’s hundreds of miles longer than before. One glimmer of hope for people in Florida and the entire South is a second ruling the Florida Supreme Court issued in early April: A ballot measure to protect abortion access in the state can move forward. The measure, which would require support from at least 60 percent of Florida voters to pass, would amend Florida’s constitution to protect abortion rights up to the point of fetal viability, or typically between 22 and 24 weeks of a pregnancy. Voters will have the opportunity to weigh in on this question in November. Past polling indicates extreme abortion restrictions are not supported by the Florida public. In one survey conducted by Florida Atlantic University, 67 percent of Floridians said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while just 12 percent supported a total ban. Another survey from 2023, led by the Public Religion Research Institute, found 64 percent of Americans backed abortion in all or most cases. All seven ballot measures that have been advanced to protect abortion rights since the fall of Roe have passed. But those in red and purple states like Montana, Kentucky, Kansas, and Ohio did not have to reach a 60 percent threshold, receiving backing between 52 and 59 percent. Advocates for abortion rights expect the Florida campaign to be particularly expensive, running upwards of $100 million. “It has never been more essential that the right to abortion be enshrined in the state constitution to protect access for Floridians and that we elect federal champions to protect the right to abortion at the national level,” said Reproductive Freedom for All President Mini Timmaraju. “We’re committed to working beside our partners on the ground to ensure that happens.” Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said the Supreme Court’s decision “paves the way for Florida voters to stop these ridiculous abortion bans once and for all.” Update, April 30, 9:37 am : This story was originally published on April 5, 2023, and has been updated multiple times.

What North Carolina’s abortion ban does — and why it matters,Zack Beauchamp,2023-05-17T14:30:02+00:00,"On Tuesday, the North Carolina legislature took the hugely consequential step of overriding Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto of a new 12-week abortion ban. Republicans control a supermajority in both the Senate and the House, which gave them enough votes to override the governor’s veto. The veto override is only the latest contentious chapter in the partisan fight over abortion since the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade last year in Dobbs v. Jackson. North Carolina is an unusually critical state for abortion rights: It has become a haven for those seeking abortion in the post-Dobbs South. In the months following the Supreme Court’s ruling, North Carolina saw the single highest increase in abortions of any state in the country — largely due to out-of-staters coming in from nearby states where the procedure is heavily restricted or banned. The new law, which goes into effect July 1, could have a significant impact on abortion access in the United States writ large. The actual policy mechanisms in the bill are more subtle than you might think. Most abortions — at least 88 percent in North Carolina — take place at or before 12 weeks. To reduce abortions during the period when it remains legal, the bill contains new in-person visit requirements for patients and onerous licensing restrictions on surgical clinics. These likely wouldn’t have the same effect as a full ban but would still make it harder for patients (especially out-of-staters) to access care. North Carolina Republicans chose this more subtle pathway deliberately: Reporting from the Washington Post shows that the legislative drafting process was shaped by the widespread evidence that strict abortion bans are a political loser for the GOP. The bill even includes some limited financial support for parents, like paid parental leave for state employees and teachers, to defang the popular Democratic argument that Republicans don’t actually care about the welfare of mothers and their children. It’s a state abortion restriction seemingly designed to counter the post-Dobbs backlash — one that could serve as a model for Republicans elsewhere looking to retreat from more hardline positions if it proves politically effective. Whether the bill actually works as intended, on both policy and political grounds, it has potentially massive stakes for the entire country. Under current North Carolina law, elective abortion is permitted up through 20 weeks. This is considerably less restrictive than the post-Dobbs bans enacted in several nearby Republican-controlled states. In neighboring Tennessee, abortion is completely banned (with some very limited exceptions); in Florida and Georgia, it’s prohibited past six weeks (before many people even know they’re pregnant). As anyone who has been pregnant or known a pregnant person knows, the difference between six and 20 weeks is absolutely massive. Only 40 percent of all abortions nationwide took place before six weeks, whereas nearly all abortions in the United States happen before 20 weeks. This is why North Carolina has seen such a dramatic surge in abortions since Dobbs; it, together with surprising holdout South Carolina, remains an island where abortion is still accessible in a region where it’s increasingly prohibited. The new North Carolina law restricts elective abortion through 12 weeks (the first trimester). After that, abortion is prohibited with narrow exceptions: rape and incest through 20 weeks, life-threatening fetal anomalies through 24 weeks, and life of the mother throughout (a notoriously murky exception). In and of itself, the changing dates represent a rollback in abortion rights — though, given that most abortions happen within the first 12 weeks, one perhaps not as hugely consequential as the six-week bans that have passed in other states. But at least two other components of the bill also create important barriers to abortion access. First, the bill changes the state’s waiting period law to require an in-person visit. Under current law, anyone seeking an abortion in North Carolina must begin with a consultation process at least 72 hours before the procedure — but this can be done over the phone, making it comparatively easy for out-of-state patients. The new lawnow requires the consultation to be done in person, which the bill’s critics say is a significant barrier for out-of-state residents — especially low-income or working-class ones who can’t afford to take time off work. “This bill is about making it as difficult as possible to obtain an abortion, even in the first trimester,” Amy Bryant, a professor at the University of North Carolina and practicing OB-GYN, said at a rally against the abortion bill. Second, the new lawimposes a new requirement that abortion clinics maintain facilities on par with those of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), which are non-hospital outpatient surgery clinics. ASCs are required to adhere to specific rules, including physical layout restrictions, that abortion clinics don’t always meet. There is no evidence that these restrictions improve outcomes in patients who have abortions; a study of 50,000 abortions found no difference between those performed in ASCs and those performed outside of them. The ASC rule is the most common restriction found in so-called TRAP laws — short for “targeted regulation on abortion providers.” The idea behind TRAP legislation is to impose financially burdensome requirements on abortion clinics that all but force many of them to shut down. Research by the Guttmacher Institute found that TRAP laws in four states — Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, and Texas — caused roughly half of all clinics in those states to shut down between 2011 and 2017. And Planned Parenthood has already said that none of its existing clinics in North Carolina meet the state’s ASC standards. Moreover, the bill passed Tuesday strengthens an existing North Carolina law that prohibits patients from using abortion-inducing drugs like mifepristone at home or elsewhere absent a physician’s supervision. Providing abortion drugs directly to a patient carries a $5,000 fine, as does advertising the sale of any such drugs. Again, none of these rules are as tight as the bills in nearby states. But combined, they amount to significant restrictions on abortion access in a state that currently serves as a region-wide haven. It’s hard to estimate how many (safe and legal) abortions would be prevented by this bill’s imposition: North Carolina after Dobbs is a fairly unique case. But it’s fair to say that the number isn’t trivial. So why did the North Carolina GOP, famously one of the more radical in the country, opt for this more subtle attempt to restrict abortion rather than a tighter ban? The answer appears to be politics. According to the Washington Post’s Caroline Kitchener and Rachel Roubein, Republicans drafted the bill in secret and introduced it through a procedurally novel method that circumvented the need for committee debate. The reason, per Kitchener and Roubein, was to avoid political backlash: both to minimize anti-abortion protests and “to prevent far-right legislators from introducing an amendment that would replace the 12-week limit with a six-week ban.” By restricting input during the bill’s passage, they aimed to circumvent the problem that has plagued state Republican parties since Dobbs: being caught between an activist base demanding six-week-or-tighter restrictions and a mass public that vehemently opposes such restrictions. The 2022 midterms and subsequent elections, like the Wisconsin Supreme Court contest, proved that abortion is a motivator for Democrats and a powerful wedge issue — one that has seemingly punished Republicans at the ballot box. North Carolina Republicans were clearly sensitive to these political consequences, and drafted policy with politics in mind. Republican state senators and representatives have repeatedly emphasized, in their public rhetoric, a poll finding that a majority of North Carolinians supported restricting abortion to the first trimester (with exceptions). Whether this is actually true is open to debate: Another poll found that a clear majority, 57 percent, supported either keeping North Carolina abortion laws the same or making it even easier to access the procedure. And a more recent poll, conducted after the abortion bill’s initial passage, found that 54 percent opposed the new requirements. These numbers aren’t favorable to Republicans, but they’re far less unfavorable than those on six-week bans or total prohibitions. No matter what, Republicans took a lesser risk than, say, Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida, who recently signed new restrictions into law. In the internal GOP debate, they have lined up with Donald Trump — who is arguing that abortion is a political loser that Republicans need to deemphasize — rather than DeSantis. But deemphasizing doesn’t mean ignoring. Instead, it means using other means — like TRAP provisions — to restrict abortions alongside the tighter week requirements they could impose after Dobbs. This approach worked for Republicans for many years while Roe was still law, allowing them to reduce abortion access without suffering much in the way of obvious political consequences. Whether it’s enough for powerful anti-abortion activists, who play a major role in the party’s internal politics, is another matter. The North Carolina abortion law won’t merely be a test of whether the GOP can reduce abortions both state- and region-wide. It’ll be a test of a different, less blatantly radical approach to post-Dobbs pro-life politics in a state that will likely be competitive in 2024.

"What Americans think about abortion, in 3 charts",Rani Molla,2022-06-24T14:43:50+00:00,"The US Supreme Court ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade, clearing the way for states to outlaw abortion, goes against majority opinion on ending a pregnancy. Americans overwhelmingly want legal access to abortion, at least in some situations. But get more specific than that, and the picture is more nuanced. Feelings about specifics are much more varied, and generally include support for some restrictions on when and in what situations the procedure should be performed. Only 8 percent of adults say abortion should be against the law in all cases, without exception, while just 19 percent say abortion should be legal in all cases, without exception, according to data from Pew Research Center. Americans’ support of abortion rights in some or all situations — meaning they would disagree with the overturning of Roe v. Wade — has been fairly consistent for a long time. Back in 1975, three-quarters of Americans said it should be legal in all (21 percent) or certain (54 percent) circumstances, according to a long-running survey by Gallup. In the ensuing half-century, that number has gone up 10 percentage points to 85 percent, meaning the support has only gotten stronger. In that sense, abortion, like gun control, is an issue where American policy appears to be at odds with American majority opinions. But when polled on specifics regarding the situation and timelines, support for abortion is not always as strong. While Pew found that sizable majorities of Americans said abortion should be legal if a woman’s health is at stake (73 percent) or if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest (69 percent), just over half (54 percent) said it should be legal if the baby was likely to be born with severe disabilities or health issues. The stage of pregnancy especially affects people’s views of abortion. Pew found that in the first six weeks of pregnancy, 51 percent of people said abortion should be generally legal, compared with 26 percent who said it should be illegal. By 24 weeks into a pregnancy, just 29 percent said it should be generally legal while 42 percent said it should be generally illegal. All along, about a fifth of those polled say that it depends. All of this, however, might be beside the point, according to Tresa Undem, co-founder of public opinion research firm PerryUndem, which has extensively researched abortion viewpoints. “You can’t take any single polling question at face value because you just dig a centimeter beneath the surface and you get data that’s conflicting,” Undem said. “If they’re not doing qualitative research, they’re not listening to people.” Polling that asks people whether they’re for or against abortion or what their opinions are on particular gestational limits runs up against the fact that most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking through their opinions on abortion nor do they understand a lot about it, she said. A series of polls by YouGov found that Americans don’t know much about abortions in general, like when abortions are typically performed (in the first six weeks), who gets them (people with kids), and how prevalent they are (42 percent of unplanned pregnancies end in abortion). The number of abortions in the US jumped 8 percent from 2017 to 2020, after decades of decline. Surface-level answers about abortion don’t always get at what people really think. When PerryUndem asked the binary question of whether abortion should generally be legal or illegal in the second three months of pregnancy, a majority, 57 percent of voters, said it should be illegal. But when it asked more qualitative follow-ups about their viewpoints, a third of those who said it should be illegal also said they’d prefer their state lawmakers stay out of this issue. Additionally, when asked something more personal — what Americans want the experience to be like for a woman who has chosen to have an abortion — the vast majority said they want abortion to be safe (95 percent), legal (85 percent), and without protesters (83 percent). Overall, Undem said, such broad-based polling makes people’s opinions on abortion seem more politicized and contentious than they are, though the issue does often fall on partisan lines. “It’s hard to understand through polling, but basically, in all the work I’ve done — qualitative focus groups, in-depth interviews, surveys — the bottom line is that the public wants people making these decisions around abortion, not the government,” she said. And high-level polling also can eclipse changes that might be going on below the surface. 
In May, 55 percent of Americans identified as “pro-choice,” the highest level who’ve done so since 1995, according to Gallup. Part of that could have to do with the fact that Gen Z is substantively more likely to support abortion rights than older generations were at their age, according to Mary Ziegler, a law professor at UC Davis and author of the upcoming book Dollars for Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement and the Fall of the Republican Establishment. The changing identification also might reflect the changing realities people are living in, rather than changing viewpoints, she said. “It’s likely that what states are doing now is too much for people,” Ziegler said. “People who might be totally fine with waiting periods and mandatory ultrasounds are looking at this and saying, ‘Sending people to jail if they have an abortion or if they perform an abortion at seven weeks gestation is not something I’m really interested in.’” Perhaps unsurprisingly, people who identify as for or against abortion rights tend to have vastly different ideas about issues like adoption, murder, and bodily autonomy, according to polling by YouGov. Some 90 percent of those who say they are “pro-choice” believe forcing someone into an unwanted pregnancy infringes on their bodily autonomy; the same percentage of people who identify as “pro-life” believe abortion is the same as murdering a child. Undem also sees abortion as moving from an issue of women’s rights to a broader issue of power and control, and who has a voice in this country. “They think power is consolidated into a small handful of people of a particular view that represents the minority and this is just one thing. It’s a big thing, but they see it as part of this larger issue,” Undem said, that includes things like voting rights and democracy. “Everything’s changing, going backward, for the negative, and it’s almost like people are just feeling loss.” Update, 10:40 am: This story was updated to reflect the Supreme Court decision.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23167397/abortion-public-opinion-polls-americans,11808
"The end of Roe v. Wade, explained",Ian Millhiser,2022-06-24T17:50:00+00:00,"Roe v. Wade is overruled. The Republican Party, which achieved a generational victory when it captured a supermajority of the Supreme Court’s seats under former President Donald Trump, has now capitalized on that victory to achieve one of its longtime political goals. The half-century when American constitutional law protected a right to an abortion is now over. Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization is substantially similar to a leaked early draft of that opinion, which was published by Politico in early May. Alito’s opinion was joined by the Court’s four most conservative members. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative who often takes a more incrementalist approach than Alito, wrote a separate opinion arguing that the Court should limit but not yet overrule Roe. Alito’s final opinion doesn’t just allow Mississippi to enact the 15-week abortion ban at issue in Dobbs — a ban that violated Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 opinion that weakened Roe while retaining the constitutional right to an abortion up to the point of “viability.” Alito’s opinion goes further, and concludes that Roe and Casey “must be overruled.” It is written in Alito’s characteristically snide tone, repeatedly referring to abortion providers by the pejorative term “abortionists.” And it rests on a conservative theory that limits which rights are protected by the Constitution. “The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,” Alito writes. According to Alito, if a right isn’t explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it must be “‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ and ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’” to qualify for constitutional protection. He then spends many pages of his opinion arguing that the right to an abortion is not rooted in legal history or tradition. Much of Alito’s account of this history is dubious. The Roe opinion itself argued that, under English “common law,” which still forms the basis for much of US law, “abortion performed before ‘quickening’ — the first recognizable movement of the fetus in utero, appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy — was not an indictable offense.” And there is considerable historical evidence that a right to pre-quickening abortions is, indeed, firmly rooted in US legal history and tradition. Ultimately, however, Alito’s opinion is less a triumph of one theory of history over another, than it is the triumph of one political party over another. Roe was overruled because Republicans appointed six justices and Democrats appointed only three. This outcome became inevitable the minute Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in the final weeks of a Republican presidency. So what happens now? The immediate impact is that the many state laws that already ban abortion — either outright or very early in a pregnancy — will quickly take effect. Many clinics in the states with the most rigid laws suspended abortion procedures as soon as the Dobbs opinion came down. There’s also an open question about whether other rights, such as the right to same-sex marriage or the right to contraception, are in danger. Many of the Court’s decisions protecting a right to sexual, romantic, or bodily autonomy rely on similar reasoning to Roe. And Alito’s reasoning in the Dobbs opinion closely tracks reasoning he once used to argue that same-sex marriage is not rooted in American legal history and tradition. In other words, the logic Alito uses in Dobbs could be used to target other rights. That said, Alito’s Dobbs opinion does contain language denying that overruling Roe necessarily means the demise of other, still-existing freedoms. Alito declares abortion to be a “unique act” because it “terminates ‘life or potential life.’” That distinguishes the now-defunct constitutional right to abortion from, say, the right to marry a person of the same sex. This is one of the largest changes from the leaked opinion in May, which did contain some language suggesting that the Dobbs opinion is limited to abortion, but not nearly as much as the final version. That suggests that at least one of the justices who joined Alito’s opinions might have reckoned with the earlier draft’s sweeping repercussions and pushed for a slightly less aggressive opinion. But whether other rights are next on the chopping block or not, Dobbs is already a sweeping change for America, one that will immediately change society not just in the states likely to ban abortion, but across the country. Eighteen states currently have laws on the books that either ban abortion outright or permit it only in extremely limited circumstances. Some, but not all, of these states permit abortion to save a patient’s life or protect them from a dire health consequence. Some, but not all, permit the termination of a pregnancy that results from rape or incest. Many of these laws are now in effect, after the Court’s decision overruling Roe, but some of these states have “trigger” provisions that do not take effect until a certain condition is met — such as that 30 days have passed after the Dobbs decision. That means abortion may remain briefly legal in a few states with trigger laws, but that the bans will most likely take effect by the end of the summer. The 18 states with near-total bans on the books are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Four other states — Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and South Carolina — have laws on the books banning abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy, which is before many people who may want an abortion will be aware that they are pregnant. (There’s also the unusual case of North Carolina, which once had an abortion ban on the books. But a more recent law appears to have legalized abortion up to the 20th week of pregnancy.) It should be noted that this list of states will fluctuate. State supreme courts retain the power to interpret their own state constitutions, potentially to protect a right to abortion within their state’s borders. In Michigan, for example, a judge has temporarily blocked the state’s ban from taking effect, and the litigation continues. Given that Democrats currently hold a narrow majority on the state’s highest court, the state could protect the right to an abortion. And, of course, Alito’s opinion also means that state legislatures can pass new laws regulating or banning abortion. That means states currently controlled by Republicans are likely to enact new bans in the coming weeks or months. Alito’s Dobbs opinion acknowledges that the Constitution protects some rights that are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, but only rights that are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” He’s made this argument before. Specifically, Alito made this “history and tradition” argument in his dissenting opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the landmark opinion holding that people with same-sex partners have the same right to marry that partner as anyone else. “It is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage” is not sufficiently rooted in history and tradition, Alito claimed in his Obergefell dissent. Justice Clarence Thomas, meanwhile, wrote a concurring opinion in Dobbs where he denounced the concept of “substantive due process,” the legal theory that drives many of the Court’s decisions involving a right to sexual and romantic autonomy. Alito also rejects the idea that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment implies the right to an abortion. But Thomas goes further. According to Thomas’s opinion, which is joined by no other justice, the Court’s pro-contraception decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), its decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) that consenting adults have a right to choose whom they have sex with and how they have sex, and its decision in Obergefell should all be reconsidered. That said, the final version of Alito’s opinion seems to go out of its way to explain that abortion is different from these other rights — again, because abortion involves the termination of a fetal life and these other rights do not. Much of this language was added after Alito wrote the leaked early draft of the Dobbs opinion. Indeed, Alito accuses the dissenting opinion — which is co-authored by all three of the Court’s Democratic appointees — of stoking “unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights” because the dissent worries that Dobbs could endanger things like same-sex marriage or contraception. In any event, the future of rights other than abortion will likely need to be litigated. There is no doubt that Thomas would happily light many existing rights on fire. And there is little doubt that Alito, based on his Obergefell dissent, would also happily tear down same-sex marriage. But it takes five votes to strip away an existing constitutional right, and it remains to be seen whether Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — conservatives who sometimes break with Alito’s most aggressive attempts to drive the law to the right — will support mass rollbacks of existing rights. Although there may not be five votes on the current Supreme Court to permit an outright ban on all forms of contraception, the Court may permit states to ban certain forms of contraception that many religious conservatives believe to be akin to abortion. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), a 5-4 Supreme Court held that employers who object to certain forms of birth control on religious grounds may refuse to cover these contraceptive methods in their employees’ health plans. At least some of the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby claimed that “two forms of emergency contraception commonly called ‘morning after’ pills and two types of intrauterine devices” can cause an abortion because they “may operate after the fertilization of an egg.” It is far from clear that these forms of birth control actually do operate on fertilized eggs. As Dr. Mary Jacobson, an OB-GYN and chief medical officer at Alpha Medical, told me, “No existing scientific studies validate the fallacy that hormonal contraceptives or the copper intrauterine device act partly as abortifacients.” But the question of whether IUDs or morning-after pills qualify as contraception (which is still protected by existing Supreme Court precedents) or abortion-inducing drugs (which are not protected after Dobbs) will not be decided by medical doctors. It will be decided by a federal judiciary dominated by conservative Republicans. In Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), moreover, the Supreme Court held that state and federal lawmakers have “wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.” This line is likely to play a starring role in conservative judicial decisions permitting bans on certain forms of contraception. Under Gonzales, to justify a contraception ban, a state does not need to prove that a particular form of contraception definitively acts as an abortion-inducing drug. They just have to convince a court that may be dominated by right-wing Republicans that there is “uncertainty” about how a pill or contraceptive device operates. Litigation over contraception bans, in other words, is inevitable if a state decides to ban common forms of birth control such as the morning-after pill or IUDs. Abortion opponents will no doubt feel emboldened by their victory in Dobbs, and will try to press their advantage. One of the most aggressive anti-abortion theories is known as “fetal personhood.” It claims that a fetus is entitled to the same rights as a fully born human being. And thus the law must treat killing a fetus the same as a homicide. Could this theory gain purchase in this Supreme Court? Based solely on the text of the Dobbs opinion, the answer is “no.” Alito claims that his decision “returns the issue of abortion to ... legislative bodies” and allows people with varying opinions on abortion to “affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office.” Alito, of course, is notoriously hostile to the right to vote. Among other things, he is the author of Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee (2021), an opinion that invented a number of judicially created limits on the Voting Rights Act that appear nowhere in the law’s text. So, if Alito’s Dobbs opinion does permit voters to shape abortion policy moving forward, it will do so only after Alito has skewed the electorate toward Republicans. A second caveat worth considering is that the Court recently tripped over itself to ensure that Texas’s SB 8 law, an unusual ban on most abortions that relies on private litigation to enforce the ban, could take effect. (Now Dobbs permits Texas to ban abortions outright.) The Court’s decision in that case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson (2021), didn’t simply shield SB 8 from judicial review. If taken seriously, Jackson’s reasoning would permit a state to nullify any constitutional right by writing a law with a similar enforcement mechanism as SB 8 . The Court, in other words, was willing to do considerable violence to the Constitution as a whole in order to spite abortion rights in Jackson. That suggests that five justices may be willing to take similarly extraordinary steps to restrict abortion in the future. For the time being, however, the Court’s most recent pronouncement on abortion rights is Dobbs. And Dobbs, at least on its face, is inconsistent with the theory of fetal personhood. At least for now, in other words, abortion is likely to remain legal in blue states.",https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception,11808
Sometimes the biggest obstacle to abortion is insurance,Anna North,2017-08-31T18:30:02+00:00,"Erika Christensen’s pregnancy ended at 32 weeks. But her fight to get her abortion covered by insurance had just begun. In 2016, Christensen found out that the baby she was carrying had abnormalities that doctors called “incompatible with life.” “If it made it through birth, it would choke to death and die,” said Garin Marschall, Christensen’s husband.Christensen, now 36, and Marschall, 39, had very much wanted the child, which would have been their first. But after doctors gave them the bad news, they decided on abortion. New York state, where they lived, bans the procedure after 24 weeks unless the mother’s life is at risk. Since there was no immediate risk to Christensen, she had to travel to a clinic in Colorado, one of only a few states with doctors who perform late-term abortions, an experience she has described in interviews at Jezebel. Her insurance covered abortion, but the clinic didn’t take it. So Christensen paid $10,000 out of pocket, which her mother withdrew from her 401k. After the procedure, Christensen requested a reimbursement from her insurance company. She got back about $800. She asked the company to review the decision, which meant months of waiting and hours on the phone. Ultimately, the insurance company reimbursed her around $3,000. The experience, so soon after the loss of a wanted pregnancy, prolonged her family’s pain and “kept us from being able to just start the grieving process,” Christensen said. “It felt like abuse to have these conversations again and again.” Christensen’s experience is unusual in some ways — most abortions take place early in pregnancy and cost far less. But her struggle with insurance is surprisingly common — even insurance that ostensibly covers abortion may not actually pay for the procedure. That leaves patients scrambling to pay their bills out of pocket or even trying to do the procedure at home. And it leaves clinics with difficult choices, as Katrina Kimport and Brenly Rowland, researchers from Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), a group at the University of California, San Francisco, note in a study released to the public Thursday. Given the insurance landscape, they write, “facilities might reasonably conclude that they cannot afford to take insurance and keep their doors open.” Most people who get abortions pay out of pocket because they’re uninsured, they don’t want to go through their insurance (sometimes they’re worried an insurance bill could lead to family members finding out about the procedure), or their state restricts insurance coverage for abortion. The Hyde Amendment bans the use of federal Medicaid funding to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the mother’s life; 32 states have similar restrictions on state Medicaid funds. Meanwhile, 26 states restrict abortion coverage in private plans offered on the insurance exchanges, and 11 restrict abortion coverage in all private plans. But even if patients have insurance that covers abortion, they or the clinic may end up footing the bill, according to the UCSF study. Kimport, a sociologist, and Rowland, an interviewer, talked to administrators in charge of 64 clinics in 21 states. They found that even in states where Medicaid was legally allowed to cover abortion, some Medicaid insurance providers declined to cover the procedure. Private insurance presented similar roadblocks. In many states that don’t restrict private coverage of abortion, insurers can still choose whether to offer it or not. And some impose restrictions that conflict with the realities of abortion care. One insurer would only pay for medication dispensed by a pharmacist, according to a doctor quoted in the study. But the FDA requires medication abortion, which accounts for nearly a third of all abortions, to be administered to a patient by a clinician, not a pharmacist. “I fought and fought” with one insurer to get medication abortion covered, said the doctor. After eight years of trying to challenge the rule, the doctor said, “I finally just gave up.” Because of the way another insurer’s policies are written, abortion could only be reimbursed for patients over 12 years old, Kimport said. “When they had a patient who was under 12, there was simply not a way to get that reimbursed.” When insurance companies fail to cover abortion, patients can suffer, especially if they live at or near the poverty line. They may need to delay while they get the money together, resulting in a later and costlier procedure, said Daniel Grossman, director of ANSIRH. The average cost of an abortion at 10 weeks is around $500; by 20 weeks, that rises to around $1,500. Financial obstacles can also push women to try to self-induce an abortion, potentially putting their lives at risk. For low-income women, abortion costs can mean going without necessities. In her work with an abortion fund in California, Destiny Lopez, now co-director of the group All* Above All, saw women who were forgoing rent or food to pay for their abortions. “I vividly remember the day that I provided literally a tank of gas to a young couple that had to have a termination,” she said. Even for those who are able to rely on family members for money, the experience of fighting with insurance companies can take a toll. Kate Carson had an abortion at 36 weeks after finding out that her daughter had a fatal brain abnormality. That meant coming up with $25,000 with just a weekend’s notice — her parents took the money out of their retirement account. Carson had insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield, but since she had to travel out of state, from Massachusetts to Colorado, her insurer only reimbursed her a small amount of the total. “Every bill that came in the mail and every refusal from insurance was like a knife in my heart,” she said. A representative from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts said that employers decide which services their plans cover. If a service is covered and a patient receives it out of state, the reimbursement is typically based on how much a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in that state would pay. Patients choose late-term abortion for a variety of reasons. Jenny, who asked that her last name not be used, decided to seek an abortion after she found out her baby had a major heart defect that would likely leave him in a vegetative state, dependent on a ventilator and feeding tube. “I’m a nurse and I know how this stuff goes,” she said. “I didn’t want him to have that quality of life.” Christensen considered carrying her child to term, even though a previous surgery meant she would have to have a C-section. But she realized that he would probably die soon after delivery “if he even made it that far,” she told Jezebel. Ultimately, she said, “I couldn’t put him through that suffering when we had the option to minimize his pain as much as possible.” The idiosyncrasies of insurance coverage for abortion also mean clinics may never get reimbursed for the abortions they perform. In states where Medicaid does cover abortion, reimbursement rates for the procedure are typically very low. The Medicaid reimbursement “doesn’t even come close to the expenditures” for an abortion, a counseling manager at one facility told Kimport and Rowland. Medicaid reimbursements are low for many services, but since patients seeking abortions are disproportionately low-income, abortion clinics see an especially high percentage of patients with Medicaid. That means low reimbursement rates can pose a serious threat to a clinic’s survival. Some clinics have to make an uncomfortable choice between accepting Medicaid — and potentially going out of business — or declining the insurance so they can continue to see patients, Kimport and Rowland note. Reimbursement rates are generally higher for private insurance, but the many restrictions and quirks involved mean clinics can never be sure if an insurer will pay them. “Providers are always rolling the dice,” said Kimport. Some practices choose not to accept private insurance — the Boulder Abortion Clinic, where Christensen had her abortion, has a contract with Kaiser but does not take other public or private insurance. Meanwhile, some abortion practices have costs that neither public nor private insurance reimbursements truly reflect. Dr. Warren Hern, who performed Christensen’s abortion, estimates that 50 percent of what his patients pay goes toward security for his practice. “Pediatricians do not have to have armed guards and bulletproof windows,” he said. “We do.” Since their experience, Christensen and Marschall have become advocates for the Reproductive Health Act, which would make abortion after 24 weeks legal in New York state if the fetus is not viable or if the mother’s health is threatened. That would allow women in Christensen’s situation to stay in New York and get abortions from in-network doctors, making it more likely for insurance to cover the procedure. New York allows state Medicaid coverage for abortion, and most private insurers also cover the procedure, said Liz Krueger, a state senator and sponsor of the bill. The Reproductive Health Act has passed the state assembly but not yet received a vote in the Republican-dominated state senate. Krueger is hopeful that it might move forward when the senate comes back into session in January 2018. Public opinion is on the bill’s side, she said, and in an election year, senators may be especially motivated to listen to their constituents’ concerns. The Trump administration has created anxiety and an appetite for change on many issues, she said. “There’s real momentum in New York state for voters to say, ‘We don’t trust Washington, we need this done here.’” A few other states have recently passed similar laws. The Reproductive Health Equity Act, passed in Oregon this year, requires insurers, including the state’s Medicaid program, to cover abortion at no cost to the patient. But one of the biggest barriers to insurance coverage for abortion around the country is the Hyde Amendment. Though it restricts only federal funding for abortion, it affects the private insurance markets as well, since many private insurers take their cues from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Marschall, who has become something of an insurance expert since Christensen’s abortion. The EACH Woman Act, introduced in the House in January, would repeal Hyde, allowing Medicaid recipients, government employees, and anyone else with government-sponsored health care to receive coverage for abortion. It would also bar states from banning abortion coverage in private plans on the exchanges. There’s likely little appetite in the current Congress for repealing Hyde. But advocates for the bill are realistic about their approach, said Lopez. “We know that if we’re undoing 42 years of bad policy, it’s not going to take one Congress to fix that,” she explained. “What’s important about the bill is it allows us to have a conversation we haven’t had in this country about public and private insurance coverage of abortion.” Even repealing Hyde wouldn’t necessarily fix the problem of low reimbursement rates, as Kimport and Rowland note. Simply allowing Medicaid to cover abortion wouldn’t mean that clinics would actually get reimbursed for the full cost of the procedure.But advocates are at work on the state level to try to raise rates, Lopez said. Sometimes that means working with groups trying to raise rates for other services, she added. “Some of these issues are larger than just abortion care.” The barriers to change are many, but advocates like Christensen remain committed to the fight. Until New York changes its law, “I will feel like I’m not allowed to grieve,” she said. “I’m going to stay acutely angry and rageful until it’s made right.” Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of states that have restrictions on Medicaid coverage for abortion similar to the federal restrictions imposed by the Hyde Amendment. The correct number is 32 states.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16229654/abortion-insurance-hyde-amendment,11808
America’s abortion debate is being defined by Fox News,Anna North,2019-09-23T16:00:00+00:00,"Something strange happened to the abortion debate earlier this year. Politicians, media outlets, and ordinary people began talking about “post-birth” or “fourth-trimester” abortion, claiming that doctors in America are killing babies after they’re born. This would be murder, not abortion, and it’s already illegal in every state. No abortion-rights group supports this. But the idea that “post-birth” abortion is happening, and that abortion-rights supporters want it to be legal, made its way into speeches by President Donald Trump and to the floor of Congress, where Republicans have tried more than 70 times to get a vote on a bill that would protect abortion “survivors.” How did something that’s already illegal, and that isn’t abortion, become the subject of abortion legislation in Congress? The answer has to do with who’s driving the abortion debate in America right now: Fox News. When it comes to coverage of abortion, Fox News dominates the cable news landscape. The progressive media watchdog group Media Matters for America recently looked at coverage of common abortion-related topics on the big three cable networks: Fox, CNN, and MSNBC. It found that a full 94 percent of statements on those topics came from Fox. The study, provided exclusively to Vox ahead of publication, suggests Fox dominates the abortion debate when it comes to content. When the authors looked at specific statements on abortion, they found commentators on MSNBC and CNN echoing statements made on Fox — from the false claim that Planned Parenthood has been proven to sell fetal body parts to the idea that recent laws allow abortion almost “up until the time you cut the umbilical cord.” Overall, the study authors judged Fox News statements on abortion to be inaccurate 85 percent of the time — but they found that 67 percent of statements at CNN and 40 percent at MSNBC were inaccurate as well. Overall, study author Sharon Kann told Vox that when other networks do talk about abortion, they’re often just responding to what Fox News has already said or commenting on political controversies that Fox helped create. The result is American viewers don’t hear about abortion as an issue of health or human rights but only as a topic of political debate. And because Fox is often first to the story, the network and its conservative-leaning hosts often get to define what that debate looks like. On abortion, “Fox News is the loudest voice in the room,” Kann said. “When other networks do engage, the terms are already set.” For their study, released on Monday, Media Matters researchers looked at coverage of abortion between March 2, 2018, and February 28, 2019. Specifically, they looked at four topics that have been in the news in recent years: videos from the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress purporting to show that Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue; abortion funding rules like the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for most abortions; Planned Parenthood’s role providing reproductive health services; and discussions or allegations of “extreme” abortion procedures, like “abortions until the moment of birth.” The authors found that Fox News had the vast majority of statements on these topics as well as the majority of more in-depth discussions of abortion. During the study period, Fox aired 334 segments with substantive discussion of one of the abortion topics, while MSNBC had 115 and CNN had just 77. As Kann and her co-author Julie Tulbert put it in a report on their research, “CNN and MSNBC are allowing Fox News to drive abortion-related conversations.” That effect shows up in what the networks are saying, not just how much they’re saying it. For example, the study authors found that Fox News commentators and guests made numerous statements about the claim that Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue (multiple investigations have found no evidence of this). But a similar statement also cropped up on CNN, with Marc Short, now chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence, telling the audience about “certain parts of the pro-abortion industry that was marketing fetus body parts.” According to the researchers, that was actually the only statement CNN aired during the study period regarding the claim about Planned Parenthood and fetal tissue, meaning regular viewers of the network weren’t given accurate information to counter Short’s comment. Media Matters has conducted similar research in the past, Kann said, and consistently found that the majority of cable news coverage on abortion is on Fox News. The group has also found, over the years, that CNN and MSNBC often repeat misinformation rather than debunking it, she said. This year, however, a new theme emerged. It started with efforts to loosen abortion restrictions in New York and Virginia. New York’s Reproductive Health Act, passed in January, allows abortions after 24 weeks if a fetus is not viable or there is a risk to the pregnant person’s health (previously, most abortions after that point were banned in the state). In Virginia, meanwhile, a bill proposed this year would have broadened the circumstances under which a pregnant person could get a third-trimester abortion. These legislative efforts didn’t initially get a lot of coverage on CNN or MSNBC, but Fox began covering them aggressively. The day after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed his state’s law, host Laura Ingraham said that it allowed abortion “up to birth” (the New York law allows abortions after 24 weeks only under select circumstances, such as a fetus that cannot survive outside the womb). Sean Hannity, meanwhile, said the following day that “the State of New York legalized late-term abortions, up to the ninth month. That will be called infanticide.” The narrative that the New York law allowed abortion until birth was already in place when, on January 29, the Virginia House of Delegates held a hearing on its bill. Del. Todd Gilbert, a Republican, asked questions reminiscent of this narrative, pressing the bill’s sponsor, Democratic Del. Kathy Tran, about whether the law would allow a patient to get an abortion if she was “about to give birth” or was “dilating.” Tran seemed unprepared for the question and said that her bill would allow that. She later said that she misspoke: “I should have said, ‘Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.’” But Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, muddied the waters further a few days later when he was asked to respond to Tran’s answer. “If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen,” the governor said. “The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” Many commentators, especially conservatives, interpreted his comments to mean that he supported infanticide. The governor’s office later clarified to Vox that he was “absolutely not” referring to killing an infant, but was talking about “the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor.” But President Trump and others began claiming that Northam and other Democrats thought it should be legal to kill babies after they were born. “We had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth,” Trump said in his State of the Union address in February. Meanwhile, Fox News commentators picked up the governor’s comments and used them to argue that both the New York and Virginia measures would allow killing babies after birth. For example, Jon Gabriel, editor-in-chief of the website Ricochet, said on Fox in February that, “what we’ve seen with Ralph Northam’s comments and also the legislation that passed in New York, you have some Democrats who seem to be pushing third trimester abortion but fourth trimester.” At first, Kann said, CNN and MSNBC didn’t talk much about the New York or Virginia laws. They did not, for example, give extensive coverage to activist efforts to pass the laws or to how they would affect patients. When they did begin to cover them, “it was after it became a political story” — thanks, in part to coverage on Fox News. Three days after the hearing on the Virginia bill, CNN focused on conservative response to Northam’s comments as part of a segment on broader controversy about the governor, with correspondent Sara Sidner saying “a lot of people took that, would say, OK, the baby is still alive and you’re talking about killing a child that has already been born.” Sidner added that “he’s already faced quite a bit of criticism there.” The fact that Fox spends so much more time on abortion than other networks has a real effect on the larger media narrative about the procedure, Kann said. When Fox hosts make misleading claims about abortion and those show up in the State of the Union address, she explained, and “CNN and MSNBC haven’t been talking about the substance of this, when they come to the narrative a month later, it really changes the terms of the conversation.” In particular, when other networks arrive at the story late, it becomes harder for them to correct false claims. “If you’re contending with already repeated and ossified misinformation in the mind of viewers, it’s so much more difficult to get the accurate information out there,” Kann said. Not everyone agrees that Fox, or conservative sources more generally, dominate abortion coverage. For example, Charles Camosy, a board member of Democrats for Life of America, wrote in a New York Times op-ed earlier this year that media outlets were mischaracterizing the views of advocates like him by using the term “anti-abortion” rather than “pro-life.” “This language allows critics to dismiss me and fellow pro-lifers as single-issue obsessives, which we are not,” he wrote. Other anti-abortion advocates say media coverage of the issue is missing crucial stories. Serrin Foster, president of the group Feminists for Life, which opposes abortion, told Vox in an email that “since abortion is such an important issue to people on both sides of the political divide, it is surprising how little air time is devoted to this contentious subject from mainstream cable news.” She called for more coverage of legislation that supports pregnant people, such as a law recently passed in California that grants protections to pregnant and parenting students. She’s not the only one who sees media coverage of abortion and related issues as lacking. Researchers say the Media Matters finding is in line with the broader landscape of abortion coverage, across the political spectrum. “Most of the time when abortion is covered, it’s as a political hot-button issue, not treated as a health issue,” Katie Woodruff, a public health social scientist at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a group at the University of California, San Francisco, told Vox. “It’s very much treated in the context of horse-race politics.” “The way even mainstream news covers abortion tends to emphasize the polarization that we have come to associate with it,” added Woodruff, who has studied newspaper coverage of abortion. “Most of the public supports abortion rights and abortion is a very safe and common experience, and I don’t think you would understand that from even mainstream news coverage of the issue, let alone how Fox chooses to approach the topic.” Kann also says that to combat misinformation, media outlets need to be specific in their coverage of abortion and look beyond the political battles. “When we treat abortion just as a political issue” and not one of health care or people’s rights, she said, “we lose the context necessary to debunk some of the most harmful claims that are coming out of right-wing media.” “Making sure that we are talking about abortion in specific, nuanced, and factual ways is always going to be the most important,” she added. The governor of Alabama signed the nation’s strictest anti-abortion bill into law.

What “crisis pregnancy centers” really do,Anna North,2020-03-02T12:10:00+00:00,"When Aya got a positive pregnancy test, she wanted to confirm the results at a clinic. But the first six places she called either required her to pay out of pocket, or had no appointments for a week. So Aya went to a pregnancy resource center. Sometimes called crisis pregnancy centers, the facilities’ “primary mission is to dissuade women from choosing abortion,” Katrina Kimport, an associate professor at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), a group at the University of California San Francisco, writes in a new study of patients at the centers, published on Friday in the journal Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health. The centers, most of which are religiously affiliated, typically offer services like pregnancy tests and sometimes resources like diapers or baby clothes, alongside counseling with an anti-abortion message. The inner workings of pregnancy resource centers don’t always get a lot of coverage in the media, and unless they’ve visited one, many people may not know much about the facilities. But they have been a subject of major concern among abortion-rights advocates in recent years, because such centers have been found to give misinformation about the risks of abortion. Some advocates feared that the centers “inappropriately interfered” in patients’ decisions around their pregnancies, “preventing people from being able to choose or obtain an abortion,” Kimport told Vox. But that’s not what Kimport found in interviews with 21 patients, including Aya, who later went to a prenatal care clinic. Most of those patients had already decided to continue their pregnancies when they went to the resource centers. They visited the facilities for basic necessities — like ultrasounds and diapers — that were expensive or difficult to get elsewhere. In many cases, the patients did get help at the centers. But some resources came with strings attached — free baby clothes and other supplies, for example, were only available if patients took workshops or classes, some of which had a religious component. Some women found the required instruction troubling, with one saying of a parenting video, “it hurt me.” Meanwhile, the patients Kimport talked to, most of whom were low-income, also had major needs that could not be met by pregnancy resource centers, from food insecurity to homelessness to high-risk pregnancies that required specialized care. It’s not necessarily surprising that the centers couldn’t help women with these problems, Kimport told Vox — that’s not really what they were designed to do. But in recent years, states and the federal government have been increasingly positioning the centers as social safety-net providers, shifting money toward them and away from other facilities that provide a wider range of services, like family planning clinics. The Trump administration, for example, last year barred groups that provide or refer abortions from getting federal family planning funds, but awarded a grant to a network of pregnancy resource centers in California. Kimport’s research suggests that as family planning clinics and other service providers lose funding, pregnancy resource centers, at least as they’re currently designed, won’t be able to fill in the gaps. For the patients Kimport talked to, going to such a center “didn’t meet all of their needs,” she said. “It didn’t even meet most of their needs.” Pregnancy resource centers as they exist today first began appearing in the 1960s, after states began liberalizing their abortion laws, according to Heartbeat International, which identifies itself as the country’s first network of such centers. Their spread increased after 1973, when the Supreme Court established Americans’ right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. Today, there are around 2,500 such centers across the country. In general, the centers’ goal is to encourage people to carry their pregnancies to term rather than having abortions. For example, Heartbeat International aims “to make abortion unwanted today and unthinkable for future generations,” according to its website. Heartbeat’s affiliates around the world — the organization says it has more than 2,800 facilities on six continents — offer a range of services. “Some pregnancy resource centers provide pregnancy tests and material aid (diapers, clothing, etc.) while other pregnancy help medical clinics offer limited ultrasounds, STI testing, and prenatal care,” said Andrea Trudden, the group’s director of communications and marketing, in an email to Vox. Some also offer financial aid courses or mentorship for couples. Pregnancy resource centers have been criticized in the past for ads and website copy that made them look like they offer abortions. In fact, they do not offer the procedure, and research has shown that their websites often include misinformation about its risks, like the false claim that abortion is linked to breast cancer or mental health problems. This has led to concerns that the centers will trick people into believing they offer abortion, then dissuade them from the procedure with false claims about its dangers. For Heartbeat International, individual affiliates have a lot of autonomy when it comes to services they offer and information they provide, Trudden said. But in general, “our clients have the right to choose an abortion, and they also have the right to know more fully what may be at stake in their decision.” Because of concerns about misinformation, however, Kimport wanted to learn more about why patients go to pregnancy resource centers, and what happens when they get there. Other researchers have studied the centers in recent years, often looking at the information presented on their websites. But, Kimport writes, “the voices of pregnant people who have visited the centers” are largely missing from the existing scholarship. So she and her team asked patients who came to prenatal care clinics in southern Louisiana and Baltimore, Maryland if they’d ever been to such a center, and if they were willing to talk about their experiences. The first surprise for Kimport was that relatively few patients had actually been to the centers. Over a two-year period from 2015 to 2017, she found just 21 people who had been to one and were comfortable talking about the experience (a few said they had visited a center but preferred not to talk about, but about 80 percent agreed to be interviewed). Nineteen of the 21 patients were black, one was Latina, and one was white; most worked low-wage jobs or were unemployed. The second surprise was that despite the centers’ mission to dissuade people from having abortions, most people were not even considering that option when they went to the centers. Just four of the 21 women were thinking about terminating the pregnancy when they went to the center, and all four were also thinking about continuing it. Most of them went to the centers not for help deciding what to do, but to get resources or services they needed for their pregnancies or eventual children. One woman, identified in the study as Samantha (all names are pseudonyms), needed proof of pregnancy to qualify for Medicaid insurance. Aya wanted proof of her pregnancy from an “official” entity because she believed it would help with her husband’s green card application. In contrast to the other facilities she called, the pregnancy resource center could see her for a same-day appointment at no charge, so she went there. All the women in the study were “deeply concerned about their ability to materially provide for a new baby,” Kimport writes, and some went to the centers at least in part to get baby products like clothes. “They had clothes, they had baby chairs and bouncers,” one woman told the researchers. “They offered a lot.” These items didn’t cost money, but they typically came with strings attached: namely, that pregnant people would keep coming to the center and participating in programs. “I went to a parenting class,” one said. “When you go, you watch, like, two movies, and you earn five [center] ‘dollars,’ and they give you a list of things that they have that you can shop for.” A points system is common at pregnancy resource centers, Trudden of Heartbeat International said. “It encourages continued learning while providing practical items for the family,” she added. “Many parents find this to be a great benefit and love the fact that they can provide for their family while learning life skills.” But in Kimport’s study, some of the women described the classes as unpleasant or upsetting. While respondents did report that the counseling they received was “religiously inflected,” Kimport said, that wasn’t necessarily the problem — in some cases the women were religious themselves. In one case, however, a woman was shown a video with an explicitly anti-abortion message and was angry that the center presumed she was seeking an abortion. Another woman felt hurt by a video because it reminded her of past trauma in her life. In some cases, the need to show up to appointments in order to get resources caused problems for women. One respondent, Katelyn, told researchers that the pregnancy resource center scheduled her appointment for a time when she was supposed to be working. “Desperate for the resources they offered and believing that attending all of the center’s appointments was important for the health of her pregnancy, Katelyn missed work to go to the appointment,” Kimport writes. Katelyn was fired, and she and her boyfriend ended up losing their apartment because they couldn’t pay rent. The findings underscore what other researchers have found about pregnancy resource centers and their offerings. “While their services may not cost money, they’re not necessarily free,” said Andrea Swartzendruber, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia who studies the centers. “They cost people’s time and energy.” Once they had attended classes, the women were not always able to choose what items they received. One woman, Danielle, said she was considering saving up her points to get something larger, but her counselor at the center “was like, ‘Oh, I’m just so excited. I want you to get something.’ So, she picked out a bottle, a blanket, a little set of lotions and some onesies.” Danielle was grateful for the items, but, Kimport writes, “they were not her own choice.” In general, the products the women reported getting were relatively minor, like prenatal vitamins, a water bottle, or baby clothes. All of the women in the study — including Katelyn — said their visit to a center was a positive experience. Many were grateful for the baby items they got, even if they weren’t necessarily what they would have chosen. One thing the centers did provide for respondents, Kimport writes, was a place where “their desire to have a child was supported and encouraged.” That’s significant because, as she notes, low-income women, especially women of color, are sometimes actively discouraged from having children, including by their health care providers. However, the centers are not truly “safe spaces for emotional support” for many people of color, Nourbese Flint, policy director at the reproductive justice organization Black Women for Wellness, told Vox. Black people who have visited pregnancy resource centers have told her they faced racist assumptions about things like their income or whether their fathers are in their lives, Flint said. They also, she said, sometimes heard the increasingly common anti-abortion message that abortion is a conspiracy against black people. That message implies that “black women are not able to make decisions about whether or not they want to keep a pregnancy by themselves,” she added — “that it’s just outside forces and we’re not smart enough to understand what’s best for our lives.” And overall, Kimport said, while pregnancy resource centers did supply some of what the study participants needed, “there were still, for many of the respondents, very acute social and material needs that were not met through going to these centers.” Pregnancy resource centers weren’t necessarily set up to meet all those needs — as Kimport noted, they are privately run and often staffed largely by volunteers. But increasingly, they’re being asked to take the place of social services agencies. In 1996, Missouri and Pennsylvania began to allocate state funding to pregnancy resource centers. Other states began to make similar moves, including Louisiana, which began devoting some of its budget for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families — meant to help low-income people with their basic needs — to programs offering “abortion alternatives,” including pregnancy resource centers. Today, 16 states directly fund the centers, Swartzendruber told Vox. Meanwhile, the Trump administration last year awarded a grant to Obria, a network of pregnancy resource centers in California, under Title X, a program designed to provide family planning support to low-income Americans. The same year, the administration issued a rule barring providers that receive Title X funds from providing or referring for abortions. That forced Planned Parenthood and many other providers that offer a full range of reproductive health services — including, in some cases, prenatal care — to stop taking Title X money, and some have closed as a result. Nationwide, research has shown that “decreases in the social safety net have been accompanied by a growth of privately run pregnancy resource centers,” Kimport said. But her research suggests that those centers aren’t offering the same services as the social safety net providers they’re supposed to replace — and that the help they do offer comes at a cost to pregnant people, even if that cost isn’t financial. Kimport acknowledged some limitations in her study. Since the people she interviewed had visited a prenatal care clinic after going to a pregnancy resource center, the study might not have captured the full range of experiences of people who went to the centers — for example, she might have gotten a different picture if she interviewed people who went to the center but then ended up getting abortions. And while most of the people in Kimport’s study were already decided about their pregnancies when they went to centers, Swartzendruber said her research suggests people go to such facilities for a variety of reasons, including help with decision-making. Still, the study can help flesh out Americans’ understanding of pregnancy resource centers — especially since research and media coverage delving into people’s experiences there has been relatively rare — as well as pointing out holes in the social safety net that cause some people to go to the centers in the first place. For example, Kimport said, “if you need proof of pregnancy in order to get on Medicaid, but it costs money to get an official proof of pregnancy, that does seem to be a contradiction.” And for Flint, the centers are “unfortunately capitalizing on a gap that we have in our system in terms of responding to the actual real needs of pregnant folks and the actual real needs of families.” Overall, the study is a reminder that for too many pregnant people in America, getting basic care and resources is difficult or impossible — and at least as of now, pregnancy resource centers don’t change that reality.",https://www.vox.com/2020/3/2/21146011/crisis-pregnancy-center-resource-abortion-title-x,11808
"America’s first generic abortion pill, explained",Anna North,2019-08-20T13:33:55+00:00,"In 2000, a new method of abortion became available in America: an oral medication called mifepristone. Previously, the procedure in the early stages of pregnancy often involved emptying the uterus by suction. But taken with another medication called misoprostol, mifepristone can end a pregnancy in the first 10 weeks without the need for an in-clinic procedure. Patients can go through much of the process in whatever setting they like, with whomever they like — or alone. For these reasons and others, medication abortion has skyrocketed in popularity since it was introduced. By 2014, it accounted for 45 percent of abortions before nine weeks. Despite its popularity, just one company has sold the drug on the American market in the past 19 years. This week, that changed: The company GenBioPro is putting the first generic version of the drug on the market. It believes its version could help bring down costs for patients, as well as ensuring that doctors have a reliable supply of the drug. “It’s always risky to have only one product of anything on the market,” Mary Fjerstad, the senior director of medical affairs at GenBioPro, told Vox. But even with a generic available for the first time, many obstacles to medication abortion remain. Doctors say the medication is extremely safe, yet it’s highly restricted: Patients have to get it in a doctor’s office, rather than at a pharmacy, and doctors have to go through a special process to get certified to dispense it. The result: many doctors don’t offer mifepristone, and patients can struggle to get it. GenBioPro sees its mission as promoting “reproductive autonomy,” its president, Evan Masingill, told Vox. And experts say a generic option will help patients to some degree. But the story of mifepristone is about much more than pills and supply chains; it’s about restrictions federal and state governments place on abortion medication, even though doctors say they’re not necessary for patient health. Medication abortion works like this: a person takes a single oral dose of mifepristone, which stops the pregnancy from progressing. Up to 48 hours later, the patient takes misoprostol, which causes the uterus to contract, essentially inducing a miscarriage. Patients typically experience bleeding and cramping, as with any miscarriage, but the process is very safe and quite effective: Complications occur in less than 1 percent of cases, and the drugs work to end a pregnancy 95 percent of the time. Mifepristone has historically been available in the US from just one company, Danco Laboratories, which sells it under the brand name Mifeprex (mifepristone is also sometimes called RU-486, a name that originated in Europe). But with GenBioPro’s pill, there will now be a second option. “As we started to do our analysis of the landscape and where we felt we could be most impactful, this product in particular came into our sights,” Masingill said. They sought FDA approval, received it in April, and officially launched the drug on Tuesday. According to GenBioPro, the introduction of a generic will lead to a more reliable supply of the drug. Fjerstad pointed to recent shortages of drugs like the anesthetic lidocaine, which forced some doctors to cancel surgeries and other treatments. Though no such shortages have been reported for Mifeprex, GenBioPro believes they may be more likely when there’s only one company selling mifepristone. “If there’s only one product on the market, if there’s any problem at all anywhere along the supply chain,” Fjerstad said, “it just creates a huge problem for clinics that need that medicine.” Then there’s the issue of cost. Mifeprex currently costs providers around $90 per pill, said Dr. Karen Meckstroth, a clinical professor at the University of California San Francisco and the medical director at a clinic that provides early abortions. Danco doesn’t make the cost of its drug public. GenBioPro won’t say exactly what the cost for its generic will be, but the company expects the introduction of its product to bring prices down through competition. “Whenever a generic comes to market usually the price is somewhat cheaper,” Fjerstad said. Overall, “having a generic on the market is extremely important for us as providers,” said Dr. DeShawn Taylor, GenBioPro’s senior medical director. “We all know and love someone who has had an abortion, and so we want to be able to expand access to a form of abortion that is extremely safe, effective, and is an FDA-approved way to end a pregnancy.” Doctors and experts outside GenBioPro say the introduction of a generic matters, but it’s unclear how much it will change things for patients. “To have different manufacturers definitely helps in terms of price competition and increased availability,” said Alina Salganicoff, senior vice president and director of women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “But at the end of the day, will medication become more available to women, will it become more affordable, is still an open question.” One reason for the uncertainty: The cost of the drug itself is only part of the cost of having a medication abortion. In 2014, patients paid an average of $538, compared with $508 for an in-clinic abortion at 10 weeks (many insurance plans don’t cover abortion, and most patients pay out of pocket). In addition to the pill itself, patients typically have to pay for the costs of doctor visits and lab work. Meanwhile, state laws can impose additional costs; for example, some states require patients to visit a clinic for pre-abortion counseling, then undergo a waiting period before actually getting the medication. Others require an ultrasound, an added expense, although doctors say it is not always necessary in cases of early abortion. “Anything that reduces cost eliminates some financial barriers,” Salganicoff said. But “if women still have to have multiple visits and they still have to have sonograms,” she added, “those cost money too.” A major barrier to getting mifepristone has to do with how it’s dispensed: The medication is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) imposed by the Food and Drug Administration. Under the REMS, the drug can’t be dispensed at a pharmacy like other medications (including its counterpart, misoprostol). It can only be provided by a doctor or other clinician who has gone through a special certification process. That process is a big deterrent for many doctors. “People are afraid they’re on a list,” Meckstroth said, referring to concerns about the stigma and harassment that abortion providers can face. You don’t have to be an OB-GYN or surgical abortion provider to get certified, Meckstroth said, meaning that in theory, patients could get the medication from their primary care doctors. But because of the onerous certification process, few primary care clinicians offer the medication. In fact, when Meckstroth’s team recently looked for primary care clinics or other general health centers in California that offered medication abortion outside an abortion clinic setting, they found just one — a clinic where she is a medical director. Abortion-rights advocates agree that the FDA requirements could limit the impact the GenBioPro pill will have. “While the generic form of mifepristone is important and long overdue, the real barrier to accessing medication abortion, especially for those living in rural and medically underserved areas, is the FDA’s unnecessary restrictions on how mifepristone is dispensed,” said June Gupta, director of medical standards at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement to Vox. Anti-abortion groups opposed the introduction of mifepristone in the US, and have argued that the current FDA guidelines are too lenient and insufficient to protect women’s health. But reproductive health groups and many doctors say the reverse is true. A REMS is intended for drugs with serious safety concerns, and experts have long argued that it’s not necessary for mifepristone, which is just as safe as many drugs available by ordinary prescription from a pharmacy. In fact, Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of the FDA when mifepristone was first approved in 2000, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year that the REMS should be reevaluated. “After nearly two decades of actual use, additional research, and a comprehensive review conducted by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM),” she and her co-author Helene D. Gayle wrote, “all of which clearly demonstrate that mifepristone is extremely safe and effective, we believe that the distribution restrictions may no longer be appropriate.” The FDA has the power to change or remove the REMS without action by Congress, but it has shown no sign of doing so. Until it does, doctors may remain unwilling to stock mifepristone, generic or not. In press materials announcing the introduction of the medication, GenBioPro expresses its commitment to abortion access: “We support the community of providers, patients, and advocates working to ensure universal access to quality, affordable reproductive health care for all.” But a drug company can only do so much to challenge a system of laws and regulations that makes medication abortion harder to get than other medications of comparable safety. And for now, the history of mifepristone in America is as much about what hasn’t changed as what has.",https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/20/20750226/abortion-pill-mifepristone-pregnancy-genbiopro-mifeprex-generic,11808
Independents back abortion rights. They’re less sure Democrats do.,Rachel M. Cohen,2023-05-08T11:00:00+00:00,"Democrats know that Republican attacks on abortion rights will be central to their efforts to reelect Joe Biden and regain full control of Congress in 2024. And for good reason — Democrats won competitive midterm races last fall while running on protecting reproductive freedom. Last month, inanother high-stakes election in Wisconsin,the judicial candidate who staunchly supported abortion rights beat her anti-abortion opponent by 11 points. Polls conducted over the last few months indicate that abortion remains top of mind for voters, who seem tohave grown even more supportive of abortion rights than they were before the Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturned the constitutional right to an abortionlast June. “I don’t think Democrats have fully processed that this country is now 10 to 15 percent more pro-choice than it was before Dobbs in state after state and national data,” pollster Celinda Lake said recently. But there is one worrying sign for Democrats in the polling data. Over the past two weeks, for example, two new national polls and data from three focus groups conducted in swing states (Ohio, North Carolina, and Michigan) indicated that significant numbers of independent voters remain confused and skeptical about where Republicans and Democrats stand on protecting abortion rights. The upside for Democrats is they may have substantial room to grow with these voters. One survey, conducted in mid-April by Marist Poll in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour, found 38 percent of independent voters think neither Democrats nor Republicans handle the abortion issue well, compared to just 10 percent of Democratic voters and 21 percent of Republican voters who felt the same. And when the progressive polling group Navigator asked voters in April what they thought came closest to the Democratic Party’s position on abortion, 34 percent of independents said they didn’t know enough to say, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats and 11 percent of Republicans. These gaps are significant, as most US adults self-identify as independent voters — 41 percent, according to Gallup, compared to 28 percent of adults who ID as Republican and 28 percent as Democrat. “Since 2009, independent identification has grown and reached levels not seen before,” Gallup reported this year. The surveys come as some abortion rights activists continue to raise frustrations with the president for what they see as his lackluster support for keeping abortion legal. While the Biden administration has done much to defend abortion rights since the Supreme Court issued its ruling last summer, the president himself has struggled to talk about abortion, relying largely on surrogates and euphemisms like “protect women’s health care” and “a woman’s right to choose.” In Biden’s recently released reelection launch video, he did not say “abortion” himself — though a woman was featured holding an “abortion is healthcare” protest sign. In February, Biden used the word “abortion” explicitly for the first time in a State of the Union address, though many activists were still upset he devoted just four sentences to the topic, and almost an hour into his speech. “It was, to be blunt, offensive,” feminist writer Jessica Valenti said after. The Biden administration did not return a request for comment. Bryan Bennett, a pollster with Navigator, said independents broadly report pro-choice attitudes, so the two new surveys suggest Biden and Democrats “have a real opportunity to talk more and crystallize” where they stand on abortion. Bennett noted that among independent women, the gaps were even higher, with 43 percent in their latest survey saying they weren’t sure what Democrats’ position on abortion was. “Focusing on that, and trying to reach that 34 percent of independents who don’t have a position, represents a real chance to drive that [pro-abortion rights] advantage,” he said. A majority of independent voters back abortion rights, though public opinion research indicates there may be some notable differences between their views and those of self-identified Democrats. For example, while a post-Dobbs Navigator survey found 84 percent of Democrats identified as “pro-choice,” the pollsters found just 54 percent of independents did. Thirty percent of independents in the same survey identified as “pro-life,” compared to 11 percent of Democrats. Heading into the 2022 midterms, pollsters found abortion rights to be a significantly motivating issue for independent voters, though again less motivating than for Democrats. A quarter of independents told Navigator the Dobbs decision made them “much more motivated” to vote in November, compared to 56percent of Democrats. And 41 percent of independents told KFF the decision made them “more motivated” to vote, compared to 64 percent of Democrats. A Wall Street Journal poll found 9 percent of independents ranked the Supreme Court ruling as the top issue among five choices motivating them to vote, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. In days immediately following the midterms, NARAL Pro-Choice America led exit surveys of voters in battleground states and found that while Democrats ranked abortion a top priority for Congress and the White House, independents did not. Still, independents definitely reported broad pro-choice attitudes in NARAL’s exit survey, with 54 percent saying they’d be less likely to support Republicans if they tried to pass more abortion bans, and 74 percent of independents said women and their doctors should make decisions about abortion, not politicians. When asked about the Marist/NPR survey finding high levels of distrust among independents for both Democrats and Republicans, Angela Vasquez-Giroux, NARAL’s vice president of research, noted that many voters support abortion access because they distrust politicians generally. “Voters don’t want politicians involved in their personal freedoms and personal medical decisions,” she told Vox. In late April, Navigator hosted three focus groups with women voters to learn more about how abortion issues continue to motivate Americans politically. The participants in Ohio and North Carolina were suburban women who identified as either weak Democrats, independents, or weak Republicans; the participants in Michigan were women of color who identified as either strong Democrats, weak Democrats, or independents. Each group had between seven and nine participants, and all had previously stated they either support the right to abortion or do not believe the government should prevent access to abortion even if they are personally against it. While these are tiny samples, researchers say the qualitative data from a focus group helps clarify voter beliefs and signals questions to more rigorously study in the future. Vox reviewed video footage and transcripts from the three focus groups and found in each some women who support abortion rights had significant trouble identifying Democrats’ and Republicans’ stances on abortion. “I think Democrats are pro-life and Republicans are against it,” said one participant in Ohio, when asked what Democrats and Republicans believe on abortion. In Michigan, a woman was asked how the two parties differ on abortionand how she would describe each party’s position. “I’m not sure,” the woman answered. “I really haven’t basically heard anything about which party is leaning toward it and which one isn’t.” When the focus group moderator pressed her to guess, she answered: “If I had to guess, I would say Democrat would probably be against it and Republican probably would be for it.” In North Carolina, a participant said she wasn’t sure where the parties stand on abortion and had been surprised Roe v. Wade was overturned under a Democrat. “Okay, but did Joe Biden have a say in whether or not it was overturned?” the focus group moderator asked. “No, but he helped get the Supreme judges where they are.” The moderator then informed the woman that the most recent judges came in under Donald Trump. Confusion among independents has been reflected in some other polling data. For example, in a survey conducted in the two weeks after Dobbs, 23 percent of independents said they don’t know if abortion rights were at risk in their state, compared to just 5 percent of Democrats who said the same. Likewise, while a majority of independents said in the same survey they would support a nationwide law that protects the right of a woman to have an abortion, 18 percent of independents said they weren’t sure either way, suggesting there might be more need to clarify for voters what that means. One Democratic pollster, speaking on background, said the data about independents was great to have and provides “actionable information” for campaigns ahead of 2024. Other leaders have been more hesitant to suggest Democrats could benefit from new tactics to target pro-choice independents — saying the recent election results in Democrats’ favor speak for themselves. “Time and time again, whether it was the 2022 midterms, ballot initiatives, or special elections in Virginia and Wisconsin, voters continue to prove that they will support the candidate who will protect their reproductive freedom,” said Jenny Lawson, the vice president of organizing and electoral campaigns at Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “The data is clear and we have the receipts: Anti-abortion politicians are on the losing side of the issue.” Vasquez-Giroux of NARAL also defended Biden’s rhetoric. “I think the president is doing a pretty good job of being clear about where he stands, and [regarding] the reelection video — taking one example out is not fully representative,” she said. “And you do have [Vice President] Kamala Harris out on the road talking about abortion. It should be clear where the administration stands.”",https://www.vox.com/policy/23710432/independents-abortion-democrats-midterms-2024-election-voters,11808
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a law this year that mandated funerals for fetuses,Emily Crockett,2016-10-03T20:59:00+00:00,"It’s no secret that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Donald Trump’s running mate, opposes abortion rights. Pence basically invented the Republican Party's war on Planned Parenthood while he was in Congress. He wants Roe v. Wade to beoverturned. He signed every anti-abortion bill that crossed his desk as governor of Indiana. But Pence signed one anti-abortion bill in March of this year that was so extreme, even some pro-life Republicans opposed it. And it was eventually blocked from going into effect by a federal judge for violating women’s right to choose. The law did something truly bizarre. It would have basically forced women to seek funerary services for a fetus — whether she’d had an abortion or a miscarriage, and no matter how far along the pregnancy was. The law Pence backed would have required all fetal tissue to be cremated or buried, an unprecedented measure in state law. The law also banned abortion if the fetus had a ""disability"" — which would have denied women the right to end a pregnancy even in case of serious fetal anomalies. The wording of the burial provision meant that technically, even if a woman had a miscarriage at eight weeks of pregnancy at home, she would have to keep the blood and tissue, take it to a hospital or clinic, and have it buried or cremated by a funeral home. The law would have also dramatically increased the cost of an abortion, since providers would have had to spend time and money on arranging the funerary services. And since about half of miscarriages happen shortly after a fertilized egg is implanted, and occur at roughly the same time a woman would expect her period, many women could be having a miscarriage and not even know it — and thus, technically be violating the law if they didn’t cremate or bury the resulting tissue. As a protest against the new law's extreme requirements, women who opposed the law started a Facebook group called ""Periods for Pence."" Members of the group started calling Pence’s office in droves to tell him about their periods in graphic detail. ""Any period could potentially be a miscarriage,"" wrote the anonymous founder of Periods for Pence in an introductory post. ""I would certainly hate for any of my fellow Hoosier women to be at risk of penalty"" if they don't properly dispose of or report a potential miscarriage. The idea of women reporting their periods as a legal precaution sounds absurd and Orwellian. But it's also what happens when you take a law as bizarre and medically incoherent as Indiana's to its logical conclusion. Anti-abortion laws like the one Pence signed are often criticized for being medically incoherent — for requiring doctors to do things that make no sense from a medical perspective, or restricting abortion in ways that fail to account for the medical realities of pregnancy. Pence also fell afoul of medical reality in 2015, when Indiana faced a devastating HIV outbreak. Pence arguably helped prolong the outbreak by waiting two months to authorize a clean needle distribution plan. And Pence's budget cuts that shuttered a rural Planned Parenthood arguably helped cause the outbreak in the first place. Trump often comes across as incoherent and inconsistent on the issue of abortion. But Trump's choice of Pence as running mate helps indicate that Trump is willing to go all in on banning abortion in America.",https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12190380/mike-pence-trump-vice-president-abortion-funerals-fetuses,11808
How abortion bans make inequality worse,Laura Bult,2022-07-08T15:27:26+00:00,"In 2008, researchers with the University of California San Francisco embarked on a study that compared the outcomes of two similar groups of women, each at a crucial juncture in their lives: a visit to an abortion clinic. The groups differed, though, in whether or not their abortion actually happened. It was called the Turnaway Study, named for those who were turned away by the clinic because their pregnancies were past legal gestational limits, and it provides some of the best data we have on the impacts of abortion bans. Among the study’s findings is the severe financial impact of being forced to parent a new child when someone is already living in difficult financial circumstances. People who seek abortions, especially later-term abortions, are far more likely than the general population to be living in poverty or otherwise financially unstable. That fact makes it unsurprising that, when researchers asked women about their reasons for seeking an abortion, not being financially prepared was the most common reason. This video offers a glimpse into the financial penalty of parenting under difficult circumstances. We interviewed several women who had similar experiences to the women in the study. We didn’t seek out interviewees who exactly reflected the circumstances of the study participants (i.e., the length of gestation when they sought an abortion, or their socioeconomic background), but their stories reveal some parallels: Most people want an abortion because they don’t feel financially stable or don’t have a partner they want to co-parent with. The Turnaway Study also looked at mental health outcomes, relationship outcomes, and whether or not study participants chose adoption instead of parenting. Whether or not they chose adoption is relevant to common anti-abortion rhetoric, which encourages people to give unwanted children up for adoption rather than choose abortion. But the Turnaway Study found that 91 percent of women who were denied an abortion chose to parent, which indicates that adoption is not a feasible alternative for most people. We interviewed Gretchen Sisson, a researcher who looked at adoption rates and motivations among the Turnaway Study participants. And we also interviewed Katie Woodruff, who analyzed news coverage of abortion.

Why the Kansas abortion amendment is so confusing,Rachel M. Cohen,2022-08-02T13:55:35+00:00,"Editor’s note, August 3, 2022: This story was originally published on July 27, and on August 2, 2022, Kansans voted to reject this amendment. For Vox’s latest coverage of the results, click here. On Tuesday in Kansas, abortion rights will be tested at the polls for the first time since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In 2019, Kansas’s Supreme Court ruled that the state’s constitution protects the right to an abortion. Now voters are asked to weigh in on a proposed amendment that would explicitly remove that right, opening the way for Kansas’s Republican-controlled legislature to further restrict or ban abortion, just as neighboring Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri have done. The other elections taking place Tuesday are the state’s Democratic and Republican primaries, althoughregistered independents — who compose 29 percent of Kansas’s electorate — may also vote on the abortion amendment. The timing is intentional: Republican lawmakers placed the measure on the August primary ballot instead of into the November general election in hopes thatturnout remains low. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the state roughly two to one. Four other states will vote on abortion-related ballot measures later this year, all in November. In Kansas, millions of dollars are pouring in from supporters and opponents of the amendment, and the outcome is being closely watched nationwide as a potential signal of how energized voters are about abortion rights. The outcome will also have major implications not only for Kansas residents but also for women from across the region who depend on Kansas for reproductive careas their own states shut down abortion access. The Guttmacher Institute predicts Kansas could see a more than 1,000 percent increase in abortions in the post-Roe era as neighboring states outlaw the procedure. You’d be forgiven if you had trouble making sense of the amendment’s text, which would add a paragraph to the state’s constitution that says both “Kansas does not require government funding of abortion” and that people, through their elected officials, “may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, laws that account for circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or circumstances of necessity to save the life of the mother.” The language could trip up the average voter, said Neal Allen, a political scientist at Wichita State University. “You could read it and think you were voting to eliminate state funding of abortion when there is no state funding to abortion,” he told Vox. “And there is language that refers to exceptions to preserve the health of the mother, and for rape and incest, but there’s nothing about the amendment itself that would create those exceptions.” Supporters of the amendment, organizing under the banner of “Value Them Both” — a reference to valuing “women and unborn children” — have been working to convince voters that a “yes” vote on the amendment would not lead to an abortion ban and would simply allow lawmakers to regulate the procedure. Many of their claims have been dubious at best, and have generated significant confusion. Value Them Both supporters have stressed in their advertisements that the amendment “restores our ability to place basic regulations on the abortion industry.”In fact, abortion remains highly regulated in Kansas. They say the amendment would merely allow lawmakers to impose rules like requiring parental consent, “stopping painful late-term abortions,” and barring public funding of abortion. But Kansas already requires parental consent, already bans public funding of abortion, and already bans abortion after 22 weeks. If the amendment passes, nothing could stop Republican lawmakers from passing a total or near-total abortion ban, and political experts say the likelihood of such restrictions moving forward in that context is very high. Richard Levy, a constitutional law professor at the University of Kansas, told Vox that even though the amendment is not itself a ban on abortion, it’s safe to assume Kansas lawmakers would adopt highly restrictive abortion laws if the amendment passes. He pointed to the supermajority of Republicans in the House and Senate, the Kansas legislature’s long history of adopting laws intended to limit abortion, and to the fact that the amendment’s supporters have indicated that’s their goal. Earlier this spring, a Kansas Republican lawmaker introduced a bill to ban abortion statewide with no exceptions for rape or incest. It did not receive a hearing or vote, but last month a regional director from the Value Them Both coalition was caught on tape telling a group of Republicans that they stand ready to support the bill if the amendment passes. A Value Them Both spokesperson did not return Vox’s request for comment, but told Kansas Reflector that the regional director “is no longer with the organization and didn’t speak on behalf of the coalition.” Kansas — a reliably Republican state at the national level — has a long history of conflict over abortion rights. In 1991, a Wichita abortion clinic, at the time among the few in the country that would provide third-trimester abortions for women with life-threatening pregnancies or severe fetal abnormalities, became a magnet for protesters in what was seen as a sign of an emboldened national movement against abortion rights. In 2009, the doctor who performed those abortions, George Tiller, was murdered while attending church. The Kansas state legislature banned abortion after 22 weeks in 2012 and passed a law in 2013 stating that life began at fertilization. But voters in Kansas have repeatedly expressed opposition to full abortion bans.One poll released last year from Fort Hays State University found 60 percent of Kansas residents opposed making abortion illegal in all circumstances, including in instances of rape, incest, or where a woman’s health is at risk. A narrow majority of respondents — 50.5 percent — also said their state government “should not place any regulations on the circumstances under which women can get abortions” compared to just a quarter who disagreed. The first public poll of the Kansas amendment was released July 18, and found only 5 percent of likely primary voters supported a total abortion ban. Near-total bans, such as those passed in neighboring states, were also deeply unpopular with survey respondents. Russell Arben Fox, a political science professor at the Wichita-based Friends University, also believes Republicans would “absolutely” pursue a ban on abortion if the amendment were to pass. “The simple truth is that anyone with even a minimal understanding of Kansas politics must realize that pursuing a total ban is exactly the kind of policy that the Republican leadership will pursue,” he told Vox. “Besides the obvious influence which fervent anti-abortion conservatives have long had within the Republican Party in Kansas, and besides the fact that one of the leaders of the pro-Value Them Both movement was caught on tape ... there is also the fact that we know that game plans detailing the introduction and passage of complete state abortion bans, prepared by the National Right to Life Committee, have been circulating among top Republicans in Topeka all summer.” One of the first hurdles for organizers working to preserve abortion rights in the state is helping voters understand what they’re voting on. Ashley All, a spokesperson for Kansas for Constitutional Freedom, the coalition organizing against the amendment, told Vox it’s been “pretty challenging” to make sure that voters understand the implications of the proposal. The amendment is in response to a 2019 Kansas state Supreme Court ruling that concluded the state constitution’s protection of personal autonomy includes an individual’s right to end a pregnancy. The Supreme Court case came about from a challenge to a 2015 ban passed by the Kansas legislature on dilation and evacuation, a second-trimester abortion procedure. Following the 2019 decision, the D&E ban was struck down as unconstitutional. Abortion restrictions are not inherently prohibited,the state Supreme Court ruled, but as of 2019 they must be narrowly tailored, which the D&E ban wasn’t. Value Them Both supporters argue that all restrictions are now “presumed unconstitutional,” though legal and political experts say that’s a poorly supported position. “In the three years since the decision was handed down, only the law originally challenged in the lawsuit and one additional Kansas abortion law, one dealing with the excessive health regulations the state government has imposed on abortion clinics, has been overturned,” noted Fox. Though Kansas is a Republican state that leans conservative, it has some distinguishing characteristics from other neighboring red states. Allen, from Wichita State University, says one factor is that Kansas has a relatively higher percentage of college-educated whites, which Democrats made gains with during the Trump era. Neal also attributes state-specific factors that have helped Democrats over the last decade, such as highly unpopular Republican tax cuts that hurt schools and other public services. In 2018, Kansas voters elected Laura Kelly, a moderate Democrat, to be governor. Both sides spent millions of dollars ahead of August 2, each emphasizing language in advertising around freedom from government overreach. Financial disclosure forms filed recently showed that Kansans for Constitutional Freedom raised more than $6.5 million to fight the amendment, while Value Them Both raised about $4.7 million. Most of the funding in support of the amendment has come from religious groups, the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas in particular. A public poll of the campaign released in July found 47 percent of likely primary voters planned to vote for the amendment, and 43 percent planned to vote against it. But the pollsters also found Democrats were significantly more likely than Republicans to say the abortion amendment “increased the importance of voting in this upcoming election” — suggesting differences in motivation. Past political science research has found a “status quo bias” when it comes to abortion-related ballot measures; voters are more likely to reject measures on Election Day they otherwise tell pollsters they support. These dynamics bode well for advocates who want to keep the state constitution unchanged. Allen, from Wichita State, thinks Kansas for Constitutional Freedom is still “an underdog” but wouldn’t be surprised if the amendment fails. “And that’s not what most of us who pay attention to Kansas politics thought six months ago,” he told Vox, attributing the shift primarily to the national backlash to the Dobbs decision, as well as to the fact that the new laws in neighboring states give more detail into what’s possible if the amendment passes. Young, independent voters in particular could be pivotal to the final outcome, Allen predicts. Update, August 2, 12 pm ET: This story has been updated with information about other upcoming votes this fall.",https://www.vox.com/23273455/kansas-abortion-roe-dobbs-ballot-initiative-constitutional-amendment,11808
"The unconstitutional plan to stop women from traveling out of state for an abortion, explained",Ian Millhiser,2023-09-12T19:25:00+00:00,"More than a year ago, anti-abortion activists appeared eager to prohibit anyone seeking an abortion in a state where it is banned from traveling to another state where it is legal. Indeed, many lawmakers appeared so eager to enact such travel bans that Justice Brett Kavanaugh, of all people, attempted to cut off these laws before they could be enacted. “May a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion?” Kavanaugh asked in his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022), the decision overruling Roe v. Wade. “In my view, the answer is no,” Kavanaugh replied to his own question, “based on the constitutional right to interstate travel.” The Constitution has long been understood to allow US citizens to travel among the states. For the most part, state and local lawmakers have not tested whether Kavanaugh would hold to this view if a travel ban actually became law. But a few jurisdictions in Texas are now breaking with this consensus. As the Washington Post reports, two Texas counties and two Texas cities have passed local ordinances making it illegal to transport someone through one of these counties or cities for the purpose of obtaining an out-of-state abortion. Notably, this list of anti-abortion localities includes Mitchell County, Texas, a sparse community of about 9,000 people. This matters because Interstate 20, the route that many people traveling from Dallas to New Mexico to receive an abortion will take, passes through Mitchell County. Several other counties with major highways or airports are also considering similar laws. These ordinances and proposed ordinances largely track model legislation, which anti-abortion activist Mark Lee Dickson shared on Twitter, that is itself modeled after SB 8 — the statewide anti-abortion law that allows private bounty hunters to sue abortion providers and collect bounties of $10,000 or more. In fairness, Dickson’s model legislation does prohibit such bounty hunter suits from being filed against “the pregnant woman who seeks to abort her unborn child.” But the legislation would potentially allow abortion funds that help pay for abortion care, or anyone who drives a pregnant patient to an out-of-state abortion clinic, to be sued. Ordinarily, Kavanaugh’s preemptive rejection of travel bans would be a clear sign that these laws will not survive judicial review. But, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson (2021), the Supreme Court effectively shut down federal lawsuits challenging unconstitutional laws that are enforced solely by bounty hunters. And Kavanaugh joined the Court’s decision in Jackson. The upshot is that these unconstitutional Texas ordinances may succeed, not because they are lawful but because the Supreme Court has largely immunized them from constitutional review. Citizens of the United States have a right to travel freely among the states. As the Supreme Court said in Shapiro v. Thompson (1969), “the nature of our Federal Union and our constitutional concepts of personal liberty unite to require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.” Indeed, the Supreme Court held over 150 years ago that states may not impose even fairly insignificant barriers on US citizens who wish to travel outside that state. This issue arose in Crandall v. Nevada (1867), which struck down a Nevada law that imposed a tax of one dollar “upon every person leaving the State by any railroad, stage coach, or other vehicle engaged or employed in the business of transporting passengers for hire.” In striking down this fairly small tax, the Court spoke in sweeping terms about each citizen’s right to travel freely. “We are all citizens of the United States, and as members of the same community must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States,” the Court declared in Crandall. Moreover, the Court also made clear that this rule applies equally to “persons residing in the State who may wish to get out of it, and upon persons not residing in it who may have occasion to pass through it.” Again, Crandall involved a fairly minor imposition on travelers: a single dollar tax (about $18 in today’s value). If the Constitution does not permit such a small burden to be laid on interstate travelers, it follows that a state or local government may not effectively take someone hostage for months — potentially for the duration of their pregnancy — in order to prevent them from leaving the state to obtain an abortion. As the Court explained in Saenz v. Roe (1999), the right to travel has “three different components” — the right of citizens to “enter and to leave another State,” the right to be treated “as a welcome visitor” when visiting another state, and the right to be treated the same way as established residents of a state after moving to that state. Each of these rights flows from a different provision of the Constitution. Of those three components, the right to travel out of state to obtain an abortion flows from the right to citizens to “enter and leave another State,” and the Court indicated in Edwards v. California (1941) that this right is rooted in a doctrine known as the dormant commerce clause. The Constitution gives Congress the power to “regulate commerce ... among the several states,” and the Court has long held that, by vesting authority over multi-state commerce in the national government, the Constitution implicitly prevents states from enacting laws that impose excessive burdens on commerce among the states. That includes laws that burden people’s ability to travel across state lines. As Edwards held, “it is settled beyond question that the transportation of persons is ‘commerce.’” For what it’s worth, Dickson told the Washington Post that his model ordinance is lawful because it is similar to the federal Mann Act, which makes it illegal to transport “any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.” If the Mann Act is constitutional, he argued, so too must a travel ban targeting abortions be constitutional. Dickson might have a point if Congress enacted a Mann Act-like law that prohibits interstate travel to obtain an abortion. But, again, the Constitution gives Congress, and not state or local governments, exclusive authority over interstate commerce. Neither Texas nor any Texas county may pass a law that targets conduct occurring in New Mexico. Nor may they prevent people in Texas from leaving the state. The Court’s decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson looms over this discussion of travel bans like a plague. Dickson’s model legislation was clearly written with Jackson in mind, as it relies on the sort of private bounty hunters that the Court embraced in Jackson. As a general rule, someone who fears that their rights will be curtailed by an unconstitutional state or local law may obtain a federal court order blocking that law. The Supreme Court held in Ex parte Young (1908) that someone seeking such a court order must sue the specific state official who is tasked with enforcing the unconstitutional law. So, for example, if Texas passed a law ordering the state police to blockade I-20 to prevent anyone from traveling on it to obtain an abortion, a plaintiff who wished to block this law might sue the head of the state’s police force. SB 8, the law the Court embraced in Jackson, tried to immunize itself from judicial review by stating that no state official may attempt to enforce it — only private bounty hunters filing lawsuits could do so. And, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court agreed that this bounty hunter framework immunized the law from federal lawsuits seeking to block it. In fairness, someone who is sued under SB 8 could still allege at their trial that the law is unconstitutional. But SB 8 permits virtually anyone to sue any abortion provider who performs an abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. So anyone accused of violating the law risked being bombarded with so many lawsuits that their legal fees would bankrupt them. That’s why it was so important to block the law before anyone was sued under it, and why the Supreme Court’s decision to immunize SB 8 from federal review was such a harsh blow to abortion rights in Texas. Meanwhile, Dickson’s model legislation uses a similar mechanism to evade judicial review. Under that legislation, the ban on traveling through the wrong Texas county to help someone obtain an abortion “shall be enforced exclusively through ... private civil actions.” As a practical matter, it’s unclear if this framework will actually be effective in deterring people from traveling to New Mexico to seek abortions. If a man drives his pregnant girlfriend through Mitchell County on the way to an abortion clinic in New Mexico, how is anyone other than the two of them supposed to know where they are headed? But the law could wind up deterring women in abusive relationships, or other patients whose acquaintances or family members learn that they are seeking an abortion. Indeed, according to the Washington Post, Dickson suggested that “a husband who doesn’t want his wife to get an abortion could threaten to sue the friend who offers to drive her.” If that lawsuit happens, the wife’s friend should prevail — he can argue at trial that the Mitchell County ordinance violates the constitutional right to travel. But even if this friend does prevail, they will wind up having to hire legal counsel and endure the stress of a lawsuit that never should have been filed in the first place.",https://www.vox.com/23868962/texas-abortion-travel-ban-unconstitutional,11808
Biden’s chance to go bolder on abortion rights,Li Zhou,2022-06-27T23:30:00+00:00,"This past weekend, more than 30 Democratic senators had a message for President Joe Biden: They want him to do more to protect abortion rights, and they want him to do it now. “There is no time to waste,” they said in the letter, which was led by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and sent one day after the Supreme Court announced its decision to officially roll back Roe v. Wade. “You have the power to fight back and lead a national response to this devastating decision.” This letter is the latest indication of growing pressure on the White House to take additional executive actions in response to the fall of Roe. While Biden is not able to reinstate the protections offered by Roe without Congress, lawmakers and activists have clamored for the president to take other steps, such as finding ways for the federal government to defend abortion access in every state. Many of these proposals would likely be challenged in court, but proponents emphasize that they’d like to see the administration give them a try before forgoing them completely. For months, some abortion rights advocates have felt that the White House hasn’t been doing enough to address the urgency of the situation, whether that’s weighing more ambitious policies or simply speaking out more forcefully on the subject. Many were disappointed, for instance, to find that Biden hadn’t used the word “abortion” in any presidential speech until recently. The White House has taken some initial steps — and signaled that further action is on the way — while stopping short of laying out a comprehensive strategy. In a statement on Friday, Biden said he would combat any efforts to prevent people from traveling across state lines for abortions and indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services would work to preserve access to medication abortions to the “fullest extent possible.” Activists, though, feel there are more avenues the White House should consider.“This is not a time for speeches and hoping people will vote in November,” said Renee Bracey Sherman, the executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group.“It’s a time to get creative … to try something and see what happens.” The main thing that advocates and many Democrats want from Biden is to take more aggressive actions, even if they’re expected to face legal challenges. These actions — coupled with inclusive rhetoric about abortions — could send a powerful message about the Biden administration’s solidarity with those affected by the bans. As of early this week, nine states have already implemented trigger laws that include either bans on abortion or severe limitations in access. Additional ideas that have been suggested include a proposal championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) that would establish abortion clinics on federal lands in states where there are existing bans. Because federal lands aren’t subject to states’ civil laws and there’s room to interpret criminal laws, clinics could theoretically establish themselves on places like military bases without having to deal with a state’s bans. “Even though the land is inside the border of a state, it wouldn’t be governed by the laws of a state,” Khiara Bridges, the faculty director of UC Berkeley’s Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice, previously told Vox. Experts note that there is a precedent for federal lands to operate under a different set of policies than state-owned ones. Drexel University law professor David Cohen told Vox that there are past cases when a state’s right-to-work laws have not applied to how companies approach unionization if they are located on federal lands. Still, it’s an idea that could face legal pushback depending on how federal funds are used. If the clinics are paying the federal government to rent the lands, such an arrangement could circumvent the issue of the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal spending on most abortions. If federal funds are utilized to set these clinics up, their legal standing could be dicier. The Congressional Black Caucus has called on Biden to declare a national public health emergency, much as he did during the pandemic. When it came to Covid-19, establishing a public health emergency helped prioritize federal dollars for resources like vaccines — though, again, that might be tougher with abortions due to the Hyde Amendment.The caucus as well as many activists believe such an action could help Biden demonstrate how serious the existing crisis is. Other ideas that have been floated include using federal money to provide vouchers to people traveling across state lines for abortions and enforcing the use of federal Medicaid dollars to provide coverage in the narrow instances in which they can be used. These schemes also face implementation questions, with the first possibly running afoul of the Hyde Amendment and the second facing uncertainty about enforcement. Despite condemning the Supreme Court’s decision, the administration has repeatedly cautioned that there’s only so much it can legally accomplish. “We’re going to continue to see what else we can do,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Saturday. “I guess what I’m trying to say about the executive actions is that nothing could fill the hole that this decision has made.” That may be true, but many Democrats — lawmakers and voters alike — want to see Biden at least show that he’s fighting for people on the issue. So far, a key area of focus is medication abortion: On Friday, Biden said he’d be directing the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, to ensure that people could maintain access to medication abortion, though he offered few specifics on what this would entail. The FDA has already issued regulations that make it easier to obtain a medication abortion, policies that could counter state bans. In April 2021, it approved changes that enabled people to receive a prescription via telemedicine and get medication through the mail, a regulation the agency made permanent in December. Nineteen states, however, have passed laws that directly contradict the FDA’s regulations, requiring people to consume abortion pills with a clinician present. Legal experts argue that the Department of Justice could challenge these laws since federal regulations supersede state policies. Attorney General Merrick Garland has said that states can’t ban people’s access to medication abortions, though he has not yet detailed how the DOJ will enforce this. According to Politico Playbook, the administration is still reviewing other possibilities amid constraints posed by congressional inaction. Due to the filibuster, lawmakers have limited recourse to pass legislation in the Senate, where many bills can’t advance without 60 votes. And given their one-vote majority, Democrats’ ability to approve any abortion rights legislation this term appears highly unlikely. With that avenue closed, many advocates and lawmakers have been clear that they’ll continue to lobby Biden to take a stronger and more decisive stance. “We’re going to be loud. We’re going to be relentless. Because, Mr. President, we need a plan to protect reproductive rights in America — and we need it now,” Murray said at a June press conference.",https://www.vox.com/2022/6/27/23185624/biden-abortion-rights-executive-actions,11808
How blue cities in red states are resisting abortion bans,Nicole Narea,2022-06-29T21:10:00+00:00,"Mayors of blue cities in red states are leading a local charge to push back on laws criminalizing abortion now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. But there’s only so much they can do to shield abortion providers from prosecution and improve access to the procedure in states that have made it illegal or will soon do so. “I do anticipate that there’s more that blue cities and red states can do to fight back against this government overreach and stripping women of their fundamental rights,” Cincinnati, Ohio, Mayor Aftab Pureval told Vox. Cities can’t make abortion legal in states that have outlawed it. They can take steps to decriminalize the procedure and potentially limit any adverse consequences that pregnant people who have abortions and abortion providers might face. But they can’t give abortion seekers what they need the most: access to the procedure. In the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson, the case that overturned Roe, cities in Texas, Ohio, and Arizona have begun working within these limits by taking steps to ensure that local law enforcement resources don’t go toward targeting abortion-related crimes. Of those states, Texas is the only one with a “trigger law” outlawing abortion immediately after the overturn of Roe. That law briefly went into effect following the Supreme Court ruling before it was temporarily blocked by a state court earlier this week. Ohio’s ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy went into effect on Friday, and the state is expected to ban all abortions later this year. And Arizona has an abortion ban on the books that predates the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe. Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler responded to Dobbs by co-sponsoring a resolution — drafted in the weeks before the Court’s decision and that could be voted on as early as this week — that would update city policy to deprioritize the investigation or enforcement of any charges related to pregnancy and abortion. It would also prevent the use of city funding for information sharing, data collection, and surveillance related to abortion services and other reproductive health decisions. There are some exceptions for when “coercion or force” is used against a pregnant person or in cases involving criminal negligence related to a pregnant person’s health. Pureval has commissioned a report on potential opportunities to decriminalize abortion in Cincinnati and to prioritize law enforcement resources to protect the health and safety of pregnant people and medical care providers. Additionally, he’s reached out to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot for opportunities to collaborate, anticipating that Illinois will be the closest state where Ohioans can get abortions, he told Vox. “We are looking at ways to decriminalize abortion in our city or, at the very least, make it clear that our priorities for our public safety dollars, namely our Cincinnati Police Department, are for issues like gun violence and other violent crimes in our communities, and not invading our local hospitals and investigating our doctors and women in our city,” he said. Phoenix, Arizona, Mayor Kate Gallego told Axios that she has “no interest in criminalizing health care providers” and is working with the city’s attorneys to find the “most effective ways to protect our residents and women’s health care.” And the Tucson, Arizona, City Council voted earlier this month to order its police department not to arrest people violating state anti-abortion laws. Other cities are investigating similar measures. Cities in North Carolina, for example, which has a pre-Roe abortion ban on the books that has not yet been enforced, have also taken steps to protect abortion providers and pregnant people. Durham passed a resolution in March declaring the city a “sexual and reproductive health care safe zone, ensuring the people’s right to reproductive freedom, and naming these rights as fundamental.” The city council in Raleigh is weighing similar actions, including requests from abortion rights advocates to protect abortion clinics in the city with buffer zones and noise ordinances and block the Raleigh Police Department from collecting data stored on menstrual cycle tracking apps. It’s not yet clear, however, whether any of these measures will make a meaningful difference in preventing the prosecution of abortions. There are still ways that state law enforcement agencies can get around blue cities’ attempts to thwart the enforcement of abortion bans. The state attorney general’s office and district attorneys can still seek civil and criminal penalties against people who violate state abortion laws in blue cities. Abortion providers are also bound by the rules of state medical boards, which could revoke or suspend the licenses of providers they see as defying state regulations. States with bans on the books are debating how strictly they intend to enforce them. Texas is going as far as encouraging surveillance of women and prosecuting doctors. Other states, like South Dakota, have announced that they won’t file criminal charges against people who get abortions. But state resources to enforce the bans might be limited if cities won’t cooperate. In some ways, it’s similar to what’s been happening with marijuana legalization. While it might still be illegal in places like Texas to possess any amount of marijuana, cities like Austin have agreed not to bring charges against someone who possesses a misdemeanor amount of the drug, meaning that it’s unlikely they’d face legal repercussions unless state law enforcement somehow got involved. Again, none of these cities’ efforts will increase in-state access. But there are things many mayors can do to try to make abortion more accessible. Cincinnati is trying one of these, by repealing a decades-old ordinance that prevented the city health plan from covering abortions, meaning the procedure would now be covered. Anyone taking advantage of that benefit would need to leave the state to do so, but Pureval said that the city would reimburse them for the costs of traveling. “We also hope that this will encourage other large employers in our city, including Kroger, which already has announced that they’ll be doing something similar from a travel reimbursement perspective,” Pureval said.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/29/23188737/abortion-bans-austin-cincinnati-phoenix-tucson-raleigh,11808
What the Ohio special election results mean for abortion rights,Rachel M. Cohen,2023-08-09T13:14:39+00:00,"On Tuesday, Ohio voters rejected a Republican proposal known as Issue 1 that would have made it harder for citizens to put issues on the ballot or for a constitutional amendment to pass in the state. It lost by 14 percentage points, earning just 43 percent of the vote. The outcome has big implications for this fall’s election: In November, Ohio voters will decide on a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. And political analysts say the ramifications could extend into 2024 — when Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is up for reelection in Ohio and when Democrats hope to win big nationally by motivating voters on issues of protecting abortion rights and democracy. The amendment would have raised the state’s threshold for passing constitutional amendments from a simple majority of votes, as has been the case for over 100 years, to 60 percent, which its GOP sponsors hoped would be too high a bar for abortion rights supporters to clear. But the measure backfired, with analysts calling the election for the “no” side shortly after polls closed Tuesday night. Still, passage of the abortion rights amendment in November is no foregone conclusion; while polling so far bodes well for supporters, most citizen-led ballot measures in Ohio historically have failed. Kelly Hall, the executive director of the progressive ballot measure group Fairness Project, hailed the victory as an “incredibly profound and inspiring day for our democracy.” She said her national organization looks forward “to an aggressive campaign in the coming months” to protect Ohio abortion rights in November. Rhiannon Carnes, spokesperson for Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, released a statement Tuesday night laying out the stakes for the future of abortion access following Issue 1’s defeat. “Ohioans know that if we don’t succeed,” she said, referring to the November referendum, “the government will have the power to ban abortion completely, even in cases of rape, incest, or when someone’s life is in danger.” In November, voters in Ohio will weigh in on a proposed amendment for reproductive freedom that would restore the right to an abortion up to the point of fetal viability — or the point at which a fetus could survive outside the womb. The amendment would also permit abortions beyond that point in cases when “the pregnant patient’s treating physician” deems it necessary to protect their life or health. Though abortion is currently legal in Ohio through 22 weeks of pregnancy, a state law barring abortion after 6 weeks, with no exceptions for rape, is currently tied up in the courts. Pro-choice Ohio doctors led the push for the abortion rights measure on the upcoming November ballot, stressing that their ability to provide proper medical care is at urgent stake. Restricting abortion rights was the primary reason Republicans placed Issue 1 on the ballot for the August special election. GOP officials recognized they could make it harder for any constitutional amendment to pass in November by changing the rules in advance. A poll from June found nearly 60 percent of Ohioans support the idea of a proposed amendment for reproductive freedom, but nearly 60 percent would not be enough to pass under the parameters of Issue 1. And while abortion rights ballot measures won in red and purple states last year, they all received between 52 and 59 percent of votes, making a 60 percent threshold seem sufficiently insurmountable. In addition to raising the threshold to 60 percent, Republicans also sought to make it harder to get initiatives on the ballot in the first place. This was necessary to earn the support of the powerful Ohio Chamber of Commerce, which wanted to limit the number of ballot campaigns it potentially had to help fund. Just last year, Republican lawmakers had voted to repeal August special elections in Ohio, calling them low-turnout wastes of money. For months Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose denied he had switched positions on August special elections because of abortion rights. But in June, video footage reported by News 5 Cleveland and the Ohio Capital Journalshowed LaRose admitting abortion was motivating his stance. “Some people say this is all about abortion. Well, you know what?” he was recorded saying. “It’s 100 percent about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment out of our constitution — the left wants to jam it in there this coming November.” (LaRose announced last month that he is running for US Senate.) While Republicans and anti-abortion groups claimed that making it harder to pass ballot measures was necessary to protect the integrity of Ohio’s constitutionfrom interference by out-of-state groups, 82 percent of the funding for the pro-Issue 1 political action committee came from an Illinois-based Republican megadonor named Richard Uihlein. Opponents, meanwhile, raised much more money to defeat Issue 1 — at least $14.8 million according to the latest filings. Opponents framed Issue 1 as a threat to average citizens, as it would have significantly raised the costs of the signature-gathering process by requiring organizers to canvass in all 88 counties. Considerable funds for the opposition campaign also came from outside Ohio, includinga national progressive dark money group known as the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the California-based Tides Foundation, and the National Education Association. The opposition campaign comprised not only reproductive rights supporters but also public school proponents who wanted to preserve a tool for addressing educational inequality, democracy activists who want to tackle redistricting, environmental groups that want to push for climate action, and workers’ rights advocates who want to push more labor reforms. A coalition known as One Fair Wage, for example, has been collecting signatures for a potential 2024 ballot measure to raise Ohio’s minimum wage, and union organizers joined forces with the anti-Issue 1 campaign to raise awareness about how all future progressive measures couldbe affected. Together, the broad coalition worked to focus voters’ attention on the anti-democratic implications of Issue 1,which was aimed at stripping away not only the principle of majority rule on Ohio ballot measures, but also one of the last remaining ways voters can shape politics in the heavily gerrymandered state. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released in late July found that 58 percent of likely Ohio voters support the measure to codify abortion rights, including one-third of Republicans and 85 percent of independent women. Because Issue 1 failed, abortion rights supporters will only need to win a simple majority of votes — rather than 60 percent. The outcome of Ohio’s abortion referendum will likely shape the political narrative headed into 2024, as it’s the only abortion rights battle voters will weigh in on this fall. Last election cycle, abortion rights won in all six states with ballot measures, but anti-abortion leaders also spun the midterms as good for them because Democrats failed to unseat incumbent governors and didn’t win enough seats in Congress to pass any federal legislation restoring abortion rights. Ohio’s results should help clarify where the energy really is. Other abortion ballot measures are expected next year in states like Florida, South Dakota, and Arizona, and both opponents and supporters of abortion rights are bracing to spend tens of millions more dollars on such referendums than they did in 2022. Ohio’s proposed amendment would affirm that “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion.” Opponents claim the language is so broad that it would create a new right to gender-affirming surgery, and therefore invalidate the state’s current requirement for parental consent. Opponents organizing under the banner of “Protect Women Ohio” have made the trans youth health care argument central to their strategy, spending over $5 million on TV and digital advertising this past spring. They are regularly referring to the measure as an “anti-parent” amendment. Coalition leaders pushing for the abortion rights amendment say the focus on transgender health care is a desperate attempt to distract from the unpopularity of abortion bans, and that Ohio case law generally requires parental consent for youth medical care. Moreover, the amendment could only affect parental consent laws if someone were to successfully challenge the rules in court as unconstitutional, and given that Ohio’s state Supreme Court is controlled by Republicans, legal experts think a more sweeping interpretation of the abortion rights measure is unlikely. The defeat of Issue 1 has implications not only for Ohio democracy but also for other states looking to push measures to restrict citizen ballot measure initiatives. Supporters tried to claim that the restrictions they were pushing were because they truly deeply cared about Ohio democracy. Issue 1 proponents argued that efforts to change the state’s founding documents should be difficult, and that too much direct democracy could even undermine their system of representative government. “If a constitutional issue is significant enough to impact all 11.8 million Ohioans, then it should have to garner and demonstrate broad statewide backing for consideration,” said the heads of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, the Ohio Restaurant Association, and the National Federation of Independent Business in a joint statement in May. However, the idea that Ohio voters can easily amend their state constitution is not true.In the last 111 years, only 19 citizen-led ballot measures have beenapproved, and 52 failed. What Issue 1 supporters were really objecting to is that there was a viable way tocheck anti-abortion lawmakers’ power at all. As of late June, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a progressive group that supports state referendum campaigns, 14 states were considering a total of 50 pending measures that would raise new hurdles for ballot measures. The defeat in Ohio is not the first time in recent memory that Republican lawmakers have failed in their efforts to restrict ballot measures. Last summer South Dakota voters rejected a bid by state GOP officials to raise the threshold for ballot measures to 60 percent — a bid that one Republican official admitted was designed to cripple a ballot measure for Medicaid expansion. (Medicaid expansion in South Dakota ultimately passed.) Arizona voters also rejected a measure last fall that would have allowed lawmakers to amend or repeal ballot initiatives approved by voters. But Republicans have certainly been notching wins too. Lawmakers in both Florida and Arkansas recently raised the signature requirements for qualifying for the ballot, and last year Arizona voters did approve two measures that restricted citizen initiatives. Update, August 9, 9:10 am ET: This story was originally published on August 8, and has been updated with the final vote results.",https://www.vox.com/2023/8/8/23817989/issue-1-ohio-special-election-2023-results-abortion-rights,11808
"The new bill that would create a crime called “abortion murder,” explained",Anna North,2019-12-05T11:00:00+00:00,"Ohio legislators last month introduced a measure that would, if passed, become the most restrictive abortion law in the country. The bill creates a new felony called “abortion murder,” making people who have or perform abortions subject to life in prison. It also includes a provision suggesting that doctors should attempt to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy in a patient’s uterus, a procedure medical experts say is not possible with current medical technology. The legislation has not yet received a vote, but it’s already generated controversy around the world. For its sponsor, Ohio State Rep. Candice Keller, it’s a way to root out abortion in her state once and for all: “The time for regulating evil and compromise is over,” she said in a November statement. But abortion-rights advocates say the bill puts Ohioans at risk of being jailed over an abortion or even dying as a result of an untreated ectopic pregnancy. “If this bill was to become law, the lives of anyone who can become pregnant would be endangered,” Lauren Blauvelt-Copelin, vice president of government affairs and public advocacy at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, told Vox. Ohio has been the source of bills in the past that, initially disregarded as extreme, ended up becoming law: the first so-called “heartbeat” bill, banning abortion around six weeks into pregnancy, was introduced there in 2011. In 2018 and 2019, such laws passed not just in Ohio but in Iowa, Georgia, and elsewhere (though all have for now been blocked by courts). Now, advocates say Ohio is again at the forefront of a drive to restrict abortion — this time, one that could erode protections for the life and health of pregnant people. Bills like the one in Ohio are meant to give fetuses and even fertilized eggs the same legal rights as pregnant people themselves, Mary Alice Carter, a senior adviser at the reproductive-rights group Equity Forward, told Vox. “When we do that, we create a very dangerous situation for people that are pregnant.” Ohio House Bill 413, introduced on November 18, is 723 pages long. The bill has gotten attention in part for its striking language — it creates a new felony called “abortion murder.” Under the legislation, people would be guilty of this crime if they purposely “perform or have an abortion,” and could face 15 years to life in prison. The bill also creates a crime called “aggravated abortion murder,” of which people could be found guilty if they “purposely perform an abortion while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson, arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary,” or other crimes. For aggravated abortion murder, the maximum penalty is death. The circumstances under which someone could be accused of aggravated abortion murder are somewhat unclear. “Show me the person that can perform an abortion while committing arson, and I’ll show you a person who is remarkably good at multitasking,” Imani Gandy wrote at Rewire.News. But the new crimes are notable in large part because they would apparently allow patients to be charged with a felony for ending their pregnancies. A spokesperson for Keller told Vox that “the intent of the bill is towards the doctors, it’s not toward punishing the women that are going through these crisis situations.” But as written, the bill would appear to allow Ohioans to be sentenced to life in prison for getting an abortion. Mainstream anti-abortion groups typically do not support punishments for pregnant people who seek or get abortions. But Ohio isn’t the first state to introduce the possibility of such punishment — a Texas bill introduced earlier this year would make it possible for people who get abortions to be sentenced to death. Ohio does appear to be first in something else, however. HB 413 includes an exception for doctors who perform an abortion in order to save a patient’s life. In order to be exempt from prosecution, though, the doctor must take “all possible steps to preserve the life of the unborn child, while preserving the life of the woman.” Such steps, the law states, “include, if applicable, attempting to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy into the woman’s uterus.” Doctors, however, say no procedure to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy into a woman’s uterus exists. Ectopic pregnancies happen when a fertilized egg attaches, not to the uterine wall, but elsewhere in the reproductive system, usually in a fallopian tube. These pregnancies are not viable, and if left untreated, they can result in a ruptured fallopian tube, hemorrhage, and even death. In most cases, doctors say the only treatment is to terminate the pregnancy with medication or surgery. However, there’s a growing movement among abortion opponents to argue that ectopic pregnancies can be moved and reimplanted. Earlier this year, writer Georgi Boorman at the conservative website the Federalist mentioned the possibility as part of a larger argument that abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancies was unnecessary. Medical professionals — including some who identify as pro-life — responded that reimplantation is not possible. “To my knowledge we are nowhere near having the technology to do that,” Ingrid Skop, chair of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told Vox at the time. Boorman ended up issuing a retraction and apology. But she wasn’t the only one talking about the idea of reimplantation. The idea had already made its way into a different Ohio bill, this one restricting insurance coverage for abortion. The bill contained a special provision allowing insurance companies to cover “a procedure for an ectopic pregnancy that is intended to reimplant the fertilized ovum into the pregnant woman’s uterus.” The sponsor of that bill, Republican Ohio State Rep. John Becker, is a co-sponsor of HB 413 as well. Neither bill has yet passed, and supporters say they’re just looking to the future, when reimplantation could be possible. “If there is a way to save both mother and child, we’d like to see that demonstrated,” the Keller spokesperson told Vox. But others say the emphasis on a medical procedure that doesn’t exist could set a dangerous precedent. Language about reimplantation — along with the broader argument that abortion is not necessary in cases of ectopic pregnancy — could result in a narrowing of protections for the life and health of pregnant people in abortion law, Carter, the Equity Forward adviser, said. The current standard of care for ectopic pregnancies in most cases is to treat them with medication or surgery as soon as they are identified, Carter noted. But by introducing the idea that ectopic pregnancies can be saved, abortion opponents could push doctors to wait until a patient is near death before taking action — potentially making serious or even fatal complications more likely. And ultimately, the focus on ectopic pregnancies may be part of a larger argument that abortion is never necessary, even to save a person’s life. Keller, the sponsor of HB 413, said in November that “the time has come to abolish abortion in its entirety and recognize that each individual has the inviolable and inalienable right to life.” While the Ohio bills appear to be the first in the country to include language around ectopic pregnancy, the idea could spread, abortion-rights advocates say. “Ohio has been a breeding ground for very dangerous anti-abortion, anti-reproductive health bans and restrictions” in the past, Blauvelt-Copelin, the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio vice president, said. She noted that the first-ever “heartbeat” bill, banning abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected, was introduced in Ohio in 2011. The bill didn’t pass at the time and wasn’t even supported by some anti-abortion groups in the state. But over time, such legislation, which bans abortion at as early as six weeks’ gestation, before many people know they are pregnant, gained traction around the country, and similar bans have now passed in multiple states. Something similar happened with the idea of exceptions in abortion law for people who become pregnant as a result of rape or incest. A few years ago, Carter said, most abortion opponents accepted the idea that abortion restrictions should include such exceptions. Now, several laws around the country, including a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in Alabama, have no exception for rape or incest. A similar thing could happen with exceptions for the health and life of the pregnant person, Carter said: “What we’re seeing is an upping of the ante.” The Alabama law and all of the six-week bans have been blocked by courts, and Blauvelt-Copelin said that if HB 413 were to pass, Planned Parenthood would fight it in court as well. However, she said, “we see that this is the direction that anti-abortion politicians want to move our state and our country in, so we have to take these bills very seriously.”",https://www.vox.com/2019/12/5/20994296/ohio-abortion-murder-hb-413-reimplant-ectopic,11808
This ballot measure would restore Roe. Abortion rights groups are attacking it.,Rachel M. Cohen,2024-02-26T13:00:00+00:00,"On the same day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a law banning nearly all abortions in South Dakota took effect. This so-called trigger law was passed by South Dakota lawmakers in 2005 and immediately became one of the strictest bans in the nation, with no exceptions even for rape or incest. Now a South Dakota ballot measure to “restore Roe v. Wade” is moving forward, despite opposition not just from Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocacy groups, but also fromsome local reproductive rights activists and national progressive organizations who say it doesn’t go far enough. The pushback from certain corners of the political left illustrates ideological and strategic fissures within the abortion rights movement that have intensified since the fall of Roe, and leave ballot measure organizers in South Dakota to push ahead alone. The proposed measure would amend South Dakota’s constitution to effectively codify the access available under the original Roe v. Wade decision. It would prevent the state from regulating abortion in thefirst trimester (weeks 1 to 13 of pregnancy); during the second trimester (14 to 26 weeks) the state could regulate it“only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.” Beyond that point, after a fetus is viable, South Dakota could regulate or prohibit abortion, except when a doctor deems the procedure necessary to preserve their patient’s “life and health.” The vast majority of abortions in the United States occur during the first trimester. In 2020, 93 percent occurred before 13 weeks, according to the CDC, with an additional 6 percent occurring between 14 and 20 weeks. Though South Dakota is a solidly conservative state, voters have rejected near-total abortion bans on ballot measures twice before — in 2006 and 2008 — and in the last decade, activists have won progressive voter referendums on other issues, including campaign finance, payday lending, medical and recreational cannabis, and most recently, Medicaid expansion. To get on the November ballot, organizers will need to submit at least 35,017 valid petition signatures by May 7. Signatures are being collected by a grassroots group — Dakotans for Health — which also helped lead the ballot measure campaign for Medicaid expansion in 2022. “We’re on track and feeling very bullish,” Adam Weiland, a leader with Dakotans for Health, told Vox. “We’ve got well over 50,000 signatures signed, sealed, and delivered, but we’re still collecting because we know they’re going to throw the kitchen sink at us.” Despite the optimism, advocates face hurdles from the left and right. In the Republican-dominated state legislature, more than 90 state senators voted for a resolution opposing the constitutional amendment, and last week House lawmakers voted to allow people to remove their signatures from the ballot-measure petition. (Dakotans for Health has threatened to sue over this.) The prime sponsor of the signature withdrawal bill has been insisting the proposed amendment is far more extreme than Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile on the left, some abortion rights groups have started openly attacking the ballot measure and the organizers behind it. The ACLU of South Dakota, and Planned Parenthood North Central States — which represents Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota —have both raised issues with its drafting and its final language, saying they do not believe it will “adequately reinstate” the right to abortion. Amy Kelley, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Sioux Falls, is supporting the ballot measure because she said practicing health care is untenable for physicians like her under the trigger ban, and she doesn’t want perfect to be the enemy of good. “Of course it would be better to have a bill like the one that died in committee that said abortion is health care and should be left to women and doctors, but are we going to get to that in South Dakota before we have a maternal mortality crisis? Probably not,” Kelley told Vox. “The measure is not enough but does that mean that we don’t go in the right direction just because it’s not exactly what we want?” When the draft opinion of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision was leaked in May 2022, Cathy Piersol, a retired Sioux Falls attorney and a longtime advocate for women’s rights, called her friend Jan Nicolay, a former Republican lawmaker who led the campaigns against the 2006 and 2008 abortion ban ballot measures. They knew the trigger ban would take effect if Roe was officially overturned. The women started convening meetings, including with representatives from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. Piersol and Nicolay wanted to submit ballot language to codify abortion rights in South Dakota’s constitution, quickly, before South Dakotans elected a new secretary of state in November 2022. The favored candidate for secretary of state had repeatedly refused to affirm the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election win in 2020 and was proudly touting an endorsement from South Dakota Right to Life. But some activists felt things were moving too fast and that leaders should conduct more research and polling before advancing any specific ballot measure draft. Given the high likelihood that they’d face legal challenge, these advocates felt more due diligence was needed. Others involved disagreed. They pointed to the prior ballot measure successes led by the South Dakota Campaign for Healthy Families, which Nicolay had directed. “The idea that this was a rushed job is just silly; it’s simply not accurate,” Piersol told Vox. “We knew if we didn’t get a constitutional amendment quickly then the legislature would fiddle, diddle, and mess up the entire thing.” Piersol said she asked a Planned Parenthood regional vice president if there was a plan,“and he said, ‘Well, no, not right now,’ and I knew then we were on our own. It’s daunting but you cannot let yourself be dragged by the nay-sayers.” Nicolay and Piersol approached Dakotans for Health with questions about executing a ballot measure campaign, and the group offered to organize the effort. Rick Weiland, founder of Dakotans for Health and a longtime political operative in the state, said he personally called the local ACLU and Planned Parenthood affiliates multiple times and was ignored. “[We’re] hoping that once we qualify for the ballot there will be a change of heart,” he told Vox. About five months later, activists were approved to officially start collecting signatures, and for more than a year into the petition drive, local and national reproductive rights groups stayed relatively quiet. When I covered the pending ballot measure campaigns for abortion rights in summer 2023, Planned Parenthood North Central States had not issued any public statement and did not return my multiple requests for comment. More recently, some activists started publicly attacking the campaign, most notably in a South Dakota Searchlight article published in early December. Samantha Chapman, advocacy manager for the ACLU of South Dakota, said in the story that her organization is not encouraging people to donate or volunteer, or encouraging people to vote yes or no. She claimed grassroots groups were not consulted and blasted the ballot measure for being initiated by “women who are not of reproductive age.” (Both Nicolay and Pierosol are in their 80s.) Chapman also slammed Dakotans for Health, which she described as “ultimately run by three white men.” (Chapman was formerly married to one of Weiland’s sons.) Chapman told Vox the national ACLU and her local ACLU affiliate had no further comments for the media. Nicolay, who is currently in hospice with late-stage pancreatic cancer, told Vox she was deeply offended by Chapman’s remarks. “Quite honestly I was appalled because the gal said, ‘Well, they’re two gray-haired women; they can’t reproduce so we shouldn’t be listening to them,’” she said. “No one has any idea what I went through when I was leading the ballot measures [in 2006 and 2008]. We fought a lot of battles so they could have their rights. We fought them before and we’ll fight them again.” In the Searchlight article, Tim Stanley, of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said his organization stands with the ACLU in opposing the ballot measure. In an emailed statement to Vox, Stanley said they aren’t part of the coalition supporting the abortion rights amendment and weren’t involved in drafting it. “As the sole abortion provider in South Dakota for more than 30 years, Planned Parenthood is acutely aware of the impact policy language can have on patients’ lives,” he said. “Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood North Central States is working to build a future where sexual and reproductive health care is accessible to all South Dakotans, especially people with lower incomes, those in rural areas, LGBTQ+ and other marginalized communities.” Stanley declined multiple requests to clarify or elaborate on how Planned Parenthood is working to build that more accessible future for South Dakotans. Kim Floren, who cofounded the South Dakota Justice Empowerment Network, an abortion fund, said she doesn’t think the proposed measure goes far enough and raised concern with certain language, like that it uses the word “women,” which could exclude minors. Chapman pointed to Michigan as a better model for soliciting stakeholder input. Michigan’s ballot measure, which voters approved in 2022, affirms the right to make decisions about “all matters relating to pregnancy, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management, and infertility care.” Piersol said trying to get the kind of “wonderful and rather elaborate language” that activists pushed for in Michigan is unrealistic. “You’re not going to get that passed in South Dakota,” she told Vox. “We know what people will vote for, and that’s the key.” Ballot measures protecting abortion rights have won in all seven states in which they’ve appeared since the overturn of Roe, including in red states like Kentucky, Ohio, and Montana. Some of the victories were very expensive to win, with activists raising tens of millions of dollars for the efforts in Michigan and Ohio. Organizers in South Dakota are preparing for the likelihood that they may see virtually no outside fundraising assistance, as national progressive funders like Open Society Foundations and the Fairness Project, and national abortion rights groups like Reproductive Freedom for All and Planned Parenthood, have already made clear they plan to stay out of the campaign. Funders recently told Politico they see South Dakota’s measure as having “shortcomings” and not “align[ed] with our values.” Adam Weiland said an advantage is that South Dakota does not have a pricey media market, and so he believes they can still win without national donors, as they did with Medicaid expansion. “We’re a small state and we’ve already raised upwards of a million dollars,” he told Vox. “We think we’ll need 2, 3, or 4 million to win.” In some respects, it might ultimately help that big progressive groups that heavily fund Democratic-aligned causes want to sit South Dakota out. One key way activists have been able to win over conservatives in other states is by ensuring their efforts remain aggressively nonpartisan. Still, activists leading the abortion rights ballot measure campaign in South Dakota don’t see it that way. “It is so deleterious to women to not have the force of Planned Parenthood and to not have the force of the ACLU behind a program that is specifically set up for women’s safety and health,” said Piersol. “It’s just outrageous that they have taken that position.” Right now, organizers feel cautiously optimistic about the polling trends. A survey of 500 registered voters sponsored by South Dakota News Watch from July 2022 found 65 percent of respondents supported the idea of a statewide referendum on abortion rights, and more than 75 percent backed legalizing abortion in cases of rape or incest. However, two more recent polls suggest it still may be a tough battle. In October a survey from the Hill and Emerson College found 45 percent of voters expressing support for South Dakota’s abortion ban, with 39 percent opposed and 16 percent unsure. A News Watch survey conducted in November found mixed support for the proposed amendment, with 45.6 percent of respondents supporting it, and 43.6 percent opposing it. The poll’s margin of error was 4.5 percent. Anti-abortion leaders have been cheering the public in-fighting, and SBA Pro-Life America, a national anti-abortion lobbying group, recently highlighted the Emerson College poll as what happens when “a state has a strong pro-life alliance and Planned Parenthood and the ACLU don’t throw millions into advertising.” Adam Weiland said he’s not too worried about those autumn polls and pointed out that when South Dakotans first started organizing for the 2006 ballot measure to protect abortion rights, surveys showed they were down 14 points. “Sure, South Dakotans have a more nuanced and moderate view of abortion rights than what some people might have in New York or California, but when you ask them whether or not women or young girls should be forced to carry to term, most people don’t think so,” he said. “Most people believe in the right to a choice.”",https://www.vox.com/24078960/south-dakota-abortion-ballot-measure-dobbs,11808
Why abortion in the US is on the rise,Rachel M. Cohen,2024-03-20T11:15:00+00:00,"To understand the evolving landscape for abortion in the United States, you have to consider two seemingly contradictory things. The first: The overturn of Roe v. Wadehas led to unprecedented attacks on abortion, with nearly half of states banning or planning to ban the procedure since June 2022. Yet the second: The overall incidence of abortion has increased. In fact, according to new data published yesterday by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group, there were more abortions in the formal US health care system in 2023 than in any year since 2011. To get even more granular, there were approximately 1 million abortions last year, a 10 percent increase over the number from 2020. So what gives? How is this possible? The first underlying factor is that travel out of state for abortion has gone up, offsetting some of the newer restrictions in states with bans. More than 160,000 people crossed state lines to end pregnancies in 2023, per Guttmacher, almost double the number who did so in 2020. This isn’t to say the burden of state restrictions has been offset. “Even if people can travel, doing so comes with significant financial and logistical cost,” Isaac Maddow-Zimet, the lead researcher at Guttmacher, told me. “And it’s only been possible because there’s been a lot of support from folks like abortion funds, and we don’t know how sustainable that [funding] will be long-term.” Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day. Another factor explaining the overall increase is that more residents living in states without restrictions are getting abortions. This seems to have been driven primarily by improved access policies in those states, like expansion of telehealth medicine, more sliding-scale payment options, and wider Medicaid coverage. Some of these efforts began before 2022, though many picked up steam after the Supreme Court’s ruling. “The broader context is that access anywhere has never been particularly great, and cost has always been a pretty substantial barrier even before Dobbs,” said Maddow-Zimet. Another factor likely driving the increase is that more people are choosing to end pregnancies through medication abortion — the two-drug combination of mifepristone and misoprostol. Use of these pills has been trending up over time, but Guttmacher found a particularly big jump over the last three years, where medication abortion accounted for 63 percent of all US abortions in the formal health care system in 2023, up from 53 percent in 2020. There are a lot of reasons why people might choose to use this effective option, which researchers have found to be safe and with a very low risk of complications. Some patients lack access to in-person abortion clinics (both in the states that’ve outright banned abortion since 2022 or just in rural and otherwise underserved regions). Other people may simply prefer to end pregnancies in the comfort of their own home or seek out the pills because they can cost less than surgical abortion. Given that so many people are turning to abortion pills, it should come as no surprise that the anti-abortion movement has ramped up its efforts to restrict access to the medication since the overturn of Roe. The US Supreme Court will be hearing a case next week that could lead to even more restrictions on mifepristone, a drug that has been FDA-approved since 2000. Still, despite these legal threats and the looming possibility of a future Trump administration using the executive branch to further crack down on the pills, thus far advocates for abortion rights have made tremendous gains in expanding access to the medication since Roe’s overturn. As I’ve previously reported for Vox, it’s never been easier, faster, and cheaper to access abortion medication nationwide, even in red states with total abortion bans. Some of this is driven by the growth of new shield laws, where blue-state abortion providers can now mail pills to people living in states where abortion is illegal. Some of it is thanks to the growth of e-commerce sites and other international providers, which have collectively and significantly brought down the cost for patients. Even if the Supreme Court bans mifepristone this summer or places new restrictions on the drug, many of these alternative methods would remain intact, and many abortion providers would switch to providing misoprostol-only regimens. In other words, the anti-abortion movement is going to have a really hard time stopping people from ending pregnancies they don’t want. But okay, here’s what we still don’t know when it comes to figuring out why abortion incidence is going up. The big remaining unknown is whether the increase we’ve seen has been driven in part by people’s shifting childbearing decisions. Do fewer people want to have kids now? Do more people want to delay having kids? Researchers aren’t sure. Maddow-Zimet tells me this is a particularly difficult thing to measure, and there’s been almost no quality data on changes in people’s intention to have children since Roe’s overturn. (Though we might get some soon with next year’s National Survey of Family Growth.) An even bigger unknown: How many people wanted to end a pregnancy since Dobbs but weren’t able to? That sort of data is critical to know but has always been extremely difficult to collect, and we still don’t have reliable methods to do so. Given all these unknowns, not to mention uncertainty with the upcoming presidential election and future funding streams, it’s hard to say how and whether these abortion trends will continue. We’ll be keeping a close watch. This story appeared originally in Today, Explained, Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.

How the US polarized on abortion — even as most Americans stayed in the middle,Jillian Weinberger,2022-06-24T14:42:36+00:00,"In 1976, just a few years after the Supreme Court handed down its opinion in Roe v. Wade, most Americans thought abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances. Those numbers haven’t changed much over almost 50 years. Most Americans still believe abortion should be legal in most circumstances. But our politics have shifted dramatically. And with the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization— which effectively overturned Roe — reality has shifted as well. No longer is abortion protected at the federal level. The decision comes at a polarized moment:Anti-abortion Democrats and pro-abortion rights Republicans are dwindling breeds. Why? One major reason is a deliberate, decades-long campaign on the right to overturn Roe v. Wade. Conservative attorneys brought cases that undermined Roe with the hope that, by chipping away at the ruling, Supreme Court justices would eventually feel comfortable striking it down. The anti-abortion movement has also focused on building a pipeline of judicial nominees through organizations like the Federalist Society. The left, meanwhile, has focused on shifting party opinion on related issues like contraception coverage and the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits government funds from being used to pay for abortion except in the case of rape, incest, or endangering the mother’s life, while treating Roe as a largely settled matter. Now, all those years of work by anti-abortion activists seem to be paying off. Now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, it has tossed out nearly 50 years of jurisprudence along with it. Over the decades, the ruling turned into one of the biggest lightning rods in American politics, and those years were punctuated by crucial moments. Here are the most significant. 1973: Roe v. Wade is decided. Justice Harry Blackmun writes the opinion, finding that people have a constitutional right to an abortion in the first and second trimester. He grounds that right in the 14th Amendment right to due process and an implied right to privacy. 1976: The Hyde Amendment passes for the first time. The measure prohibits government funds from being spent on abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or threats to the life of the pregnant person. The provision exemplifies the kind of restrictions on abortion that the right continued to champion over the next five decades —and eventually draws the focus of the Democratic Party. 1978: James Bopp is named the general counsel of the National Right to Life Committee, the nation’s leading anti-abortion group. He becomes the architect of the strategy that looks set to succeed today: an “incremental” approach to slowly undermine Roe until, he hoped, the justices would eventually overturn it. Over the next four decades, Bopp helped states and localities draft abortion restrictions and, when those restrictions were challenged, defended them in the courts. Bopp also wrote the anti-abortion plank for the Republican Party platform in 1980. 1980: A new alliance between Catholics and evangelicals, driven in part by opposition to abortion, helps Ronald Reagan capture the Republican nomination and, eventually, the presidency. It’s the first time abortion becomes a salient national political issue since Roe — and that’s in part because evangelical leaders saw it as a more politically palatable issue than their true concerns: maintaining segregation in schools. Still, the alliance, known as the Moral Majority, becomes a political force to be reckoned with for years to come, and elevates the anti-abortion cause and religious right. 1992: The Supreme Court decides Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, a case concerning state-level abortion restrictions in Pennsylvania. Roe survives, but in this first serious test for abortion rights since itwas decided, the Court establishes new limits on the right. In a 5-4 decision, the Court declares that states can pass abortion restrictions as long as they don’t pose an “undue burden” on the pregnant person and replaces the trimester framework with a “viability” of the fetus standard. Following these new standards, the Court upholds most of Pennsylvania’s restrictions. 2006: Cecile Richards becomes the president of Planned Parenthood. It’s a deliberate move to select a leader suited to build the organization’s political power throughout the country and within the Democratic Party. Richards organizes the group’s local chapters and capitalizes on political events in 2010 and 2011 so that Planned Parenthood becomes a force in the Democratic Party — so much so that in 2012, the party included a declaration of support for Planned Parenthood in its platform. 2009: Dr. George Tiller, a Kansas abortion provider, is murdered while serving as an usher at his church. It’s the most extreme example of the rise in violent acts by anti-abortion activists. 2010: In March, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Because Obama needed the support of even anti-abortion Democrats to pass it, the bill included a compromise on abortion, the Boxer-Nelson Amendment. It allowed states to prohibit plans in the insurance marketplaces from covering abortion. President Obama also signed an executive order declaring that the Hyde Amendment applied to the ACA, and abortion rights activists responded by creating a coalition to defeat the Hyde Amendment. That fall, the Republican Party sweeps the midterm elections, due, in part, to backlash to the ACA and the rise of the Tea Party movement. The following year, states pass a record number of abortion restrictions. 2011: The US House passes an amendment by then-Rep. Mike Pence to defund Planned Parenthood. Though the amendment does not pass the Senate, it becomes a polarizing force between the parties. Abortion rights organizations capitalize on the amendment and the Tea Party’s broader effort to defund and restrict abortion rights: Online gifts to Planned Parenthood increase by 500 percent, and NARAL’s email activist list grows by 1,000 subscribers per day at the height of the debate around Pence’s amendment. 2012: The DNC pushes an abortion rights message at the national convention. The organization includes a new paragraph in its party plank: The President and the Democratic Party believe that women have a right to control their reproductive choices. Democrats support access to affordable family planning services, and President Obama and Democrats will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers. The Affordable Care Act ensures that women have access to contraception in their health insurance plans, and the President has respected the principle of religious liberty. Democrats support evidence-based and age-appropriate sex education. 2016: Due, in part, to the movement that started after the ACA in 2010, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders call for repealing the Hyde Amendment in their presidential campaigns that spring. The DNC eventually adopts that language for its party platform. Come November, however,Donald Trump is elected president and effectively delegates judicial selection to the conservativeFederalist Society. He nominates three Supreme Court justices during his term in office: Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. 2019: As laws that would ban abortions after the sixth week spread across the US, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden endorses the repeal of the Hyde Amendment on the campaign trail. As president, he will attempt to make good on his promise; his first budget proposal reversed the Hyde Amendment, though Congress, which ultimately holds the power of the purse, overrules him. 2020: Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies of cancer less than two months before the presidential election. Trump and the Republican Senate quickly confirm the Federalist Society-endorsed Barrett, giving conservatives a 6-3 supermajority on the Court and prompting anti-abortion groups to tee up state laws restricting abortion that would invite challenges and a showdown in the Supreme Court. 2021: Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case concerning a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks, is argued at the Supreme Court. The conservative litigants explicitly ask the Court to overturn Roe, and thejustices indicate they are open to doing so. 2022: Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion overturning Roe in Dobbsis leaked to Politico in May, and in June the final decision was handed down, overturning both Roe and Casey. “...[T]he authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives,” the decision reads.

"How Americans voted for abortion rights, in one chart",Rani Molla,2022-11-09T20:35:00+00:00,"Since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, Americans have had six chances to vote directly on laws that would affect their access to abortion— once last summer in Kansas and five in this year’s midterm elections. Every single time, voters have pushed for abortion rights. Abortion measures were on the midterm ballots in five states: California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and Vermont. Preliminary results show that, in all five, voters sought to either maintain or strengthen abortion access in their state. Even though the midterm races ended up being very close between Republicans and Democrats in many states, Americans were much more aligned in their backing of reproductive rights, likely in part thanks to a surge in women signing up to vote since Dobbs v. Jackson, the case that overturned Roe. In Kentucky, voters struck down a constitutional amendment that would have explicitly stated there was no right to an abortion or abortion funding in the state. Kentucky is one of about 20 states with a near-total abortion ban, and its law is considered the harshest in the country. In Montana, voters rejected the so-called “born alive” measure, which would have required health care providers to treat infants born at any stage in development, including after an abortion, or face criminal penalties. Critics said it gave the state too much power in deciding what should be a medical decision, and that it could result in pregnancy complications. In Vermont, California, and Michigan, voters passed proposals to enshrine reproductive rights into the states’ constitutions. In other words, they’re attempting to codify abortion rights that are dissolving at a federal level. These developments come three months after Kansas became the first state to take on abortion rights at the ballot box. A record number of Kansans voted against an amendment that would have said there was no constitutional right to abortion nor for the government to fund abortion. Since then, abortion access has proved to be an important issue for voters on both sides of the aisle, with majorities voting for abortion access even in states that predominantly vote Republican, as Kansas does, and whose legislatures are dominated by the GOP. Abortion issues were also key for candidates in state legislatures and in governors’ races around the country, where a number of pro-abortion access candidates have won, including Gov. Laura Kelly in Kansas. Americans overwhelmingly support access to abortion, at least in some situations, and it looks like they voted that way.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23449529/chart-abortion-rights-ballot-measures-midterm-elections-kentucky-results-2022,11808
Pete Buttigieg shuts down a conservative talking point about abortion rights,Li Zhou,2019-05-20T01:10:00+00:00,"During a Fox News town hall on Sunday, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was confronted with a common conservative talking point on abortion rights — and he didn’t take the bait. While discussing the recent laws passed in Alabama, Georgia, and Ohio — which severely restrict access to abortions — Fox News anchor Chris Wallace sought to press Buttigieg on just when the cutoff point should be for when a woman can access an abortion. “Do you believe, at any point in pregnancy, that there should be any limit on a woman’s right to an abortion?” Wallace wanted to know. It’s a framing that’s increasingly used by conservatives to provoke outrage about abortions: as illustrated by repeated comments from President Donald Trump, such statements falsely suggest that there’s a preponderance of individuals opting to engage in abortions very late in their pregnancies, and that they’re doing so to actively hurt babies. As Buttigieg emphasized to Wallace, however, not only is the proportion of women getting an abortion in the third trimester very small, the decision to have an abortion — at any point in pregnancy — should be a woman’s choice. “The dialogue has gotten so caught up in where you draw the line. I trust women to draw the line,” he said. Wallace followed up and pressed Buttigieg on that point, but the mayor did not change his stance. Buttigieg’s response highlights just how much conservative critiques of abortion rights have focused far more on fear-mongering than they do on addressing the realities of when people have abortions. “You would be okay with a woman well into the third trimester to obtain an abortion?” Wallace asked. “These hypotheticals are set up to provoke a strong emotional reaction,” Buttigieg noted. “These aren’t hypotheticals — there are 6,000 women a year who get an abortion in the third trimester,” Wallace said. “That’s right, representing less than 1 percent of cases a year,” Buttigieg responded. The data about abortions that take place later in pregnancies closely matches Buttigieg’s comments, as noted in a Los Angeles Times story: Just over 1% of abortions are performed at 21 weeks [which is before the third trimester], or later, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. An abortion after that time would likely occur because of a serious fetal anomaly or for the health of the woman. The vast majority of abortions — 89% — are done in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. “Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a woman in that situation. If it’s that late in your pregnancy ... it’s [almost to the point] that you’ve been expecting to carry it to term,” Buttigieg added. “Families ... then get the most devastating medical news of their lifetime. ... That decision is not going to be made any better, medically or morally, because the government is dictating how that decision should be made.” Buttigieg does, however, still have vulnerabilities on the issue of abortion rights: Compared to competitors like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren, he remains very light on policy specifics. As part of the town hall, Buttigieg could have effectively laid out his position on this subject, but he didn’t offer many details — and neither does his website’s issues page. “I believe that the right of a woman to make her own decisions about her own reproductive health, about her body, is a national right,” Buttigieg said on Sunday, noting that he intends to appoint federal judges who would support Roe v. Wade and bolster resources for reproductive care, like sex education and birth control access. On his campaign website, Buttigieg also offers a single bullet point laying out more policy plans on the subject, which indicates that he backs repealing the Hyde Amendment, a measure that prevents Medicaid dollars from being used on abortions in most cases. As a ThinkProgress post noted in April, undoing the Hyde Amendment has become a baseline litmus test for where Democrats stand on abortion, an issue that the party had broadly agreed upon in the past. Contrast that to the comprehensive plans that Gillibrand and Warren unveiled this week. Gillibrand on Thursday released a proposal on abortion rights that called for codifying Roe v. Wade as federal law, the preemption of state laws that seek to restrict access to abortion clinics, and the creation of a new federal funding stream that would increase access to reproductive health care centers across the country. As Vox’s Anna North reported, Warren on Friday offered a similarly aggressive plan that would enshrine Roe as a federal statute. It’s worth noting that one of the biggest differences on this issue could come down to the Supreme Court. There is currently a conservative majority, and if Trump gets any more appointments, overturning Roe v. Wade — or at least chipping away at it — seems all but certain. In that case, then, it’s the president and the Senate who make all the difference. Buttigieg’s grappling with the subject on Sunday highlighted an important rebuttal to a commonly used framing on abortion rights. He’s hoping that’s enough.",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/19/18631854/pete-buttigieg-fox-news-town-hall,11808
Florida and Arizona show why abortion attacks are not slowing down,Rachel M. Cohen,2024-04-11T11:15:00+00:00,"The attacks on legal abortion in the last two weeks alone have been staggering. Since the beginning of April, state Supreme Courts in Florida and Arizona have both issued rulings that will effectively ban abortion care in the third and 14th most populous states. While both states already had curtailed abortion after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, now Florida’s Supreme Court ruling will trigger a six-week ban (before many people know they’re pregnant) beginning on May 1. And Arizona’s Supreme Court revived a near-total ban that will take effect in two weeks and carries with it a minimum two-year prison sentence for doctors who perform abortions that are not essential for saving their patient’s life. It’s perhaps fitting that these extreme rulings would come down at the same time that former President Donald Trump attempts to wipe his hands clean of abortion policy in his 2024 presidential campaign. Earlier this week Trump released a four-minute video saying he was “proudly the person responsible” for ending Roe v. Wade, but that he now supports states determining abortion policy “by vote or legislation or perhaps both.” Trump insisted that “at the end of the day it’s all about the will of the people.” Except that’s clearly not true. The American people never supported overturning Roe v. Wade. Abortion policy in the US has been clearly out of step with the will of the people over the last two years, and the judicial system has helped keep it that way. The new rulings in Florida and Arizona are only the latest examples of how access to reproductive freedom continues to be restricted by far-right judges appointed by Republicans. In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed five out of seven justices to the state’s Supreme Court (and 115 judges in total) while all seven justices in Arizona were also appointed by Republican governors. Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day. Let’s not forget the Alabama state Supreme Court decision in February that invoked God to claim that frozen embryos count as “children” under state law. This “fetal personhood” ideology is being promoted by other judges too, like in Florida, where the state’s Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz recently suggested that abortion “take[s] a whole class of human beings and put[s] them outside the protection of the law.” Six of the seven Florida justices signaled they’d be open to a future fetal personhood case there. (Republican politicians have sought recently to distance themselves from court attacks on IVF and abortion, but over 120 House Republicans are currently co-sponsoring federal legislation to give constitutional rights to embryos.) These are state-level decisions, the result of state GOP politicians’ appointments. But judges on the federal bench have also used their positions to restrict abortion rights. Trump’s appointment of Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to a federal district court in Texas, for example,led to the brazen effort to restrict medication abortion nationwide. Two more Trump-appointed judges on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled in favor of restricting access to the abortion pill. As Slow Boring writer and Vox co-founder Matt Yglesias recently wrote, one of the biggest risks to abortion rights should Donald Trump win in November is that the judiciary will move even further to the right. Trump may say he’d let the states decide, but the judges he’d likely appoint wouldn’t — and there would be no recourse, as Yglesias wrote: “The whole point of the federal judiciary in the United States is that judges are insulated from electoral accountability and free to hand down whatever kind of nutty rulings they want.” Slate writers Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern made a similar point this week, observing how anti-abortion lawyers plan to use the Comstock Act, an 1873 law that hasn’t been enforced in nearly a century, to ban medication abortion nationwide. Far-right judges, they note, can help make that possible by greenlighting legally absurd interpretations. “[Anti-abortion lawyers] tell us that they intend to stay quiet about this [Comstock] scheme until after the election,” Lithwick and Stern write. “The plot is similar to what just happened in Arizona: Republicans enacted a seemingly moderate 15-week ban, only to stand by and watch as their colleagues on a GOP-packed court resuscitated a total ban passed during the Civil War.” Voters in Florida and Arizona both will likely have the chance to vote to protect abortion rights this fall. Florida’s ballot measure, which would require (a pretty formidable) 60 percent of voters to pass, would protect abortion access up to 24 weeks. Arizona’s ballot measure, which is not yet formally on the November ballot, would also protect abortion up to 24 weeks but would only require a simple majority to pass. These will be expensive, competitive fights — even as we know voters in these states support access to legal abortion. More than two-thirds of Floridians say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and in Arizona, 59 percent of registered voters say abortion should be mostly or always legal. This doesn’t mean all those people will turn out to vote, though. Even if these ballot measures do pass, there is no guarantee the “will of the people” will be respected. In Ohio, for example, after 57 percent of voters cast ballots in 2023 to protect abortion rights, Republican lawmakers immediately started plotting ways to undermine the results, including by threatening to place another referendum on the ballot in the future. More broadly, though, state protections can only go so far. Even if Florida voters were to protect abortion access, pregnant women in Texas would still have to fear dying of sepsis, or Alabama families might still have to pay much higher costs for fertility treatments. Americans want federal standards for reproductive rights, not a patchwork of state laws that leave people vulnerable.

Why was a Texas woman charged with murder over an abortion?,Nicole Narea,2022-04-12T16:01:48+00:00,"Prosecutors dropped murder charges on Sunday against a 26-year-old southern Texas woman over an alleged “self-induced abortion,” admitting that she had not committed a crime. But her case is an example of the lengths to which red states are willing to go to restrict abortion access — and abortion advocates worry it could have a chilling effect on pregnant people seeking medical care in Texas. The woman was indicted in March after she miscarried and allegedly told staff at a Starr County hospital that she had tried to induce her own abortion. The staff then reported her to the police. It’s not clear how long she had been pregnant or how she sought to induce an abortion. (Her attorney could not be reached for comment on Monday.) But what is clear is that she never should have been charged. Texas law bans abortion providers from performing the procedure after about six weeks into pregnancy and from giving patients abortion pills after 49 days from conception. But there is no Texas law that criminalizes or imposes penalties on people who have abortions. And state law also explicitly exempts people from criminal homicide charges for having abortions. “The issues surrounding this matter are clearly contentious, however based on Texas law and the facts presented, it is not a criminal matter,” Starr County District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez wrote in his Sunday announcement that he would be dropping the charges. “It shouldn’t have happened and there are clear ways that it could have been prevented,” said Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel and legal director at the reproductive rights group If/When/How, which is covering the woman’s legal expenses through its Repro Legal Defense Fund. “If the health care providers that she reached out to kept her information confidential. If law enforcement who pursued this rightly realized that there was no criminal wrongdoing here.” But the fact that it did happen means damage has already been done: The woman’s name and mugshot have been published across national media, further upending her life. And the case may dissuade other Texans from not only self-managing their abortions but also pursuing critical medical care for fear of the repercussions. It’s not clear what law the Starr County District Attorney’s office thought the woman had broken when they charged her. A representative for the office declined to comment beyond Allen Ramirez’s statement on Sunday. Texas has recently enacted one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country. The so-called Heartbeat Act, which went into effect in September, allows private individuals to sue anyone who provides or assists in an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically about six weeks into pregnancy — before most women even know they are pregnant. As a result, it’s now effectively impossible to get a physical abortion in Texas, driving people to self-managing abortions, primarily by means of FDA-approved pills, or to seek an abortion in a neighboring state. But that law only implements civil, not criminal penalties. And it explicitly exempts from liability people who get abortions. As Diaz-Tello said, “Neither ending a pregnancy nor losing a pregnancy is a crime under Texas law.” The Starr County District Attorney’s office nevertheless pursued its case, getting a grand jury to sign off on a March 30 indictment, which is not yet publicly available. The county sheriff arrested the woman on Thursday, and she was released from jail on Saturday night after reproductive rights groups posted $500,000 in bail on her behalf. It was only after her case received national attention that the district attorney’s office made a reversal and dropped the charges. There’s good reason not to prosecute people who self-manage abortions or have otherwise adverse pregnancy outcomes: It could have a chilling effect on people who need medical care. That’s why the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association have all opposed criminalization in those kinds of cases. “I think it would give anyone pause,” Diaz-Tello said. “If they were experiencing an obstetrical emergency — whether they had self-managed an abortion or whether they were just in the midst of a pregnancy loss — the possibility that they could be investigated, thrown in jail, and have their mugshot placed all over the news is going to have a deterrent effect.” The Starr County case isn’t the only example of people being criminalized for self-managing abortions. Diaz-Tello said that her organization has identified at least 60 instances nationwide over the last two decades so far. The Starr County case came at a moment when many Republican-led state legislatures are enacting draconian anti-abortion laws. For example, an Oklahoma bill, signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt Tuesday, goes even further than the Texas law. It enacts a near-total ban on abortion except in cases where the pregnant person’s life is endangered. Under the bill, any medical provider who performs an abortion faces up to 10 years in prison and up to $100,000 in fines. There’s a limit to how far Republicans can go as long as the US Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade survives. The decision recognized a pregnant person’s fundamental right to seek an abortion, but found that states could still impose restrictions on the procedure in the service of protecting the pregnant person’s health and the potential life of a fetus once it can survive outside the womb. The Supreme Court is widely expected to overturn Roe in the coming months. Many red states already have trigger laws on the books that would allow the state to prosecute people who provide and receive abortions, potentially making the practice more common. Texas, for instance, passed a law last year that would completely ban abortion if the Supreme Court were to “wholly or partly” overturn Roe. Starting 30 days after such a decision, abortion providers in Texas could face up to 20 years in prison or up to life if “an unborn child dies as a result of the offense.” Though that law still wouldn’t criminalize people who get abortions, as the Starr County case attempted to, it could put doctors and their medical support staff in a harsh new kind of legal jeopardy.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23021104/texas-abortion-murder-charge-starr-county,11808
The limitations of Joe Biden’s executive order on abortion,Li Zhou,2022-07-08T22:30:00+00:00,"On Friday, President Joe Biden signed an executive order dedicated to protecting abortion rights, following repeated calls from Democratic lawmakers and advocates to do so. The order, which directs several federal agencies to take action on abortion, has been described by some legal experts and activists as an important first step, though it falls short of what many previously called for. “Let’s put it this way: Nothing in his executive order will fundamentally change the everyday lives of poor women in a red state,” Georgetown University health law professor Lawrence Gostin told Vox. Biden’s executive order indicates progress: It emphasizes the White House’s support for protecting access to medication abortion, defending access to contraception, and guaranteeing a patient’s right to emergency medical services. It also addresses some of the concerns progressive lawmakers and abortion rights activists had about his initial response and sends a message about how seriously the administration is taking this issue. The order fails to include, however, certain measures advocates and Democratic lawmakers have suggested, including an explicit commitment from the Justice Department to get involved in lawsuits that defend a person’s right to medication abortion and the use of Medicaid resources to fund travel for people who need to go across state lines. While both of these efforts would likely face court challenges, they’re also moves that have solid legal footing, according to Gostin, and that could significantly improve access for people living under abortion bans. Broadly, Biden’s actions have been welcomed by Democrats, advocates, and legal experts, though there’s an overwhelming sense in his party that he could do more. While Biden is unable on his own to bring back the protections offered by Roe and an executive order is no replacement for legislation, there are further steps he could take to try to preserve abortion access. Jennifer Klein, the head of the White House’s Gender Policy Council, noted in a Friday briefing that the White House is still in the process of exploring other options, including declaring a public health emergency. “We are glad to see the White House start to implement a whole of government approach to abortion access,” says Morgan Hopkins, the interim executive director of campaigns and strategies at All Above All, an abortion rights advocacy group. “But this plan, which the White House committed to months ago, is both late and not enough.” Biden’s executive order details a couple of different areas where the federal government is trying to protect abortion access. It focuses on a few key issues: The order directs HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra to compile a report within 30 days detailing different options for further guaranteeing this access. Attorney General Merrick Garland has also previously said he opposes state bans on medication abortion, though he did not indicate what actions his department would take in response to these bans. “Often abortion is the required treatment when a pregnant person’s life or health is in danger, and health care providers must have clear guidance about their legal duties in the face of confusing state abortion bans that impose severe criminal penalties,” says Cynthia Soohoo, a law professor and gender justice expert at the CUNY School of Law. “Without this clear guidance, pregnant people will die.” While the executive order is an important first step, it contains a lot of sweeping statements that still need more specifics. For example, some advocates have said they’re unclear on how the administration will defend medication abortion access and provide financial support for women who need to travel for an abortion. When it comes to access, there are a few routes the White House could take, like committing to lawsuits that contest state abortion bans on the grounds that FDA rules about medication abortion supersede state policies. Such a move would face legal pushback, but there is a precedent for a challenge like this, including a 2014 suit involving an opioid drug in Massachusetts, Drexel University law professor David Cohen previously told Vox. Abortion advocates have also called for the administration to consider more “creative” efforts like declaring a public health emergency and establishing abortion clinics on federal lands. The White House has previously said that it was worried providers and patients could be prosecuted by state officials even if clinics were set up on federal lands. Klein noted the White House was still open to a public health emergency, though there are concerns that such a move wouldn’t release much funding. “I call on the administration to recognize the true emergency we are in. Get creative. Get caught trying. Don’t let norms, or decency, or ‘tradition’ stand in your way,” said Women’s March executive director Rachel O’Leary Carmona in a statement. In general, there’s still room for the administration to explore options beyond what Biden committed to on Friday. “The executive order seems to be drafted to mitigate harm, which is important, but I fear it is not enough to address the moment we are in,” Soohoo told Vox.",https://www.vox.com/23200938/joe-biden-executive-order-abortion,11808
Missouri could lose its last abortion clinic. Its fate will be decided this week.,Anna North,2019-10-28T14:40:00+00:00,"The last abortion clinic in Missouri is battling for its existence. Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region has been operating for 46 years, serving thousands of patients annually for STI testing, cancer screenings, and abortions. But it might have to stop offering abortion care thanks to a months-long dispute with state regulators. The controversy started after an audit earlier this year, when officials say they found “deficient practices” at the clinic. While they haven’t been very specific about what those practices are, officials requested interviews with doctors working at the clinic. Some of the doctors agreed, but others did not, possibly fearing that the state would launch criminal proceedings against them. Meanwhile, officials said that if they couldn’t interview all the doctors, they would revoke the clinic’s license to perform abortions. Beginning Monday, representatives from the clinic and the state will testify at a weeklong series of hearings to determine if the facility can keep its license. If the clinic loses, Missouri residents — including more than a million people who can become pregnant — will have to travel across state lines if they want to end a pregnancy. Advocates say this will increase the already significant obstacles that patients — who are disproportionately low-income — face when trying to get the procedure. The outcome of the hearing could also signal the end of an era in abortion access: if Missouri loses its clinic, it will become the first state with no provider since Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that established the right to an abortion in America. While near-total bans on abortion grabbed headlines earlier this year, states have also been engaged in quieter, more incremental efforts to restrict abortion. Some, including Missouri, have passed restrictions on abortion doctors, laws similar to one in Louisiana that will go before the Supreme Court this term. But Planned Parenthood says it is also using the clinic licensing process as a roundabout way of shutting the clinic down. If the facility has to stop providing abortions, advocates say, it could be the biggest success yet for the strategy of eliminating access without banning the procedure outright. “It is the moment that we have long been warning about,” Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of state media campaigns at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Vox: “the day that abortion access is eliminated without ever overturning Roe.” The clinic that is now Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region was founded in 1973, the year Roe was decided. Planned Parenthood bought the facility in 1996. Over the years, the clinic has been inspected a number of times, and inspectors were always collegial and professional, Dr. David Eisenberg, the clinic’s former medical director who still provides abortions and other care there, told Vox. But things started to change after the appointment of a new director, Dr. Randall Williams, to lead the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services in 2017. Williams, an OB-GYN, was appointed by former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, and has spoken little publicly about his position on abortion. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch earlier this year, he said only, “Abortion is legal in Missouri, and I want it to be safe.” But soon after his appointment, Eisenberg said, state regulators essentially started saying, “We have reinterpreted the rules and regulations and found what you do to no longer be compliant.” (The health department has not yet responded to Vox’s request for comment.) The department conducted an audit of the clinic in March, and said it had found “deficient practices,” according to Planned Parenthood, but it didn’t clarify what practices it found deficient. In a statement in June, the department said it was “reviewing incidents with significant medical evidence which point to troubling instances and deviations from the standard care, resulting in serious patient harm.” To further investigate the deficiencies, the health department said it needed to interview all the doctors who practice at the clinic. The two doctors who are Planned Parenthood employees agreed to the interviews — but others, who were medical residents affiliated with a St. Louis hospital, did not do so. The state said the results of the interviews could include “board review” or “criminal proceedings,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood said earlier this year. And Planned Parenthood said it could not force the residents to sit for interviews because they were not employees, according to the Kansas City Star. The clinic was threatened with closure at the end of May, when its license was scheduled to expire and the health department declined to renew it. But a judge issued a preliminary injunction allowing the clinic to stay open. Since then, the case has been referred to the state’s Administrative Hearing Commission, which handles disputes between state agencies and private individuals or groups. The commission will hold all-day hearings in the case this Monday through Friday. It’s not clear when the commission will issue a decision, but the process could take months, Gilmore said. Throughout the process, the state has maintained that there are safety issues at the clinic. According to the statement issued by the health department in June, officials are “concerned by the refusal of physicians to provide explanations for the deeply troubling instances of patient care and conduct under investigation.” Details about the department’s concerns have been difficult to obtain — the statement of deficiencies was not made public. But a conference call between state officials and anti-abortion activists in May suggests that the state wanted to investigate “failed” abortions, in which a patient remained pregnant, and the number of ambulance visits to the clinic, according to the Kansas City Star. Planned Parenthood, meanwhile, says the concerns about patient care are essentially a ruse, and the state’s real goal is simply to shut down the clinic. “The state of Missouri has waged political theater in order to ban abortion,” Gilmore said. The organization points to the May conference call between Steele Shippy, then-communications director for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, and Republican legislators and anti-abortion activists. The email invitation to the call ended with the phrase “#shutthemdown,” the Kansas City Star reported. On the call, Shippy said that media would ask whether the state’s goal was to shut the clinic down. “While some of us, yes, it’s a main goal, but it also should be our main goal to protect the health and safety of women,” Shippy said. The governor’s office declined to comment to Vox for this story. Shippy, who is now Parson’s campaign manager in his reelection campaign, has said that the call was nor arranged by the governor’s office. He is scheduled to testify at the hearings this week. Ahead of the hearings, Planned Parenthood said the stakes could not be higher. Even with the clinic open, “there’s over a million women” of reproductive age “in the state of Missouri with one freestanding health center providing abortion care,” Eisenberg said. If the clinic no longer provides abortions, any of those people facing an unwanted pregnancy would have to go to another state for care. The majority of people seeking abortions in America are low-income, which means that traveling added distances can be a real financial hardship, especially if it means extra time off work. Last week, Planned Parenthood opened a new clinic just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, in Illinois, which could see Missourians if the Missouri clinic cannot. But other neighboring states, like Iowa, Kentucky, and Kansas, are restricting abortion access, not expanding it. Meanwhile, the battle with state regulators is already having an effect, according to Eisenberg. “There’s a lot of confusion,” he said. “People think that abortion’s no longer available, when it is.” And the outcome of the hearing will have implications outside Missouri too. In the last year, states around the country have passed strict bans on abortion. A Missouri law, for example, bans the procedure at eight weeks into pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. But all these laws, including Missouri’s, have been blocked by courts. Another, quieter movement against abortion, however, may be coming to fruition. Since 2010, states have been passing restrictions on abortion clinics and providers that have had the effect of shutting clinics down. A 2016 Supreme Court decision, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, found several such restrictions in Texas unconstitutional and struck a major blow to them nationwide. But since then, President Trump has appointed two conservative justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, to the court. And earlier this month, the court announced it would hear the case June Medical Services v. Gee, which concerns a law in Louisiana very similar to those at issue in Whole Woman’s Health. Many abortion-rights advocates fear that the court will rule in favor of Louisiana, essentially giving states a green light to pass more and more onerous restrictions on clinics until abortion is impossible to access, even if it’s not banned outright. The conflict in Missouri right now is about health department regulation and inspections, not laws. But, Gilmore said, the situation is still similar to the one in Louisiana — officials are “using the regulatory process under the guise of health and safety” to try to stamp out abortion in the state. If the clinic does stop providing abortions, it will likely be seen as a sign by advocates on both sides of the issue that the strategy of restricting or regulating abortion out of existence is working. That could have the effect of keeping doctors from entering the field of abortion care, Eisenberg said, exacerbating an existing shortage of abortion doctors in many places. Faced with increasing restrictions, they may feel that “this is ridiculous, I’m going to go find something else to do where the government’s not going to get in my way,” he said. But, he said, the situation in Missouri should also galvanize activism around abortion rights: “for anyone who cares about the rights of people who can become pregnant in this country, now is the time to get up and fight back.”",https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/10/28/20932235/planned-parenthood-missouri-abortion-clinic-roe-wade,11808
North Dakota adopts one of the strictest abortion bans in the US,Nicole Narea,2023-04-25T17:47:37+00:00,"North Dakota just adopted one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. The law, signed by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum on Monday, makes it a felony to perform an abortion with very narrow exceptions: in cases of rape or incest, a patient may obtain one during the first six weeks of pregnancy (before most people know they’re pregnant); and in cases where the life of the pregnant person is at risk or they would face serious health consequences. The law stands in defiance of the North Dakota Supreme Court’s March ruling refusing to reinstate a separate abortion ban that was triggered after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. That state ruling is temporary, but in a sign of how it may ultimately rule, the court said that abortion access is protected by the state constitution. The law is also coming at a time when the national Republican party is struggling to chart a path forward on abortion messaging following an unexpectedly poor performance in the midterms and the defeat of anti-abortion ballot measures even in red states last year. The new ban leaves North Dakotans with practically no option but to carry their pregnancy to term or seek care elsewhere if they can afford to do so, especially given that there are no remaining abortion clinics in the state. The law could also potentially have a chilling effect on doctors who face the now very risky decision to perform an abortion in medical emergencies, raising the stakes to potential prison time if they make the wrong call. That’s been a concern in other states, including Texas, where several women have asked a court to clarify when an abortion can be considered medically necessary to fulfill an exception in the state’s abortion ban. Katie Christensen, North Dakota state director of external affairs for Planned Parenthood North Dakota Action Fund, said that the new North Dakota ban was “likely unconstitutional.” “Abortion is essential health care, and politicians have no place inserting themselves into private, personal medical decisions,” she said in a statement. “My heart is heavy for survivors of rape and sexual assault who will have their bodily autonomy further stripped away, for doctors who will have to choose between practicing the ethical standard of care or breaking the law.” The new ban could face legal challenges. Courts temporarily blocked the earlier trigger ban from going into effect last year as litigation over it progresses, and the state supreme court’s ruling last month upholding that temporary ban suggests that the trigger ban will be struck down permanently as unconstitutional. Under that standard, it’s possible that the new ban, which is even stricter, would also be struck down. There’s also a question as to whether North Dakota voters might contest the new ban. Republican lawmakers in the state pursued the ban because they said that it’s what North Dakota voters want. “North Dakota has always been pro-life and believed in valuing the moms and children both,” Republican State Sen. Janne Myrdal said in an interview with The Associated Press. Recent polling data for the state isn’t available, making it difficult to evaluate how North Dakotans feel about the issue post-Roe. But the latest available survey conducted by Pew Research in 2014 found that 51 percent of state residents said they supported banning abortion in all or most cases, compared to 47 percent who said they supported making abortion legal in all or most cases. That was significantly further to the right on the issue than the then-national average. That year, however, North Dakota voters also overwhelmingly defeated a ballot measure that would have amended the state constitution to state that the “inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.” At the time, that measure was seen as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. Some abortion advocates in the state are weighing another potential ballot measure to reinstate abortion rights in 2024. They could initiate a ballot measure to repeal the new ban without the approval of the state legislature, so long as they gather the requisite number of signatures from voting-age residents. North Dakota’s efforts to charge ahead with restricting abortion are just one way the GOP is handling abortion politics in the year since Roe was overturned. All signs are pointing to reproductive rights remaining top of mind for voters heading into 2024, and not all conservatives are sure hardline stances will serve them well. After a surprise blowout for abortion rights on a Kansas ballot initiative last summer, abortion was also one of the top issues driving the results of the midterms: Democrats running on pro-abortion rights nearly swept the table in 2022, and every ballot initiative aimed at restricting abortion lost, while ballot initiatives strengthening abortion rights prevailed and even outperformed Democratic candidates in some cases. And last month, a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate won in a very expensive race that didn’t even turn out to be close after making abortion rights an explicit part of her platform. Some in the party are worried about that — many Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, were silent on a Texas judge’s decision to block access to the abortion drug mifepristone before the US Supreme Court intervened, ensuring that the drug will remain available withouNorth Dakota just adopted one of the strictest abortion bans in the country.

The new ban leaves North Dakotans with practically no option but to carry their pregnancy to term or seek care elsewhere if they can afford to do so, especially given that there are no remaining abortion clinics in the state. The law could also potentially have a chilling effect on doctors who face the now very risky decision to perform an abortion in medical emergencies, raising the stakes to potential prison time if they make the wrong call. That’s been a concern in other states, including Texas, where several women have asked a court to clarify when an abortion can be considered medically necessary to fulfill an exception in the state’s abortion ban. Katie Christensen, North Dakota state director of external affairs for Planned Parenthood North Dakota Action Fund, said that the new North Dakota ban was “likely unconstitutional.” “Abortion is essential health care, and politicians have no place inserting themselves into private, personal medical decisions,” she said in a statement. “My heart is heavy for survivors of rape and sexual assault who will have their bodily autonomy further stripped away, for doctors who will have to choose between practicing the ethical standard of care or breaking the law.” The new ban could face legal challenges. Courts temporarily blocked the earlier trigger ban from going into effect last year as litigation over it progresses, and the state supreme court’s ruling last month upholding that temporary ban suggests that the trigger ban will be struck down permanently as unconstitutional. Under that standard, it’s possible that the new ban, which is even stricter, would also be struck down. There’s also a question as to whether North Dakota voters might contest the new ban. Republican lawmakers in the state pursued the ban because they said that it’s what North Dakota voters want. “North Dakota has always been pro-life and believed in valuing the moms and children both,” Republican State Sen. Janne Myrdal said in an interview with The Associated Press. Recent polling data for the state isn’t available, making it difficult to evaluate how North Dakotans feel about the issue post-Roe. But the latest available survey conducted by Pew Research in 2014 found that 51 percent of state residents said they supported banning abortion in all or most cases, compared to 47 percent who said they supported making abortion legal in all or most cases. That was significantly further to the right on the issue than the then-national average. That year, however, North Dakota voters also overwhelmingly defeated a ballot measure that would have amended the state constitution to state that the “inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.” At the time, that measure was seen as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. Some abortion advocates in the state are weighing another potential ballot measure to reinstate abortion rights in 2024. They could initiate a ballot measure to repeal the new ban without the approval of the state legislature, so long as they gather the requisite number of signatures from voting-age residents. North Dakota’s efforts to charge ahead with restricting abortion are just one way the GOP is handling abortion politics in the year since Roe was overturned. All signs are pointing to reproductive rights remaining top of mind for voters heading into 2024, and not all conservatives are sure hardline stances will serve them well. After a surprise blowout for abortion rights on a Kansas ballot initiative last summer, abortion was also one of the top issues driving the results of the midterms: Democrats running on pro-abortion rights nearly swept the table in 2022, and every ballot initiative aimed at restricting abortion lost, while ballot initiatives strengthening abortion rights prevailed and even outperformed Democratic candidates in some cases. And last month, a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate won in a very expensive race that didn’t even turn out to be close after making abortion rights an explicit part of her platform. Some in the party are worried about that — many Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, were silent on a Texas judge’s decision to block access to the abortion drug mifepristone before the US Supreme Court intervened, ensuring that the drug will remain available without restrictions for now. But others have been doubling down on abortion restrictions. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is weighing a 2024 presidential bid, explicitly supported the legal fight to block access to mifepristone and said that he wanted the drug “off the market.” Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also expected to soon announce his presidential candidacy, enacted a six-week abortion ban in the state despite the fact that a big majority of Florida voters don’t support it. That’s prompted concern among some Republicans that the party is embracing a losing argument. While North Dakota is a solidly red state where the GOP isn’t likely to see significant slippage in 2024, the sum total of abortion bans signed by Republican governors like Burgum might not help the party’s case nationally. t restrictions for now.

"Abortion in America, explained in 10 facts",Anna North,2019-05-16T22:00:00+00:00,"Four states have passed “heartbeat” bills this year alone, banning abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Alabama just passed a near-total ban on abortion at any stage of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. And on Thursday, Missouri moved a step closer to passing a ban on abortion at eight weeks’ gestation, also without exceptions for rape or incest — the bill passed the state Senate and now returns to the House for approval. As legislation to restrict abortion moves forward around the country, many Americans have questions about the procedure. Some wonder whether abortion is still legal (it is, in every state in the country), whether it’s on the rise (it’s not), and how recently passed laws around the country would affect patients (the answers vary by state). To help answer these questions and more, below are 10 facts that paint a picture of abortion in America today. Given recent efforts by lawmakers to restrict abortion, you might think the procedure was on the rise. In fact, it’s less common than ever before, as Sarah Kliff reported at Vox last December. Between 2006 and 2015, the American abortion rate declined 26 percent to the lowest level on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The biggest reason for the drop, experts say, isn’t tougher abortion laws — it’s better access to contraception. “When contraceptives aren’t available, women use abortion, even if it isn’t legally sanctioned and even if it puts them at great physical risk,” Diana Greene Foster, an associate professor at University of California San Francisco who studies abortion, told Kliff in 2016. “When contraceptives are more available, use of abortion declines.” The recent decline in abortions may have to do, in particular, with long-acting, reversible contraceptives like IUDs, which work for years without the need to take a pill every day. In 2012, the Affordable Care Act made these forms of birth control, which can have a high upfront cost, more accessible by requiring that most employer-provided insurance plans cover them without a copay. But, as Kliff reports, Americans were already moving toward these methods — and possibly as a result, the proportion of pregnancies that were unintended dropped from 51 to 45 percent between 2008 and 2011. Even though the abortion rate has declined, the procedure remains commonplace. According to a 2017 analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, 23.7 percent of women in the United States will have an abortion by the age of 45. Nineteen percent will have one by age 30, and 4.6 percent will have one by age 20. Pop-culture depictions of abortion, from the 2014 romantic comedy Obvious Child to the 2019 anti-abortion biopic Unplanned, typically feature a single, childless woman undergoing the procedure. The decision is often framed as a choice between having an abortion or becoming a parent. But in fact, the majority of people who have abortions are already parents. As of 2014, 59 percent of people who had abortions had already given birth to at least one child, according to Guttmacher. And while abortion is often discussed in the context of teen pregnancy, the majority of abortion patients in 2014 — 60 percent — were in their 20s. Another 25 percent were in their 30s and fewer than 4 percent were under 18. People who get abortions are disproportionately likely to have low incomes — in 2014, 49 percent had family incomes below the poverty line. And although religious groups have been some of the most vocal anti-abortion advocates in America, the majority of people who got abortions in 2014 identified as religious, with 17 percent listing themselves as mainline Protestant, 13 percent as evangelical, and 24 percent as Roman Catholic. The abortion rate among Catholic women was about the same as the national average, while among evangelical women it was about half the national average. A wave of “heartbeat” bills, which ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, has been sweeping the country in recent months. These bills ban the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many people know they are pregnant. The first one passed in North Dakota in 2013, but they began gaining steam last year, with Iowa passing its version in May. This year, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, and Georgia have all passed heartbeat bills. Some of these have exceptions for cases of rape or incest; others do not. On Wednesday, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law an even more restrictive bill, which bans abortion at any stage of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, which is scheduled to take effect in six months, abortion would only be legal if the pregnant person’s life is at risk. Meanwhile, the Missouri state Senate on Thursday passed a bill banning abortion at eight weeks’ gestation, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Under the bill, which now goes back to the state House, abortion would only be legal in cases of medical emergency. The heartbeat laws passed around the country have all either been challenged in court or are likely to be challenged soon. None has yet taken effect. The Alabama law has not taken effect yet either, and is likely to be challenged too. Abortion is currently legal in all 50 states. The Georgia “heartbeat” law, in particular, generated concern among many after Mark Joseph Stern of Slate reported that it could be used to prosecute women who seek abortions or who have a miscarriage. At this point, reproductive rights advocates say they’re not sure if the law would ever be used in this way. “It seems to be a stretch to what’s actually in the law and I’m really confused as to whether or not this would be possible,” Elizabeth Nash, the senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, told Vox. Some of the confusion may stem from the way the Georgia law and others like it are written. “These are not particularly clearly drafted laws,” Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who studies the history of the abortion debate, told Vox. “Really the rub is going to be in how these are enforced.” If the Georgia law does go into effect, it’s more likely that a person who miscarries would be pulled into a criminal investigation of a doctor or other provider, rather than that she would face criminal charges herself, Staci Fox, president of Planned Parenthood Southeast, told the Washington Post. The symptoms of a miscarriage can be indistinguishable from those of an induced abortion, according to OB-GYN Dr. Jen Gunter. Miscarriages are extremely common, occurring in about 10 percent of recognized pregnancies, as pediatrics professor Aaron E. Carroll writes at the New York Times. Sponsors of several recently passed abortion restrictions have said that part of their goal is to challenge Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established that Americans have the right to obtain an abortion. Since the “heartbeat” bills and the Alabama law all ban abortion long before viability, they are in clear conflict with Roe. They either have been or will be challenged in court, and the cases could make it all the way to the Supreme Court, giving the Court a chance to revisit and possibly overturn Roe. Alabama state Rep. Terri Collins, the sponsor of her state’s recently passed abortion law, has said this is her goal. “What I’m trying to do here is get this case in front of the Supreme Court so Roe v. Wade can be overturned,” she told the Washington Post. It may not work. Because the Alabama law lacks exceptions for rape and incest, it is so controversial that the Supreme Court may not want to weigh in on it. However, there are more than a dozen cases involving abortion already one step away from the Supreme Court, and the Court could choose to use any one of them to reexamine Roe. So even if the Alabama law or the “heartbeat” bills don’t end up toppling the landmark abortion decision, something else might. As abortion opponents back increasingly restrictive laws at the state level, abortion-rights advocates have been supporting legislation to loosen abortion restrictions and shore up abortion access. In part, they’re preparing for the possibility that Roe v. Wade could be overturned, giving states the right to regulate abortion as they see fit. Abortion-rights supporters want states to pass laws protecting abortion so that if Roe falls, residents of those states will still have access to the procedure. One recent example is New York’s Reproductive Health Act, which passed in January. Among other provisions, the law allows abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is non-viable or if there is a risk to the patient’s health. Previously, most abortions after 24 weeks had been banned in New York. Another recent effort to loosen restrictions happened in Virginia, where state legislators proposed a bill that would have broadened the circumstances under which someone could get an abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy. That bill was eventually tabled after sparking nationwide controversy, which started when the bill’s sponsor said in a hearing that the bill would allow an abortion if a patient was going into labor. The sponsor later said that she misspoke, and Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an OB-GYN and board member of Physicians for Reproductive Health, told Vox, “patients do not request abortion when they are in labor and doctors do not provide it.” But controversy around the bill continued when Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, asked about the bill during a radio interview, said that if a mother was in labor, “the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” Some took these comments as an endorsement of infanticide. A spokesperson for the governor said he was “absolutely not” referring to infanticide, but his comments led President Trump and others to claim, repeatedly, that doctors in America are killing babies after birth and that legislation is needed to stop it. In reality, no abortion law — not the Virginia bill, the New York law, or any other — allows doctors to kill babies after they are born. This is already illegal everywhere in the United States. Though much conversation recently has focused on abortions that happen later in pregnancy (“late-term abortion” is not a medically accurate phrase), more than 90 percent of abortions happen within the first trimester, or about the first three months. Only 1.4 percent of abortions happen at 21 weeks’ gestation or later, according to Planned Parenthood. Patients who seek abortion later in pregnancy may have recently found out about a serious fetal abnormality, some of which are not discovered until 20 weeks or later. Others may have had trouble getting to a clinic. “I’m at a center where I’m the referral center for the state, and so patients that are seeking care elsewhere may get referred to me and I’m often hours away from where they initially sought care,” Brandi explained to Vox earlier this year. “So it takes a while for them to get up to see me, and that includes not just the time it takes to come up here but also making sure they have child care for the children they already have, getting transportation. There’s so many different types of barriers that are created for health care in general, but specifically abortion care.”",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/16/18628002/abortion-ohio-alabama-georgia-law-bill-details,11808
Why the Senate took a doomed vote on abortion rights,Li Zhou,2022-03-01T15:52:38+00:00,"The Senate on Monday took its first ever vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill aimed at codifying the right to an abortion. Democrats hoped to use the vote to show support for abortion rights as they come under attack in numerous states, and as they face a challenge in the Supreme Court. The vote, as expected, failed: Republicans broadly opposed the legislation and filibustered it, so the bill was unable to advance. The final vote count was 46-48, with all present Democrats except Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) voting in favor of opening debate on the legislation, and no Republicans doing so. Both Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who’ve been longtime supporters of abortion rights, made it clear they wouldn’t be signing onto the Women’s Health Protection Act because they felt it would supersede certain state laws they support. The two put out a joint statement ahead of the vote introducing their own bill, which centered on codifying the protections established by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Although the bill was never expected to advance, the consideration of the Women’s Health Protection Act was still important. By holding a vote on the legislation, Democrats highlighted abortion rights as a priority and got lawmakers — including vulnerable Republicans — on the record about where they stand. Because the vote was primarily for messaging, its main purpose was to demonstrate to voters that Democrats are listening to them, andtrying to advance this issue. By taking it, Democrats hope to energize their base and draw a stark contrast with GOP leaders in the upcoming elections.Given most Americans, including 35 percent of Republicans, support abortion rights, activists believe this vote can help make their case in competitive midterm races. “It’s really important to take these critical votes on issues that matter to the American people so voters understand where their elected officials are,” said Kristin Ford, a vice president of communications and research for NARAL, a group that advocates for abortion rights. The Women’s Health Protection Act would enshrine into federal law the right to access and perform an abortion, and it would supersede state laws on the issue. That’s notable because it would effectively neutralize laws in 19 states that have sought to severely curb access to abortion or ban it altogether. Such restrictions have disproportionately harmed low-income women who are already less likely to have health care coverage for abortions, and who face more obstacles accessing alternative options if their states put in barriers. According to an ABC News report, Black and Hispanic women in conservative states will also bear the outsize impact of abortion restrictions in these places because they’ve had higher abortion rates. If passed, the Women’s Health Protection Act would bar six-week and 20-week bans on abortions. It would also prohibit policies, like ultrasound requirements and waiting periods, that attempt to make it more burdensome to obtain an abortion. The text of the legislation makes it clear that it’s a direct response to what the bill’s sponsors say are more than 500 state and local laws limiting abortion access implemented in some way since 2011. Democrats’ consideration of the bill comes as Republican-led states have ramped up efforts to ban abortions, including a six-week ban Texas instituted last year, and as the Supreme Court weighs a case that could severely dilute the protections offered by Roe v. Wade. The proposed federal law would provide sweeping protections that ensure that people have abortion access even if the Supreme Court rules to weaken reproductive rights. It wouldn’t, however, supersede laws addressing insurance coverage for abortions. Previously, there have been strict limits on Medicaid coverage of abortions because of the Hyde Amendment’s restrictions on the use of federal funding for such health care. “People are counting on the Senate to do what the Supreme Court will not,” Nancy Northrup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. “The hardship and chaos in Texas right now is coming to other states soon, unless the right to abortion is protected through federal legislation.” In addition to revealing where lawmakers stand, the vote also makes the case for a larger Democratic majority. Because Democrats have such narrow margins in the Senate, they aren’t able to advance most bills if they get blocked by Republicans. Additionally, their razor-thin 50-50 majority means that any Democratic defections would still stymie the legislation even if the filibuster were to be eliminated. If Democrats were able to keep all of the Senate seats they currently hold, and win the seats currently held by the GOP that the Cook Political Report rates as “toss-up” or “lean Republican,” they’d gain five seats. That’s an unlikely prospect, but they’ll try to argue for it this fall with votes like the one on the Women’s Health Protection Act. In certain battleground states including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, a narrow majority of adults have said they believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a 2014 Pew survey. Support for abortion rights was slightly less robust in other purple states like Georgia and Arizona. Advocates hope this vote will be compelling for swing voters in places where abortion rights have strong support, and a motivating force for the Democratic base. Even if they were to pick up more seats, Democrats would still need Republican support to hit a 60-vote threshold to overcome filibusters. But they’d potentially have the 51 votes needed to eliminate the filibuster or to establish a carve-out for certain bills, including legislation to protect abortion rights. That’s a tantalizing possibility for Democrats, who have spent two years seeing their legislative goals blocked by the Republican minority. Ford notes that Monday’s vote could play an important role in reminding voters of the importance of winning every race possible ahead of the midterm elections. “We need to secure more seats so we can advance legislation like this that is so critical, and so aligned with mainstream public opinions,” Ford said.",https://www.vox.com/2022/2/28/22946299/womens-health-protection-act-senate-vote-abortion-rights,11808
Latin American abortion rights activists just notched another win in Mexico,Nicole Narea,2023-09-07T18:25:00+00:00,"Mexico’s Supreme Court decriminalized abortion nationwide Wednesday, making it one of many Latin American countries that has eased restrictions on the procedure in recent years. Wednesday’s decision comes after a narrower 2021 ruling that decriminalized abortion only in the state of Coahuila, which sits along the US-Mexico border. Though some states moved to liberalize their laws around abortion since that ruling, federal law defining abortion as “unconstitutional,” as well as laws penalizing medical providers who perform the procedure, still stood until Wednesday. Now, abortion will become available in all federal Mexican health institutions in every state where women could have previously faced criminal penalties for undergoing the procedure. “It is a huge and historic victory for Mexico and for the entire region,” said Anu Kumar, president and CEO of Ipas, a global reproductive justice organization. “Abortion is not a crime. Abortion is part of essential health care. And that is what the Supreme Court in Mexico now clearly recognizes.” Mexico — much like the rest of conservative, largely Catholic Latin America — has been slow to lift restrictions on abortion. But under pressure from abortion activists’ so-called “Green Wave” movement, the legal landscape has changed dramatically in the last three years. Since Argentine lawmakers voted to legalize the procedure in 2020, Colombia’s highest court also decriminalized abortion, Ecuadorian lawmakers made abortion legal in cases of rape, and Chilean lawmakers began seeking to guarantee women’s reproductive rights through the country’s new constitution. (The rise of the far right in elections held earlier this year, however, has threatened to reverse that progress in Chile.) Wednesday’s ruling is another victory for the Green Wave. “Latin America has a very powerful not just feminist movement, but social justice movement, and they are increasingly working at a regional level,” Kumar said. The ruling in Mexico is a reflection of changing attitudes about abortion. In Mexico, nearly a third of the population supported legalizing abortion in all cases in 2019, compared to just 12 percent in 2005. A bigger share — 46 percent — supported legalizing abortion in all or most cases in a Pew Research survey earlier this year. Still, support for abortion remains lower in Mexico and other Latin American countries than in the US and many other countries globally, particularly in Europe. The level at which Latin Americans support abortion rights is also lower compared to support among Hispanics living in the US, who include people from other Spanish-speaking countries in addition to those from Latin America. A September 2022 survey by Pew Research found that 57 percent of US Hispanics say abortion should be legal in most or all cases. And in 2022, after the US Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, abortion entered the top five issues that US Latinos were concerned about for the first time. That discrepancy might be in part attributed to differences in how religious beliefs factor into views on abortion in Latin America compared to among Hispanics living in the US. Secularism is rising among both Latin Americans and US Hispanics, but more slowly among the former. Some 57 percent of Latin Americans identified as Catholic as of 2020, whereas exactly half of US Hispanics identified as Catholic that year. Wednesday’s ruling will bring about immediate changes in Mexico: States will have to change their laws to comply, clinical standards and guidelines will have to be rolled out, medical providers will have to be trained to administer abortion, and the public will have to be educated on their newfound right to an abortion and how they can access it. In the parts of Mexico that have been administering abortions in large numbers for more than a decade, like Mexico City, those changes should be implemented relatively quickly. Expanding abortion access beyond federal facilities in states that currently criminalize the procedure is expected to take more time, and right-wing opponents to abortion rights have promised to fight the decision. “Let’s remember what happened in the United States,” Irma Barrientos, leader of the anti-abortion group the Civil Association for the Rights of the Conceived told the Associated Press. “After 40 years, the Supreme Court reversed its abortion decision, and we’re not going to stop until Mexico guarantees the right to life from the moment of conception.” Despite opposition, the decision is expected to open up opportunities for not just Mexicans, but for all Central Americans, and even citizens of the United States. After Roe v. Wade fell, Americans in states with abortion bans increasingly began traveling from the US to Mexico to access abortions. That trend is likely to continue. “People will definitely travel to Mexico to get the care that they need,” Kumar said.",https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/9/7/23863267/mexico-abortion-decriminalize-supreme-court-ruling,11808
"The Supreme Court’s abortion pills case, explained",Ian Millhiser,2024-03-21T16:00:00+00:00,"For more than a year, a specter named Matthew Kacsmaryk has loomed over abortion access in the United States. Kacsmaryk, a former lawyer for Christian right causes who Donald Trump appointed to the federal bench, attempted to ban the drug mifepristone, a medication used in about half of all US abortions, in the spring of last year. Now this case, known as FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, will receive a hearing before the Supreme Court on Tuesday — though there’s not a lot of suspense regarding the outcome. The Court blocked Kacsmaryk’s decision last April, temporarily leaving mifepristone on the market while this case worked its way through the appellate process. That’s a strong sign that even this very conservative Supreme Court — the same Court that overruled Roe v. Wade — wants no part of this attack on mifepristone. Kacsmaryk’s opinion was, to put it mildly, sloppy. He allowed the plaintiffs to challenge the FDA’s 23-year-old approval of mifepristone, even though the statute of limitations for such claims is six years and there was no valid reason to extend it by nearly two decades. He relied on two discredited studies that have since been retracted by their publisher. He cited another “study” that collected “data” entirely from anonymous blog posts published on an anti-abortion website. According to a brief filed by the ACLU and two other organizations, Kacsmaryk relied on testimony by a “doctor” who isn’t actually a physician at all — the man in question’s only advanced degree is a masters in theological studies. Also, Kacsmaryk didn’t even have jurisdiction to hear the case in the first place. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a court dominated by MAGA Republicans, did toss out part of Kacsmaryk’s decision: It acknowledged that the statute of limitations to challenge the FDA’s 2000 decision to approve mifepristone has expired. But the Fifth Circuit’s ruling would still have the same effect as a ban. That’s because the Fifth Circuit invalidated changes that the FDA made in 2016 and 2021 to the protocol health providers must use when prescribing mifepristone. Among other things, the FDA allowed mifepristone to be used up to the 70th day of a pregnancy (previously, it was only allowed up to 49 days), and it reduced the amount of mifepristone dispensed to abortion patients from 600 mg to 200 mg. Requiring health providers to return to pre-2016 protocols would prevent mifepristone from being prescribed for at least several months. As the drug’s manufacturer explained to the Supreme Court, it must “revise product labels, packaging, and promotional materials; recertify providers; and amend its supplier- and distributor-contracts and policies” to comply with the old protocols, under the Fifth Circuit’s approach. In the unlikely event that the Supreme Court affirms the Fifth Circuit, moreover, that would have devastating effects on the entire US health system. The Fifth Circuit faulted the FDA for looking at multiple scientific studies to justify the changes to how mifepristone is prescribed, rather than relying on one grand study that examined every potential change at once. But the FDA has never been required to make this inquiry when approving any other drug. Moreover, as a brief filed by pharmaceutical executives and investors warns, if all medications have to clear this bar, “thousands of drugs, including numerous transformative medicines,” would likely fall short. Kacsmaryk and the Fifth Circuit, in other words, were willing to jeopardize Americans’ access to hundreds or even thousands of potentially lifesaving drugs, all to spite a single drug that is used to provide abortions. And now it’s up to a Supreme Court that is quite hostile to abortion rights to clean up this mess. No one is allowed to bring a federal lawsuit unless they can show that they were injured in some way by the party they are suing, a requirement known as “standing.” Federal plaintiffs may sometimes allege that they have standing to sue because they will experience an injury in the future unless a government policy is changed. But the Supreme Court held in Clapper v. Amnesty International(2013) that this future injury must be “certainly impending” and not merely “speculative.” The plaintiffs in the Alliance case are anti-abortion doctors and organizations representing anti-abortion doctors, and their theory of why they have standing changed significantly after this case arrived at the Supreme Court for the second time. But none of their shifting standing arguments are persuasive. In the lower courts, the plaintiffs’ primary argument was that, if mifepristone remains on the market, some patients who take the drug will experience complications. Some of those patients might then seek care from an emergency room in a hospital where one of the plaintiff doctors or a member of the plaintiff organizations is working. That doctor might then have to care for this patient, and might discover that the mifepristone did not successfully terminate the patient’s pregnancy. This anti-abortion doctor might then have to complete the abortion or otherwise provide care that violates their conscience. That’s a whole lot of mights. And it’s far too many to establish the “certainly impending” injury that is required by Clapper. Nevertheless, the Fifth Circuit bought this argument. It reasoned that “millions of women take mifepristone” and “hundreds” of the plaintiff organizations’ members “are OB/Gyns and emergency-room doctors.” So, statistically, the Fifth Circuit claimed, it was likely that at least one of these doctors would have to provide care they do not want to provide to a mifepristone patient. There are many problems with the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning, but the most glaring one is that the court’s decision is directly at odds with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Summers v. Earth Island Institute (2009). Summers rejected the idea that a membership organization can establish standing by demonstrating that “there is a statistical probability that some of those members are threatened with concrete injury.” Perhaps recognizing that the Fifth Circuit’s standing theory is inconsistent with Summers, the Alliance plaintiffs offer several alternative theories in the Supreme Court. Their new lead argument, for example, is that some of their members “consider any participation in an elective abortion objectionable,” and so these doctors are injured if they are made to “feel complicit” in an abortion by providing care to someone who took mifepristone. But even if this feeling of complicity is enough to establish standing, the Alliance plaintiffs still haven’t shown that it is “certainly impending” that an anti-abortion doctor who belongs to one of the plaintiff organizations will be made to feel complicit in an abortion in the future. At most, they’ve just shown a greater statistical likelihood that a doctor who belongs to a plaintiff organization might experience some future injury. All of which is a long way of saying that the Supreme Court should toss this case out without even reaching the merits. No plaintiff has standing to bring this case in a federal court. Because the six-year statute of limitations prevents these plaintiffs from challenging the FDA’s decision to approve mifepristone way back in 2000, the only question before the Supreme Court is whether various changes that the FDA started to roll out in 2016, which make it easier for health providers to prescribe mifepristone, are invalid. Those changes include a new protocol which allows mifepristone to be prescribed up to the 70th day of a pregnancy. They allowed some non-physician health providers to prescribe the drug. And they include two separate decisions to relax a previous requirement that mifepristone patients make in-person visits to the doctor’s office. In 2016, the FDA reduced that requirement from three visits to one. It later eliminated the requirement that the drug be dispensed during an in-person visit. When the FDA approves a drug, or when any federal agency takes any action that falls within the heartland of that agency’s responsibilities, courts are supposed to defer to the agency’s judgment. As the Supreme Court said in Bowman Transportation v. Arkansas-Best Freight System (1974), a “court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.” Instead, the FDA’s decision to approve a drug, or to change how it is prescribed, should be upheld by the courts so long as the agency articulated a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” There’s no serious question that the FDA cleared this low bar in the Alliance case. When the FDA decided to allow mifepristone to be prescribed up to 70 days into a pregnancy, for example, it reviewed several studies, which collectively involved over 30,000 mifepristone patients, that “evaluated the exact proposed dosing regimen through 70 days gestation.” Based on this data, the FDA concluded that the drug works just as effectively after 70 days as it does under the previous protocol, which allowed it to be used only up to 49 days. Similarly, the FDA relied on 11 studies, which together examined tens of thousands of mifepristone patients, to determine that home-use of mifepristone is safe and that the number of in-person visits could be reduced. And it relied on “data on the efficacy of medical abortion provided by non-physician healthcare providers, including four studies with 3,200 women in randomized controlled clinical trials and 596 women in prospective cohorts” to determine that non-physician health providers such as nurse practitioners should be allowed to prescribe the drug. All of this data, which supported the FDA’s decision to relax restrictions on the drug, shows a “rational connection” between the facts and FDA’s ultimate decision. So how did the Fifth Circuit justify ruling against the FDA? The answer is that, while the FDA examined many studies involving thousands of women who took mifepristone, the Fifth Circuit faulted FDA because “none of the studies it relied on examined the effect of implementing all those changes together.” This appears to be an entirely novel new requirement, and the Fifth Circuit cited no caselaw or any other legal decision that has ever imposed such a requirement on the FDA. Nevertheless, the Alliance plaintiffs urge the Supreme Court to adopt this novel limit on FDA’s authority in their brief to the justices. Again, there is no legal support for the Fifth Circuit’s position. And the Fifth Circuit didn’t simply construct a new hoop that the FDA must jump through whenever it approves a new drug or modifies the protocol for an existing drug — it applied this new requirement retroactively to decisions the FDA made years ago. The implications of such a decision are astounding. As the pharmaceutical executives warn in their amicus brief to the justices, the FDA used a more flexible framework “in approving thousands of drugs, including numerous transformative medicines, and in updating those approvals as science evolves.” Moreover, “had those drugs been developed or reviewed by FDA under the Fifth Circuit’s approach, it is likely that few, if any, would have been approved and avoided legal challenges to those approvals.” In other words, if the FDA suddenly must comply with much more restrictive rules, and if those new rules apply retroactively to its past decisions, countless existing medications would immediately be subject to legal challenge. Every court in the country would be required to retroactively apply the new restrictions to a long list of drugs that currently are widely available in the United States. It would be a chaotic, catastrophic blow to US public health, as a wide range of medicines would suddenly be unavailable — and the specific medications that were removed from pharmacies’ shelves would be chosen almost entirely at random, based on whether a court determined that the FDA jumped through a new, arbitrary hoop when it originally approved these drugs. It is unlikely that even the current, very conservative Supreme Court will allow such a thing to happen. The Court already blocked Kacsmaryk and the Fifth Circuit’s attempt to shut down mifepristone use once, and there’s no reason to believe that any justice has changed their views since then. Nevertheless, the Alliance case is significant because it shows just how far some judges are willing to go in order to achieve their ideological goals. Judges like Kacsmaryk are so single-mindedly opposed to abortion that they are willing to upend the existing process for approval, potentially disrupting the availability of lifesaving drugs to millions of Americans in order to make it more difficult for American women to obtain an abortion. And, if Trump wins in November and has the chance to appoint more Kacsmaryks to the federal bench, there could very well be a Supreme Court majority at some point in the future that shares Mr. Kacsmaryk’s recklessness.",https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/21/24105984/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-pills-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine,11808
A federal judge mocks the Supreme Court on abortion,Ian Millhiser,2023-02-07T21:11:33+00:00,"Last June, the Supreme Court said in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization(2022) that “the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.” Given that Dobbs tossed out a half-century of precedent, upended reproductive freedom in about half of the country, and effectively eliminated an entire constitutional right, you probably heard about this decision. Nevertheless, on Monday, a federal judge in Washington, DC handed down a brief order suggesting that the Supreme Court may not have meant what it said in Dobbs. “The ‘issue’ before the Court in Dobbs was not whether any provision of the Constitution provided a right to abortion,” Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton appointee, wrote. “Rather, the question before the Court in Dobbs was whether the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution provided such a right.” And that leaves open the possibility that the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibits “slavery” and “involuntary servitude,” does forbid laws banning abortion. Judge Kollar-Kotelly’s order requires the parties to a criminal prosecution touching on abortion rights to brief whether the Thirteenth Amendment or “any other provision of the Constitution could confer a right to abortion.” Unless the membership of the Supreme Court changes drastically, the Court is exceedingly unlikely to rule that any provision of the Constitution protects the right to an abortion. The Court’s GOP-appointed majority stridently opposes abortion rights. They didn’t just overrule Roe v. Wade. They established, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson (2021), that states can effectively immunize anti-abortion laws from judicial review by using bounty hunters to enforce those laws. Simply put, these deeply committed opponents of abortion rights are not going to reverse course because a judge appointed by a Democratic president writes a clever opinion arguing that forcing someone to carry a pregnancy to term is a form of involuntary servitude. That said, the argument that the Thirteenth Amendment protects a right to an abortion is serious — or, at least, no less serious than much of the legal reasoning that comes out of this Supreme Court. As Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe has written, “a woman forced by law to submit to the pain and anxiety of carrying, delivering, and nurturing a child she does not wish to have is entitled to believe that more than a play on words links her forced labor with the concept of involuntary servitude.” Moreover, while Judge Kollar-Kotelly’s order is, at most, a very thoughtful effort to troll the Supreme Court, trolling is now common practice by lower court judges throughout the federal judiciary. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is dominated by right-wing trolls, who routinely hand down outlandishly reasoned decisions declaring entire federal agencies unconstitutional, ordering the Biden administration to change America’s foreign policy, or even permitting military personnel to defy orders that political conservatives do not like. It would certainly be best if federal judges all engaged in good faith efforts to follow the law, including well-established legal precedents. But since we don’t live in that world, Kollar-Kotelly’s order raises an arresting question: Why should left-leaning judges unilaterally disarm? If Republican judges can play this game, why can’t judges who support abortion rights do the same? Judge Kollar-Kotelly’s order arises out of a case called United States v. Handy, a criminal prosecution of several individuals who allegedly worked together to block access to a reproductive health clinic in 2020, when Roe was still good law. Among other things, these defendants are charged with violating a federal law that makes it a crime to conspire to “injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person . . . in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.” Before Dobbs, this would have been a fairly straightforward case (assuming, of course, that the government can prove its factual allegations against these defendants beyond a reasonable doubt). Prior to Dobbs, cases like Roe established that there is a constitutional right to an abortion. So blocking an abortion clinic injured the right of that clinic’s patients to exercise a constitutional right. After Dobbs, however, the case becomes more complicated. The government still has a strong argument that blocking an abortion clinic violates a federal statute that specifically prohibits using certain tactics to block access to an abortion clinic — and the government also charged these defendants with violating this statute. Nevertheless, the prosecution’s argument that these defendants violated the broader ban on injuring constitutional rights would be stronger if it could also argue that these defendants violated a constitutional right to an abortion. Enter the Thirteenth Amendment. Kollar-Kotelly’s order cites two sources — a scholarly article by law professor Andrew Koppelman, which argues that this amendment “is violated by laws that prohibit abortion;” and a Tenth Circuit opinion that discusses a similar argument — to support the proposition that an abortion ban might qualify as “involuntary servitude.” The argument that the Thirteenth Amendment protects a right to abortion is fairly straightforward. In Bailey v. Alabama (1911), the Supreme Court held that this amendment sought to abolish “that control by which the personal service of one [person] is disposed of or coerced for another’s benefit, which is the essence of involuntary servitude.” As Koppelman writes, “forced pregnancy and childbirth” by its very nature, operates “by compelling the woman to serve the fetus.” Of course, one major problem with this Thirteenth Amendment argument is that Dobbs spoke in categorical terms about the right to an abortion — or, rather, the nonexistence of that right. Dobbs states outright that “the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.” To get around this problem, Kollar-Kotelly rests on a notoriously hard-to-pin-down distinction between a court decision’s “holding” and something known as “dicta.” Briefly, the portions of an opinion that respond to the specific legal question before a court are considered the court’s “holding,” and are binding on lower courts that consider similar cases. By contrast, when a judge launches into a non-sequitur or otherwise opines on issues that are not relevant to the actual legal issue in the case, those portions of the judge’s opinion are considered “dicta” and are not binding. As Kollar-Kotelly writes, quoting from the eminent federal Judge Henry Friendly, “a judge’s power to bind is limited to the issue that is before him; he cannot transmute dictum into decision by waving a wand and uttering the word ‘hold.’” The specific issue that was before the Court in Dobbs, Kollar-Kotelly notes, was whether the Fourteenth Amendment protects a right to an abortion, not whether any other provision does so. “That is why neither the majority nor the dissent in Dobbs analyzed anything but the Fourteenth Amendment,” she writes. Thus, the Court’s broad pronouncement that the Constitution as a whole “does not confer a right to abortion” can plausibly be dismissed as dicta. Realistically, this argument is unlikely to persuade anyone on the Supreme Court who joined the majority opinion in Dobbs. The distinction between holding and dicta is notoriously slippery. And even if five justices were convinced that Dobbs’s broad announcement about the entire constitution is dicta, those justices would still have the formal authority to simply reject the Thirteenth Amendment argument for abortion rights on the merits. Again, unless two Republican appointees on the Supreme Court unexpectedly leave the Court and are replaced by Democrats, the justices are about as likely to rule that the Constitution protects a right to an abortion as they are to move the Supreme Court’s building to Mordor, Asgard, or the Unseelie Court. And, again, in a better world, judges would behave as servants of the law — rather than trying to stretch that law to serve their particular agenda. But here in the actual world, lower courts do not always operate as loyal followers of the Supreme Court’s precedent. They often act as think tanks for new legal ideas that haven’t gained support on the Supreme Court, but that could at some point in the future. The Fifth Circuit more or less operates as a generator and legitimizer of right-wing ideas that are often, but not always, rejected by this Supreme Court. So do several federal trial judges that have become favorites among right-wing advocates seeking to move the law hard to the right. If this Supreme Court didn’t want lower court judges to act like partisan trolls, it could communicate that to those judges by hewing more closely to legal texts and to existing precedents. But, if anything, this Court has actively encouraged judges on the rightward extremes of the federal judiciary to play games with the law. Kollar-Kotelly’s order cannot really be defended as a serious attempt to convince this Supreme Court to change the law. But, at worst, it is simply the center-left equivalent of the kind of judicial entrepreneurship that routinely goes on at the Fifth Circuit. The Supreme Court should not be surprised that, if it refuses to rein in egregious overreach by courts like the Fifth Circuit, Democratic judges will also start behaving like they have a free hand.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/2/7/23589355/supreme-court-abortion-dobbs-jackson-handy-united-states-judge-kollar-kotelly,11808
"The Supreme Court’s new, nightmare abortion cases, explained",Ian Millhiser,2024-01-05T23:10:00+00:00,"The Supreme Court handed down two significant orders on Friday evening. The first announces that the Court will hear a case asking whether former President Donald Trump is disqualified from running for president. The Court’s decision to hear this case was widely expected, and the biggest news in this order is that the Court plans to hear the case on an expedited basis, with oral arguments taking place on February 8. The second order is more surprising and potentially almost as consequential: The Court temporarily blocked a lower court’s decision holding that patients who require an abortion to save their life or prevent catastrophic health consequences are entitled to such an abortion under federal law. In the second order, the Court also agreed to hear a pair of cases asking whether federal law requires hospitals to perform medically necessary abortions. Those two cases are called Moyle v. United States and Idaho v. United States. Both the Moyle and Idaho cases should be slam dunks in favor of abortion rights. A federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals that receive Medicare funds — which is nearly all hospitals because Medicare pays for health care for the elderly — to provide “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” of “any individual” who arrives at the hospital’s ER with an “emergency medical condition.” (In limited circumstances, the hospital may transfer the patient to a different facility that will provide this stabilizing treatment, but the patient must receive the treatment.) EMTALA does not specifically mention abortions, but the law is written expansively and applies a blanket rule. When a patient arrives at an emergency room with a medical emergency, the hospital must stabilize that patient. That means that, if an abortion is the medically appropriate treatment, the patient must receive an abortion. This rule is triggered, moreover, not only when a patient has a life-threatening condition, but also when a patient has a condition that places their health “in serious jeopardy,” that threatens “serious impairment to bodily functions,” or “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.” So a patient must be offered abortion care if an abortion will save their life, but also if they need an abortion to prevent serious damage to their uterus or some other serious medical complication. The Court’s decision to hear the Idaho and Moyle cases is not particularly surprising because the far-right United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently handed down a decision holding that EMTALA does not apply to abortions at all. That decision is riddled with errors; among other things, the Fifth Circuit didn’t even have the lawful authority to decide this case. But the Supreme Court often takes up legal questions that split lower courts, and the Fifth Circuit’s decision means that lower courts are divided on whether EMTALA means what it says. Still, the Court’s decision to also suspend a lower court’s order holding that EMTALA does mean what it says and that it preempts an Idaho law that prohibits all abortions except when “necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman” is quite unexpected. The Court sat on these two cases for more than a month before blocking the lower court’s decision. And, again, the EMTALA statute is crystal clear that patients experiencing a medical emergency must receive “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” — nothing in EMTALA suggests that this rule does not apply if the appropriate treatment is an abortion. But this is the same Court that overruled Roe v. Wade, and five of the Court’s Republican appointees have shown an extraordinary willingness to bend the law to benefit anti-abortion litigants — even ruling that the state of Texas may immunize itself from federal litigation challenging its anti-abortion laws by using bounty hunters to enforce those laws. So, while the Court’s order in the Idaho and Moyle cases isn’t a sure sign that these cases will end disastrously for women who will die if they don’t receive an abortion, it is still a terrible sign of what the future may bring for these patients. And, if nothing else, the Court’s decision to suspend the lower court’s decision holding that EMTALA applies to hospitals in Idaho endangers pregnant patients in that state — at least until the Court issues its final decision in these cases.",https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/1/5/24027273/supreme-court-trump-abortion-emtala-idaho-emergency,11808
It’s not just about abortion,Dylan Scott,2022-06-26T13:00:00+00:00,"The end of Roe v. Wade will not only jeopardize access to abortion in many states, it could have wide-ranging and unpredictable consequences for medical care, including fertility treatment, contraception, and cancer care. This post-Roe world will be, in many ways, a new era for medical care in the United States, one that could transform medical services for conditions that range far beyond pregnancy, either by making them illegal or by putting their legality in question. The consequences are unpredictable. Michelle Banker, director of reproductive rights and health litigation at the National Women’s Law Center, told me in an interview before Friday’s decision that the effect on other types of health care will depend upon the answers to “open and untested questions” in US courts. Some of it will rest on how judges will interpret new state abortion bans. States could also be emboldened by the Supreme Court’s ruling to pass new legislation that restricts other medical services. History would suggest places that outlaw abortion tend to have less access to other reproductive care as well. In Ireland, which only recently legalized abortion, there is still less access to in vitro fertilization and certain contraceptives than in the rest of Europe, even after abortion became legal. In the US, a health system that is already fractured will become even more so, limiting access to medical care particularly for marginalized patients. Whether you can get certain health care services may be predicated on where you live (or whether you can afford to travel). “The breadth of the potential health care consequences is so broad,” Banker said. “The first place to start is this is going to result in the death of pregnant people.” The United States has the highest maternal mortality rates among wealthy nations; Black Americans have a significantly higher mortality rate than anywhere else in the developed world. The risk of death from carrying a pregnancy to term is much higher than the risk of death from undergoing an abortion. One estimate puts the number of forced birth in the first year after Roe is overturned at 75,000; the maternal mortality rate in the US is about 1 in 10,000. The impact the end of Roe could have on pregnancy care could reach much further. As the Atlantic’s Sarah Zhang wrote, pregnant women undergo genetic and other tests throughout their pregnancy, meant to assess the health of the fetus and identify any anomalies that could be fatal or life-altering. In some cases, parents who learn about these anomalies choose abortion. But that may no longer be so simple if abortion is now outlawed or severely limited. Decisions about whether to get genetic testing and when could be affected. By the same token, most abortion bans would carve out exceptions if the health of the mother were in jeopardy. But whether a complication represents a life-threatening risk to the mother’s health is in part a judgment call on the part of her doctor — and the possibility of legal consequences could make the cost of mistakes much higher. “At the very least, there may well be a chilling effect due to providers’ and patients’ uncertainty as to whether treatment could expose them to civil or criminal liability,” Banker said. Fetal personhood laws that convey constitutional protections to unborn fetuses would further limit a pregnant person’s choices in medical care. Several states have attempted to pass such a law, but they have thus far been held up by the courts. This new post-Roe jurisprudence could embolden those states and others to put such measures into place. Law enforcement or private citizens, depending on the state law, could bring complaints. The recently signed Texas law, for example, deputizes private citizens by creating a financial incentive for them to take civil action against people who seek or provide abortions. Or, in a less extreme example, what happens if a pregnant person is also receiving cancer treatment or taking mental health medication that could affect the health of their fetus? If they stop receiving that medical care, their health could be in danger. But if they continue to receive it, the fetus could be affected. What are they and their doctor supposed to do? “The laws that criminalize abortion are going to impact medical decision-making, and that’s terrifying,” Banker said. Supporters of abortion rights fear that, unchained by the Supreme Court, states could push deeper and deeper into the lives of pregnant women and the decisions they make about how to conduct themselves. People have been arrested for substance use during pregnancy, based on reasoning that they are harming the growth of the pregnancy. Tennessee passed the first law permitting the prosecution of pregnant women who use drugs. That alone is objectionable to people who oppose a criminalized approach to substance use. But they also worry that such laws are just the tip of the iceberg in a post-Roe reality. Could a pregnant woman be charged with a crime if she drinks a glass of wine? Or if she goes on a hiking trip that a complainant thinks would imperil the health of her fetus? These questions will be answered by the specifics of state laws and the discretion of prosecutors in different places. But they are questions that were unfathomable just a few months ago. “How far down this path could states go?” said Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state policy at the Guttmacher Institute, in an interview before Friday’s Supreme Court ruling. “That might sound a bit far-fetched to people but we have seen states take drastic actions in relation for some pregnant people.” Beyond medical care during pregnancy, the end of Roe could usher in a wave of new restrictions on access to contraception and fertility treatment. The right to contraception is currently upheld by two previous Supreme Court decisions: Griswold v. Connecticut enshrined the right for married people and Eisenstadt v. Baird did the same for unmarried people. But the current Court is clearly not bound by those precedents if they are willing to overturn Roe v. Wade. And some prominent Republicans, such as Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), have referred to those prior court decisions as constitutionally unsound in the days since the Alito draft leaked. “That puts case law in jeopardy because it relies on this idea that rights not specifically named in the Constitution are only entitled to special protection if they are deeply rooted in the nation’s traditions,” Banker said. Other experts I spoke to agreed. “The stage is very much set for state legislators to ban contraception if they want to,” Sean Tipton, who works on policy issues at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, told me before the Supreme Court ruled. Would state legislators want to ban condoms or even birth control pills? Maybe not. But new laws or even state abortion bans could target other kinds of birth control. Many of these states want to define the beginning of life as early as possible in the biological process. Oklahoma, for one, passed a law that recognized an unborn child’s life as beginning at fertilization. Other states describe the moment of conception. But, as Tipton pointed out, the early stages of pregnancy are, medically speaking, a process. There is not a single moment of conception. But if states define life in such a way, then contraceptives that could prevent a fertilized egg from becoming implanted could be under threat. IUDs and the morning-after pill would be threatened under such a legal regime. In the vast majority of cases, IUDs work by preventing fertilization: the sperm and the egg never meet in the first place. But they also might prevent implantation under certain circumstances. There is also some controversy about whether Plan B, the morning-after pill, prevents fertilization in the first place or whether it blocks the implantation of a fertilized egg. The latter could arguably be illegal in states that recognize life at fertilization. Lawmakers in Idaho, for example, announced hearings on whether to ban emergency contraceptives and possibly IUDs before the Supreme Court had even issued its final ruling. Then there are fertility treatments — particularly in vitro fertilization — that depend on fostering a larger number of eggs but typically only use a small number of them. If an embryo is conferred the same rights as a toddler, are those procedures suddenly illegal? As Tipton put it to me, what if a doctor puts 199 embryos in a freezer for IVF treatment, and 198 of them come out of the freezer okay? “Does that mean a homicide has been committed?” he said. Experts imagine other possible restrictions on procedures like IVF, particularly in states that define life as beginning at conception or fertilization. That alone could put IVF in legal jeopardy. States could also institute new restrictions on those procedures, now that the right to privacy has been redefined. Maybe the number of embryos could be limited. Maybe state legislators restrict which people are allowed to avail themselves of those services — to only straight married couples, for example. And while there is a tension between ostensibly “pro-life” politicians restricting access to fertility care, there is an expectation that anti-abortion advocates would be willing to let these medical services be collateral damage in order to achieve the goal of outlawing abortion. “Most right-to-life proponents are not interested in doing anything to hurt fertility patients,” Tipton said. “But they’re very willing to throw those patients under the bus to end abortion.” The new jurisprudence could also affect access to health care that has nothing to do with pregnancy or reproduction, experts say. Medical care for people undergoing a gender transition would be one possible casualty. “The decision in particular puts gender-affirming care in its crosshairs,” Banker said. In the opinion, Alito cited a 1974 decision, Geduldig v. Aiello, that takes what Banker calls “a very narrow and cramped view” of what constitutes sex discrimination. For Alito’s purposes, that narrow view of sex discrimination supports the argument that banning abortion would not constitute discrimination against pregnant people on the basis of sex. But Banker says the same logic could be applied to gender-affirming health care such as surgery or hormonal treatments. If the Supreme Court’s definition of sex discrimination is now much narrower than it used to be, then opponents of those services could argue that denying a person gender-affirming medical care is not actually discriminatory. “Those arguments are easily refuted under modern precedent,” Banker told me. “But the draft’s language and citation to Geduldig raises concerns that we may see those arguments gain more traction.” Old battles over medical research or treatment could also resurface, Tipton said. Modern science has developed treatments for spinal cord injuries, myelofibrosis, and even certain cancers by relying on stem cells. More treatments are in clinical trials right now. But their prospects could be compromised if access to those materials is limited. Some stem cells are collected from adult body tissue, but others come from embryos. Much of this will depend on how aggressive anti-abortion advocates decide to be, and on the success of abortion rights advocates in mounting a political and legal response to a ruling overturning Roe. But it will undoubtedly be a new era for health care in the United States, with potentially devastating consequences for patients with a wide array of medical needs.",https://www.vox.com/23137822/abortion-birth-control-health-care-roe-wade,11808
How abortion became a partisan issue in America,Anna North,2019-04-10T11:30:00+00:00,"Joe Biden called it “the single most difficult vote I’ve cast as a U.S. senator.” In 1982, he voted for a constitutional amendment that would have let states overturn Roe v. Wade, as Lisa Lerer noted in the New York Times. A practicing Catholic, he said at the time, “I’m probably a victim, or a product, however you want to phrase it, of my background.” This vote is one of many things, including accusations of inappropriate touching, that could hurt Biden’s chances if he seeks the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. Though he’s currently leading the polls for the nomination, Biden’s record on abortion could be a problem for Democratic voters, a large majority of whom support abortion rights. But four decades ago, when Biden was a young senator from Delaware, it was far less unusual for a Democrat to support restrictions on abortion, just as it was not unusual to see Republicans voting for abortion rights. The story of the abortion debate since the 1970s is one of party leaders moving farther and farther apart on the issue. The reasons, scholars and activists say, are a combination of grassroots activism and establishment political strategy. The results are a landscape that would be unrecognizable to many voters in 1982 — or even five years ago. Today,banning abortion entirely could be on the table, as more and more states pass “heartbeat” bills and more than a dozen potential challenges to Roe work their way up to the Supreme Court. On the other side, at least one Democratic candidate is calling for the legalization of federal funding for abortion, a position that seemed like a political third rail even six years ago. The story of how we got here is a reminder that a debate whose different sides can seem deeply entrenched has actually changed enormously over a short period of time — and understanding how is crucial to understanding the election landscape in 2020 and beyond. In the 1970s, politicians’ views on abortion didn’t break down along neat party lines. While Republican President Gerald Ford opposed Roe v. Wade, first lady Betty Ford was an abortion-rights supporter and Ford’s vice president Nelson Rockefeller presided over the repeal of abortion restrictions in New York, as Linda Greenhouse and Reva B. Siegel explained in their book Before Roe v. Wade. In Congress, Republicans voted against abortion at about the same rate as Democrats. That didn’t start to change until the ’70s. During his 1972 presidential campaign, Republican Richard Nixon began staking out anti-abortion positions as part of a strategy to appeal to Catholic voters and other social conservatives. After Nixon won the election and a majority of Catholic votes, Republican strategists began using the same tactics in Congress, as well as forging coalitions with evangelical groups around opposition to abortion. The shift to opposing abortion rights was part of a larger effort to paint the Republican Party as pro-family in a way that would help mobilize socially conservative voters, according to Greenhouse and Siegel. Others argue that grassroots organizing by abortion opponents played a role. When abortion restrictions were struck down by the courts in the years after Roe, it “helped to galvanize pro-lifers,” said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, which describes itself as “the nation’s oldest and largest pro-life organization.” “I don’t know if there was any one issue” that caused the parties to move apart on abortion, Tobias said. “It was just a general acceptance that we have to make a difference in the elections” rather than focusing solely on changing Americans’ minds through outreach on the issue. Whatever the case, move apart they did. The career of Ronald Reagan illustrates the shift: As governor of California in 1967, Greenhouse and Siegel noted, he signed a law loosening abortion restrictions, but his 1980 presidential campaign called for the appointment of anti-abortion judges. For rank-and-file voters, the change appears to have happened later. “Only after 1988 does Gallup consistently show more Democrats than Republicans supporting access to abortion,” Greenhouse and Siegel wrote. Even after the parties began to move apart on the issue, activists on both sides tried to appeal to the center, as Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who studies the history of the abortion debate, wrote recently at the Washington Post. In the 1990s and early 2000s, for instance, many abortion opponents devoted their energy to supporting incremental restrictions, like a ban on dilation and extraction, a technique for abortions later in pregnancy that opponents called “partial-birth abortion.” The restriction, which was eventually passed at the federal level in 2003, is far less sweeping than the “heartbeat” bills many Republican lawmakers favor today, which would ban abortions as early as six weeks. Democrats, meanwhile, could be somewhat equivocal on abortion during this time period, with Bill Clinton during his 1992 campaign famously saying that abortions should be “safe, legal, and rare.” Hillary Clinton used the same language in her 2008 presidential campaign. But more recently, both sides of the abortion debate have come to seek broader change. Among abortion-rights supporters, there’s been an increasing awareness of reproductive justice.The term, coined in 1994, describes an approach focused not just on the legal right to an abortion, but on safe, affordable access to a range of reproductive health care, as well as the ability to parent children safely. The reproductive justice lens puts an emphasis on the affordability of abortion as well as on its legal status. “A right means very little when we can’t afford the health care we need,” Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity (URGE), a reproductive rights group focused on young people, told Vox. Especially in the last five years, reproductive-justice activists have campaigned to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which was first passed in 1976 and bars federal funding for most abortions. Because it restricts Medicaid coverage for abortions, the amendment makes it difficult for many low-income Americans to pay for the procedure. Opponents of Hyde have had some successes — in 2017 and again this year, Democrats in Congress introduced the EACH Woman Act, which would repeal Hyde and allow Medicaid to cover abortions. Meanwhile, Democratic candidates have begun campaigning on repealing Hyde. During her 2016 presidential run, Hillary Clinton called for a repeal of Hyde, and the Democratic Party platform followed suit, something that would have been nearly unthinkable in the years when she and her husband were calling for abortion to be rare. This year, the American Civil Liberties Union is working to get Democrats on the record supporting a repeal of Hyde — 2020 hopeful Pete Buttigieg has already called for a repeal. On Hyde, “what has changed in the last five years is that a community of people led by young people and women of color decided that the status quo was not good enough,” McGuire said. At the same time, abortion-rights advocates have been working to reduce stigma around abortion and to present the procedure as a normal part of medical care. In 2015, in response to efforts to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood, activists and ordinary people shared stories of their abortions under the hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion, and campaigns like We Testify and 1 in 3 encourage people to tell the stories of their abortions. “We talk about it as abortion positive,” McGuire said of URGE’s approach to the issue. “For us that means, not only do we think abortion should be legal, but we think it’s a really good thing when people can get abortion care who need it.” In the midst of these drives for greater public acceptance of abortion, Donald Trump became president. Trump promised during his campaign to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, and he appears to have made good on that promise — Justices Neal Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh are seen by advocates on both sides of the issue as potential votes to gut the landmark abortion decision. After Trump’s inauguration, Republican state legislators began passing increasingly restrictive abortion laws, banning abortion after 15 weeks or even earlier. In many cases, the architects of these laws believed such restrictionswould stand a better chance in court than in years past, thanks to a federal bench populated with Trump appointees, both at the Supreme Court and at lower levels. Mississippi, Kentucky, and Georgia lawmakers, for example, have all passed “heartbeat” bills that would ban abortions as early as six weeks, before many women even know they’re pregnant. To some degree, such laws, which most legal experts agree are unconstitutional under Roe, may be efforts to get the Supreme Court to revisit the decision. Trump’s tactics as president may also have had an influence. “Some read his rise as proof that stoking passions among a narrow base is a smarter political play than trying to build a broader, but less inspired, coalition,” Ziegler writes. And some politicians “seem convinced that the voters most passionate about abortion will reward them for being purists rather than pragmatists.” The increasingly restrictive laws on the anti-abortion side have been matched, especially in recent months, by efforts by abortion-rights supporters to liberalize state abortion laws. To some extent, these laws are meant to prepare for a potential post-Roe future — if federal protections on the right to an abortion disappear, abortion-rights supporters want to make sure states protect access. But activists and lawmakers are also responding to Democratic wins at the state level in 2018. A recent law loosening abortion restrictions in New York, for instance, became possible when Democrats took the state Senate for the first time in years. The overall result is a landscapewhere, in the run-up to the 2020 elections, Republicans are pushing more restrictive laws than ever while Democrats are backing expansions of access in ways that were hard to imagine just a decade ago. In that climate, someone like Biden, a Democrat who supported abortion restrictions in 1982 and has not been specific about which ones he supports now, is something of an outlier. Biden has been on the national scene longer than any of the other major Democratic hopefuls, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and on abortion rights, he may carry some of the politics of an earlier era into the 2020 campaign. Whether Biden’s history on abortion will hurt him if he chooses to enter the race remains to be seen. Overall, 58 percent of Americans believe the procedure should be legal in all or most cases, according to a 2018 Pew poll. Opinions are sharply divided by party: 36 percent of Republicans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 76 percent of Democrats. Among voters from each party, there’s also a lot of room for nuance. In a focus group of male Trump voters that Vox convened in 2017 with the research firm PerryUndem, several expressed frustration with state abortion restrictions. Meanwhile, Tobias of the National Right to Life Committee said she’s spoken with many longtime Democrats who told her they couldn’t vote for Clinton in 2016 because of her position on abortion. Still, there’s evidence that for many Democrats, abortion has become a crucial voting issue. According to a PerryUndem poll conducted in December 2017, Democratic voters care more about candidates’ abortion views than Republicans do — 71 percent of Democrats said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who supported abortion rights, while just 36 percent of Republicans said they were more likely to vote for someone who opposed abortion. And since that poll was conducted, the stakes of the abortion debate have only gotten higher, with Kavanaugh appointed to the Supreme Court and heartbeat bills proliferating in the states. Biden seems to be styling himself as a centrist choice for Americans nostalgic for an earlier time in Democratic politics. But on abortion, a lot has changed since 1982 — and even since Biden was first elected Vice President in 2008. As Americans look forward, some with fear and some with hope, to a possible future without Roe, it’s not clear how interested they are in looking back.",https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18295513/abortion-2020-roe-joe-biden-democrats-republicans,11808
Artificial wombs are coming. They could completely change the debate over abortion.,I. Glenn Cohen,2017-08-23T12:40:02+00:00,"There’s a scientific development on the horizon that could upend the abortion debate: artificial wombs. The research remains preliminary, but in April a group of scientists at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia announced amazing advances in artificial womb technologies. The authors explained how they had successfully sustained significantly premature lambs for four weeks in an artificial womb they had designed. This enabled the lambs to develop in a way very similar to lambs that had developed in their mothers’ wombs. Indeed, the oldest lamb — more than a year old at the time the paper was published — appeared to be completely normal. The technology included placing the premature lambs in a “biobag” containing a bath of simulated amniotic fluid, regularly replenished, with an oxygenator circuit connected to the lamb via the umbilical cord. The lambs were at a stage of development comparable to that of a 22- to 24-week-old human fetus. Babies born at that stage of gestation have very high mortality rates —roughly 70 percent at 22 weeks — and almost all who survive have long-term health problems. The immediate hope is that artificial wombs could raise the survival rate of human fetuses and improve their lifelong health substantially. The Supreme Court’s decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey treats “viability” — when a fetus can survive outside the womb — as the important constitutional dividing line for individual states’ ability to restrict abortion. US states have much more power to restrict abortion after viability than before (although even post-viability there are important constitutional carve-outs, including for abortions to protect the health of the mother). If — and it is a big “if” — artificial wombs were to become available for human fetuses, we face the following question: Could anti-abortion laws require pregnant women whose fetuses are not yet viable to transfer the fetus to a nurturing site outside the body, possibly by way of minimally invasive surgery? The right to abortion would thereby be restricted. Let me be very clear: The technology is not ready for human use, which means major changes in abortion policy are not imminent. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t begin to wrestle with the implications of such foreseeable medical advances. (And of course, whatever you think of abortion, we should celebrate this kind of research for the benefit it can offer to the families of premature infants.) Why is this technology relevant to abortion? The reason is that — as I have argued elsewhere — the constitutional right to abortion in America actually amounts to a conjunction of three separate but overlapping “rights not to procreate.” First, there is a right not to be a gestational parent: That is, a woman has the right to stop gestating, or carrying a fetus to term. Second, there is a right not to be a legal parent: The law cannot force on a woman, against her wishes, the legal duties of parenthood. Finally, the right to have an abortion implies a right not to be a genetic parent — for there to be no child that comes into being that is her genetic offspring. Typically, when a woman has an abortion, she is able to prevent all three kinds of parentage: She stops gestating the child, there is no child that bears her genetic code that comes into existence, and (therefore) there is no child the law recognizes as her child. In some cases, however, the rights come apart. Take gestational surrogacy. In one version of such a case, a father who intends to raise a child provides his sperm and a mother who intends to raise the child provides her egg. The egg is then fertilized outside the body (in vitro) and then implanted in another woman. That second woman is the gestational surrogate, carrying the child to term, even though she is not the genetic mother. Suppose the surrogate decides she wants to have an abortion. She would be exercising her right not to be a gestational parent. But that abortion would not represent an exercise of her right not to be a genetic mother; after all, whether the child is born or not, it is not her genetic child. Additionally, according to the law in many states where surrogacy is practiced — California, for example — if the child were born, the gestational surrogate would not be the legal mother either. So her abortion would not be an exercise of a right not to be a legal parent either. Fair enough, you might say: The three rights are unbundled in the unusual case of gestational surrogacy, but what does that have to do with most pregnant women in America? This is where the artificial womb comes in. Imagine, as proposed above, that a fetus could be moved from the mother’s womb to an artificial womb through a minimally invasive surgery beginning at 18 weeks of gestation. Now imagine a US state were to pass a law decreeing that although abortion is available up to that 18-week threshold, once transfer to an artificial womb is possible, a woman who wants to stop gestating cannot abort. She can either continue her pregnancy or transfer the fetus to the artificial womb. This would effectively preserve her right not to be a gestational parent — as she can stop gestating by transfer to the artificial womb — but not her right not to be a genetic parent. That’s because a child would come into being with her genetic code that she does not want to exist. (It is unclear whether she would also be considered the legal parent in such a case, so let’s put that to one side.) For those who support abortion rights in America, this scenario raises a crucial question: Do they support the right of women to control only whether they gestate or, additionally, a right to terminate a fetus whether or not gestation is involved? Certainly, the rhetoric of abortion rights in America focuses on avoiding unwanted gestation — think of the slogan “my body, my choice.” Artificial wombs may lead to a revisiting of the argument posed in one of the most famous articles ever written about abortion, “A Defense of Abortion,” by Judith Jarvis Thomson, first published in 1971. Thomson’s article, which features one of the most famous thought experiments in bioethics, is similarly focused on the right not to gestate. Thomson seeks to argue that even if a fetus is a person, women should still have the right to abort. Let me (all too briefly) recap the case she makes: Thomson asks us to imagine that one morning you wake to find you’ve been kidnapped and hooked up to an unconscious famous violinist. (Whether you are male or female is irrelevant.) The violinist is dying from a rare kidney disease, but he will survive if you allow him to use you as a human dialysis machine for nine months. Should you unhook yourself, the violinist will die. The violinist is not at fault for your predicament. The kidnapping and dialysis coupling was instead the work of the Society of Music Lovers, who are devoted to the man’s music and to saving his life. Thomson concludes that it is intuitively obvious that one has a right to disconnect oneself from the violinist in this situation, that the violinist’s need for your help, however pressing, does not create an obligation upon you to sustain him. While it would not be immoral for you to disconnect, you also may stay connected. But that would be a “supererogatory” moral act (above and beyond one’s moral obligation). If you agree with Thomson on the case of the violinist, she concludes, you must also agree that a woman has a right to be free of a fetus, even if you believe the fetus to be, like the violinist, a “person,” with all the rights that word entails. (Thomson did not in fact assert that an early fetus has such rights; she was granting one premise of her pro-life opponents’ argument.) As Thomson herself puts it: I am not arguing that people do not have a right to life. … I am arguing only that a right to life does not guarantee having either a right to be given the use of or a right to be allowed continued use of another person’s body — even if one needs it for life itself. So the right to life will not serve the opponents of abortion in the very simple and clear way in which they seem to have thought it would. Thomson’s approach is not without its critics. Some commentators have suggested the thought experiment works as an analogy to abortion following a rape but does not fit every abortion. But my purpose here is not to delve into these objections. Instead, I want to emphasize how Thomson’s influential argument, as she herself recognizes, is an argument only for a right to disconnect: It’s the right to not gestate, not a right to terminate the fetus. To put the point in terms of Thomson’s hypothetical: If you find yourself hooked up the violinist, the state should protect your right to disconnect the violinist and attach him to an actual dialysis machine, but that does not imply you have the right to disconnect him and kill him. In a world of artificial wombs — the world that may be opening up as a result of the recent research on premature lambs — a woman might have a right to stop gestating (to transfer the fetus out of the body to an artificial womb) but not a right to terminate the fetus as well. Distinguishing between ceasing gestation and terminating a fetus could have some important implications for paternal rights. Both typical pro-choice arguments and, indeed, even a decision of the US Supreme Court have rejected the idea of a paternal veto on abortion. In Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, the Court put it this way: “[A]s it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor.” But if it became possible to transfer the fetus to an artificial womb, a man opposed to his wife’s (or other sex partner’s) abortion might be able to make a case along the following lines: “No one is forcing you to gestate the fetus, and after we transfer the fetus to an artificial womb, you and I are on equal footing. At that point, the disagreement is: I want to be a genetic parent; you do not. Given this tie, the state should favor life.” How might one resist this argument? Earlier, I asked you to imagine that transfer to an artificial womb happened via a “minimally invasive surgery”: something on the order of laparoscopic surgery to remove a small tumor. If the surgery were more invasive, as seems plausible, one might think it was just as much a violation of a woman’s right to control her body as forcing her to continue gestation. And perhaps one might think even a minimally invasive surgery is morally problematic, given the rights we enjoy in most circumstances to reject forced medical treatment of almost any sort. But what if, to really get sci-fi, the transfer worked like the transporter in Star Trek? A tingle and then it’s gone. Would the arguments against mandated use of the artificial womb still hold water? Confronted with the argument that transfer to an artificial womb could be made mandatory, a different strategy might be to stand up and defend abortion as a right not to be a genetic parent — full stop. The asserted right, in other words, would extend further than the right not to be a gestational parent and include a right to terminate the fetus. In Roe v. Wade itself, the Supreme Court speaks about the burden of motherhood — not merely the burdens of gestating — as underlying the abortion right: Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. The references to the burdens of caring for a child who is already born, and the psychological distress for a family of an unwanted child go beyond a mere focus on the burdens of carrying the child. It is subsequent cases and the modern abortion rhetoric that have focused more on the physical burdens of gestation. The advent of artificial wombs may press those defending a woman’s right to abortion to return to these earlier themes. But such arguments are more complicated and fraught. As we have seen, they put mothers and fathers on much more of an equal plane when it comes to abortion, and men might well argue that non-gestational burdens fall on both sexes. The questions raised by artificial wombs also reopen the question of whether the right to abortion at all hinges on the availability of adoption. Once we go beyond the burdens of gestation as the justification for abortion and instead turn to the psychological, financial, and social burdens of unwanted parenthood, the potential of adoption to reduce — but not completely eliminate — some of those burdens may become relevant. It seems an unalloyed good that prematurely born fetuses may eventually have a greatly improved chance to live and thrive. But welcome new advances also sometimes raise new questions. Here, these laudable medical advances also reopen a host of complicated questions about one of the most hotly contested issues in politics, law, and ethics. I.

Abortion was on the ballot in Kansas. Access won.,Nicole Narea,2022-08-03T16:44:21+00:00,"Kansans voted decisivelyagainst a ballot measure on Tuesday that would have allowed state lawmakers to further restrict abortion access in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which could have severely limited abortion access in the region. The measure, known as the “Value Them Both Amendment,” was defeated 59 to 41 percent (as of Wednesday morning).The campaign director of Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the pro-abortion rights group that worked to sink the amendment, hailed their victory as “truly an historic day for Kansas and an historic day for America.” Value Them Both, the group that backed the amendment, promised to ensure their loss is just “a temporary setback.” Before the vote, it was unclear what would happen. Past polls showed Kansas to be evenly divided between those who support abortion access and those against it, and polling conducted ahead of the election suggested that voters were closely divided over the measure. But the final result wasn’t particularly close, and appears to represent the will of a broad swath of Kansas voters. Turnout was supercharged. Votes are still being counted as of Wednesday morning, but roughly 47 percent of eligible voters — more than 900,000 Kansans — cast ballots on the issue.That’s nearly double the participation seen in the last midterms in 2018,and 11 percentage points higher than the secretary of state predicted. As the first state to vote on abortion since the Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturned Roe, Kansas was closely watched. The measure was on the ballot before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. But the Dobbs decision supercharged interest in the amendment: volunteers for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom increased tenfold, from 50 to 500 volunteers per week. Volunteers ultimately knocked on more than 25,000 doors in June, said Ashley All, spokesperson for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom. “Quite frankly it was a wake-up call for a lot of Kansans, including probably more moderate voters who thought their constitutional rights were protected at the federal level,” All told Vox in July. Analysts are already hypothesizing about what the amendment’s loss means for abortion in America, what lessons Republicans should learn, and whether the high turnout means Democrats should be hopeful about the fall. But it’s difficult to make broad declarations based on the results of one race. On Election Day, abortion measures in California, Vermont, Montana, and Kentucky (and likely Michigan as well)will give more data on what Americans want. And it’s important to remember that abortion won’t directly be on most ballots in the fall; voters will instead largely be weighing in on candidates with a range of stances on a variety of issues. Still, it’s notable that a red state struck down a pathway to greater abortion restrictions so forcefully, and that so many voters who usually don’t vote in midterm primaries showed up this time. People in Kansas will now continue to have access to abortion services up to to 22 weeks of pregnancy with some restrictions, including mandatory ultrasounds and counseling, and parental consent in cases involving minors. And those who live in more restricted neighboring states will continue to be able to travel to Kansas for certain abortion procedures. The Value Them Both Amendment would have amended the state constitution to explicitly state that “there is no Kansas constitutional right to abortion or to require the government funding of abortion.” Kansas already restricts the use of public funds for abortions to cases where federal law requires it, including those involving rape and incest, and where the life of the pregnant person is at risk. The amendment also would have codified the state legislature’s power to pass laws that regulate abortion, effectively overriding a 2019 Kansas Supreme Court ruling that recognized a “woman’s right to make decisions about her body, including the decision whether to continue her pregnancy” under the state constitution. That court ruling’s made abortion possible in Kansas, and is what allows it to be a resource to its neighbors. The state of Kansas found that 49 percent of abortion procedures, a total of 3,912, performed in the state were done for people from other states in 2021. That number is expected to grow given that so many of Kansas’s neighbors, including Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, have banned the procedure or soon will. A number of Kansas providers have reported an uptick in out-of-state patients; a provider in Wichita, for example, told the Washington Post their practice has seen a 60 percent increase in patients from outside Kansas over the past year. While the amendment’s defeat is politically notable, it’s patients and their families who will benefit most from Tuesday’s vote. Vox politics reporter Nicole Narea is here to help you unpack the fractured American political system and how it affects your life. Submit your question here. The stakes of the vote were fairly clear: to continue allowing abortion, or to give the GOP-dominated legislature a green light to restrict it. Republican lawmakers introduced a bill in the previous session of the state legislature that would ban abortion. House Bill 2746 would have made it a felony to perform an abortion from the moment of fertilization, with exceptions for cases involving an ectopic pregnancy. The measure struggled to gain traction, and it’s unlikely to do so going forward now that Kansas voters have decisively voted down the ballot initiative. Now that voters have essentially opted to maintain the status quo in Kansas, the subject of abortion might not take up as much oxygen in statewide races where it had become a major flashpoint, including the governor’s race. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly opposed the ballot measure, and has said that “every woman’s reproductive decisions should be left to her, her family, and her physician,” opposing any legislation that would interfere with those decisions. The Republican nominee for governor, state Attorney General Derek Schmidt, supported the amendment and said that he would “prefer a future with less abortion, not more.” He did, however, issue a legal opinion in July that clarified that treating miscarriages, removing dead fetuses, and ending ectopic pregnancies would not be considered abortions under Kansas law.

Living in an abortion ban state is bad for mental health,"Keren Landman, MD",2024-02-20T12:30:00+00:00,"The false idea that getting an abortion makes women irreparably depressed and anxious, that it causes a deep psychic wound, has for decades been used by anti-abortion activists to support abortion restrictions. But the argument is entirely based on anecdotes, personal beliefs, and vibes. No good science has demonstrated this link. That’s not because nobody’s tried to answer the question of what the mental health impacts of abortion are on the women who obtain them. It’s because the answer to that question, over and over again, is: none. In study after study, researchers have consistently shown that getting an abortion does not cause mental health problems. What doesreliably worsen women’s mental health, however, is banning or restricting abortion access. A wealth of research has shown that when people are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies, it negatively impacts their physical health and finances — and mental health. In a survey conducted before the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, women living in states with more abortion restrictions had higher rates of mental distress. In another study, states enforcing abortion restrictions between 1974 and 2016 had higher suicide rates in women of childbearing age in particular. But when the court decided to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, it wasn’t making a decision grounded in science. Now we’re more than a year and a half into living with the consequences. And when it comes to women’s mental health, the fallout is following the exact pattern scientists predicted. In a study published last month, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that people living in states that banned abortion in the immediate wake of the Court’s decision have worse symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who live in states without bans. Using data gathered as part of US Census Household Pulse surveys, the researchers looked at respondents’ self-reported anxiety and depression scores from about six months before and six months after the Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. They compared scores on a scale of zero to 12 among people in states with and without trigger bans, abortion restrictions that went into effect as soon as the Supreme Court issued its ruling. What they found was, frankly, predictable: Before the Court’s decision, anxiety and depression scores were already higher in trigger states — a population-wide average of 3.5 compared with 3.3 in non-trigger states. After the decision, that difference widened significantly, largely due to changes in the mental health of women 18 to 45, what the authors defined as childbearing age. Among this subgroup, anxiety and depression scores subtly ticked up in those living in trigger states (from 4.62 to 4.76) — and dropped in those living in non-trigger states (from 4.57 to 4.49). There was no similar effect in older women, nor in men. These differences were small but statistically meaningful, especially since they sampled the entire population, not just women considering an abortion. Moreover, they were consistent across trigger states, whether their policies and political battles around abortion had been high- or low-profile. Even when the researchers omitted data from states with particularly severe restrictions on women’s reproductive health (looking at you, Texas), the results held up. It’s notable that the different levels of mental distress across states after Roe was overturned weren’t just a consequence of worsened anxiety and depression in states with trigger bans. Also contributing: an improvement in these symptoms in states without these bans. We can’t tell from the study exactly why that is, but it seems plausible that women living in states that protect their right to access necessary health care simply feel some relief. In bird’s-eye-view studies like this, it can be hard to pick apart the nuances behind a finding. For example, it’s possible other social or cultural factors are more likely to disproportionately affect women in trigger states — like variability in gender equity, interpartner violence, abortion stigma, and mental health care access. Still, it should set off our alarm bells when high-quality research finds a causal relationship between big societal shifts and worsening depression and anxiety on a population-wide level. People who sense limitations to their personal freedom and autonomy feel a sense of “violation and powerlessness,” says Benjamin Thornburg, a health economics PhD student who led the study. It stands to reason that the opposite of that, a sense of freedom and autonomy, would improve people’s overall mental health. Anxiety and depression rates are reaching record highs and are especially pronounced among young adults, and suicide deaths are ticking up. At the same time, Americans are living in an age of broadly unmet mental health care needs: 160 million Americans live in areas with provider shortages and insurance denials, and only one-third of people diagnosed with a behavioral health condition get the care they need. Policymakers need to understand “there could be an increase in the need for mental health services in states where these bans have happened,” says Thornburg. But it’s not at all clear they do.

Abortion medication in America: News and updates,Vox Staff,2023-12-13T15:52:14+00:00,,https://www.vox.com/2023/4/10/23677220/texas-abortion-pills-usa-updates-mifepristone-misoprostol-kacsmaryk,11808
A 10-year-old Ohio rape victim got an abortion. Now her doctor is being punished.,Nicole Narea,2023-05-26T18:00:00+00:00,"The case of a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim who sought an abortion in Indiana just after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year became a major flashpoint in the political debate. On Thursday, her doctor was reprimanded and fined for discussing the case — and physicians worry that it will have a chilling effect on any kind of patient advocacy that conflicts with the political agenda of state lawmakers. The Indiana medical board found that Caitlin Bernard, an OB-GYN, violated patient privacy laws in publicly disclosing that she had performed the abortion without the consent of the patient or their parents, even though she never named the patient and only provided a general outline of the case, as doctors typically do when performing health advocacy. She will be fined $3,000 and issued a letter of reprimand, but will be allowed to keep her medical license. It’s the result of Indiana Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita, who is running for reelection in 2024, filing a complaint against Bernard last year, also claiming that she was unfit to practice because she had not stayed “abreast of current professional theory or practice.”Bernard’s lawyer previously characterized the complaint as an attempt to intimidate abortion providers. The fact that Bernard is facing professional consequences suggests that there is a legal gray area when talking about patients in an advocacy context, even beyond the subject of abortion, that is ripe for exploitation by political actors. Dr. Tracey Wilkinson, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine who attended Bernard’s hearing before the medical board Thursday, told Vox there was a long debate as to whether Bernard had disclosed identifiable information about the patient and witnesses who argued to the contrary. She said her colleagues around the country were “shocked and devastated” by the ultimate decision, which showed that “politicization can really prevent us from being able to do our job.” “All of us have an ethical duty to do advocacy,” Wilkinson said. “This got so far because this was about abortion, but we’ve now set the precedent and opened the floodgates to any clinician doing their job and having their medical license put on the line.” The 10-year-old patient sought an abortion from Bernard in Indiana just days after Roe fell last June because she could not obtain one in her home state. Ohio had a trigger ban prohibiting abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before most people know they’re pregnant, and she had been pregnant for six weeks and three days. (That ban has since been put on hold by the courts, but could go into effect again.) The story, initially reported by the Indianapolis Star, went viral. President Joe Biden mentioned the case in remarks at the White House last July: “Ten years old — 10 years old! — raped, six weeks pregnant, already traumatized, was forced to travel to another state.” News outlets, however, questioned whether the case was real, given that the Star had relied on Bernard’s account alone. Right-wing politicians, including South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, called it “#FakeNews.” The story was confirmed when 27-year-old Gerson Fuentes was charged in Franklin County, Ohio, after confessing to raping the girl on at least two occasions. He later pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial will continue in July. Bernard’s case before the medical licensing board was unusual because it became a front in the national political battle over abortion. Rarely if ever does a state’s top prosecutor get involved in medical licensing board hearings, and they generally concern cases where there is a bad patient outcome, which didn’t happen here. “The outcome of the care that Dr. Bernard gave was exactly what she always does, which was compassionate, comprehensive health care,” Wilkinson said. Rather, the case concerned her violations of guidelines of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, which specifically mandates that identifiers such as name, date of birth, and address be protected, but also prohibits the disclosure of any unique identifier. Bernard only disclosed the age of the girl and her state of residence, but her hearing focused on whether that could have been considered identifiable information. Her employer, Indiana University Health, concluded last year that she had not committed a HIPAA violation, but the medical board found the opposite. The decision to punish Bernard has left physicians across the country “afraid of getting in the crosshairs of politicians in their state and feeling that they could be next,” she said. That applies in the context of abortion, but also when it comes to bans on gender-affirming care for trans kids. It’s exacerbating anxieties that physicians were already feeling in terms of navigating the patchwork of laws across the US post-Roe, many of which include very limited exceptions to abortion bans that in practice discourage doctors from administering medically necessary care. And that makes it all the more difficult for doctors to perform their duty to advocate for change beyond the walls of the medical system. “I do a lot of advocacy. And I’m not going to stop as a result of this hearing,” Wilkinson said. “But that’s why this is such a dangerous precedent.”",https://www.vox.com/2023/5/26/23738974/indiana-abortion-doctor-caitlin-bernard-ohio,11808
Anthony Kennedy’s retirement puts abortion rights at risk,Dylan Matthews,2018-06-27T19:20:01+00:00,"Anthony Kennedy, the longest-serving member of the Supreme Court, is retiring. Within minutes of his announcement, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin tweeted this: “Anthony Kennedy is retiring. Abortion will be illegal in twenty states in 18 months. #SCOTUS.” Nothing is guaranteed, of course, but Kennedy has, since at least 2005, been the swing vote on many of the Court’s most ideologically charged decisions — including preserving Roe v. Wade. And Kennedy’s replacement will be much likelier to join a decision overturning Roe v. Wade, giving states the ability to ban abortions as early as the first trimester. This may take years after the replacement’s confirmation; a state would need to pass a law clearly incompatible with the Court’s existing approach to abortion rights and wait for the challenge to reach the Supreme Court before the new justice would have a chance to join a ruling. The anti-abortion movement might choose a more cautious strategy, instead chipping away at Roe with measures that fall short of outright bans. But with Kennedy gone, the votes for an outright reversal of Roe would probably be there. UC Berkeley law dean and constitutional law expert Erwin Chemerinsky wrote in 2016, “There almost certainly will be a majority to overrule Roe v. Wade and allow states to prohibit abortions” once Kennedy (or one of the liberals) leaves the court. It’s certainly possible that Chief Justice John Roberts will decline to join an anti-Roe majority due to precedent and a desire to avoid a massive public backlash, but there are reasons to think it unlikely. Roberts has on three occasions joined decisions overturning past Supreme Court precedent: one was a case on the right to counsel and how it can and cannot be waived; another was Citizens United, which sparked massive national outrage; and the third came just this year with Janus v. AFSCME, in which the Court overturned a 41-year-old precedent and struck a blow against public-sector-unions. Roberts voted to overturn precedent anyway, knowing a backlash was inevitable. Indeed, in his concurrence to Citizens United, Roberts suggested that “hotly contested” issues might provide for exceptions from the principle of stare decisis and respect for precedent. Also possible is that instead of decapitating Roe in one blow, Roberts will instead “vote to kill it with 1,000 cuts rather than overturn it outright,” as UC Irvine Law’s Richard Hasen puts it. Perhaps we’ll see another case like Whole Women’s Health (a 2016 decision where Kennedy joined the Court’s liberals in striking down Texas regulations meant to disrupt abortion provision), but this time the court sides with the state’s restrictions. Perhaps another state takes its 20-week ban to the Supreme Court, which then relaxes Roe and rules that you can bar abortions that early in a pregnancy. Bit by bit, the Court enables states to get more creative and bold in their restrictions, until one day it finally gives up the ghost and announces Roe is dead. In the aftermath of a reversal, the current gap in abortion services between red and blue states will become even more severe. The pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute classifies 29 states as “hostile or extremely hostile” to abortion rights, of which all but two voted for Trump in 2016 (the exceptions are Rhode Island and Virginia). It rated only 12 as supportive, with Montana the only supportive red state. Guttmacher further notes that four states (Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota) have passed laws to automatically ban abortion should Roe be overturned, 10 have retained pre-Roe abortion bans, and eight have laws that “express their intent to restrict the right to legal abortion to the maximum extent permitted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the absence of Roe”; in total, 18 states fall into one or more of those categories. Some states on the list may be surprising; Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin all retain their pre-Roe abortion bans, though in some cases those bans may violate the state constitution. On the other side, only eight states (California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, and Washington) have passed measures defending abortion rights in the absence of Roe. That said, there are already substantial gaps between states in access to abortion. Restrictive laws already on the books appear to significantly lower the abortion rate in their states, suggesting they’re already reducing access. A study by Guttmacher researchers found that while the average American woman aged 15-44 lives less than 11 miles from the nearest clinic, that number varies dramatically from state to state and county to county. In Mississippi, the average woman lives 68.8 miles from the nearest clinic. In North Dakota, the number is 151.6. A lot of the variation is just a function of how rural the state is, but the political environment appears to be a significant factor as well. Overturning Roe would harden these gaps between states, and also open up a vast new market for self-induced abortions. That market already exists. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, an economist and writer who has conducted research on demand for abortion using Google search data, once told Vox, “I’m pretty convinced that the United States has a self-induced abortion crisis right now based on the volume of search inquiries. I was blown away by how frequently people are searching for ways to do abortions themselves now. These searches are concentrated in parts of the country where it’s hard to get an abortion and they rose substantially when it became harder to get an abortion.” But while “self-induced” conjures up images of wirehangers and back alleys, the form this will most likely take is greater usage of abortion pills. About a third of all abortions, and a higher share of early-term abortions, are medication abortions now. It’s possible that’s what some of the searches for “self-induced abortion” were about, anyway. As the journalist Irin Carmon has noted, the drug misoprostol, which is usually paired with mifepristone but is still somewhat effective on its own at terminating early-term pregnancies, is available over the counter in Mexican pharmacies. It’s medically safe enough that some doctors believe it, and mifepristone, should be available over the counter here too. How much do you want to bet that the US market for misoprostol, or misoprostol plus mifepristone — also known as RU-486 — will explode in the aftermath of Roe falling? So that’s what’s likely in store for us. An America after Anthony Kennedy looks significantly different from America before — and the anti-abortion movement could notch its greatest victories in a half-century.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/27/17510896/anthony-kennedy-retirement-abortion-rights-roe-v-wade-john-roberts,11808
The Supreme Court is already considering another threat to abortion rights,Ian Millhiser,2020-09-09T12:10:00+00:00,"Last June, Chief Justice John Roberts provided a brief reprieve to abortion providers — joining his liberal colleagues in striking down a Louisiana anti-abortion law. But that reprieve could be very short-lived: A case now before the justices could give them a vehicle to undercut the right to terminate a pregnancy. If the Trump administration gets its way in Food and Drug Administration v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Supreme Court could force many patients seeking abortions to undergo unnecessary surgeries, despite the fact that those patients could safely terminate their pregnancy with medication — and that’s assuming that these individuals are able to find a doctor to perform the surgery in the first place. The case turns on whether the courts should relax long-standing FDA-imposed restrictions on the drug mifepristone, which is commonly used in medication abortions, in order to make the drug easier to obtain during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the short term, a victory for the Trump administration would leave in place long-standing rules requiring health providers to dispense mifepristone to abortion patients in person. During ordinary times, this restriction imposes a fairly minor burden on such patients. But, as explained below, the same restriction could potentially prevent many pregnant individuals from obtaining an abortion altogether while the pandemic still rages. Any time the Roberts Court hears an abortion case, moreover, the abortion right is at risk — because a majority of the Supreme Court is skeptical of whether that right should exist in the first place. Indeed, if the Court follows the path laid out in the Trump administration’s brief in American College, many abortion patients could lose access to the safest form of abortion. Roberts’s decision to invalidate the Louisiana law in June Medical Services v. Russo(2020) was a somewhat surprising development, as Roberts has fairly consistently opposed abortion rights during his career on the bench. But June Medical was also a very narrow victory for abortion advocates. The chief justice’s opinion turned on the fact that the Louisiana law at issue in June Medical was nearly identical to a Texas law the Court struck down just four years earlier. Roberts spent much of his June Medical opinion explaining why he disagrees with many of his Court’s decisions protecting abortion, and even dropping hints about how anti-abortion advocates can help undermine abortion rights in the future. June Medical, in other words, turned out the way it did because abortion opponents brought the weakest possible case to the Supreme Court — a case that was in all relevant respects indistinguishable from another case that the Court recently decided. The new case pending before the justices, Food and Drug Administration v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, does not suffer from similar weaknesses. There are several reasons to suspect that Roberts will return to his anti-abortion roots in American College. Even if this were not an abortion case, and even if Roberts were not typically opposed to abortion rights, Roberts has urged courts to defer to public health officials during the pandemic. He’s unlikely to support a lower court decision that disagreed with the FDA’s judgment regarding a drug used in abortions. And, with four other anti-abortion justices on the Supreme Court, if Roberts does flip back to the anti-abortion side in American College, that will almost certainly be enough to form a majority. Mifepristone, the drug at the center of American College, is part of a two-drug regimen used to induce abortion. Mifepristone causes pregnancy tissue and the lining of the uterus to break down and separate from the uterus itself. About a day or two after taking mifepristone, the patient takes a second drug, misoprostol, which causes uterine contractions and expels the uterus’s contents. Although patients may take mifepristone at home, the FDA only permits this drug to be distributed at hospitals, clinics, or medical offices — meaning that it cannot be dispensed by a retail or mail-order pharmacy. Thus, at a time when many health providers are moving toward telemedicine to protect themselves and their patients from the coronavirus, abortion providers and their patients must risk in-person contact. The limit on who can dispense the drug stretches back to when mifepristone was originally approved by the FDA in 2000, while Bill Clinton was president. The FDA also reviewed its restrictions on mifepristone in 2011, 2013, and 2016 — all during the Obama administration — and it left the requirement that the drug be dispensed by health care providers in place. But while this requirement imposes a relatively minor burden on people seeking abortions during normal times, it is significantly more burdensome during the coronavirus pandemic. Many clinics have either closed or reduced the number of patients who are allowed to visit, in order to reduce the spread of Covid-19. But that means that fewer patients are able to obtain mifepristone at those clinics. Meanwhile, patients may be afraid to travel to a clinic — especially if they rely on public transportation — because of the risk that they could be exposed to the coronavirus during this trip. As one expert witness testified in the American College case, the requirement that drugs be dispensed in-person “unnecessarily increases the infection risk for patients, their families, health care professionals, and the larger communities in which they work and live.” The FDA, moreover, has relaxed similar restrictions on other drugs unrelated to abortion during the pandemic, but it has not made such accommodation for mifepristone. As the plaintiffs note in their brief, the FDA has taken “‘extraordinary actions’ to reduce viral transmission by suspending in-person requirements for drugs, including potentially lethal controlled substances like opioids, and urging the use of telemedicine ‘whenever possible.’” Yet it’s left the in-person dispensing restriction in place for mifepristone. In light of all of these factors, a federal trial court held that the requirement that mifepristone must be dispensed in-person to patients by health providers should be suspended until 30 days after the end of the public health emergency triggered by Covid-19. “The In-Person Requirements impose a substantial obstacle to abortion patients seeking medication abortion care,” wrote Judge Theodore D. Chuang. As Chuang noted, the dual barriers raised by the pandemic and the in-person requirements “delay abortion patients from receiving a medication abortion, which can either increase the health risk to them or, in light of the ten-week limit on the Mifepristone-Misoprostol Regimen, prevent them from receiving a medication abortion at all.” After a federal appeals court refused to block Judge Chuang’s order, the Trump administration went to the Supreme Court, seeking a stay of that order. And, if that stay is granted, it could send a very clear signal to lower court judges that the right to an abortion should not be robustly enforced. The low-water mark for abortion rights, at least after Roe v. Wade (1973), was the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Gonzales v. Carhart. Prior to Gonzales, the Court applied a strong presumption against abortion restrictions that might endanger patient health. As the Court held in Stenberg v. Carhart(2000), “where substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women’s health,” a ban on a particular abortion procedure must “include a health exception when the procedure is ‘necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.’” But Gonzales upheld a federal ban on an abortion procedure known as intact dilation and extraction, despite the fact that the federal ban did not include an exception protecting “the life or health of the mother.” Rather, Gonzales held that state and federal lawmakers have “wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.” Thus, if physicians disagree about whether intact dilation and extraction is ever necessary to protect the health of a patient, Congress can resolve this disagreement in favor of a ban on the procedure. Significantly, Gonzales also noted that the ban on intact dilation and extraction did not prohibit another “commonly used and generally accepted method” of abortion that could be used as an alternative to intact dilation and extraction. Thus, the Court reasoned, a ban on this one particular method of abortion “does not construct a substantial obstacle to the abortion right” because patients could still obtain a different form of abortion. The Trump administration wants to turn this line in Gonzales into a rule that would block many abortion patients from obtaining the safest method of abortion. According to the Trump administration’s brief, restrictions on the use of mifepristone are appropriate — even if those restrictions effectively prevent many pregnant individuals from receiving a medication abortion altogether — because these patients could still have surgical abortions. The in-person dispensing requirement, the Trump administration argues, has “no effect on the availability of surgical abortions, a method that this Court has treated as safe for women.” Thus, they claim, the fact that another (far more invasive) means of obtaining an abortion is available means that the FDA is free to impose restrictions on medication abortion. So long as surgical abortions are available, the American College plaintiffs cannot attack restrictions on medical abortion “simply because [they] would prefer another alternative.” That’s an aggressive reading of the Court’s decision in Gonzales. As the plaintiffs explain in their brief, the thrust of their case is that “patients incur grave COVID-19 risk by engaging in unnecessary travel and physical proximity to other people as a condition of obtaining” a medication abortion. But those same patients face even more risk if they are forced to “travel to a health center for a more invasive procedure” such as a surgical abortion. And that’s assuming that these patients are even able to obtain a surgical abortion in the first place. Many clinics are already operating at reduced capacity due to the pandemic and have reduced the number of surgeries they perform as a result. These already stressed clinics are unlikely to be able to accommodate a rush of patients seeking surgeries in lieu of a medication abortion. Nevertheless, it’s likely that this Supreme Court — with its conservative Republican majority — will, at the very least, give very serious consideration to the Trump administration’s arguments. Moreover, when the administration seeks a stay of a lower court order, the justices typically decide whether to grant that request fairly quickly, and without oral arguments or full briefing. That means that the Court could potentially hold that the government may block patients from receiving medication abortions — and force these patients to have more invasive surgical procedures or to give up their right to terminate their pregnancy — as soon as this week. In June Medical, the four most conservative justices all voted to uphold Louisiana’s attempt to shut down many of its abortion clinics. Those four justices are almost certain to support additional restrictions on the right to an abortion. Meanwhile, the four liberal justices are typically fairly protective of abortion rights. That leaves Roberts, who almost always votes with his conservative colleagues in abortion cases (among other things, Roberts joined the majority in Gonzales), as the closest thing to a swing vote in American College. There’s good reason to believe that Roberts is likely to uphold the in-person restrictions on mifepristone. Indeed, there’s good reason to believe that Roberts is likely to uphold any similar restriction on a drug, regardless of whether that drug is used in abortions. For one thing, Roberts has advised courts to defer to public health officials during the Covid-19 pandemic, even when those officials take steps that implicate constitutional rights. In South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom (2020), Roberts broke with his fellow conservatives to uphold a California public health order limiting the number of people who could gather in a place of worship. “The precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement,” Roberts wrote in his South Bay opinion. He added that “our Constitution principally entrusts ‘[t]he safety and the health of the people’ to the politically accountable officials of the States ‘to guard and protect.’” A similar logic could apply in American College. That is, the task of determining whether it is safe to obtain mifepristone via a mail-order pharmacy, or some other method, is left to the FDA. And, if plaintiffs disagree with that judgment, courts should defer to the FDA. Roberts, moreover, joined the Gonzales majority, with its conclusion that the government has “wide discretion” to restrict abortion in areas “where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.” To be sure, the primary plaintiff in the American College case is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization with an unusual amount of credibility to opine on whether medical uncertainty exists in a particular case. But the College also believed that doctors should be allowed to perform intact dilation and extraction prior to Gonzales, and the Court did not defer to the College’s judgment in that case. There is good reason to suspect, in other words, that Roberts is likely to resolve a disagreement between the FDA and the College regarding how to safely dispense mifepristone in favor of the government agency. That said, the fact that the FDA is likely to prevail in American College does not mean that Roberts will go so far as to declare that medication abortions can effectively be banned so long as surgical abortions are available. For one thing, when the Court stays a lower court decision, it often does so in a brief order that does not explain the majority’s reasoning. So even if Roberts agrees with the Trump administration's arguments, he may not write those arguments into a binding opinion. If the Court does produce a majority opinion, moreover, there’s no guarantee that Roberts will embrace the broad new restriction on abortion rights proposed by the Trump administration. He could dispose of this case in a relatively narrow opinion holding that courts should defer to public health officials during the pandemic, much like the Supreme Court did in South Bay. But the fact remains that the Court has five justices who are broadly skeptical of abortion rights. So any time an abortion case reaches the Supreme Court, the Court’s Republican majority could potentially use that case to cut back on the right to terminate a pregnancy — or even to eliminate the right altogether.",https://www.vox.com/2020/9/9/21426056/supreme-court-abortion-american-college-obstetricians-gynecologists-surgery-trump-john-roberts,11808
What it takes to get an abortion during the coronavirus pandemic,Anna North,2020-04-01T11:10:00+00:00,"When Paige Alexandria found out she was pregnant, she wanted a medication abortion. But she lived in Austin in 2016, three years after Texas passed abortion restrictions that drove more than half the state’s clinics out of business. While many clinics were still open in Austin, they were so busy serving patients from other parts of the state that Alexandria couldn’t get an appointment for three weeks. Alexandria called the clinic every day, hoping someone would cancel so she could get an earlier appointment. “For any person who is pregnant when they don’t want to be,” she told Vox, “every day feels like a year.” Now, countless Texans are having a version of Alexandria’s experience, wanting an abortion but uncertain when — or if — they’ll be able to get one. Last week, Gov. Greg Abbott announced that abortion did not qualify as essential health care during the coronavirus pandemic and ordered all procedures postponed unless the life of the pregnant person is threatened. The state was one of at least five to essentially ban abortion during the pandemic — a move that anti-abortion groups have championed but that abortion-rights groups have characterized as a ploy to exploit a public health crisis for ideological gain. Abortion-rights advocates have been fighting the bans in court, but on Tuesday, a court ruled that the Texas ban can go into effect, for now. That leaves Texas patients with a choice: Delay the procedure for an uncertain amount of time, or try to travel out of state during a pandemic to end their pregnancies. Even if they’re able to travel, the current crisis has placed serious new obstacles in their way. In many states, an abortion requires multiple visits to a doctor — which could mean multiple exposures to the coronavirus in waiting rooms and other facilities. Meanwhile, the enormous economic toll of the pandemic has made it even harder for many low-income people to afford the procedure. “For our callers, expenses like groceries and rent are already difficult to obtain,” Cristina Parker, communications director at the Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity, which funds abortions in Texas, told Vox in an email. “But with the added instability of our economy — and with so many losing their jobs virtually overnight — paying out of pocket for an abortion can be next to impossible.” For Alexandria, the daily calls paid off. She was able to get an abortion after two weeks instead of three. But it was still too late for her to get a medication abortion; she had to get a surgical procedure, which was more expensive and required more time away from her two children. And today, she feels for those who are trying to end their pregnancies but are faced with fear, uncertainty, and delays. “Abortion is essential,” she says, “even during a pandemic.” As coronavirus sweeps the country, many areas are placing restrictions on businesses and services deemed nonessential, as well as pushing back nonemergency medical care. In the midst of such moves, officials in several red states — including Texas, Ohio, Alabama, Iowa, and Oklahoma — categorized abortion as nonessential and ordered that clinics postpone procedures until the crisis is over. “No one is exempt from the governor’s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures, including abortion providers,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a statement last week. “Those who violate the governor’s order will be met with the full force of the law.” Abortion opponents argue that abortion is an “elective” procedure and that providers should stop offering it and donate their masks and other protective gear to the coronavirus response. “Somebody needs to tell the abortion industry there’s a pandemic going on,” Mark Harrington, president of the anti-abortion group Created Equal, said in a statement last week. “Abortion is an elective procedure or they wouldn’t call it a ‘choice.’” But providers and abortion-rights advocates say abortion is just as necessary now as it ever was. “Abortion is essential health care,” Dr. Ashley Brant, an OB-GYN in Ohio and fellow with the group Physicians for Reproductive Health, told Vox in an email. “Many of my patients are experiencing fear,” Brant said. “Fear of contracting Covid-19, fear of losing their jobs and income, and fear of not being able to support their families. They should not have to fear losing access to reproductive health care, too.” Abortion-rights advocates say that opponents, and governors of states like Texas, are just using this moment to score political points. “I can’t emphasize enough how shameful it is to take advantage of this pandemic to just further shame women seeking abortion care,” Kelsey Ryland, director of federal strategies at the abortion-rights group All* Above All, told Vox. After Texas and other states announced bans, clinics had to cancel or postpone appointments for many patients, as Ema O’Connor reports at BuzzFeed. Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and other groups supporting abortion rights filed suit in five states to allow abortions to go forward. And on Monday, federal judges in Texas, Ohio, and Alabama ruled in their favor, meaning that clinics in those states could stay open. But Texas appealed the ruling to the Fifth Circuit, which on Tuesday allowed the state’s ban to take effect, at least for now. That leaves Texas patients in limbo, facing the possibility that abortion may be banned in their state for weeks, months, or even longer. Since abortion becomes more expensive later in pregnancy — and since some states, including Texas, ban it after 20 weeks’ gestation — the delay is likely to have serious repercussions for many. Some are already trying to travel out of state for the procedure, said Alexandria, who now works at the clinic where she got her abortion in 2016. Traveling at this time is especially difficult — some public transit routes have been reduced due to the pandemic, and contact with others during travel could increase patients’ chances of exposure. Even if patients can get to a clinic, they face a host of obstacles and concerns when they arrive. Many states require multiple in-person clinic visits for an abortion, even by medication. “This means that patients have to travel for care, sit in waiting rooms, and interact with multiple health care providers,” Brant said. “This endangers families and communities and promotes spread of the virus.” In order to mitigate those risks, a group of 21 attorneys general is asking the Trump administration to lift restrictions on medication abortion so that it could be prescribed by telemedicine around the country. Given the administration’s past embrace of restrictions on abortion, however, it is unlikely to agree. And the pandemic will only worsen obstacles that many people already face when seeking abortions, many reproductive rights advocates say. “Things that were already hard like getting to the clinic for multiple visits, getting child care, could be nearly impossible right now,” Ryland of All* Above All said. People who are low-income — the majority of abortion-seekers in America — may be facing job layoffs and more difficulty paying for an abortion than ever, she said. The Hyde Amendment already prohibits the use of federal funding for most abortions, and Republicans insisted on Hyde Amendment language in the recent coronavirus stimulus bill to ensure that states and localities couldn’t use the stimulus funds to help pay for abortions. As someone who had an abortion, Alexandria knows what it’s like to have to delay the procedure. For her, it wasn’t just the added cost of the surgical abortion. Because she didn’t have a ride to the clinic, she wasn’t able to be sedated for the procedure, increasing her discomfort. “It was really just hard not being able to access care when I needed it,” she said. But now, as a patient counselor at a clinic, she says she also sees the ways that advocacy groups are trying to help people get abortions during this time, whether it’s sending money to abortion funds in states affected by bans or booking hotel rooms for people who need to travel to get the procedure. “Even though access looks really hard right now,” she said, “there are so many people fighting right now to make sure that access remains a reality.”",https://www.vox.com/2020/4/1/21200247/coronavirus-texas-abortion-ban-pandemic-covid-19,11808

"Trigger laws and abortion restrictions, explained",Natasha Ishak,2022-06-25T21:02:34+00:00,"With the Supreme Court’s opinion on Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization issued this week, people who are able to become pregnant are now left wondering how the ruling may affect abortion-related legislation in their home state. In some states, abortion was made almost entirely illegal immediately following the Court’s decision on Friday thanks to special statutes known as “trigger laws.” In anticipation of Roe v. Wade’s reversal, more than a dozen Republican-controlled states created trigger laws. These laws put in place anti-abortion policies that may have been unconstitutional under Roe and are “triggered” by any federal law or Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe. Beyond health or medical risks, there are few exceptions where these anti-abortion laws do not apply, like in cases where the pregnancy would put the individual’s life in jeopardy, or in cases of rape or incest. But many states with those exceptions require the individual to report their case to law enforcement in order to meet the requirements for the exemption. Some states have trigger laws that will not go into effect unless certain conditions are met, like requiring a state’s chief prosecutor to sign off on a certification of the court’s decision. Other trigger laws simply don’t take effect immediately but will soon be enforced — in some states in as little as fivedays’ time. Several other states without trigger statutes are expected to reinstate old anti-abortion laws as well, though those are likely to face legal challenges from abortion rights advocates. Three states — Kentucky, Louisiana, and South Dakota — had statutes already on the books that allowed for complete or near-complete bans on abortion to take effect immediately following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. None of these states make an exception for abortion in cases of rape or incest. Six other states with trigger laws have also had their complete or near-complete bans on abortion swiftly implemented. There are a total of 13 states with trigger laws, though their scopes vary and so do their implementation. In Alabama, a judge lifted an injunction on Friday that allowed the state’s 2019 law banning abortion to become legal. In Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, the trigger laws became active after the Supreme Court’s decision was certified by the respective states’ attorneys general. Many Republican officials hailed the Supreme Court’s decision as a celebratory milestone for so-called pro-life conservatives. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who was the first AG to sign such a certification in the wake of the Dobbs ruling, rejoiced in the opportunity. “My office has been fighting to uphold the sanctity of life since I became attorney general, culminating in today’s momentous court ruling and attorney general opinion,” Schmitt said in a statement. “I will continue the fight to protect all life, born and unborn.” Complete or near-complete abortion bans in other trigger law states are expected to take effect within a certain period (typically within 30 days) after actions from state officials. Mississippi, another trigger law state where the court’s decision needs to be certified by the attorney general, has a shorter grace period, with its law taking effect just 10 days after certification. In North Dakota, anti-abortion laws will take effect immediately after the state’s attorney general signs off on it. North Dakota AG Drew Wrigley has 30 days to do so but said his office is reviewing the Dobbs decision. In Tennessee, anti-abortion laws will take effect 30 days after the court’s decision, with the lone exception being the risk of death or permanent disability. Idaho’s trigger law will kick in 30 days after the court’s official opinion is published — which is expected in about a month — enacting a near-complete ban on abortion in the state with the exceptions of cases of medical emergencies, rape, and incest. Texas’s trigger law will take effect 30 days after the court issues a judgment, not just an opinion. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton clarified that the official judgment should be issued after an appropriate period in which any appeals can be filed. The state already had a law banning abortions after six weeks except to save the life of the pregnant person, which took effect in September 2021. Wyoming and Utah are also trigger law states with anti-abortion legislation ready to be reactivated. Wyoming’s trigger law will take effect five days after the court decision is certified by the state’s governor, Mark Gordon, who described the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling as “a decisive win for those who have fought for the rights of the unborn for the past 50 years.”In Utah, the trigger law took effect after court decision was certified by the state’s legislative general counsel, which occurred the same day as the Dobbs ruling. Utah’s law will ban nearly all abortions except in cases of rape and incest, but only if reported to law enforcement. Utah’s law also allows exceptions in cases in which a baby would have severe birth defects and if a pregnancy puts the individual’s life at risk. Outside of the 13 states that hold trigger laws, there are at least six states likely to ban abortion in the coming weeks and months: Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Georgia, and South Carolina. A near-total abortion ban is expected to take effect in West Virginia through its existing anti-abortion law, which dates back to the 1800s. It will likely be revived, but it’s still unclear how and through what specific legal mechanisms that will happen. Recently, voters in West Virginia approved a state constitutional amendment specifying that “nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.” We can expect to see further anti-abortion laws flourish in the next few years; Republican lawmakers across the country have expressed their desire to pursue the strictest anti-abortion policies possible in their respective states. Among them is Arkansas state Sen. Jason Rapert, who sponsored the state’s trigger law in 2019. “It’s a good day for Arkansas but our work is not done,” Rapert said on Friday. “The NACL [National Association of Christian Lawmakers] has committed that we are going to seek the abolishment of abortion in every state in this country because just like Abe Lincoln said, ‘we cannot continue as a house divided.’” Correction, 6:45 pm: A previous version of this article misstated the details of several states’ laws post-Roe, including Alabama, New Hampshire, and Utah.

"The Supreme Court’s new abortion pill decision, explained",Ian Millhiser,2023-04-21T23:00:04+00:00,"The Supreme Court handed down a brief order on Friday in Danco Laboratories v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a lawsuit asking the federal judiciary to effectively ban mifepristone, a drug used in more than half of all abortions in the United States. The most immediate impact of the Court’s new order is that the justices voted to stay lower court decisions that would have cut off access to mifepristone, at least for the time being. That means that mifepristone remains available, and that patients who live in states where abortion is legal may still obtain the drug in the same way they would have obtained it if this lawsuit had never been filed. The Court did not disclose how each justice voted, but only two justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, publicly noted their dissents. This stay, however, is only temporary. The case will still need to be litigated in the conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and it may need to be heard by the Supreme Court again. Nevertheless, Friday’s order means that mifepristone will remain available until the last court to hear this case issues its final decision. The plaintiffs’ arguments in this case are laughably weak. They ask the Court to defy longstanding legal principles establishing that judges may not second-guess the FDA’s scientific judgments about which drugs are safe enough to be prescribed in the United States. Moreover, no federal court has jurisdiction to even hear this case in the first place. As attorney Adam Unikowsky, a former law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia, has written, “if the subject matter of this case were anything other than abortion, the plaintiffs would have no chance of succeeding in the Supreme Court.” But this Court’s GOP-appointed majority has a history of manipulating longstanding legal principles in order to achieve anti-abortion results. Most notably, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson (2021), the Supreme Court announced a new legal rule that, if taken seriously, would allow any state to nullify any constitutional right — a result that allowed the Court to shield a Texas anti-abortion law from judicial review. That said, the Court’s decision to temporarily keep mifepristone legal is a hopeful sign that the justices will ultimately decide not to ban mifepristone. And there are other reasons to believe that a majority of the Court might reject this entirely meritless attack on abortion rights. Although a supermajority of the justices were appointed by Republican presidents, not all of these justices are reliable votes for literally any outcome preferred by conservative litigants. To the contrary, the Court’s current majority tends to track the views of Republican elites in other positions of power and influence. To be sure, the Court’s six Republican appointees frequently call for massive rightward shifts in the law. And they often do so based on legal theories rejected by most legal experts. But in recent high-profile instances, the Court has done so after a consensus emerged among Republican elites that the law should be changed. As Yale law professor Jack Balkin has written, “law, and especially constitutional law, is grounded in judgments by legal professionals about what is reasonable.” A legal argument can “move from off the wall to on the wall because people and institutions are willing to put their reputations on the line and state that an argument formerly thought beyond the pale is not crazy at all, but is actually a pretty good legal argument.” To see this phenomenon in action, consider two high-profile lawsuits asking the Supreme Court to repeal the Affordable Care Act: NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) and California v. Texas (2021). When the NFIB case was filed shortly after Obamacare became law, it was widely viewed by legal experts as so absurd that few were willing to defend it. At a 2010 panel on the lawsuit hosted by the University of Washington, for example, the moderator announced that “we tried very hard to get a professor who could come and who thinks this is flat-out unconstitutional, but there are relatively few of them, and they are in great demand.” But elected Republican leaders, GOP-aligned media outlets, and powerful legal organizations like the Federalist Society spent two years touting the NFIB plaintiffs’ arguments against Obamacare and giving prominent platforms to lawyers who supported these arguments. The result was that four justices, all Republicans, voted in NFIB to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. And a fifth, Chief Justice John Roberts, struck a deal that severely weakened the law by permitting states to opt out of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. A very different drama played out nine years later, however, in the Texas case. As that case rose through the courts, leading voices in the GOP and its allied media outlets mocked the plaintiffs’ legal theory. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board labeled this lawsuit the “Texas Obamacare Blunder.” Yuval Levin, a prominent conservative policy wonk, wrote in the National Review that the Texas lawsuit “doesn’t even merit being called silly. It’s ridiculous.” Even Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) claimed that “no one believes the Supreme Court is going to strike down the Affordable Care Act” while the Court was considering the Texas case. The Supreme Court ultimately voted 7-2 to dismiss the Texas case, ruling that federal courts didn’t even have jurisdiction to hear it. So far, Republican reaction to the Hippocratic Medicine case more closely resembles the GOP reaction to Texas than NFIB. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board conceded that this lawsuit should fail. And at least one Republican member of Congress, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), even argued that the Biden administration should ignore one of the lower court decisions attacking mifepristone, telling CNN that this lawsuit “should just be thrown out quite frankly.” This tepid reaction by many Republican elites suggests that, if the Supreme Court’s GOP-appointed majority does decide to go out on a limb and ban mifepristone, then they will do so without consistent support from their fellow Republicans in other positions of power. Historically, even the Court’s current majority has been reluctant to go this far out of a limb on their own. An amicus brief filed by many key players in the pharmaceutical industry warns that, should the Supreme Court embrace the lower courts’ attacks on mifepristone, the entire health care system is likely to suffer terribly. That’s because the lower courts required the Food and Drug Administration to jump through so many needless hoops before it could approve mifepristone — or any drug, for that matter — that, the brief’s authors wrote, “it is unlikely that a single one” of the thousands of drugs the FDA has approved in the past “would have been approved” if those drugs had “been developed or reviewed by FDA under the lower courts’ approach.” The Hippocratic Medicine case, in other words, doesn’t just threaten access to abortion. It could potentially toss the FDA’s entire drug approval process into turmoil, threatening access to everything from antibiotics to blood pressure medication to cancer-fighting drugs.",https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/4/21/23686788/supreme-court-abortion-pill-ruling-mifepristone-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine,11808
Republicans’ abortion bans are nothing like those in Europe,Rachel M. Cohen,2023-06-06T11:00:00+00:00,"Republicans scrambling toaddress mounting backlash to abortion bans havelanded on what they hope they can market as a moderate political compromise: limiting abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Over the last month, Republicans in North Carolina and Nebraska have passed 12-week abortion bans, a dramatic reduction in access for states that previously allowed abortion up until 20 weeks and 22 weeks, respectively. North Carolina’s ban would permit abortion for rape victims through 20 weeks, for life-threatening fetal anomalies through 24 weeks, and to protect the life of the mother throughout. Nebraska’s new ban would permit exceptions for rape and to save the life of the mother, but not for fatal fetal anomalies. (Health of pregnant person exceptions have been notoriously confusing for doctors in practice, who fear criminal sanctions for violating the vague statutes.) Republican politicians are casting these new 12-week bans as “mainstream,” comparing them to even more extreme GOP-led states that have banned virtually all abortion, and pointing to other countries, particularly in Europe, that also impose gestational age limits at 12 weeks. The rhetorical strategy of invoking other countries to justify banning abortion will sound familiar to those who followedthe overturn of Roe v. Wade. In that case, Dobbs v. Jackson, Mississippi lawmakers defended their 15-week abortion ban by pointing out that most European countries have even earlier restrictions. In the Dobbs Supreme Court hearing itself, Justice John G. Roberts claimed the proposed 15-week ban mirrors “the standard that the vast majority of other countries have.” In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito cited a study published by a leading anti-abortion group that argued the US was out of step with the rest of the world in terms of abortion after 20 weeks. The study, published by the think tank arm of the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said 47 out of 50 European nations limit “elective” abortion before 15 weeks, meaning before then doctors are not required to attest to a particular justification for the abortion. But differences between the US and European countries are more complex than that simple comparison suggests. In practice, abortion limits in the United States are far more restrictive than what exists in most of the Western world, including in nations with gestational age limits at 12 weeks, like Germany, Denmark, Belgium, and Italy. This distinction between “elective” abortions (or “abortion on demand,” as it’s more provocatively called) and “therapeutic” abortions, which are done for medical reasons, might seem like a key distinction between the US and Europe. But in practice, the line is much blurrier. All abortions are ultimately elective — no one is forced to end a pregnancy, even if a doctor recommends it. Plenty of elective abortions are done for therapeutic reasons. Moreover, European countries that have 12-week limits on “elective” abortions still make it fairly easy for women to get abortions later on, with relatively broad exceptions for mental health or socioeconomic circumstances. Republicans have aggressively fought against similar exceptions, and in particular have worked to bar consideration of mental health risk — even the risk of suicide if a pregnancy continues — as a factor. And in other ways, European countries make it easier to get an abortion than in even relatively permissive jurisdictions in the United States.Across Europe, abortion services are coveredunder national health insurance, meaning the cost of accessing care is a far lower barrier for pregnant people facing time constraints. By contrast, in the US, cost is one of the biggest hurdles to ending a pregnancy. Even though more than90 percent of abortions occur within the first 13 weeks, roughly 75 percent of all US abortion patients are low-incomeaccording to 2014 numbers, and researchers find Americans needing care in the second trimester tend to be those with less education, Black women, and women who have experienced “multiple disruptive events” in the past year, such as losing a job. Republican lawmakers are also bucking international trends in working to aggressively restrict access to telehealth abortion care and medication abortion generally — which allows patients, especially those who live in remote and rural areas, to get the abortion services they seek on a faster timeline. Both North Carolina and Nebraska have fully banned abortion via telehealth, despite research affirming its safety and efficacy. Across the globe, the clear trend has been to expand access to abortion, decriminalize the procedure, and loosen restrictions. While restrictive policies, including earlier gestational limits, still present barriers for international abortion care, per the Center for Reproductive Rights, nearly 60 countries have liberalized their laws and policies on abortion since 1994. Only four — the US, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Poland — have further restricted rights. Even with earlier gestational limits, abortion in Europe is broadly affordable and accessible. This is not the paradigm Republicans are proposing in the United States. They are fighting to keep abortion expensive, particularly for low-income patients who rely on Medicaid; to limit the reasons like mental health for which patients can access legal abortion; and to restrict access to care, all while imposing bans on telemedicine, ramping up criminal penalties for providers, and shortening the legal timeline for pregnant people to raise funds, arrange travel, and book mandatory medical appointments. Republicans have been eager to point to countries that restrict “elective” abortion after 12 weeks to justify the supposedly mainstream nature of their new bans. But in 21 countries across Europe, the cost of abortion care is fully paid for by federal governments, making first-trimester abortions simply easier to do. Abortions in the US can easily exceed $500 out of pocket, and only 17 states currently cover abortion under their Medicaid programs, which they must do with state funds, not federal dollars, as Congress prohibits it. Another difference is that abortion exceptions for “health of the pregnant woman” in Europe take into account mental health, too. In Germany, for example, while abortion is permitted upon request throughout the first 12 weeks, someone can seek legal abortion through 22 weeks if it would help them “avert the danger of grave impairmentto [their] physical or mental health.” In Britain, which allowslegal abortion up to 24 weeks, it’s similarly clarified that a pregnant person can access careif it’s determined that ending the pregnancy would cause less damage to the patient’s physical or mental health than continuing to carry. “This is always granted [by doctors] under the correct assumption that continuing a pregnancy is always more dangerous than terminating, and that continuing an unwanted pregnancy is always detrimental to a person’s mental health,” said Maria Lewandowska, a reproductive and sexual health researcher at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Any doctor can provide this authorization, she said, and in practice, patients often get approval directly from doctors at abortion clinics. Advocates in the UK have been encouraging the government to authorize nurses and midwives to grant this permission, too. Some countries don’t explicitly state “mental health” in their statute, but recognize that maternal health includes psychological health. The author of France’s 1975 abortion law clarified during legislative hearings that “the very term ‘health’ covers, it seems to me, the mental aspect as well as the physical aspect.” The World Health Organization’s definition of “health” includes “mental health.” In Canada, leaders make no formal distinction between physical and mental health, which Joyce Arthur, executive director of the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, says allows providers to “better integrate abortion care into the broader health care system.” Meanwhile, research on the psychological harm associated with carrying unwanted pregnancies continues to mount. The Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study on the effects of unwanted pregnancy on patients’ lives, found that the mental health of women able to end unwanted pregnancies was significantly better than that of women forced to carry to term. Another report published in 2022 found that suicide is a leading cause of death for pregnant people during pregnancy and the first year following it. Anti-abortion activists in the US, for their part, continue to dismiss these studies. “Having an abortion will not mitigate mental health issues,” said Laura Echevarria, a spokesperson for the National Right to Life Committee, which has lobbied state legislatures to exclude mental health. In addition to providing exceptions for mental health and paying for abortion care, pregnant people in European countries can also seek legal abortion beyond their country’s 12- or 14-week limit for broad socioeconomic reasons, like feeling too young or too old to have children, feeling consumed by existing children, being a single parent, or lacking a stable housing or financial situation. The Center for Reproductive Rights counts at least 16 European countries that permit abortion on socioeconomic grounds. In Denmark, for example, though the country has a 12-week ban on paper, it’s considered relatively feasible for residents to get approval for abortion beyond that. In 2021, 803 pregnant people applied to get an abortion in Denmark beyond 12 weeks, and 750 were approved. Even with broader grounds for legal exceptions and greater financial assistance available in countries with earlier gestational age limits, first-trimester bans in Europe still force thousands of pregnant people to travel internationally every year to end their unwanted pregnancies. (A French parliamentary report from 2020 estimated that as many as 4,000 French women traveled abroad for abortion annually due to gestational limits. In 2022, French legislators extended their limit to 14 weeks.) One study published in March looked at people who traveled from countries like Austria, Bulgaria, France, Germany, and Italy to the Netherlands or England for later abortion care. Over half of the pregnant people surveyed hadn’t learned they were even pregnant until they were at least 14 weeks along, when they had already surpassed the limits in their home countries. The reasons participants cited for not knowing they were pregnant hold strong relevance for pregnant people in the US living in states with new 12- or six-week bans. The participants all said they would have preferred earlier abortion care but didn’t know they were pregnant due to reasons like irregular periods, lack of clear pregnancy signs, misinformation by doctors about contraception, or their gestational age. While European passports make travel to other EU countries relatively easy, pregnant people then have to shoulder the cost of travel and the abortion, as national governments only fund abortion care for their own residents. Feminist activists help fundraise for pan-European surgical abortion, as well as the distribution of medication abortion to regions where it’s illegal, but second-trimester abortions for non-Dutch residents can cost up to 1,100 euros. Abortion travel also delays care, which increases a pregnant person’s health risks. Twelve-week bans in the US won’t end the need for abortion care in the second trimester, because there will always be women who lack the knowledge that they’re pregnant before then. But if Republicans wanted to reduce the need for abortion after 12 weeks, they could back straightforward policies to make the procedure more accessible and affordable.",https://www.vox.com/23741997/republicans-12-week-abortion-bans-europe-roe-dobbs,11808
