What You Don’t Know About the Abortion Fight Before Roe v. Wade,Daniel K. Williams,History;politics,"January 4, 2016 11:00 AM EST","On Sunday, April 16, 1972, ten thousand people gathered in New York’s Central Park to protest New York’s liberal abortion law. The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade was still nine months away, but the battle over abortion was already raging. Yet the divisions did not fall neatly along partisan or ideological lines. In New York, the state with the highest number of legal abortions, the polarization was especially acute. It had been a Republican legislator and Republican governor who had been chiefly responsible for the legalization of abortion in the state two years earlier, and many of New York’s Republicans—including Governor Nelson Rockefeller—were still strongly supportive of abortion rights. But it was also a Republican who was leading the charge to reverse their actions. Democrats were equally divided. The media portrayed the pro-life movement as a Catholic cause, but by 1972, that stereotype was already outdated. In Michigan, for instance, the fight against a referendum to legalize abortion was spearheaded by three Protestants—a gynecologist, a white Presbyterian mother, and an African American woman who was a liberal Democratic state legislator. In Minnesota, the leader of the state’s pro-life campaign was a liberal Methodist whose physician husband was a member of Planned Parenthood. In Massachusetts, one of the leading pro-life activists was an African American Methodist physician who had been the first black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School. And even in New York, where Catholics accounted for the vast majority of the movement’s activists, there was more religious diversity than the media often acknowledged, partly because Catholics had joined forces with Orthodox Jews. In fact, one of the keynote speakers at the April 16 pro-life rally in Central Park was an Orthodox Jewish rabbi who served as president of the Rabbinical Alliance of America. One of New York City’s most vocal pro-life advocates was a liberal Lutheran minister who was best known for his protests against the Vietnam War and his advocacy of civil rights. Perhaps most surprisingly, at the time the protest took place, the pro-lifers were winning. Only a few years earlier, their campaign had looked like a last-gasp battle against the forces of progress. They faced opposition from the women’s rights movement, newspaper and television media, the medical and legal establishments, mainline Protestant denominations, ecumenical religious organizations such as the National Council of Churches, and political leaders in both major parties. Yet the pro-life movement had figured out a way to defy the international trend toward abortion legalization and defeat several efforts to liberalize state abortion laws. The right-to-life movement had faced nearly insuperable challenges in the late 1960s, when a wave of sixteen states legalized at least some forms of abortion within a three-year period. But then the pro-lifers regrouped, changed their strategies, and figured out how to win legislative battles. In 1971, twenty-five states considered abortion legalization bills. Every one of them failed to pass. In 1972, the pro-life movement went on the offensive and began campaigning for measures to rescind recently passed abortion legalization laws and tighten existing abortion restrictions. In the wake of the Central Park protest, the New York state legislature voted to repeal New York’s liberal abortion law and was thwarted only by Governor Rockefeller’s veto. The size of the backlash against abortion legalization surprised many supporters of abortion rights. What had happened? How did a small, beleaguered Catholic movement manage to create a massive ecumenical coalition of grassroots activists and stop the march of abortion legalization? . . .If the opponents of abortion had based their opposition merely on religious teaching or the seemingly arcane principles of natural law—as Catholics had when campaigning against contraception—it is unlikely that the pro-life cause could have withstood the forces of the sexual revolution, the feminist movement, and the social changes of the 1960s. But because the pro-life movement grounded its arguments in the language of human value and constitutional rights, it was able to attract a politically and religiously diverse coalition that actually gained strength over time. The pro-life movement succeeded because it drew on the same language of human rights, civil rights, and the value of human life that inspired the struggle for African American freedom, the feminist movement, antiwar protests, and the campaign for the rights of gays and lesbians.

Arizona’s Abortion Ban Never Represented the Will of the People—Even in 1864,Katherine Benton-Cohen / Made by History,;History;Made by History,"May 1, 2024 12:39 PM EDT","Arizona’s extreme anti-abortion law, which dates to 1864, might finally be on its way out on Wednesday.  The law had been made moot by Roe v. Wade in 1973. But on April 8, 2024, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that when the U.S. Supreme Court abolished the right to an abortion in 2022, the 1864 law snapped back into place, prohibiting all abortions except for those necessary to save the life of the mother.  Chaos and flip-flopping ensued. On April 24, three Republicans in the state house joined with all Democrats to pass a repeal. The state senate plans to vote on the matter on Wednesday. If the repeal passes, Democratic governor Katie Hobbs has promised to sign the bill, thus returning Arizona to a more moderate ban on abortions after 15 weeks, which was enacted in 2022. That law has broad support, unlike the more total ban — which probably never came close to majority support, even in 1864.  That’s because the men who passed that law represented only a fraction of Arizona’s population. The territorial legislature enacted the law before women could vote. What’s more, most of Arizona’s residents were American Indians, none of whom had access to the vote, and Mexican Americans, very few of whom did.  In fact, the laws passed by the legislature didn’t really even apply to most of the territory. Instead, American Indians, among them the various Apache groups who had not yet surrendered to the U.S. government, controlled most of the geography of the state. That meant that the authority of the young government that passed the abortion law was more a fiction than a reality — even though the ramifications of the laws they enacted are still reverberating today.  Congress created the Arizona Territory in 1863, by separating it from New Mexico. Arizona had no railroad, no mail service, and no public schools. The first territorial government was ad hoc at best. Legislators were elected, but, as in all territories, executive positions were appointed by the President. Prescott, the first territorial capital, was a small gold-mining camp.  The legislature met in a two-room log cabin that still smelled of pine pitch, had holes for windows, and a dirt floor. The house assembly had 18 members; the senate only nine. Three of the 27 were of Mexican origin, all of them wealthy ranchers, who did not represent most Arizonans. Altogether, these circumstances meant that the laws they enacted did not necessarily represent the will of Arizonans. In 1864, roughly 600 Anglos, almost all men, and approximately 6,000 Mexican-Americans lived in the territory. But many of the latter were not counted by the official census taker, who was a “lawman and gunfighter” that they might well have wanted to avoid. The official census also did not even attempt to count the territory’s roughly 4,000 American Indians.  Read More: After Abortion Ban, Arizona Just Became the Most Important State in 2024 Politics Most of the women in the territory were Mexican or American Indian,  and they had no formal voice in the political realm. The 1864 territorial census found 40 women living in the Prescott area, 31 of whom were Mexican. More than half of them lived with men as what the census taker labeled “mistresses,” but would be more accurately described as common-law wives.  Only a handful of Anglo women lived in the region, which gave them some social influence and flexibility to make money, but no political power. Mary Sawyer was a cross-dresser, someone we might call transgender today, who dressed as a man, worked mining claims with men, and drank with them as well. Another, Mary DeCrow, had come to Arizona with her southern companion, “Negro Brown.” She soon left him for a Mexican American blacksmith, Cornelius Ramos. She later ran a small restaurant. These women proved to be transient as well. The census found only 10 of the 50 women in central Arizona in 1864 were still there by 1870. People came and went in mining camps, but the anti-abortion law may have repelled some women — especially because it prescribed a sentence of two to four years to anyone who provided an abortion. In those years, it was likely that abortion providers were fellow women.  Thus, the territory’s new laws quite literally represented the views of a small group of white men, not the broader Arizona public. The abortion law was part of an omnibus legislative package, called the Howell Code, that became Arizona’s first legal system. It made no exceptions for rape or incest, but very few acts we would understand as rape even counted as such at the time. The rape of Native and Hispanic women was widespread but almost never acknowledged, marital rape did not yet exist as a legal concept, and the age of sexual consent for girls was 10 years old. Until 1871, non-whites could not even legally testify against whites in Arizona courtrooms, and, according to historian Katrina Jagodinsky, “no Indigenous woman testified against a white defendant until 1913.”  In addition, the particular men in the territorial legislature were especially awful in their treatment of women. The speaker of the house, William Claude Jones, was a known pedophile. The legislature he presided over legalized a system of Indian “apprenticeship” that amounted to slavery. This law allowed one legislator, territorial militia Lieutenant Colonel King Woolsey, to keep as his consort 10-year-old Lucía Martinez. He had captured the young Yaqui girl during his self-proclaimed “extermination” plan in which he murdered 30 Apaches. By age 17, she had borne three children. After Woolsey married a white woman, Martinez went to court and won back the daughters Woolsey kept from her. Woolsey’s story illustrates something important: Arizona’s first legislators were more concerned with controlling and killing Indians than they were with women’s rights. After passing the Howell Code, that first legislature spent most of its time debating how to fight the Apaches.  Read More: What to Know About the Arizona Supreme Court Abortion Ban Ruling The war on indigenous people involved rape, as the fate of the largest tribal group in Arizona, the Diné, or Navajo, made clear. After a violent U.S. military campaign led by Indian Agent Kit Carson, the Diné were removed from Arizona and forced on the over 200-mile ""Long Walk"" to a remote reservation in New Mexico. The soldiers did “not have any regard for the women folks,” one white man recalled. “They took unto themselves for wives somebody else’s wife,” and killed husbands who resisted.  The territorial law gave these women no recourse if they became pregnant — despite the fact that, for the Diné, pregnancy was a deeply private matter and women had a say in politics and governance. In 1868, when the Diné successfully negotiated for a reservation on their homeland, it was men and women who did so. Later tribal law even emphasized the right to privacy, and polls suggest most tribal members in the Southwest support reproductive rights. Even so, American Indians were entirely excluded from participating in Arizona politics, not just in the 1860s, but for decades to come. White women in the state secured the franchise in 1912, but Native peoples did not gain the right to U.S. citizenship until 1924. In Arizona, many fought for suffrage long after that, including through the use of the Voting Rights Act after it passed in 1965. Given the exclusion of women, American Indians, and Mexican Americans from the political process that elected the territorial legislature, it is safe to say that the 1864 abortion law probably has never represented the views of the majority of Arizonans. Twentieth-century Arizona history supports that idea.  Take the state’s legendary conservative Republican U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater. With her father's support, Goldwater’s daughter had an abortion in 1956, and his wife Peggy won Planned Parenthood’s national Margaret Sanger Award in 1967 for her decades of reproductive-rights activism. The Goldwaters, like many others in Arizona, embraced a libertarian conservative philosophy that rejected the sort of infringement upon liberty represented by the abortion law. And this spirit persists to the present day. A recent poll (Indivisible/Data for Progress) found that 60% of Arizona voters identified as “pro-choice.” That includes Attorney General Kris Mayes, who grew up on a tree farm in Prescott, the former capital, and is the first mother to serve as Arizona’s attorney general. She has made it clear that she will not enforce the law those benighted men passed in her hometown 160 years ago. Finally, it appears the current legislature is following her lead to represent the actual views of most Arizonans. Katherine Benton-Cohen is professor of history at Georgetown University.

"Supreme Court Allows Idaho to Enforce Its Strict Abortion Ban, Even in Medical Emergencies",MARK SHERMAN / AP,Politics;Supreme Court,"January 6, 2024 8:58 AM EST","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, while a legal fight continues. The justices said they would hear arguments in April and put on hold a lower court ruling that had blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies, based on a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration. The Idaho case gives the court its second major abortion dispute since the justices in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to severely restrict or ban abortion. The court also in the coming months is hearing a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration's rules for obtaining mifepristone, one of two medications used in the most common method of abortion in the United States. In the case over hospital emergencies, the Biden administration has argued that hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by federal law to provide emergency care, potentially including abortion, no matter if there's a state law banning abortion. The administration issued guidance about the federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, two weeks after the high court ruling in 2022. The Democratic administration sued Idaho a month later. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Idaho agreed with the administration. But in a separate case in Texas, a judge sided with the state. In a statement Friday night, President Joe Biden objected to the high court's decision and said his administration “will continue to defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law.” Idaho makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion. The administration argues that EMTALA requires health care providers to perform abortions for emergency room patients when needed to treat an emergency medical condition, even if doing so might conflict with a state’s abortion restrictions. Those conditions include severe bleeding, preeclampsia and certain pregnancy-related infections. “For certain medical emergencies, abortion care is the necessary stabilizing treatment,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in an administration filing at the Supreme Court. The state argued that the administration was misusing a law intended to prevent hospitals from dumping patients and imposing “a federal abortion mandate” on states. “EMTALA says nothing about abortion,” Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador told the court in a brief. Just Tuesday, the federal appeals court in New Orleans came to the same conclusion as Labrador. A three-judge panel ruled that the administration cannot use EMTALA to require hospitals in Texas to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy. Two of the three judges are appointees of President Donald Trump, and the other was appointed by another Republican president, George W. Bush. The appeals court affirmed a ruling by U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, also a Trump appointee. Hendrix wrote that adopting the Biden administration's view would force physicians to place the health of the pregnant person over that of the fetus or embryo even though EMTALA “is silent as to abortion.” After Winmill, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, issued his ruling, Idaho lawmakers won an order allowing the law to be fully enforced from an all-Republican, Trump-appointed panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But a larger contingent of 9th Circuit judges threw out the panel’s ruling and had set arguments in the case for late January. The justices' order Friday takes the case away from the appeals court. A decision is expected by early summer. Friday’s development is just one of several legal battles currently making their way through the courts in Idaho. Separately, four women and several physicians have filed a lawsuit asking an Idaho court to clarify the circumstances that qualify patients to legally receive an abortion. That lawsuit was recently granted the greenlight to move forward despite attempts by the Attorney General’s office to dismiss the case. Meanwhile, a federal judge in November temporarily blocked Idaho’s “abortion trafficking” law from being enforced while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality is underway. That law, which Idaho lawmakers passed last year, was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don’t have their parents’ permission.

How a 10-Year-Old Rape Victim Who Traveled for an Abortion Became Part of a Political Firestorm,Solcyré Burga;What do we know about the case?;Why did it become national news? ;More From TIME;How are officials reacting? ;More from TIME;What does this mean for other rape survivors? ,U.S.;abortion,"July 15, 2022 7:29 PM EDT","The case of a 10-year-old girl who had to travel from her home in Ohio to Indiana to receive an abortion after being raped has become national news—and a major political issue following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The child, then nearly six-and-a-half weeks pregnant, could not legally receive an abortion in Ohio due to the state’s “fetal heartbeat” law, which went into effect after the Court abolished the constitutional right to an abortion. Her doctor phoned Indianapolis physician Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who agreed to perform the procedure. Bernard went public with the story in the Indianapolis Star.  The response from both sides of the abortion debate has been uncompromising. For advocates of abortion rights—including President Biden—the girl was an example of how new abortion restrictions were already harming the most vulnerable people.  But abortion opponents have doubled down. Jim Bopp, an Indiana lawyer and general counsel for the National Right to Life, believes the girl should have carried the child to term.  “She would have had the baby, and as many women who have had babies as a result of rape, we would hope that she would understand the reason and ultimately the benefit of having the child,” Bopp told Politico on Thursday. “We don’t think, as heart-wrenching as those circumstances are, we don’t think we should devalue the life of the baby because of the sins of the father.”  Here’s what to know about the case:  The Columbus Police Department was informed about the child’s pregnancy on June 22, after the Franklin County’s Children Services agency filed a complaint, NPR reports.  Officers have since already arrested Gerson Fuentes, 27, who confessed to raping the girl at least twice. He is currently held at the Franklin County Jail on a $2 million bond. Detectives investigating the case collected Fuentes’ DNA to confirm his paternity, and he faces a potential life sentence if found guilty.  The case was brought to national attention after Biden delivered impassioned remarks while signing an executive order to better protect access to abortion in response to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade on July 8.  Biden called the Supreme Court’s decision “extreme.” Since Roe has been overturned, four states have banned abortion, with no exceptions for rape or incest, unless the mother’s life is at risk. “This isn’t some imagined horror,” Biden said. “It’s already happening. Just last week it was reported that a 10-year-old girl was a rape victim. And she was forced to have to travel outside the state to Indiana to seek to terminate the pregnancy.” Biden’s executive order asked federal agencies to find policies that would allow FDA-approved medication for abortion to remain accessible. It also sought to protect patient privacy for those seeking reproductive medical services.  Many conservative lawmakers and media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, reacted to Biden’s speech by casting doubt that the 10-year-old girl’s case even existed. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost on FOX News stated that there was not a “whisper anywhere” of the 10-year-old rape victim. That changed after Columbus police announced the arrest of a suspect in the case. Indiana’s current law allows for an abortion up to 22 weeks of pregnancy, but that is likely to change following the state’s special legislative session on July 25. Both chambers of the General Assembly have conservative supermajorities, and Republican leaders have promised to increase abortion restrictions. While Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb called the 10-year-old’s case a “horrific example,” he did not specify the type of restrictions residents can expect.  Dr. Meera Shah, the Medical Director of Whole Women’s Health Alliance in South Bend, Ind., expects abortion to be outlawed entirely in the Hoosier state, and says that even exceptions like rape or incest do not protect victims. “These laws require that [patients] disclose or have some recognition of what they’ve experienced on a very specific timeline in order to get care,” Shah says. “That requires the patient to disclose that they were raped or experienced incest. And for those of us that have worked with survivors of trauma, survivors of sexual abuse, we know that oftentimes that trauma gets internalized and is wrapped around with shame and stigma.” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita announced on Fox News on July 13 that he was launching an investigation to determine whether Bernard filed a report within three days of the procedure, as is required by state law for abortions done on patients under the age of 16. The next day, however, the Star acquired documents from the Indiana Department of Health showing she did file the proper paperwork. Bopp, the anti-abortion rights lawyer, has been involved in writing model anti-abortion legislation to be used by state lawmakers. His model legislation would have prevented the victim from obtaining an abortion. Across the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that nearly 3 million women have experienced rape-related pregnancy in their lifetimes, with an estimated one in nine girls under the age of 18 experiencing rape, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).  And while data about rape-related pregnancy is limited, a 2020 CDC report found that more than 1,700 infants were born to children aged 10 to 14. The statistics are a cause of great concern, experts say.  Research by the Commonwealth Fund shows that while maternal deaths are largely preventable, there are approximately 17 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in America, compared to the 8.6 maternal deaths seen in neighboring Canada. “Pregnancy for most adult women can kill them,” says Michele Goodwin, author of Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood. “[If] we think of this as a child, whose organs become far more vulnerable, whose body has not developed to be able to handle nine months of that kind of pressure. Then one can only see it as being cruel to enforce those kinds of mandates.”  Since May 9, there have been 50 police reports of rape or sexual abuse for girls aged 15 or younger in Columbus, Ohio, alone—though experts say confidentiality laws mean some reports may not be included in that figure. Experts also point out that most sexual assaults go un-reported. The Ohio Department of Health has indicated that there were 52 abortions that took place in children age 15 or younger in 2020, down from the 63 that were recorded in 2019. And abortion rates for teens are higher than for adults, with an estimated 28% of pregnancies for people aged 15-17 ending in an abortion. The strict new abortion laws, Goodwin says, will disproportionately affect the socially economically vulnerable, and especially low-income women of color that live in states like Alabama, with one of the most restrictive abortion policies and the highest teen birth rates. Experts predict teen birth rates will begin to rise. Goodwin likens the young girls who will be forced to travel to receive abortions to refugees. “Refugees are individuals who have a very legitimate claim to try to save their lives from the tyranny that is being imposed by a government in another state where they will be harmed,” she says. Correction, July 17 The original version of this story misstated what Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said to Fox News. Rokita said he would investigate to see if Dr. Caitlin Bernard failed to report an abortion she performed in Indiana, not that she did fail to report it.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg Wishes This Case Had Legalized Abortion Instead of Roe v. Wade,Olivia B. Waxman,History,"June 24, 2022 1:40 PM EDT","Editor’s Note: This story, originally published in 2018, explores Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s views on abortion rights and Struck v. Secretary of Defense—the case that the late Supreme Court Justice argued that she wished legalized abortion, instead of Roe v. Wade. On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to overturn Roe v. Wade. When the U.S. Senate confirmed President Bill Clinton’s nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court by a 96-3 vote on Aug. 3, 1993 — precisely 25 years ago Friday — that decision set Ginsburg on the path to legal (and viral) history. That process was also noteworthy for her decision to take “the unprecedented step of strongly endorsing abortion rights” in a Supreme Court confirmation hearing, as TIME reported back then. “It is essential to woman’s equality with man that she be the decisionmaker, that her choice be controlling,” Ginsburg told Senators during her four days of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. “If you impose restraints that impede her choice, you are disadvantaging her because of her sex.” Read More: What the Supreme Court’s Abortion Decision Means for Your State Today, the idea that a judge’s views on abortion rights might be determining factor for his or her suitability for a seat on the Supreme Court is unsurprising. In particular, the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade is frequently referred to as a “litmus test” for a justice. So it might come as a surprise that, though she made history by endorsing abortion rights during her confirmation hearing, Ginsburg had well-known reservations about Roe. Her views on abortion came up during her confirmation hearings in part due to a lecture she’d given earlier that year at New York University School of Law, in which she discussed the topic. At one point during her talk, she critiqued the Court for the structure of its decision in Roe v. Wade: The seven to two judgment in Roe v. Wade declared “violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment” a Texas criminal abortion statute that intolerably shackled a woman’s autonomy; the Texas law “except[ed] from criminality only a life-saving procedure on behalf of the [pregnant woman].” Suppose the Court had stopped there, rightly declaring unconstitutional the most extreme brand of law in the nation, and had not gone on, as the Court did in Roe, to fashion a regime blanketing the subject, a set of rules that displaced virtually every state law then in force. Would there have been the twenty-year controversy we have witnessed, reflected most recently in the Supreme Court’s splintered decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey? A less encompassing Roe, one that merely struck down the extreme Texas law and went no further on that day, I believe and will summarize why, might have served to reduce rather than to fuel controversy. Kate Michelman, then president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, called on the Senators to determine “whether Judge Ginsburg will protect a woman’s fundamental right to privacy, including the right to choose, under a strict scrutiny standard.” The questioning was strong enough that Ginsburg’s husband Marty Ginsburg, one of the fiercest advocates for her judicial career, got academics to call the White House and clarify that she was talking about the Court’s thinking in 1973, not the ultimate decision. When Sen. Hank Brown (R-CO) asked about her remarks during her confirmation hearing, she clarified her stance: “Abortion prohibition by the State, however, controls women and denies them full autonomy and full equality with men. That was the idea I tried to express in the lecture to which you referred.” Ginsburg said that she believed it would have been easier for the public to understand why the Constitution protected abortion rights if the matter had been framed as one of equal protection rather than privacy. And in fact, there was a specific case she had in mind as one that should have driven the national conversation, instead of letting Roe carry that weight. She told the Senators that she “first thought long and hard” about abortion rights when, as a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), she took on Struck v. Secretary of Defense, a case that was on the Supreme Court’s calendar during the same term that Roe was decided. Susan Struck was an Air Force Captain who got pregnant while serving in Vietnam and sued the Air Force after it said she would have to either get an abortion at the base hospital or leave if she wanted to have the child. She told the Air Force that she didn’t want to get an abortion; she wanted to use the vacation days that she had saved up to give birth and then put the baby up for adoption because abortion violated her Roman Catholic faith. Here’s how Ginsburg explained her approach — that sex discrimination includes discrimination because of pregnancy — to the Senate Judiciary Committee: First, that the applicable Air Force regulations — if you are pregnant you are out unless you have an abortion — violated the equal protection principle, for no man was ordered out of service because he had been the partner in a conception, no man was ordered out of service because he was about to become a father. Next, then we said that the Government is impeding, without cause, a woman’s choice whether to bear or not to bear a child. Birth was Captain Struck’s personal choice, and the interference with it was a violation of her liberty, her freedom to choose, guaranteed by the due process clause. Finally, we said the Air Force was involved in an unnecessary interference with Captain Struck’s religious belief. So all three strands were involved in Captain Struck’s case. The main emphasis was on her equality as a woman vis-à-vis a man who was equally responsible for the conception, and on her personal choice, which the Government said she could not have unless she gave up her career in the service. In that case, all three strands were involved: her equality right, her right to decide for herself whether she was going to bear the child, and her religious belief. So it was never an either/or matter, one rather than the other. It was always recognition that one thing that conspicuously distinguishes women from men is that only women become pregnant; and if you subject a woman to disadvantageous treatment on the basis of her pregnant status, which was what was happening to Captain Struck, you would be denying her equal treatment under the law… The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself. When Government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices. Struck lost in the lower courts, and the Supreme Court agreed on Oct. 24, 1972, that the case should be heard — but that never happened, because the Air Force waived Struck’s discharge and allowed her to remain in the service before that date rolled around. (As Ginsburg told law students in a summer program in July 2008, according to the 2016 edited collection of her remarks and writings My Own Words, Solicitor General Erwin Griswold had recommended that course of action for the Air Force because he thought the government could potentially lose the case.) The Roe decision came out three months later.  Ginsburg has described calling Capt. Struck in December of 1972 to see if she had been denied anything else because she was a woman, “hoping to keep the case alive.” Struck told her she would have liked to become a pilot but the Air Force didn’t let women become pilots. “We laughed, agreeing it was hopeless to attack that occupational exclusion then,” Ginsburg recalled. “Today, it would be hopeless, I believe, to endeavor to reserve flight training exclusively for men. That is one measure of what the 1970s litigation/legislation/public education efforts in the United States helped to achieve.” Despite her impassioned response on the matter of abortion, Ginsburg’s confirmation hearings are also known for setting the precedent of the so-called “Ginsburg rule,” which refers to her refusal to comment on some pending cases or cases that could come before the court. Ironically, as President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces the process Ginsburg endured 25 years ago, some experts predict that he will rely on the Ginsburg rule to get out of answering questions about his views on just the very subject on which she spoke so memorably.

In the immediate aftermath of the ruling, protesters on both sides of the debate flooded the plaza in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington. Anti-abortion advocates prayed and danced as young activists declared themselves the “post-Roe generation.” Abortion-rights supporters, meanwhile, vibrated with both rage and despair. Some wept. Others held images of hangers, a grim reference to the dangerous abortions that took place before Roe was decided in 1973.  Buy a print of the ‘Where the Abortion Fight Goes Next’ cover here But if the searing emotions resonate with most Americans, neither reference fully encapsulates our new reality. We are neither the post-Roe generation nor are we transported back to 1972. Technology has made the future of abortion access in America both less horrifically grisly than it was a generation ago and simultaneously more frightening than anyone could have predicted. Read More: Supreme Court Overturns Roe v. Wade, Undoing Constitutional Right to Abortion Abortion pills, which can now be prescribed via telehealth appointments and mailed directly to people’s homes, allow those who are up to 10 weeks pregnant to safely and privately end their pregnancies. And those who cannot, or do not want to, use pills can turn to vast networks online—unimaginable 50 years ago—where advocates are poised to help those in need pay for and travel to obtain abortions. But like most technological advances, these transformations cut both ways. The internet, a fount of advice, is also a swamp of misinformation; apps and digital platforms, readily available in our pockets, are also powerful tools of surveillance.  The legal and political battle over the future of abortion access, now unfolding at the state and local levels, will reflect this newly complex landscape. Anti-abortion advocates, who have spent a half century amassing power in the federal judiciary and in state legislatures, are poised to pass new measures designed to limit access and layer in criminal penalties for an increasingly broad set of behaviors. The issue of abortion, long polarizing, has now been codified into the platforms of both major political parties, catapulting it to the fiery center of the nation’s culture wars.  The decision does not, of course, come as a surprise. A leaked draft, published by Politico in early May, offered a thorough blueprint. Still, the opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization is historic, overturning both Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 case that reaffirmed abortion rights. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito argues that “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start” because, he writes, abortion is “not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions.” The same could be said about the rights to birth control, same-sex marriage, and same-sex sexual activity—points that Justice Clarence Thomas explicitly raises in his concurring opinion arguing that the court should reconsider which rights are found in the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Read More: Inside Mississippi’s Last Abortion Clinic—and the Biggest Fight for Abortion Rights in a Generation In all the fury and emotion of this moment, historians are rightly cautioning against any suggestion that the U.S. may be on the precipice of another Civil War. But it is worth noting that a decision that rolls back a major civil right will have the nearly immediate effect of re-creating a starkly fractured map of America: about half of the states will ban abortion entirely or severely restrict it, while the other half will likely either strengthen access or preserve the status quo. What’s clear now is that the period that we are entering will not look like 1972. Rather, it will be a futuristic steampunk version of the American past, as warring factions battle over new technologies and clash against new state laws that aim to dictate whose lives have value within their borders. Even before the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Dobbs last fall, the mere existence of medication abortion had transformed reproductive rights in America. Now, activists see these pills as central, though not a panacea, to the future of abortion access nationwide. In the past year, activists and providers have ramped up efforts to crank out information about abortion pills, publishing guides on how to find them and how to take them, launching ads on social media and the New York City subway, and hosting free Zoom classes on how to self-manage abortions outside the medical system. They are also staffing up hotlines to answer people’s medical and legal questions, and funding programs to teach primary-care doctors and medical residents how to follow up with patients who’ve used abortion pills. Telehealth startups like Hey Jane, Choix, and Just the Pill are partnering with online pharmacies to deliver the drugs to people in states where it’s legal. Groups like Aid Access, which are based overseas, plan to continue shipping the pills anywhere in the U.S., regardless of state restrictions, often in small, unmarked packages that are indistinguishable from other mail.  State and local abortion-rights activists are also already in high gear. With the U.S. Congress repeatedly failing to pass legislation codifying the right to abortion, and President Joe Biden weighing executive actions that lawyers say would likely be challenged, abortion-rights groups, grassroots networks, and abortion funds have been raising money to support existing clinics, lobbying against efforts to criminalize providers and patients, and building expansive networks designed to transport people hundreds of miles to receive care. In the Mountain West, a telehealth service is launching the country’s first mobile abortion clinics—bulletproofed vehicles equipped with abortion pills, exam tables, and medical equipment that will stop in different locations each week to offer free services to patients from states where the procedure is banned. In the Midwest, a group of volunteer pilots has banded together to offer free private flights to patients who need to travel to get abortions.  Read More: What the Supreme Court’s Abortion Decision Means for Your State In Texas and Tennessee, volunteers are teaching people how to use abortion pills to safely end their pregnancies on their own, if they cannot access a doctor—a service that advocates say is critical to bridging the stark racial, economic, and geographic disparities that are already emerging in who can access the pills. In Ohio, clergy are learning to combat the stigma around abortion, and in Florida, a synagogue has filed suit, arguing that the state’s abortion ban infringes on religious freedom. Liberal state governments, too, are enacting additional protections. California, New York, Oregon, and Connecticut have all either added funds for abortion patients or safeguards for providers who treat those from out of state; 16 states now explicitly protect abortion rights—far more than the four that did so before 1973. Anti-abortion groups are also using every tool at their disposal, including well-targeted Google ads, social media campaigns, and TikTok videos, to capitalize on this moment. It’s no mistake, for example, that the top two search results for “abortion in Dallas” lead to anti-abortion pregnancy-center organizations. Students for Life of America, which works with young people around the country, has spearheaded social media ad campaigns, hosted virtual lobbying days, and released documentary series designed to scare people away from medication abortion. Other groups, including Live Action, use emotive videos and Facebook ads to promote “abortion pill reversal,” a supposed treatment that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says is “unproven and unethical.”  Navigating this sea of information and misinformation is often confounding and may soon be more dangerous. Many of the apps and chatbots and 24-hour hotlines available online collect users’ personal information—data that vigilantes and local law-enforcement officials may soon be able to use to track, shame, implicate, or even prosecute pregnant people seeking abortions, or those who help them. Legal experts warn that period-tracking apps, Google search histories, and text messages between friends can currently be used as evidence in a court of law.  Brick-and-mortar anti-abortion pregnancy centers, which have exploded in number in recent years, also collect women’s most intimate data, including what they plan to do with their pregnancy. Many of these centers use names like Your Choice and Women’s Health Clinic, but most are faith-based groups connected to large anti-abortion organizations and not licensed medical facilities—which means that the data they collect is not subject to federal privacy laws, legal and privacy experts say. Through all of this, the racial profiling and surveillance that people of color already face is likely to mean those communities will be disproportionately criminalized in this realm too. Read More: Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers Are Collecting Troves of Data That Could Be Weaponized Against Women The legal landscape is also shifting rapidly. Texas’ ban on abortion after roughly six weeks, which has been in effect since last September, essentially puts a price on personal health information. It offers a $10,000 reward to any private citizen who successfully brings a case against anyone who provides an abortion or aids someone in getting one. Oklahoma’s abortion ban, which went into effect in May, offers a similar reward. Idaho’s six-week abortion ban allows the fetus’ family members to sue for a potential $20,000 reward, and was only blocked in court because Roe still stood this spring.  Historically, mainstream anti-abortion advocates have avoided punishing women and instead focused on providers, says Mary Ziegler, an abortion-law historian at the University of California, Davis. But as abortion pills play a bigger role, she says, that may soon change. In the past two years, conservative lawmakers have introduced a raft of new laws effectively prohibiting the use of telemedicine for abortion pills. In some cases, the measures directly outlaw mailing the pills to state residents and increase criminal penalties for violating existing abortion laws. On June 21, Louisiana’s governor, a Democrat, signed two new laws that do just that. In May, Louisiana legislators advanced a bill that would have classified abortion as homicide and allowed pregnant women to be charged. (It failed but could be reintroduced.)  In March, Missouri legislators introduced a measure that would make it a felony to perform an abortion on an ectopic pregnancy—a condition in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus and cannot survive, and that can be life-threatening to the pregnant person. The same measure would treat shipping abortion pills as drug trafficking. Missouri lawmakers also introduced a bill that would allow citizens to sue anyone who helps a Missouri resident travel to get an abortion out of state. None of those measures passed this session, but legal experts say they expect to see the ground shift quickly. The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers warned last year that without Roe, these aggressive state abortion bans “will open the door to mass criminalization on an unprecedented scale.” Read More: Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers Are Collecting Troves of Data That Could Be Weaponized Against Women The ambitions of anti-abortion legislators match the broader anti-abortion movement, which has over the decades, shifted dramatically to the right, following larger trends in American politics. As the number of competitive political districts have decreased, politicians have been incentivized to focus on winning primaries, rather than general elections. That, in turn, has led to “more extreme abortion policies,” Ziegler says. A highly conservative Supreme Court majority, delivered in part by the anti-abortion movement, also had the effect of emboldening lawmakers to test once-fringe ideas—like abortion bans without exceptions for rape or incest. After the Supreme Court draft leaked in May, U.S. Congress Republicans floated the idea of a federal abortion ban, a proposal that would have been considered outrageous less than a year ago.  Now that Roe is officially overturned, national anti-abortion groups are also cranking into high gear. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America rebranded this month to expand into more state legislative advocacy, and Students for Life of America, which runs programs to help pregnant college students and organizes young anti-abortion advocates around the country, has changed its organizational structure to focus on lobbying for state-based abortion restrictions. The National Right to Life Committee, the country’s largest anti-abortion organization, recently released a so-called model bill, providing a legislative template for states to criminalize nearly all abortions, as well as people aiding an abortion, distributing abortion pills, and sharing any information or hosting a website about abortion. Conservative lawmakers in at least six states have called for special legislative sessions that would allow their states to pass new bills banning abortion in light of the Supreme Court ruling. Local law enforcement officials could also start to take action against anyone they see as violating new laws immediately. If these laws and enforcement measures are new, the idea of policing a particular group’s behavior is not, says Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. A post-Roe America will likely have deep parallels to the post-Civil War Jim Crow laws, which were, she says, “both substantively and symbolically, meant to relegate people to a second-class citizenship.” All of the new anti-abortion legislation cropping up in states is designed not only to stop most abortions, she says, but to intimidate. “​​The way in which the state shows suspicion rather than care and respect for [people] leads people to internalize shame and guilt. And it means that people then will resist turning to the state when they actually need the state support and when they should get it,” she says. Like data-collection and surveillance efforts, these effects may fall hardest on people of color, poor people, and others who are already marginalized.  Doctors and health care providers also warn that many of these new anti-abortion laws will have the effect of punishing women seeking care for miscarriages, pregnancy complications, and other related concerns. In Texas, some ob-gyns have reported that pharmacies are refusing to fill prescriptions to treat miscarriages and a New England Journal of Medicine article published June 22 found that the Texas law has led to some hospitals denying patients care and others with pregnancy complications being forced to wait until their conditions become life-threatening. This reality, the doctors say, compounds an already horrific problem: the states set to ban abortion currently have some of the highest maternal-mortality rates in the country.  Read More: Meet the Pharmacist Expanding Access to Abortion Pills Across the U.S. Meanwhile, as women travel to liberal states for abortions and other reproductive health care, they’re driving up wait times and straining already stretched infrastructure, according to Yamelsie Rodriguez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Fairview Heights, Ill., just across the border from Missouri, has already seen a 130% increase in patients. The week before the ruling, it was looking into whether it can keep its doors open seven days a week to meet Illinois’ expected 8,600% increase in out-of-state patients.  Anti-abortion advocates are planning to start their post-Roe advocacy with “prayerful” rallies in state capitals around the country, according to Students for Life. But the movement is also gearing up to capitalize on its victory. Advocates are planning to encourage new legislation, and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America is investing in its program aimed at connecting pregnant women with medical, social, and material resources through anti-abortion pregnancy centers and other nonprofits, though Republican politicians have not embraced legislation that Democrats and reproductive-rights advocates say would help support families. Organizations on both sides of the debate are bracing for what comes next, including a potential increase in violence as the country reacts to the Supreme Court decision.  Activists have been prepared for an outcome of this kind for nearly a half-century. But for most people, the Dobbs decision comes as a shock—undermining once-immutable legal precedent, upending politics just months before a mid-term, and running starkly counter to public opinion. A majority of Americans believe the court should have left Roe intact. For the many millions of Americans who are just now grappling with the implications of the court’s decision, the reality will be harsh. It took half a century for the anti-abortion advocates to reach this point and nearly twice as long for Black people to get a Civil Rights Act following the Jim Crow era. This is not a temporary state of affairs, but rather the beginning of a new set of battles. We are neither back in 1972 nor the post-Roe generation; we are Dobbs generation now.  —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Simmone Shah/New York Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6190995/abortion-future-after-roe/
What to Know About Abortion Funds and How They Help Patients Get Care,Eliana Dockterman;What are abortion funds?;Who supports abortion funds?;What exactly do abortion funds pay for?,U.S.;abortion,"June 24, 2022 5:23 PM EDT","On Friday, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and, in doing so, eliminated federal abortion protections that existed for nearly 50 years. Roe prohibited states from outlawing abortion before viability, around 24 weeks into pregnancy, and after that time in cases when the pregnant person’s life or health was in danger. In the wake of the decision, reproductive-justice advocates have called for people to donate to abortion funds, on-the-ground organizations that help arrange and pay for abortion care for patients who need financial support. Some 26 states are poised to outlaw abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and 13 of those states have “trigger laws” in place that were designed to automatically outlaw abortion as soon as Roe was struck down. Such restrictions will force those seeking an abortion to travel across state lines in order to receive care. Read More: The Fight Over Abortion Has Only Just Begun “If you are feeling outraged or devastated this morning by the end of Roe, you don’t have to turn to hopelessness. You can be a part of the solution,” Lauren Rankin, author of Bodies on the Line: At the Frontlines of the Fight to Protect Abortion in America, wrote on Twitter. “Think small. Think local. Think human. Donate to @AbortionFunds. Volunteer as a clinic escort. Turn to experts. You’re not alone.” Former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner also encouraged her followers on Twitter to “donate to an abortion fund” rather than donating to any political candidate to provide the most immediate help for pregnant people in need. Jon Favreau, a speechwriter for President Obama, joined the chorus of advocates who pushed followers to act on their rage and donate to abortion funds, as well as clinics and a legal defense fund. Here’s everything you need to know about how abortion funds work. Abortion funds provide support to pregnant people seeking an abortion. An abortion can cost up to $750 in the first trimester, and up to $1,500 later in pregnancy, according to Planned Parenthood. And some states have restricted Medicaid, private plans, and Affordable Care Act marketplace plans from covering abortion. Read More: What the Supreme Court’s Abortion Decision Means for Your State Such funds have been a crucial tool for abortion-rights advocates in the last several years. As Republican lawmakers have enacted local laws to restrict abortion in their states, abortion has become effectively inaccessible to millions of patients, particularly BIPOC people, low-income people, and those living in rural areas. A near-total abortion ban in Texas, for instance, placed 7 million women of reproductive age at least 247 miles away from accessible abortion care. (That’s 14 times the distance they would have had to travel before the ban went into effect.) Abortion funds pay for the health care and/or travel expenses some patients may not be able to afford. Most abortion funds are supported by individual donations. And a flood of new donations has come in the last several weeks. The National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF)—which, as of October 2020, included 92 abortion funds—told Good Morning America that it received more than $1.5 million in donations in the three days after Politico published a leaked draft of the Dobbs decision on May 2. So many people tried to donate that their website crashed. On June 24, when the Supreme Court handed down its decision, their site abortionfunds.org appeared to have again crashed. The donation surge is much-needed, according to advocates. The NNAF says that most abortion funds can only accommodate somewhere between one-quarter and one-third of callers who ask for their assistance in paying for an abortion and its associated costs like travel and childcare (which can be critical because most women who seek abortions are already mothers). Read More: What Abortion Providers in Anti-Abortion States Will Do Post-Roe A representative for Fund Texas Choice, which covers Texans’ travel costs to out-of-state abortion clinics, told CBS in May, before Roe was repealed, that the organization already was fielding more than 300 calls a month. It had the resources to support only 130 patients, each of whom required $750 to $1,000 in support. They expected even more calls after Roe was struck down. Abortion-rights advocates noted that travel costs have recently been exacerbated by high gas prices. Each fund works differently. Some completely or partially cover the costs that are strictly related to the procedure itself, like pills for medical abortions—which make up more than half of all abortions in the United States—or an in-office procedure. When those seeking abortions are delayed in their plans by clinic capacity, legal restrictions, and the need to gather money for the procedure, they are often pushed later into pregnancy, and termination becomes more expensive the later a pregnant person waits. Other funds help pay for out-of-pocket costs associated with traveling out of state for an abortion, like transportation, gas, lodging, and food. They also can provide other services like translation, coordinating and paying for childcare, and giving emotional support. Many abortion funds are more specific in their focus, whether that focus is geographic (like the Midwest Access Coalition), cultural (like Indigenous Women Rising), or logistical (like the Brigid Alliance, which helps pay for those patients who have to travel long distances to receive abortions later in pregnancy). Read More: What to Know About Abortion Pills Post-Roe How, exactly, a fund connects with and approves patients seeking care for financial assistance depends on their specific policies. Certain local funds will provide finances directly to women who contact the organization, while funds like the Women’s Reproductive Rights Assistance Project, ask clinics and providers to bill them directly. Changes in state laws may impact these individual funds. The Texas Equal Access Fund announced Friday that they are pausing funding: “Due to the uncertainty and risk of what the decision could bring, we are pausing funding today until we have had a chance to understand the decision once it is released,” the organization tweeted. They pointed potential patients toward the website Ineedana.com, a national clinic directory. “We are furious,” tweeted the Jane Fund, a Massachusetts-based abortion fund. But the organization assured followers that they and other abortion funds “will continue to do what we do best—fund abortions.” Write to Eliana Dockterman at eliana.dockterman@time.com",https://time.com/6190996/how-abortion-funds-work/
What Abortion Safe Haven States Can Do,Simmone Shah;Which states are abortion ‘safe havens’?;What abortion safe haven states can—and can’t do.;What could happen next,Politics,"June 27, 2022 4:45 PM EDT","The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade on June 24th triggered immediate bans on abortion in several states, which had put in place laws primed to shutter abortion clinics within their borders in anticipation of the ruling.  The new law of the land, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, gives each state the power to deny access to abortion services. An estimated 36 million people were immediately affected, as the so-called “trigger laws” took effect (though a Louisiana judge on Monday put that state’s ban on hold). Other states, however, are expanding access.    At least 16 states and Washington D.C. plan to continue to protect abortion rights on the state level. Several of those states–California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington-have been strengthening abortion protections to help meet a rise in demand by individuals who might travel from out-of-state for care.  State legislatures have the power to bolster abortion access in several ways–directing more funding towards abortion clinics; requiring health insurance plans to cover procedures; or expanding the type of medical professionals who are allowed to provide abortion..  For example, Oregon lawmakers this year allocated $15 million dollars through the Oregon Reproductive Equity Fund to help pay the travel expenses for people coming from states with strict abortion laws. California and Maryland both recently passed laws to ensure that abortion costs will be covered by insurance providers. Four states have expanded the pool of medical professionals who can provide abortion, allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to administer abortions. But while states are working to cover costs and expand access, there is still little legal protection in place for those who cross state lines for an abortion. Connecticut lawmakers passed a bill earlier this year that protects individuals and providers who travel for abortions from being charged under other states more restrictive laws–by modifying the state’s extradition statutes and and preventing an out-of-state patient’s medical records from being disclosed.   Texas’s abortion ban provides a look at what’s to come for safe haven states. In the four months after Texas banned almost all abortions after six weeks, Planned Parenthood said its clinics in neighboring states saw a nearly 800% increase in abortion patients. Though politicians in a state might promise continued abortion access for all who seek it, providing it will depend on the capacity of the abortion centers, which will need more funding and medical professionals to keep up with the rise in demand. There’s also the question of whether states with abortion bans will move to punish traveling across state lines to receive an abortion. Missouri proposed a law that would that would allow individuals to sue anyone who helps help a patient cross state lines for an abortion, though the law was later blocked.

What to Know About the Texas Woman Who Sued the State to Get an Abortion,Solcyré Burga;Simmone Shah;More From TIME;What is the case about? ;Stakes of the case  ,U.S.;abortion,"December 12, 2023 10:33 AM EST","The Texas Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that would have allowed a woman to receive an emergency abortion under the state’s “medical emergency” exception.  Shortly before the ruling was delivered, the woman’s attorneys shared that she had left the state to get the procedure after the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the ruling on Friday. On Thursday, a Travis County judge ruled in favor of Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two who filed a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction on Dec. 5, asking the court to allow her to terminate her pregnancy at 20 weeks because she received a diagnosis of a fatal fetal condition. Dr. Damla Karsan, a board certified OB/GYN who would perform the abortion on Cox, is the second plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with Cox’s spouse, Justin Cox. But one day later, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court ruling, and on Dec. 11 it overturned the decision.  Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S., prohibiting abortion beginning at six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. The law only allows for the procedure if the person is facing a life-threatening condition, which the Supreme Court claimed Cox’s doctor was unable to prove. In the seven-page ruling the Supreme Court said that Dr. Karsan, “asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.”  “This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, the organization representing Cox’s case, when sharing Cox’s decision to leave the state for care. “Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer. This is why judges and politicians should not be making healthcare decisions for pregnant people—they are not doctors.” “Kate’s case has shown the world that abortion bans are dangerous for pregnant people, and exceptions don’t work,” Northup said. “While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.”   The case is the first of its kind in 50 years, and heralds a burdensome new legal strategy for pregnant people navigating the complex legal landscape of abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. ""We are talking about urgent medical care. Kate is already 20 weeks pregnant. This is why people should not need to beg for healthcare in a court of law,” Molly Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a news release following the state supreme court's stay Following Thursday’s ruling, the state’s attorney general threatened to prosecute anyone who aids in providing the abortion. In a letter to three hospitals where Dr. Karsan has admitting privileges, Paxton warned that Thursday’s ruling “will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability”.  “The court is being invited into this agonizing decision-making that this woman is having in choosing between the health of her life and the future of her living children,” says ​​Missy Owen, co-chair of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers’ Criminalization of Reproductive Health Taskforce. “She is opening the doors for the court, saying, ‘I do not want to be committing a crime, but the situation in front of me is impossible.’” In Cox v. Texas, the plaintiffs asked the court to allow Karsan to perform an abortion on Cox because her fetus has Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome. The condition causes abnormalities—Cox’s baby, the lawsuit says, has a “spine abnormality,” umbilical hernia, clubbed foot, and other conditions. Cox’s physicians have recommended an abortion. Children with Trisomy 18 have a greater risk for miscarriage or stillbirth and research shows that only 1 in 2 babies who are carried to term will be born alive. Most only survive for a few days, and only about 90-95% of babies do not live beyond the first year, the Minnesota Department of Health reports. According to the case filing, Cox is currently 20 weeks pregnant and has been to three different emergency rooms because of “severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks.” Cox is also at higher risk for complications because she previously had two Cesareans, has elevated glucose levels, and other underlying health conditions. Cox filed the case to ask that the court clarify its abortion regulations. The case filing says that Cox could not wait for the Texas Supreme Court to release its decision on a separate lawsuit, Zurawski v. Texas. That case, filed in March, asks the court to clarify under which medical exemptions OB/GYNs could perform abortions. A Travis county judge previously ruled that patients who have medical issues that could threaten their life, or have a lethal fetal diagnosis, should be exempt from existing abortion regulations. But Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton appealed that ruling. The stakes go beyond Cox and her family. Cox’s case could encourage women in other states with abortion bans to file similar suits seeking both to obtain an abortion and to clarify exceptions to Texas’ abortion restrictions. “It would show them that it might be possible for them to get an abortion,” says University of Virginia School of Law professor Naomi Cahn. Barriers remain for many women to employ a similar strategy. Finding legal representation can be costly and difficult. There also can be an emotional and physical toll to seeking an abortion through the judicial system: “The notion that anyone would have to publicly advocate to a court their personal circumstances to be able to get justification feels like a violation,” says Owen. “That she (Cox) would have to file on a docket in a courthouse where anybody can read the complaint and it can be plastered all over every publication in America…that’s an enormous sacrifice.” Duane, during a press call Thursday, said this process is not a “reasonable or rational way to practice medicine in this country.”  “This is not some new precedent we're setting that every patient has to come to court to get an abortion,” she said. “But I want to be clear that that's what the attorney general of Texas wants.” Nicolas Kabat, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the case, says this has been difficult for Cox. “Imagine that you are grieving the loss of a very desired pregnancy. Kate wants to carry. She has two children, and she wanted to have a third,” says Kabat. “So she's grieving a loss of a pregnancy and at the same time, she's being told by her doctors that she needs to end this pregnancy now in order to be able to have kids in the future.” There’s added time pressure on cases like these as the pregnancy progresses. “The consequence of the state's strategy here is that in the middle of a time-sensitive and devastating pregnancy crisis, a woman like Kate may have to be forced out of state,” Kabat says. “This is a situation where she's not only facing potential loss for fertility, but life threatening risks. And the state cannot force a woman to take on those risks just because the state is opposed to abortion.” Correction, Dec. 7  The original version of this story misspelled the name of a Center for Reproductive Rights attorney.

Inside Mississippi’s Last Abortion Clinic—and the Biggest Fight for Abortion Rights in a Generation,Abigail Abrams;Stacy Kranitz,U.S.;abortion,"November 11, 2021 7:00 AM EST","Shannon Brewer’s eyes dart to a grid of grainy images on a wide, black screen above her desk at the Jackson Women’s Health Organization (JWHO). Live footage shows a large truck creeping into the clinic’s parking lot, its side emblazoned with a pair of blue, ghostly baby feet and the words Where are our children? Brewer doesn’t recognize the driver. Her spine stiffens. As the director and de facto head of security at the last abortion clinic in the state of Mississippi, Brewer is not easily spooked. In her two decades there, she has seen bomb scares and stalking incidents, and protesters getting in fights with her staff. She keeps the number of an FBI contact amid a sea of sticky notes beside her desk. But this year, she says, everything feels more intense. More dangerous. More consequential. Her clinic, known as the Pink House for its bubble-gum-colored exterior walls, is at the epicenter of the fight over abortion access, in Mississippi and the country. On Dec. 1, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, about a Mississippi state law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the court allows the law to remain in effect, the decision will effectively hollow out Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability. “This is not gonna just affect Mississippi,” Brewer says. “It’s gonna affect women everywhere.” Five years ago, this moment was unthinkable. Even the Supreme Court’s decision to take up a case that directly challenges Roe would have been considered outlandish, legal scholars say. But the landscape has shifted rapidly. Over the past year, GOP-controlled state legislatures have passed a record-breaking 106 abortion restrictions, including a Texas statute that bans nearly all abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Conservative state and federal judges have allowed some of those laws to stand, while President Trump’s appointment of three Justices—Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett—has put Roe at risk. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization will come before the most conservative bench in decades. Anti-abortion activists are energized. In a normal year, the Pink House has its share of regular protesters, but ahead of the December hearing, “abortion tourists,” as the clinic volunteers call them, have begun showing up on the sidewalk every day. Melissa Fowler, chief program officer at the National Abortion Federation, which tracks threats to abortion clinics, says she’s heard from members “who report an escalation in anti-abortion rhetoric, criminal activities and the intensity of activities” since last year. Brewer herself has become a lightning rod. “She thinks she’s doing a good thing,” says Barbara Beavers, who was trying to discourage patients from entering the Pink House in October. “But she’s killing babies.” Coleman Boyd, a local physician who regularly protests outside the clinic with his wife and children, also calls out Brewer by name. She and her staff, he says, “have a heart to kill.” It’s in this context that Brewer, one eye still trained on the security footage, walks out the clinic’s front door and strides over to the unfamiliar truck, idling a few yards from the building. She exchanges words with the driver, then rolls her eyes and flashes a nod of assurance to her staff. The truck is part of a national anti-abortion group’s protest that evening. Nothing to worry about. Back at her desk, in front of a sign reading Queen Warrior, Brewer considers the enormity of her role in the moment—the last director of her state’s last abortion clinic, just weeks before the most momentous high-court hearing on abortion in a generation. “I’m going to appreciate the time that we have,” she says. “Once we go to court, every day that we are open and see patients and get to talk to them—it’s like we don’t know if this is the last time.” Abortion wasn’t always such a partisan subject in America. Nearly a half-century ago, when the Supreme Court decided Roe, the ruling wasn’t as polarizing as it is now, says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and an expert on the legal history of abortion. Republicans kept the issue at arm’s length, wary of anti-abortion activists who they saw as “wild children,” she says; Democrats rarely discussed it at all.  That began to change in the 1980s, Ziegler explains, when a cadre of GOP strategists seized on abortion as a way to animate the religious right and win over voters who might otherwise lean left. These activists began to test the limits of Roe, working closely with state lawmakers to pass new abortion restrictions, such as mandated waiting periods or minimum measurements for clinics’ rooms and corridors. That legal strategy was supercharged by a 1992 Supreme Court decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the Justices ruled that states could restrict abortion so long as they did not impose an “undue burden” on patients. In the three decades since, the number of laws restricting abortion multiplied. Abortion opponents framed many of these new rules as protections for women’s health, but doctors often -described them as medically unnecessary. “It’s simply that the enforcement of these regulations would make it hard to keep clinics open,” says Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute, a research center that supports abortion rights. The plan worked. In 1992, there were 2,380 abortion providers in the U.S., according to Guttmacher. In 2017, the most recent year for which statistics are available, there were 1,587. Mississippi has been the tip of the spear in this strategy. In the ’90s and 2000s, state lawmakers passed more than two dozen restrictions on abortion, each of which came with new costs, paperwork, or staffing rules that pushed abortion clinics out of business. By 2004, JWHO was the only clinic in the state left standing. Brewer says it’s still struggling to stay afloat. “There are so many hurdles,” she says. For the patients at the Jackson clinic, navigating all of these hurdles is becoming increasingly impossible. They must take time off work, scrape together money for the procedure, which cannot be covered by Medicaid or Affordable Care Act marketplace plans in most cases in Mississippi, find money to travel to the clinic or to one out of state, pay for a hotel and potentially for childcare. A 21-year-old at the clinic on a Friday in October had driven six hours from Louisiana because she wanted the first appointment she could find. She already has two kids—a one-year-old and a three-month-old—and knew she needed to get an abortion as soon as possible because she couldn’t handle a third on her own. Brewer knows this struggle firsthand. She was first hired at the Pink House in 2001 as a sterilization technician. Back then, she says, she was not attuned to the national politics of abortion. Her outlook was guided by her own experience growing up in a poor family outside Jackson, where she received no sex education in school and no one ever talked about abortion. In her mid-20s, she tried to get an abortion, but was too far along, and had a baby when she didn’t feel prepared to do so. Brewer now has six kids she loves. When she talks about “reproductive justice,” she describes it as letting people decide if, when and how they choose to have a family.  In 2010, when Brewer was promoted to clinic director, the national politics of abortion found her. Brewer credits Diane Derzis, majority owner of the Pink House, for helping to guide her. “She taught me how to speak up and how to fight,” Brewer says. “In the South, we’re limited on who’s speaking out. This is not the time to be quiet.” Derzis, who became an outspoken advocate after getting an abortion in 1975, eventually bought clinics in four Southern states. (In addition to the Pink House, she now owns two more clinics, in Virginia and Georgia.) She has been on the front lines of the battle for decades. In 1993, an anti-abortion activist in Florida killed a doctor whom Derzis had known for years. Five years later, her Birmingham, Ala., clinic was bombed, killing a guard and permanently maiming a nurse. In 2012, a new Mississippi law nearly forced the Pink House to close, but a federal court blocked it the day it was set to take effect, setting off a legal battle that lasted until 2017. So for Derzis, this strange moment—in which her clinic is the plaintiff in a Supreme Court case that could result in overturning Roe—doesn’t feel strange at all. It feels inevitable. From her vantage, the anti-abortion movement’s long-term objective was always to capture politics at every level, from local city councils to state legislatures to Congress and the presidency, in order to reshape the court and relitigate Roe. Under Trump, who campaigned on the promise to appoint judges who would overturn Roe, Republican state legislators turned to passing a raft of laws designed to get the justices to finish the job. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, recognized the work that state lawmakers have done in passing anti-abortion bills to get the Mississippi case before the Supreme Court. “This is a landmark opportunity” for the anti-abortion movement, she said last spring. “This has been a campaign they have waged over 45 years,” Derzis says. With Trump, “they got their Supreme Court Justices.” It was game time. Over nearly 50 years, the Supreme Court has heard more than two dozen cases touching on abortion. (Earlier this month, it considered an enforcement mechanism embedded in the Texas abortion law.) But the Mississippi case that will come before the court on Dec. 1 is different by an order of magnitude. This one is not “biting around the edges” of abortion access, says Ziegler. It’s “going for the jugular.” Mississippi has explicitly asked the court to overturn Roe. It is, of course, impossible to predict how the court will rule. With six conservatives on the bench, a majority could well choose to overturn the nearly 50-year-old precedent. Such a decision would be audacious, but not unheard of. The court has reversed precedent dozens of times in the nation’s history. If it happens again, the fallout for people seeking abortions would be immediate. Twelve states, including Mississippi, have what are known as “trigger laws” that ban nearly all abortions immediately or shortly following such a court decision. Another nine states have already written strict restrictions that they could move quickly to implement. But legal scholars say it’s much more likely that the court would rule in a way that stops short of technically overturning Roe—while weakening the constitutional right to abortion so substantially that it’s largely hollow. For example, the Justices could hold that the “viability standard”—the idea, embedded in Roe, that states cannot restrict abortion before a fetus can survive outside the womb—is no longer central to the precedent. Such a decision, while formally leaving Roe in place, would render it nearly unrecognizable. If the court allows states to ban abortion before viability, there are dozens of other abortion restrictions currently blocked or being challenged in lower courts that could be reconsidered too. The Supreme Court could also decide that Mississippi’s law is constitutional because it allows people to access abortion prior to 15 weeks, and therefore does not present an “undue burden,” as defined by Casey. A decision like that would undermine the viability standard and redefine the court’s previous definition of “undue burden.” Whatever the court decides, legal experts say the justices may be likely to remand the case back to lower courts, asking federal judges to reconsider the law under a newly modified interpretation of Roe. Abortion-rights advocates say any ruling that does not explicitly find the Mississippi law unconstitutional amounts to a distinction without a difference. “The law has been absolutely clear for 50 years that bans on abortion before viability are unconstitutional,” says Julie Rikelman, the litigation director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, who will represent JWHO before the Supreme Court. And any decision that creates more legal uncertainty is bad for abortion access, as it leaves clinics—most of which are already operating on a shoestring—to fight costly legal battles or temporarily shut down while judges deliberate.  In recent weeks, as the Supreme Court hearing has drawn nearer, Brewer and Derzis have huddled to discuss contingency plans. Although only 10 to 15 of the roughly 300 patients at JWHO each month request an abortion after the 15-week mark, Brewer says that if the high court allows this law to stand, she fears what laws Mississippi will pass next. In the meantime, Brewer is focused on the fight. The day after we spoke was a Saturday, but she planned to be at the clinic bright and early—as she always is. She’s doing it for the next generation, she says, in hopes they take up the mantle for the ones who come next. “That’s kind of how it goes,” she says, turning her eyes briefly away from the security screen. “You have to have people to continue to fight.” —With reporting by Mariah Espada/Washington and Leslie Dickstein/New York Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6116072/mississippi-abortion-supreme-court-jackson-womens-health/
Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers Are Collecting Troves of Data That Could Be Weaponized Against Women,Abigail Abrams;Vera Bergengruen,Politics,"June 22, 2022 12:02 PM EDT","The first alarm bell went off in Ashley’s head when no one at the Prestonwood Pregnancy Center was wearing a mask. No one was in scrubs, no one’s hair was tied up, and every staffer was wearing a visible cross. “I should have noticed all the red flags,” says Ashley, 28, whom TIME is identifying by her first name to protect her privacy. But it wasn’t until she sat down for a mandated counseling session in the brick building in a Dallas suburb that she realized what kind of a facility it was. Ashley had Googled where she could confirm a positive pregnancy test and get an abortion. One of the first results had been a website called Choices Dallas offering “pre-screening abortion consultations.” That had led her to Prestonwood, one of more than 2,500 anti-abortion centers, sometimes known as “crisis pregnancy centers,” that have exploded across the U.S. in the past two decades, fueled by an increasingly powerful anti-abortion movement. This sprawling network of unregulated, faith-based nonprofits now outnumbers abortion clinics 3 to 1. Many of the millions of women who visit these pregnancy centers stumble into them by accident, as Ashley did. The centers often present themselves as medical facilities and mirror abortion clinics’ logos, using names like Your Choice and Women’s Health Clinic. Prestonwood’s—a P at the center of three concentric circles—looks very similar, for instance, to that of Planned Parenthood. Pregnancy centers’ billboards—Pregnant? Scared? Need help?—blanket highways, and their well-funded parent organizations offer trainings in Google Ads, search-engine optimization, and social marketing to ensure they appear atop search results. Their goal is to dissuade women from having abortions by promoting parenting and adoption, and offering baby supplies and counseling. But researchers and doctors have found they also provide misinformation about abortion. More than half a dozen women who sought care at such centers told TIME that staff used a variety of scare tactics, including gory videos. Ashley had gone to Prestonwood in hopes of getting an ultrasound and information about abortion. She has a medical condition that puts her at high risk of an ectopic pregnancy, in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus. An egg cannot survive the condition, which can also threaten the life of the pregnant person. But Ashley says the Prestonwood counselor told her, falsely, that she could carry an ectopic pregnancy to term if she was “careful,” and urged her to delay a decision to terminate the pregnancy. “I said, ‘OK, so you want me to wait until it becomes illegal for me to get an abortion?’” Ashley recalls, referring to a recent Texas law that bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. After leaving the center, Ashley broke down in tears in her car. A Prestonwood spokesperson told TIME that it “abides by all relevant laws and regulations,” respects client privacy, and prioritizes “the health of both mother and child.” Ashley was later able to see a doctor and terminate her pregnancy within the time period that Texas law still allows. But her visit to Prestonwood haunted her. In her interactions with the center, both over the phone and in person, she had unknowingly provided a ream of personal information to a religious anti-abortion group. She began to wonder what they would do with that data. “They scanned my ID. They know where I live, they know my name, they have my f-cking license number. It felt like a completely different violation.” Her concerns are not unfounded. While privacy worries about location data and health apps have dominated recent headlines about sensitive abortion data, the troves of personal information that pregnancy centers collect and store arguably pose a much more immediate privacy risk, legal and privacy experts tell TIME. Pregnancy centers, many of which are affiliated with national anti-abortion advocacy groups, including Care Net and Heartbeat International, collect personal data from the millions of women they interact with every year in person, by telephone, and through online chats. This data includes sexual and reproductive histories, test results, ultrasound photos, and information shared during consultations, parenting classes, or counseling sessions, which some pregnancy centers require before they provide aid, like diapers. Because most centers are not licensed medical clinics and offer services for free, privacy lawyers tell TIME that they are not legally bound by federal health data privacy laws. With the Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, these largely unregulated databases could be exploited in the wake of conservative efforts to criminalize abortion. Lawmakers in three states have already passed laws allowing private citizens to sue abortion providers, or in two states, anyone who aids in an abortion; other proposed bills target the pregnant woman herself. Pregnancy centers’ databases could be used as evidence in both launching and pursuing such legal actions. Because pregnancy centers often focus on outreach to women of color in urban areas, according to their own strategy reports, their clients are already disproportionately more likely to be surveilled and scrutinized by law enforcement. “We anticipate that we will see a dramatic increase in the criminalization of pregnant people for self-managed abortion and pregnancy outcomes,” says Kim Clark, a lawyer at Legal Voice, a women’s-rights nonprofit in Seattle. “Pregnancy centers are just perfectly positioned to facilitate those investigations.” The national anti-abortion organizations that run the largest networks of pregnancy centers say they protect their clients’ privacy. “That data is secure,” Heartbeat International spokeswoman Andrea Trudden tells TIME. “Any information that we publish and pull is just numbers, so we’re not looking at any of that [personal] information.” But some abortion-rights advocates point to conflicts of interest: Heartbeat, which runs the largest network of pregnancy centers in the U.S. with 1,800 affiliates, has also cheered Texas’ six-week abortion ban that is enforced by private lawsuits, and urged the Supreme Court to overturn Roe, which would allow state bans, some of which criminalize abortion, to go into effect. From law enforcement to human rights, one of the lessons of the past few decades is that privacy violations follow the creation of unregulated troves of data. Now, with the rollback of abortion rights on the horizon, the cache of data on pregnant women represents arguably the most intrusive front yet. “It’s just nuts,” says Mary Jo Daley, a Democratic state representative in Pennsylvania, who introduced a bill directed at pregnancy centers. “They’re collecting all this information, and you don’t know how they’re gonna use it because they’re not health care providers. And women don’t know that. It’s frightening.” Small, locally operated pregnancy centers first cropped up in the 1960s, as mostly Catholic groups looked to prevent abortion by offering mothers counseling and social-service referrals. After the Supreme Court established a constitutional right to abortion in 1973, larger groups, including evangelical activists, joined the so-called “pregnancy help movement,” according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion think tank associated with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. As the movement grew larger, advocates began organizing independent pregnancy centers into networks, featuring annual conferences, training sessions, and digital and legislative strategies. What had once been mom-and-pop storefronts became the scaffolding of the national anti-abortion movement. Pregnancy centers “go out of their way to perpetuate that idea that they’re just volunteers trying to help at a storefront on the corner,” says Megan Peterson, the executive director at the legal nonprofit Gender Justice. “There’s a whole machine behind them.” By the late ’90s, conservative state lawmakers were channeling government funds to pregnancy centers to launch programs promoting sexual risk avoidance and alternatives to abortion. Close to 20% of pregnancy centers nationwide now receive public funding. Twelve states funnel up to $8 million in taxpayer money every year to pregnancy centers, according to a 2021 report from Equity Forward, a reproductive-rights research firm; Texas provides much more than that: $50 million a year. At least 33 states and the District of Columbia raise money for these centers by selling specialty choose life license plates, and at least 10 states have diverted funds to pregnancy centers from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which gives states block grants meant to help vulnerable families meet basic needs, including food, rent, and child care. As pregnancy centers spread nationally, many rebranded themselves as medical clinics, borrowing the language and imagery of women’s clinics—photos of people in white coats and exam tables—in their promotional materials. Today, the vast majority of centers do not provide even basic women’s health care, like Pap smears, and many oppose the use of birth control. But 77% offer non-diagnostic ultrasounds, which do not provide any information about the health of an embryo, according to research by Andrea Swartzendruber, an associate professor at the University of Georgia College of Public Health. This decision to “go medical” was part of a national strategy to draw in more women explicitly considering abortion, according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute. But the shift also compounded confusion over what the centers do. “Our data show that many people who go to crisis pregnancy centers have misconceptions about what the centers are,” says Swartzendruber, who surveyed people who visited Georgia pregnancy centers. Many were “expecting an abortion facility or a medical facility.” The ambiguity has been aided by internet search results. In the 13 states that are set to ban abortion quickly if Roe is overturned, nearly 40% of Google Maps searches for “abortion clinic near me” and “abortion pill” led to pregnancy centers, according to the misinformation research nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate. The top two search results for “abortion in Dallas” lead to pregnancy-center organizations, including Choices Dallas, the website that Ashley used. In the past decade, pregnancy centers again shifted their strategy, this time focusing on the power of data. In 2017, Heartbeat International rolled out a new data-collection system for its pregnancy centers. “Big data is revolutionizing all sorts of industries,” its marketing materials trumpeted. “The data your organization collects needs to work not just for you, but for the rest of the pregnancy help movement.” Major pregnancy-center networks now use data-collection interfaces to track women who interact with their organization in person, on the phone, or online. Calling Heartbeat International’s 24-hour hotline, which the organization says fields some 1,100 calls a day, or using its online chatbot both require that a visitor provide her name, location, demographic information, and what she plans to do with her pregnancy. These data-collection systems allow pregnancy centers to create “digital dossiers” of women, according to a 2020 report by U.K.-based civil rights group Privacy International, which warned that while these technologies “collect and centralise vast amount of people’s private information,” it’s unclear who the data is shared with. “You don’t need to physically go to a crisis pregnancy center anymore for them to harvest your data,” says Tara Murtha of Women’s Law Project, a legal-advocacy group. “They have it the moment you seek help on their website [or] use the chat app.” During in-person consultations and counseling sessions, pregnancy-center staff use the same data systems, which often feature drop-down menus or color-coded systems to categorize how likely a client is to get an abortion. Perhaps most worrisome to abortion rights advocates is the trend among pregnancy centers to reach out to women who have already had abortions, often by offering post-abortion counseling. Heartbeat International also runs an “abortion-pill reversal” hotline directed at women who have started medical abortions. While the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there’s no scientific evidence suggesting that abortion-pill reversal works, the women who call the hotline asking about it are still asked to provide personal data. If abortion is illegal, that interaction carries potential legal implications, says Murtha. “You’re on record,” she says, “as having been pregnant and attempted an abortion.” Unlike data gathered at real medical clinics, client information collected by pregnancy centers is mostly unregulated by federal law. The centers are not generally subject to federal privacy laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which governs health care settings. State privacy laws vary widely, but only a few states require pregnancy centers offering medical services to be licensed, according to a 2020 report from the Charlotte Lozier Institute. In reviewing more than two dozen pregnancy-center privacy disclosures, TIME found that many reference HIPAA and assure broad data privacy. But most of the time, such promises are legally toothless since HIPAA does not apply, says Shannon Hartsfield, a lawyer at Holland & Knight who focuses on corporate compliance and data privacy. “They may say, ‘Oh, we keep everything confidential,’” she says, “but it’s going to be hard to know for sure without legal standards.” The fine print on pregnancy-center forms and websites is also expansive. According to the terms of use on Heartbeat International’s data management system, the organization can share any and all client information with any “affiliates, partners, vendors, or contract organizations, or as legally necessary.” Antiabortion leaders, as well as staff at local pregnancy centers, tell TIME that they have no intention of breaching their clients’ privacy. In May, after Louisiana lawmakers advanced a bill classifying abortion as homicide and allowing pregnant women to be charged, a coalition of anti-abortion groups published an open letter urging state legislators to stop. “The mainstream pro-life movement absolutely opposes prosecuting women, and that extends to pregnancy centers,” National Right to Life Committee spokesperson Laura Echevarria tells TIME. The sponsor of the Louisiana bill later pulled it in the face of public opposition. Echevarria and others say pregnancy centers are a crucial part of the future of maternal care. A Heartbeat International survey showed that 41% of centers in Texas and surrounding states have seen an uptick in clients since Texas’ abortion ban took effect in September. Heartbeat spokeswoman Trudden says the organization’s primary concern is the recent increase in vandalism and threats to its centers, not data security. Even as abortion clinics have moved to paper forms and encrypted apps to protect clients’ information, Trudden says their centers are not making changes: “We have not received increased concerns by pregnancy-help organizations regarding their data security.” Echevarria adds that pregnancy centers have a “vested interest” in fighting law-enforcement requests to access their databases. “It would completely undermine and destroy the mission of pregnancy centers,” she says, “to have to give that information to anybody, to any court of law.” But the legal landscape is changing rapidly. Texas’ six-week abortion ban offers a $10,000 reward to anyone who wins a civil case against either an abortion provider or someone who aided in an abortion. Oklahoma also offers $10,000 in its sweeping abortion ban, which went into effect in May. A similar law in Idaho is only blocked in court because Roe is still standing. On June 15, National Right to Life released a model bill that would ban nearly all abortions, allow local officials and some private citizens to sue violators, and make punitive damages payable to nonprofits, including pregnancy centers. In cases filed under these laws, lawyers could subpoena information from pregnancy centers, legal experts say. While most states don’t currently allow pregnant women to be punished for violating abortion restrictions, there’s a precedent for using such data to arrest or threaten legal action against women. There have been more than 1,700 instances since 1973 in which law enforcement arrested or took legal action against women in cases related to their pregnancies, according to the National Advocates for Pregnant Women; in some of the more recent cases, internet search histories and information gathered by medical professionals were presented as evidence. Last summer, the National Association of Defense Lawyers warned of an impending legal storm: if Roe is overturned, state anti-abortion laws “will open the door to mass criminalization on an unprecedented scale.” By offering a substantial monetary reward, the Texas, Oklahoma, and Idaho laws, and the National Right to Life model bill, potentially create a powerful motivation for anyone who has access to pregnancy-center databases. “The data,” says Peterson of Gender Justice, “literally has a price tag on it.” That includes pregnancy-center staff, partners, vendors, and contract organizations, the staff of which are presumably involved in this advocacy work because they believe that having an abortion is tantamount to murder. A front-desk attendant and spiritual counselor at Brazos Pregnancy Center in Texas who declined to give her name told TIME that while the center’s goal was to protect “the client and their baby,” she personally is “in the middle” on whether a woman should face criminal charges for having an abortion. The Opelousas Pregnancy Center in Louisiana goes further: its policies promise to treat clients “with kindness, compassion and in a caring manner,” while also asserting, “Abortion by any means for any reason is unjustified…and an act of murder.” Pregnancy centers’ increasingly close ties to state governments present yet another concern, multiple legal and privacy experts tell TIME. Last year, Arkansas passed a law requiring women seeking an abortion to call an abortion-alternatives hotline, which in many cases would direct them to a pregnancy center. The same law requires that such callers be given a unique identifying number, which would then be registered in a state database. Five other states are considering similar legislation. Arkansas state representative Jim Dotson, who authored the bill, told TIME that he opposes efforts to criminalize pregnant women and said the data gathered would be secure. But privacy experts say current law cannot ensure that. In May, Daley, the Pennsylvania Democrat, introduced a bill barring the 156 pregnancy centers in the state from sharing women’s health data without their consent. They get state money, Daley tells TIME, “but they are not transparent, they’re not accountable.” Meanwhile, Ashley, the woman who visited the pregnancy center near Dallas, says that she’s not sure where her data is stored or who has access to it, and she can’t help but feel that someone is looking over her shoulder. “I was within the legal bounds [to have an abortion],” she says. “But honest to God, it would not surprise me if someone were to knock on my door to see if I was still pregnant. I mean, it’s terrifying.” — With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Simmone Shah Correction, June 28 The original version of this story misstated Heartbeat International’s influence effort.

Abortion Access Is Affecting Where College Students Decide to Study,Philip Elliott,Politics;The D.C. Brief,"April 20, 2023 5:37 PM EDT","This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. For years, consultants paid to help colleges draw more applicants urged premium amenities, posh student centers, and professional-grade athletic complexes. But, in the current environment, an unlikely selling point has quietly emerged: access to abortion rights. In a new tranche of research released Thursday from Gallup and the Lumina Foundation, almost three-quarters of college students told pollsters that laws governing reproductive health factored into their decision of whether to stay enrolled in their current campus or leave. While Democrats have the strongest interest in abortion rights, a clear 62% of Republicans also said they play a factor in picking a university. Among all college students, the support for states that have greater access to abortion is by an overwhelming 4-to-1 margin, including two-thirds of Republicans who said they prefer states with less restrictive abortion laws. It’s also a pronounced winner among women (86%) and men (74%) alike. The survey of about 6,000 current college students and 6,000 college-age adults is among the first hard pieces of evidence of the second-order effects of last year’s Dobbs decision that reversed a half-century of national legal access to abortion rights. Dobbs sent the question of abortion back to state legislatures, and 13 states have all-but-outlawed the medical procedure. Five other states have bans starting as soon as six weeks of gestation, and the federal courts are considering competing cases dealing with abortion medication. The results may not come as a total surprise for anyone involved in the higher ed world, but for those scrambling to maintain student rolls in a red state, it’s another piece of bad news on top of what was already keeping policy wonks up at night: the Enrollment Cliff. Higher ed officials across the country were already bracing for the next few years at the very real prospect that application rates will dip, and hard. That’s because the young professionals of the late aughts and early ‘10s didn’t have children at the same rates as their slightly older counterparts. Birth rates fell and stayed low as young families remained skittish about being about to provide in a shaky economy. COVID, too, had a baby bust. As a result, the numbers of applicants—and then matriculators—are forecast to shrink for the next two decades. While the high-demand flagships and marquee schools will make out just fine, mid- and lower-tier universities could see themselves hollowed out, as the economics of their offerings simply don’t match the moment. Statistically, the trend seems to be cutting particularly hard against red states. In states with Republican governors right now, enrollment this fall declined on average, while states with Democratic governors crept up ever so slightly, according to my reading of the numbers. There were, of course, outliers: Wyoming was up 8%, Maryland was off by almost 5%. But on average, the states that can least afford to be losing ground with potential college students were those where Republicans now lead, and those are the states that, writ large, are moving to constrict abortion rights. In other words, their culture war agenda is poised to ding their higher-ed policies as a bank-shot casualty. So as many state leaders are treating abortion rights as something confined to health clinics, they are missing the broader ripples here. Much the same way corporations and sports voted with their feet when states adopted policies that were counter to their values, college applicants are looking closely at the cultural climate of places where they could spend four—or likely more—years studying and exploring their lives as young adults. red states were already having a tough time attracting talent among students and professors alike, and veering to the right on abortion is only going to make retaining their rankings and prestige more difficult.

‘Never-Ending Nightmare.’ An Ohio Woman Was Forced to Travel Out of State for an Abortion,Abigail Abrams;Griffyn Anthony;Caught in national chaos;‘Am I going to be supported?’,Politics;abortion,"August 29, 2022 7:00 AM EDT","When Tara George’s cell phone rang with a number from Michigan one evening in early August, she knew it would not be good news. As soon as she picked up, the doctor apologized and told her they would have to cancel her abortion appointment the following morning.  Tara’s husband, Justin, who had been downstairs in their northeast Ohio home, came up to check on her when he heard the phone ring. Tara, still listening to the doctor, silently shook her head. Then she hung up and broke down crying.  This was supposed to be a happy time for the George family. They had been thrilled when Tara, 34, got pregnant last spring, and were eager to welcome their first baby. But six days before the doctor’s phone call, with Tara 20 weeks pregnant, the couple had learned their fetus would not likely survive outside the womb. Tara’s OB-GYN told her that if she tried to carry the baby to term, Tara could become dangerously ill or suffer a blood clot that could threaten her life. This was just the beginning of what the couple described as a “never-ending nightmare.” Even as the Georges’ doctor explained there was nothing else they could do for the baby, she informed Tara and Justin that they couldn’t terminate Tara’s pregnancy in Ohio. The hospital said it wasn’t confident her conditions met the limited exceptions in the state’s new six-week abortion ban, passed in 2019 and put into effect the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The couple quickly arranged to travel to Michigan for the procedure. But days later, a Michigan appeals court ruled that county prosecutors in the state could start enforcing the state’s 1931 abortion ban. The Michigan hospital where the Georges had arranged to go had stopped all abortions while they figured out the new legal landscape. For the second time in less than a week, Tara and Justin were being denied an abortion they didn’t want to be seeking—but that they and Tara’s doctors agreed was medically necessary—because of the cascade of state laws going into effect without Roe. In the two months since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, about a third of states have completely banned or tightly restricted abortion. A complex web of new laws and old ones resurrected by the Court’s decision have rapidly changed the legal terrain for a wide range of health care. Many laws, some of which were written more than a century ago, include no exceptions for rape, incest, or fetal anomalies, and even exceptions for the pregnant person’s life or health are often vague or confusing. In many states, the legality of abortion is changing by the day or hour as judges weigh challenges. At the end of August, federal courts in Texas and Idaho reached opposite rulings about whether doctors need to provide abortions in emergency situations based on federal guidance. “This is just a perpetuation of the chaos that has started since Dobbs came down,” says Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who focuses on abortion rights. “The abortion bans are vague—some think that they’re intentionally vague—doctors don’t know how to interpret them, there’s conflicting federal guidance and federal law.”  In this murky and fast-evolving environment, abortion clinics often turn away patients, only to call them back when a court challenge succeeds. Tara eventually got an abortion at a hospital in Michigan amid a sudden change in the procedure’s legal status there. Other clinics have stopped offering abortions even if laws haven’t officially taken effect because conservative prosecutors or other officials have threatened to enforce bans preemptively even as their state’s legality remains unclear. In places where abortion is still legal, wait times are surging as out-of-state patients travel in search of care. At hospitals, fear and confusion is creating dangerous delays for patients experiencing serious pregnancy complications such as ectopic pregnancies, premature rupture of membranes, and miscarriages.  Ohio’s law prohibits abortions after cardiac activity is detected, which can happen around six weeks into pregnancy. The law has an exception for cases that involve a “medical emergency,” which includes situations that could cause a pregnant person’s death or pose a “serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” But other than a few specific conditions listed in the law itself, doctors and their lawyers have largely been left to interpret what falls under this exception on their own. Doctors across the state are now consulting with lawyers and getting second opinions on any procedure that might be considered an abortion. “I know what the medical answer is,” says Dr. Mae Winchester, the maternal-fetal medicine physician overseeing Tara’s care. (Winchester declined to speak with the name of her hospital attached because she is not authorized to speak on behalf of the institution.) “But the legal part is what I’ve never had to deal with here before.” Tara and Justin grew up in Ohio just 30 minutes away from each other. After meeting through mutual friends 15 years ago, they quickly hit it off and have been together ever since. They married in 2019, and had talked about having two children one day, who they hoped would share their love of Ohio football, Halloween, and horror movies.  In May, the couple found out that their first child would be a boy. They were “ecstatic,” Justin says. They held gender reveal parties for each of their families over Memorial Day Weekend, and settled on a name: Griffyn Anthony. Tara’s own health meant this would be a high-risk pregnancy, but she wanted to become a mom. She has antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and a Factor V Leiden mutation—blood clotting conditions that put her at high risk for potentially deadly clots. She’d had two serious blood clots, and getting pregnant increased the risk of getting another. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in particular is often associated with pregnancy loss and other complications, Winchester says. Tara and Justin were aware of the risks, she was prescribed a blood thinner that required injections twice a day, and at first, her pregnancy went smoothly. One month after the Georges settled on their baby’s name, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. When Justin posted his frustrations about the news on Facebook, citing his wife’s health risks, some friends who supported the Court’s decision assured him that states like Ohio would protect the life of the mother. The exchanges annoyed Justin, but neither he nor Tara thought the situation would apply to them. Tara was into her second trimester of pregnancy—the point, she thought, where you’re supposed to start telling people the news and making concrete plans for the baby’s arrival. The couple had created a registry: a stroller, car seat, diaper bags, Cleveland Browns onesies, Halloween outfits, and swim diapers—already thinking about future experiences with Griffyn. “We were really thinking, Oh, this is great, this is actually happening,” Tara says.  But then, at their 20-week appointment near the end of July, the sonographer grew quiet, and “almost ran out of the room,” Tara says. Justin rubbed Tara’s arm as the couple waited for what felt like an eternity. Eventually, the sonographer returned with Dr. Winchester, who did another look at the ultrasound machine. “She put the tool down,” Tara recalls, “and just looked at us and said, ‘Unfortunately, we need to have a very serious discussion.’”  The fetus’ bladder, Dr. Winchester explained, had stretched to much larger than its normal size. There was no fluid around the fetus, a sign of lower urinary tract obstruction. The pressure from the bladder had backed up into the kidneys and appeared to be causing problems there as well. Studies have shown that lower urinary tract obstruction occurs in about 1 in every 5,000 births. If there’s no fluid around the fetus because it remains stored in the bladder, this can prevent the lung tissue from developing and make it impossible for the baby to breathe on its own after birth.  That wasn’t all. Winchester also saw something abnormal with the fetus’ heart, so she sent them to a pediatric cardiologist the next day. There, the couple learned more disastrous news: one of the fetus’ heart valves was not properly developing, and even under the best circumstances, he would need surgery right away and a transplant later on. Meanwhile, a second test of the fetus’ urine revealed his kidneys were not functioning at all. “We were holding on to that little bit of hope that his heart would be okay, and he would be able to handle what needed to be done,” Tara says. But serious heart problems and the kidney failure meant the doctors couldn’t put in the shunt they would need to treat the bladder issue, and without that, the fetus was very unlikely to make it to full term, or to survive all the procedures he would need if he were born alive. According to Winchester, the chances their baby would leave the hospital alive were under 1%.  All these fetal anomalies also put Tara at greater risk for complications like severe preeclampsia, placental abruption—when the placenta detaches from the wall of the uterus—or blood clots that could lead her to have a pulmonary embolism or stroke. “Do I just wait this out and see if something terrible happens?” Tara thought. As they were talking with Winchester, Tara and Justin decided they needed to terminate her pregnancy. “We just thought, at this point, there’s nothing they can do for him,” Tara says.  Winchester warned the couple that with Ohio’s abortion ban in effect, she’d have to ask the hospital for permission to do the procedure there. “I thought this was a no-brainer situation,” Justin says. But the hospital disagreed. Tara’s health might be at risk, but under Ohio’s new law, they didn’t think it was enough to withstand legal scrutiny, according to Winchester.  Tara recalls feeling “livid” when she heard the news. She describes herself as someone who “doesn’t follow politics” and had previously thought of herself as “pro-choice” only in abstract terms. “There’s so many people that just think it’s black and white. It’s either, okay, you’re getting an abortion because you just don’t want to be pregnant. Or there’s the people that are pro-choice who are like, you should have the right to decide what you want to do with your body. And sometimes it’s not either of those,” she says. “We were put in a situation where we didn’t really have a choice for any kind of happy outcome. And yet, we were still denied.” Winchester got in touch with physicians in Michigan and Pennsylvania—nearby states where abortion is still legal until later in pregnancy. Research has shown that abortions have much lower risks of complications and death than pregnancy, but because of Tara’s clotting disorders, she would need the procedure done in a hospital. This made the scheduling more complex, and would mean the couple had to trust a whole new set of doctors, take time off work, find a hotel, pay for gas, and drive hours across state lines. (Tara, a hair stylist, doesn’t have paid vacation days; Justin, a quality manager at a steel factory, was quickly using his up.) They chose a hospital in Michigan that allowed Tara to do the initial appointment virtually, and planned to drive up the next day for her two-day procedure. (The Michigan hospital declined to be named in light of the ongoing legal challenges in the state.) But when Tara logged on to the video appointment the morning of Aug. 1, her plans were interrupted once again. In Michigan, abortion is legal until the point of viability—when a fetus can survive outside the womb—usually around 24 weeks, which Tara hadn’t yet reached. But the state never repealed a 1931 ban on abortion from before Roe, and now Republicans want to enforce it. While Planned Parenthood and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, each sued to block the law earlier this year, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled on Aug. 1 that county prosecutors could enforce the law, throwing the state into uncertainty. The Michigan doctor wasn’t sure what the ruling would mean yet, so she went through with the consultation and promised to update Tara as soon as she knew whether they could move forward.  That night was when the doctor called back to cancel the abortion. “It was so taxing on both of us emotionally, even physically,” Justin recalls. “You can’t sleep, you can’t eat. And then you just keep getting these horrible phone calls. You’re canceling hotels, you’re missing time from work, you have to reschedule days. It just got to be so much within just a few days. It was nuts.” Tara texted Winchester, who said she would reach back out to the Pennsylvania hospital. The next morning, Tara heard from a staffer at the hospital in Pennsylvania that they would do the procedure but wouldn’t be able to fit her in for another week. At this point, Tara was 21 weeks and four days pregnant, and getting close to the limit of when neighboring states would be able to help her. (Pennsylvania also allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy). If Pennsylvania didn’t work out, Winchester suggested they consider Illinois or Maryland, both farther trips.  But an hour later, Tara received another call from Michigan. It was the same doctor from the day before, telling her the hospital had reversed its decision and could perform her abortion after all. A circuit judge in Michigan had issued a temporary restraining order at the end of the previous day, stopping enforcement of the 1931 ban again. If the couple could get there that afternoon, the hospital could see them right away, before the legal environment might change again. The couple reached the Michigan hospital by mid-afternoon. There, Tara would have a procedure known as a D&E, dilation and evacuation, over two days. On the first day, the doctor would use an injection to stop the fetus’ heart and dilate her cervix to prepare for removing the fetus on the second day.  While they waited, Justin tried to keep the mood light, but Tara couldn’t shake the fear of the doctors canceling again. They moved between waiting rooms for hours while it seemed that doctors tried to squeeze them into an already crowded schedule.  But they were able to complete the procedure. When Tara woke up from it, she immediately started crying. She felt some sense of relief. But the reality of her loss and what they’d had to go through finally broke through the shock too. “I wouldn’t wish that on anybody,” Tara says.  Tara and Justin are recovering from their experience, but they can’t stop thinking about all the other women who are going through similar situations without the same resources. They still don’t know whether their insurance will cover Tara’s care and are waiting for the day a potentially crushing bill arrives in the mail. But they know they’re lucky they could afford to travel across state lines, and Winchester told them she can connect them with assistance programs if needed to help pay the medical bills.  The couple also wants their community to understand. The Sunday before Tara’s procedure, they posted a joint message on Facebook telling people “it’s going to take a little longer to start our family.” Many people assumed Tara had a miscarriage, and while their messages were supportive, she knows that some of them are the same ones who publicly cheered Roe’s overturning and supported Ohio’s law. “If we were to tell you what we had to go through, would you still be on our side?” she wondered. “Or would you look at us differently?”  The Georges want to try to have another baby. They went through a round of genetic testing after returning from Michigan to try to determine what caused their fetus’ anomalies. Everything came back clear. But they also know that if they conceive again and have more medical problems, the situation could be even more dangerous. Conservative lawmakers in Ohio and other states have expressed interest in further restricting abortion, and in some cases, in trying to stop people from traveling out of state to access the procedure. “If we try again, what if all of a sudden there is something else that comes out that prevents travel at all?” Tara says. “Am I going to be supported?” Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6208860/ohio-woman-forced-travel-abortion/
Idaho’s New Law Will Punish Anyone Helping a Minor Access an Out-of-State Abortion With Up to 5 Years in Prison,Solcyré Burga;What does the new law do? ;How would the law be implemented?;Idaho’s current abortion laws ;What’s next for Idaho? ,U.S.;idaho,"April 7, 2023 2:42 PM EDT","Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed a first-of-its-kind law Wednesday night that criminalizes any adult who helps a minor undergo an abortion through a procedure or medication in another state without parental consent.  Under the law, adults would be facing felony charges and could be punished with two to five years in state prison for aiding with procuring an abortion, whether that be driving a minor across state lines, or helping them find an abortion provider out-of-state. Doctors who perform abortions would also be liable to criminal penalties. The law adds to the state’s near-total abortion ban, which prohibits abortions unless a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest (which has to be reported to law enforcement), or is a life-saving measure. Proponents of the measure have heralded the law as a continuation of the state’s right to ban abortions. “With the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe vs. Wade last summer, the right and duty to establish legal policy on abortion was finally returned to our state democratic process,” Gov. Little said in a letter to the Idaho legislature on Wednesday.  Opponents warn that this law adds on to the continuous attacks against the bodily autonomy of youth. “If young people are unable to travel for care, they are forced to either self-manage an abortion and take on the potential legal risks, or carry an unwanted pregnancy to term along with the serious consequences that can have for their health and well-being,” says Megan Darby, Director of State Policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization. “Young people—along with everyone in Idaho and across the country—deserve compassionate and affordable access to the whole spectrum of sexual and reproductive health care.” The law is set to go into effect in thirty days.  The new law, formerly known as House Bill 242, criminalizes so-called “abortion trafficking” by making it illegal to obtain abortion pills for minors or help them leave the state to obtain an abortion, with the intent of hiding the abortion from a minor’s parent or guardian. Under the law, the father, grandparent, sibling, aunt, or uncle of the unborn child has a right to sue an adult who helps a minor obtain an abortion up to four years after the abortion. The law also allows the specified family members to file lawsuits against out-of-state doctors who perform these abortions. The criminal ban does say that adults who help pregnant minors access abortions with the consent of parents/legal guardians have an affirmative defense. That means that if a defendant presents evidence that a minor’s parent or guardian agreed the child could travel out-of-state for an abortion, they do not have criminal liability. The measure, however, says it is not an affirmative defense for an abortion provider or the provider of an abortion pill to be out of state. In other words, if a pregnant minor has a physician across state lines and obtains an abortion, that procedure is illegal. Violators can face anywhere from two to five years in state prison.  The passage of the law does not mean it’s necessarily popular with Idahoans. In a poll commissioned by Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii but conducted by public opinion firm Lake Research Partners, nearly half of all Idaho voters reported being pro-choice, with 24% saying they think abortion should be generally available and only subject to “limited regulation.” “There’s been a movement among progressive prosecutors to say that they’re not going to prosecute some abortion offenses,” says Cynthia Soohoo, Co-Director of the Human Rights and Gender Justice Clinic at CUNY School of Law. “But the law actually gives the Attorney General the power to enforce the law if local prosecutors don’t.” In terms of implementation, experts tell TIME, prosecutors would have to have substantial evidence that someone crossed state lines to access care. Because Idaho is between Washington and Oregon, where legislators are already working to enact shield protection laws, there is likely to be a conflict of state laws.  Shield laws explicitly protect abortion providers from lawsuits if an out-of-state patient receives an abortion, but these laws also often protect “helpers.” The loose phrasing of the word helper applies to people who assist with the abortion, Elisabeth Smith, Director of State Policy and Advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights tells TIME that “assistance could be anything [from] driving someone to the clinic, to providing financial assistance, to helping them make the appointment.”  Shield laws also prohibit that state from “collaborating with any investigation that is about the provision of or assistance with reproductive health care,” according to Smith. “And so part of that prohibition on collaboration is a prohibition on subpoenas and providing evidence.” In other words, states like Idaho would be unable to access medical records or other evidence of abortion care if neighboring states do pass shield laws, making it difficult for a prosecutor to gather evidence. With that in mind, it’s imperative that people who are seeking abortion care be private about their actions, Smith says. “Thinking about how each of us share information, what information we put on social media, and what messaging services we use to share information [is critical] because again, none of these prosecutions can go forward without enough information to prove that someone has helped a young person access abortion,” Smith tells TIME.  Idaho’s abortion ban—which is modeled after a law in Texas—bars abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The Idaho Supreme Court upheld the ban this January, despite legal challenges that said that the right to abortion was implied in Idaho’s constitution. Justice Robyn Brody, who presided over the case, said that abortion advocates’ argument had no backing. Abortion continues to be a contentious issue in the state. Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union announced on Wednesday that they are suing Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador after he issued a legal opinion that said state law prohibits medical practitioners from referring a patient across state lines to obtain abortion services.  His opinion said that even doctors who offer information about abortion providers and funds in other states would violate Idaho’s existing abortion ban.  “This is a five-alarm fire. Banning abortion wasn’t enough for anti-abortion extremists in Idaho; they now want to ban where you go, what information you’re legally allowed to obtain, and even what health care providers can say,” Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest said. “Attorney General Labrador’s opinion is an egregious extension of Idaho’s abortion ban. We won’t stand for it.” Similar to the rising number of anti-LGBTQ bills seen flooding state legislatures, Soohoo says it is very likely other conservative states will attempt to pass copycat laws, which would have similar provisions to Idaho’s law.  “There is actually a long history of writing laws initially to challenge Roe vs. Wade or to limit access to abortion by conservative think tanks [that] draft these laws and then share them amongst state legislature[s].” Soohoo tells TIME.  Abortion access is likely to remain limited in the state after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which will have dire consequences on pregnant people in the state. “In 50 years, when someone or multiple people, write the definitive history of all of the harms that flowed from the Dobb’s decision, there are countless harms that we are not yet aware of right now… in terms of maternal mortality and morbidity [in the state],” Smith says.  There have already been reports of at least one hospital discontinuing its labor and delivery services, which they say is partially because of Idaho’s political climate. And efforts to track the effects of the state’s anti-abortion laws remain up in the air as the state’s existing special committee that studies maternal deaths is set to end in July.  On the national front, experts say that Congress needs to act, though their most recent attempts have not been fruitful.  Last year, House Democrats attempted to pass the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022 that would protect health care providers who provide abortion services to out-of-state residents, people who help pregnant people travel across state lines for an abortion, and more. The bill passed in the House in July 2022, but did not move forward.  Senate Republicans also blocked the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022, which would have protected people who travel state lines to receive an abortion and physicians who perform them.

How Texas’ Abortion Ban Marks a New Legal Strategy for Abortion Restrictions,Abigail Abrams;More from TIME;Impact on patients and providers,Politics;abortion,"September 1, 2021 10:58 AM EDT","A Texas law that bans abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy took effect at midnight on Wednesday after the Supreme Court failed to act on emergency requests from abortion providers. Nearly 24 hours later, the court said late Wednesday night it split 5-4 and denied the providers’ emergency request to block the law. The unsigned order, issued by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, said their decision focused on procedural issues and did not amount to a ruling on the constitutionality of the law, and that other appeals could be pursued. However, even if the ban is ultimately blocked, it will have a lasting impact on Texas and provide a roadmap for other conservative states to enact similar abortion restrictions. Senate Bill 8, signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May, bars abortions once a doctor can detect fetal cardiac activity, which is often before many people know they are pregnant. The ban would prevent at least 85% of abortions sought in Texas, according to abortion rights advocates and providers. It is now the most restrictive abortion law in the nation; at least 12 other states have passed six-week abortion bans, but all have been blocked from going into effect. “Texas politicians will have effectively overturned Roe v. Wade,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said shortly before the law went into effect, referring to the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutionally protected right to abortion before a fetus is viable. The Texas law uses a different tactic than many of the other abortion restrictions passed by Republican state legislatures in recent years—which is precisely what has made it difficult for courts to block it. The law signals a new frontier in the national fight over abortion and could mark a critical new legal strategy for conservative legislatures in how they write restrictive abortion laws in the future. John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, which helped write the legislation, says he has already heard from other states that are interested in copying this approach and the group is drafting legislation for some of them already. “This promises an alternative to that typical path that pro-life laws go down,” he says. “This is a valid public policy tool and we’re excited to see how it works.” Instead of allowing government officials to enforce the abortion ban as they do with most laws, this law says that private citizens can step in by suing abortion providers and anyone who “aids and abets” a patient obtaining an abortion after six weeks. That means clinics and their staffs could be sued, as well as patients’ family members, or anyone who drives someone to a clinic, provides financial assistance, offers religious or genetic counseling or even “intends” to do any of those actions. The plaintiffs do not need to have any connection to the person they suspect of violating the law, and if they win, the law says they are entitled to damages of at least $10,000 plus legal fees. Because so many people can now legally bring these abortion lawsuits in Texas, courts could theoretically be overwhelmed with cases. “It does open the floodgates to lawsuits, and even frivolous lawsuits, just to harass abortion providers,” says Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the Reproductive Freedom Project at the ACLU, which is part of the coalition of abortion providers and advocates challenging the law.  But the way the law is written also makes it difficult to challenge. Usually, when a state passes a new law restricting abortion access, abortion rights groups and providers sue state officials alleging they are violating people’s constitutionally protected rights. In this case, there is no specific individual tasked with enforcing the law, so there was no obvious entity for the providers to sue. The ACLU, the Center for Reproductive Rights and a collection of other groups and abortion providers filed suit this summer against a slew of officials they said would be responsible for enforcing the law, but a series of complex procedural developments left them asking the Supreme Court for a last-minute intervention. “The Constitution, including Roe v. Wade, only applies against the government, it doesn’t apply against private individuals,” says Laurence Tribe, a leading constitutional law expert at Harvard. “That’s what makes this really dangerous. It’s a kind of vigilante justice, circumventing all of the mechanisms we have for making sure that the law is enforced fairly, and that it’s not enforced in a way that violates people’s rights.” Even if the courts temporarily block the law, complications remain. The law includes a provision that says providers could still be sued for violating the law if a court decision is eventually reversed and the law goes back into effect, meaning providers could be sued over an action that was technically legal at the time. For now the law stands in Texas. Texas Right to Life has set up a website to solicit tips about people who allegedly violate the law and collect information from those who want to help the group enforce it. The website has been flooded with fake information from those who support abortion rights, but Seago says that has not hampered the group’s efforts. “We’ve set up the tip line, we’ve built the networks, we’ve been working with pro-life attorneys and activists around the state, so that if [providers] decide that they’re going to try to commit illegal abortions anyway, we will be prepared to do what the law authorizes us to do, which is to bring private lawsuits holding them accountable,” Seago says. On Tuesday, a state court issued temporary restraining orders preventing Seago and his group from enforcing the law against two attorneys and one abortion fund, but Texas Right to Life said this did not change its plans to enforce the law. Abortion providers and patients in Texas are already feeling the consequences of the new law on its first full day in effect.  The law will “immediately and catastrophically reduce abortion access in Texas,” the group of providers said in its emergency filing to the Supreme Court on Monday. “Patients who can scrape together resources will be forced to attempt to leave the state to obtain an abortion, and many will be delayed until later in pregnancy. The remaining Texans who need an abortion will be forced to remain pregnant against their will or to attempt to end their pregnancies without medical supervision.” The Supreme Court’s five most reliably conservative justices voted to reject the emergency filing. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the three liberal justices in dissent. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan each wrote separate opinions saying they would have blocked the law because it is an unconstitutional ban on abortion. Abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the law will disproportionately impact low-income patients who already often struggle to access health care. The average distance a Texas patient will have to travel to obtain an abortion will now rise from 12 to 248 miles, a 20-fold increase, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Abortion clinics in the state say they plan to comply with the law, but providers often operate on thin margins and these changes could force many to close their doors. They can now only provide abortions for people up to six weeks of pregnancy, which will dramatically limit their services and patient volume. Abortion funds, which help patients afford and otherwise access the procedure, could also face prosecution under the law, so may have to limit their work helping patients pay clinics.  Clinics also need to hire lawyers to defend their physicians, nurses and other staff members from the lawsuits they expect to face. If they lose a lawsuit, they not only have to pay damages and their opponent’s legal fees, but the state can shut the clinic down. And if they win, the law prevents clinics and others accused of helping facilitate an abortion from recovering their own legal fees.  The threat of clinic closures is not theoretical in Texas. In 2013 when the state passed its HB 2 law, which required all abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and clinics to be equipped with hospital-level surgical centers, the state lost almost half its abortion providers. Even after the Supreme Court ruled that law unconstitutional in 2016, few ever reopened.  This new law has already affected clinics across Texas. Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have stopped scheduling visits related to abortions that would take place after six weeks, and Whole Woman’s Health, which runs four clinics in Texas, said it will only schedule abortions for people who are at seven weeks of pregnancy or fewer. On Tuesday night, Whole Woman’s Health tweeted that it was providing abortions up until the last minute before the law took effect. From Whole Woman’s Health CEO @AmyHM: We have staff and doctors providing abortions in Texas - still at this hour - and they are all in to provide care until 11:59 tonight. Our waiting rooms are filled with patients and their loved ones. Right now. While the clinics promised they would continue operating for now, Whole Woman’s Health has also lost staff due to the law, says Amy Hagstrom Miller, the organization’s president and CEO. “We’ve been through HB 2; we kept all our clinics open during the COVID pandemic in Texas; these people walk through protesters screaming at them. And they’re so scared of being sued, having this uncertainty of will the clinic be open, will I still have a job,” she says. “The chilling effect has been huge.” Two clinic managers have left because of the uncertainty, Hagstrom Miller says. The law is particularly perilous for physicians, because even if a lawsuit is dismissed as frivolous, the physician will have to declare that they have been sued any time they apply for a license to practice in a different state or for new hospital privileges. Only one of the 17 physicians who work in the Whole Woman’s Health clinics in the state has agreed unconditionally to continue practicing under Texas’ new law. Four or five others have said they will continue providing care as long as the clinics can make changes to their schedules, documentation and legal representation to try to protect them from the expected lawsuits as much as possible. The rest didn’t feel they could take the risk. Texas is far from the only state advancing controversial new abortion laws. Its ban comes at a crucial moment as the Supreme Court will hear another major abortion case this fall, when the justices review a Mississippi ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. A decision in that case won’t come until 2022. Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6093905/texas-abortion-ban-abortion-rights/

Armed Demonstrators and Far-Right Groups Are Escalating Tensions at Abortion Protests,Vera Bergengruen,Politics;abortion,"July 8, 2022 7:00 AM EDT","Armed demonstrators and extremist groups have increasingly gathered at abortion-related protests in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, causing analysts to warn of a rising threat of violence.  Eight abortion-related demonstrations featured armed individuals in the week after the June 24 ruling, bringing the total number of such protests in 2022 to 10—nearly twice as many as in all of 2021, according to a new analysis shared with TIME by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a nonprofit that tracks political violence and demonstrations. Anti-government militias and extremist groups like the Proud Boys have appeared at 27 abortion-related events as of July 1, according to ACLED’s data, a 160% spike over the previous year. In 2020, far-right groups appeared at only 1% of demonstrations related to abortion rights; so far this year, almost one in five events involved members of a far-right group.  As armed demonstrators and far-right groups flock to abortion-related protests, abortion-rights activists have begun bringing guns themselves, according to ACLED, including at a rally in Dallas on July 2. The combination of the presence of firearms and competing demonstrators has alarmed analysts. Roughly half of the abortion-related demonstrations that have turned violent or destructive have involved counter-protestors. “It’s all the makings of a really worrying trend,” says  Roudabeh Kishi, the director of research and innovation at ACLED.  Abortion-related demonstrations that involve people with firearms are more likely to turn violent. So far this year, 33% of them have, according to ACLED’s data, compared to 0.2% of those that don’t involve guns. None of that violence has included shootings. But tensions are rising, giving domestic extremists an opportunity to exploit these protests to incite violence among their supporters, national security officials say. Outside the Idaho state capitol on June 28, fighting broke out between an anti-abortion prayer rally of 200 people—which included a number of Proud Boys armed with assault rifles—and protestors demonstrating against the Supreme Court decision. A few days earlier, on the evening of the ruling, a self-identified member of the Three Percenters militia armed with an AR-15 started recording a group of protestors outside a crisis pregnancy center in Eugene, Ore. The protest was dispersed after police fired tear gas, leading to the arrest of 10 people.

The Department of Homeland Security has highlighted the potential for violence by domestic extremists in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. Viral posts on online forums warned that the far-left abortion-rights group “Jane’s Revenge,” which DHS calls “a network of loosely affiliated suspected violent extremists” linked to arsons at crisis pregnancy centers, had shared a blog post encouraging a “Night of Rage” after the abortion ruling was issued. In response, far-right extremists called for “attacks against abortion-related targets,” according to a DHS intelligence memo disseminated to federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, first responders and their private sector partners.  While widespread violence failed to materialize, the dueling militant rallying cries highlighted the increasingly chaotic environment, in which both real and perceived threats are blending with disinformation, leading to a feedback loop that can be as dangerous as the threats themselves, security officials and analysts say. “People are taking threats from more obscure, fringe groups and spreading them widely online: ‘Oh, look, here’s what they want to do to us,’” says Sivanne Shalev, the head of emerging trends and misinformation at ActiveFence, a technology security company that analyzes disinformation and hate speech. “Amplifying threats and misinformation [causes] a lot of confusion which in itself can be dangerous and can promote real world harm.” Abortion-rights activists say the uptick in violent threats and attacks they’ve seen in recent years is tied to the larger rise in hate speech and political violence. Many of the same groups involved in the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 events are now threatening abortion providers, says Melissa Fowler, chief program officer at the National Abortion Federation (NAF).  “For abortion providers, watching January 6 was really very familiar,” says Fowler. “People with militia gear, with weapons, the rhetoric like calling for people to be hung and to be harmed…those are all things that that these extremists do outside of clinics and have been using to torment providers for years.” Violence against abortion providers rose significantly in 2021, according to a report last month from NAF, which has been tracking this data for 45 years. Assaults of abortion-clinic employees and patients increased 128% year-over-year, while stalking leaped 600% and bomb threats jumped 80%.  When Texas passed a law last year significantly restricting access to abortion, there was an escalation of violent and aggressive activity there and in surrounding states where women sought care, Fowler says, such as harassment, intimidation, forcibly entering abortion clinics, and death threats. Abortion-rights activists fear a similar surge with even greater intensity in the aftermath of the Dobbs ruling. “A political victory like this can really embolden people who want to harass and terrorize abortion providers,” Fowler says.

In the days since the ruling, posts in extremist online spaces have lauded violent anti-abortion activists like Robert Lewis Dear, who killed three people and wounded nine others in 2015 in a mass shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic. One poster, citing Dear, wrote, “If you’re ‘pro-life’ but aren’t prepared to follow in their footsteps…you’re wasting your time,” according to the internal DHS memo, first reported by Axios. The memo warns that federal judges, state lawmakers, abortion clinics and abortion rights protests, as well as faith-based anti-abortion centers, could all be targeted. “Some racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists’ embrace of pro-life narratives may be linked to the perception of wanting to ‘save white children’ and ‘fight white genocide,'” it says. “Violence could occur for weeks… particularly as [domestic extremists] may be mobilized to respond to changes in state laws and ballot measures on abortion stemming from the decision.” At the same time, the FBI is investigating a spate of threats and arson targeting anti-abortion pregnancy centers that began in the weeks after the leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion indicating that Roe would be overturned. The June 24 DHS memo also cites at least 11 incidents of vandalism “threatening violence targeting religious facilities perceived as being opposed to abortion.” Anti-abortion groups say they’ve stepped up security amid rising tensions. Students for Life, a national anti-abortion organization, has been adding safety trainings for its staff as well as “more and more paid security,” spokesperson Kristi Hamrick says. Heartbeat International, a national organization that runs more than 2,500 anti-abortion centers, told TIME the week before the ruling that “the primary concern we have from affiliates is regarding their centers’ security and protection given the increase of attacks directed at pro-life organizations.” With abortion-related protests set to continue in the months leading up to the midterm elections, federal law-enforcement officials acknowledge they’ll have to walk the line between monitoring these often amorphous threats and protecting peaceful protests. As DHS itself notes itself in its memo, “strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics does not constitute domestic violent extremism or illegal activity and is constitutionally protected.” With reporting by Abigail Abrams/Washington Write to Vera Bergengruen at vera.bergengruen@time.com",https://time.com/6194085/abortion-protests-guns-violence-extremists/
COVID-19 Could Permanently Make Abortions Harder to Access Nationwide,Abigail Abrams,Politics;COVID-19,"April 7, 2020 4:58 PM EDT","Kathy Kleinfeld already had patients in her waiting room at Houston Women’s Reproductive Services on the morning of March 24 when she received an update from her lawyers: Stop what you’re doing, they warned. The Texas attorney general had announced the evening before that abortions were considered non-essential medical procedures and that doctors were barred from providing them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kleinfeld’s lawyers had determined that the mandate included “medication abortions,” which are administered by pill—the kind that Kleinfeld offered at her clinic. Kleinfeld went to each of her patients, one by one, that morning and explained that she would have to cancel their appointments. They were “distraught, upset, angry, saddened, confused, panic stricken,” Kleinfeld remembers. “Every single woman was planning to proceed with her decision in whatever way was necessary,” she adds. “Now, just at greater risk and compounding the health crises with more health risks.” But if the decision was personally disruptive for Kleinfeld’s patients, Texas’s sweeping order was also an early sign of a soon-to-be explosive battle against abortion providers nationwide. On April 7, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Texas’ ban on abortions could stand, potentially triggering a petition to the Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood, which along with the Center for Reproductive Rights and other lawyers had sued Texas on behalf of a group of abortion providers, said earlier in the day on April 7 that if the Fifth Circuit did not rule, they planned to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Alexis McGill Johnson, the group’s acting president, said on Twitter after the Fifth Circuit ruling Tuesday afternoon, that they would push forward. “We won’t let this injustice stand. Our patients deserve better,” McGill Johnson wrote. The fight in Texas is just one of many battles nationwide. Five other Republican-led states—Ohio, Texas, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahoma—have taken similar steps to temporarily ban abortions during the coronavirus outbreak. While all of those have been challenged in court, more conservative states are considering following suit. Reproductive rights advocates are used to fighting state laws and court battles to preserve abortion access. But this is different. By using executive orders and other emergency measures, a handful of governors and state attorneys general have managed, at least temporarily, to all but shut down legal abortions. Abortion providers say these new restrictions will likely have lasting impacts, not only on the patients in search of abortions, but also on independent abortion clinics’ ability to survive financially in the months ahead. “The challenges that independent clinics and their patients have had to contend with have not disappeared. Medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion raised enormous barriers before the pandemic and those barriers are becoming increasingly insurmountable now,” said Jay Thibodeau, communications director for the Abortion Care Network, a national group for independent abortion providers. Independent clinics provide the majority of abortions in the United States. They often have small staffs, run on tight budgets and are constantly navigating new restrictions on the way they can provide services to their patients. While the increasing number of abortion regulations in recent years has led many clinics around the country to close, every state has maintained at least one abortion provider. Now the COVID-19 pandemic is testing that reality. “It’s going to strain any nonprofit small business who works near the margins,” Dr. Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director at the Emma Goldman Clinic in Iowa City, says of states banning abortions during the pandemic.  Some of these clinics have found emergency relief. Abortion providers, represented by lawyers and reproductive rights groups, have sued and won temporary injunctions in Ohio, Alabama and Oklahoma, and come to an agreement with Iowa. They’ve argued that abortion is time-sensitive, essential health care, a position supported by seven national medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  But nearly all abortions remain banned in Texas, and officials in Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia have questioned whether abortions should be allowed to continue in those states as well. Eighteen other states have also joined briefs supporting Texas in its fight. Hundreds of laws placing restrictions on abortion access have been passed over the last decade, and 2019 saw a particularly large wave of legislation seeking to curtail abortions across the country. These laws have an overwhelming chilling effect. Even in cases where reproductive rights advocates ultimately win in court, providers or patients feel the consequences. For example, in 2016, the Supreme Court sided with abortion providers in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, striking down regulations in Texas’ HB 2 law, which required all abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and clinics to be equipped with hospital-level surgical centers. But the court ruling came too late for many providers.  “We certainly saw after HB 2, when half the clinics closed, we went from 42 clinics to 21 virtually overnight,” says Dr. Robin Wallace, co-medical director at Southwestern Women’s Surgery Center in Dallas. “And then with the favorable Supreme Court ruling in 2016, only a handful of clinics reopened. We did not see a rebound in terms of access.” In addition to finding an abortion provider, patients must now worry about whether they are going to spread, or contract, COVID-19, Wallace notes. “They are not only being turned away from the health care that they would normally be able to access in their home state,” she says, “but now they’re having to grapple with this decision of, do I violate this stay at home guideline in order to seek my abortion?” In Texas, patients have had to travel particularly far from home. Nearly half of the state’s 254 counties were 100 miles from the nearest U.S. abortion provider before the COVID-19 order, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin. With all Texas clinics now blocked from offering abortion, 94% of the state’s counties are more than 100 miles from a provider, and nearly three quarters are more than 200 miles away. And the situation isn’t great for abortion providers going forward, Wallace adds. While Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and other abortion providers continue to pursue legal action, the current ruling has allowed Abbott’s order stopping abortions, which currently lasts through April 21, to stand. “That amount of time not being able to provide care absolutely could be financially devastating and result in more clinic closures across the state,” Wallace says. In Oklahoma, the Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma city was facing similar conditions until April 6 when a judge granted a temporary restraining order against the state’s abortion ban. In the first week that Oklahoma’s order stopped abortions, Trust Women had to cancel about 160 appointments, according to Julie Burkhart, its CEO and founder. Most of her staff was already working remotely, and she had started to think about what would happen if the clinic had to stay closed for longer.  “That would absolutely impact us financially,” Burkart said in an interview on March 31. “Within the month I would really have to sit down and make some tough decisions.” The court’s decision on April 6 will let Trust Women to start providing some abortions again, but not all procedures are allowed and the picture could change. “It’s a huge relief that we can start seeing patients again, at least for now,” Burkhart said on April 6. “We hope the court will keep the ban blocked so our patients aren’t forced to travel to other states to find abortion care at a time when travel is risky and discouraged.” COVID-19 has brought up other concerns for abortion providers, too. In Iowa, where Hardy-Fairbanks says she’s grateful that her state’s agreement now allows her to make case-by-case determinations and provide abortions in compliance with the governor’s order, the clinic has had to cut back in other ways. “The coronavirus in general has had a big impact,” she says. “We’re a healthcare clinic. We do trans care and contraception care and well visits, and all of those kinds of visits we definitely can’t do right now because they need to be delayed in order to allow people to stay home and to conserve our resources.”  Those restrictions create complications for patients who need that care, but providers say they were making those tough choices and taking COVID-19 precautions on their own before states stepped in. “As family planning specialists, we were already acutely aware that an appropriate public health response was going to include some limitations on how other health care services continued during the crisis,” Wallace says. Weeks before the Texas order to stop providing abortions, Wallace says her clinic was in touch with local health officials and had started screening patients for COVID-19 symptoms, practicing social distancing and limiting the number of people in the clinic. All the abortion providers who spoke with TIME said they had previously added these elements, as well as other measures including staggering appointment times, increasing cleaning and cutting back on other services. As abortion providers face destabilizing conditions, it’s unclear whether they will be able to access government relief funding the way other medical providers and nonprofits will be able to do. The CARES Act stimulus package gives President Trump’s Small Business Administration the leeway to deny funding to Planned Parenthood, and the final law also includes Hyde Amendment-like language, which experts say prevents state and local governments from using COVID-19 funds to help abortion services.  Several providers told TIME that they were unsure if they would be able to keep their staffs paid and protected during this time. “I’ve been working in Texas for seven and a half years now and have weathered the storms of HB 2 and other threats to access over time. And this by far is the most painful,” Wallace says. “When you layer this restriction of necessary health care on top of the public’s concerns about the unknown of their future well being, it is just really beyond tragic. It was devastating.” Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/5816530/coronavirus-abortion-clinics-access/

In November 2003, after we had filmed the first season of The Simple Life and before it premiered, I was living my best life. The show started getting tons of great press. My co-star Nicole Richie and I were working it, showing up, doing interviews. I was out clubbing almost every night, posing for the paparazzi, talking to everyone about this crazy, wonderful show about to come out, promising everyone that they’d be blown away. I shuttled between New York and L.A., working the red carpet at premieres and award shows, and wherever I went, the growing army of paparazzi followed. I was having a wild-child moment, and it was sort of glorious. It all came crashing down when I realized I was pregnant at 22. It was like waking up on the ledge outside a 40th-floor window. I was terrified and heartsick. The hormones sent my ADHD symptoms spiraling. Everything I knew about myself was at war with everything I’d been raised to believe about abortion. No one can ever know how hard it is to face this impossible choice unless she’s faced it herself.  Luckily, I wasn’t fully alone. At the time, I had been dating a guy named Jason Shaw for two years. I had first seen him on the curb in front of the Four Seasons in L.A., waiting for valet parking, and recognized him from a towering Tommy Hilfiger billboard that featured him stretched out in his underwear in Times Square. He was a lovely, down-to-earth guy. He had a degree in history. He bought a house on Kings Road where we could live together… But I knew I wasn’t in the right place to make any sort of commitment. It had nothing to do with him or a baby. I just wasn’t capable of being honest or loyal or whole. After suffering abuse at Provo Canyon School and three other programs within the “troubled teen” industry network, I was damaged in ways I couldn’t tell him about, and the fact that I never confided in him about my past—that says it all, doesn’t it? Secrets are corrosive. They destroy anything you try to layer over them. Choosing to have an abortion can be an intensely private agony that’s impossible to explain. The only reason I’m talking about it now is that so many women are facing it, and they feel so alone and judged and abandoned. I want them to know that they’re not alone, and they don’t owe anyone an explanation. When there is no right way—all that’s left is what is. What you know you have to do. And you do it, even though it breaks your heart. Read More: The Fall of Roe v. Wade Has Permanently Changed the Doctor-Patient Relationship Over the years, I’ve looked back on all this with sorrow, even though I know I made the right choice. In my loneliest moments, I’ve romanticized that time in my life and tortured myself with melodrama—thoughts like, What if I killed my Paris?—but the fact is, there was no happy little family at stake. That was not going to happen. Trying to continue that pregnancy with the physical and emotional issues I was dealing with at the time would have been a train wreck for everyone involved. At that moment, I was in no way capable of being a mother. Denying that would have jeopardized the forever family I hoped to have in the future, at a time when I was healthy and healed. Until I met Carter, who would become my husband, I wasn’t totally convinced that forever was a thing for me. With Carter, for the first time in my life, I began a relationship on a foundation of full disclosure. I made a connection that didn’t include separate corners for carefully kept secrets. We were honest with each other. Crazy concept, right? First you own it. Then you can share it. We’re now a comfortable married couple. We love our Saturday mornings when we go to the farmers’ market for fresh eggs, fruit, and veggies, which we haul home so I can cook an elaborate brunch, and then we sit there and eat and eat and talk about exquisitely nerdy things like cross-collateralization and negative pickup. We laugh a lot and take time to wonder and be grateful. We love our work, our homes, our jobs, and we adore our dogs. And we’ve started a family—on our own terms, because we were both ready to be parents. That doesn’t mean it was easy. I’ve always wanted twins: a boy and a girl. “It’s possible,” our doctor said. “In a perfect world…” If only my world were as perfect as it looks. For so many people, having babies is like plug and play, right? That’s how it seems, anyway. And when you want a baby, it seems like everyone around you is getting pregnant. It sucks, but I’m not alone in this either. There are so many young women at the fertility doctor’s office, so many families waiting to happen.  That’s what IVF is all about. Possibility. Hope. It’s hard, but you’re willing to go through anything to find your heart’s desire.  Month after month of injections, several egg-harvesting procedures, more IVF injections, new ADHD meds, my natural state of chaos—it was a lot. The shots are painful. At times, I felt like I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to confront the fact that my mind and body had never fully healed—and probably never will fully heal—from the trauma I went through as a teenager. But after two years, we finally welcomed our son, Phoenix Barron Hilton Reum, in January via surrogacy. He is my everything, the child I was always meant to raise. I know I wouldn’t have this life if I hadn’t made that difficult choice in my early 20s. Women need to control their reproductive destiny. We need to know ourselves, trust ourselves, and know what’s right for us—and when—and stay in the driver’s seat. From PARIS: THE MEMOIR by Paris Hilton. Copyright © 2023 by 11:11 Media, LLC.

Wisconsin Republicans Introduce Bill to Ban Abortions After 14 Weeks of Pregnancy,TODD RICHMOND / AP,Politics;abortion,"January 20, 2024 7:47 AM EST","MADISON, Wis. — Republicans who control the Wisconsin Assembly introduced a bill Friday that would call for a binding statewide referendum on whether abortion should be banned after 14 weeks of pregnancy. The GOP has scheduled a public hearing on the bill for Monday afternoon at the state Capitol. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is almost certain to veto the measure. However, the proposal could still galvanize the conservative base after Democrats parlayed anger over the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn its landmark 1972 Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion nationwide, into big election wins across the country. Nowhere was that dynamic more evident than in Wisconsin, where Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the state Supreme Court last year after repeatedly announcing on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights. Her victory handed liberal justices a 4-3 majority on the court. To add to Republicans' woes, a Dane County judge ruled this past summer that Wisconsin's 174-year-old ban on abortion only prohibits feticide, or an attempt to kill an unborn child. The ruling emboldened Planned Parenthood, which had ceased providing services in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision, to resume operations in September. The case is on appeal, though, and likely will end up before the state Supreme Court. Monday's hearing is set for the same day Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit Waukesha County as part of a nationwide tour promoting reproductive rights, promising plenty of headlines for both sides on abortion. Another Wisconsin law bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill Friday would outlaw abortions after 14 weeks of pregnancy, or about three months. Forty-three states prohibit abortions after a certain point of viability, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Two states — Georgia and South Carolina — have laws in effect that ban abortion at six weeks, before many women realize they are pregnant. Nebraska and North Carolina have laws in effect that outlaw abortion at 12 weeks. Arizona and Florida have laws in effect that prohibit abortion at 15 weeks. The Wisconsin bill comes with a catch, though. The proposal calls for a statewide referendum conducted during April's election asking voters whether the 14-week prohibition should take effect. If approved, the bill would take effect the day after the results are certified. If the question is rejected, the bill would not take effect. Wisconsin law does not allow voters to place questions on the ballot. Republican lawmakers have rejected Evers' calls to create a way for voters to repeal the 1849 abortion ban. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said in December that he would like to let voters decide whether to shrink the window for abortions. He said then that passing a new abortion law would end the uncertainty of waiting for judges to interpret outdated laws. Asked for comment Friday, Vos spokesperson Angela Joyce referred a reporter to Vos' December comments. Joyce released a statement on behalf of Rep. Amanda Nedweski, the bill's chief Assembly sponsor, later Friday afternoon. Nedweski said shrinking the window for an abortion could save lives. Britt Cudaback, a spokesperson for Evers, referred reporters Friday to comments Evers made last month in which he vowed to veto “any bill that makes reproductive health care any less accessible for Wisconsinites than it is right now.” “Which is what this bill aims to do,” Cudaback said. The measure may not even get to Evers. The bill would have to pass both the Assembly and the Senate before going to the governor. The Senate's Republican majority leader, Devin LeMahieu, said last week that it would be difficult to get his caucus to coalesce around an abortion bill that Evers would veto. LeMahieu spokesperson Brian Radday didn't immediately return a message Friday seeking comment.

"For 66 Years, Women in South Korea Have Been Fined or Jailed for Having Abortions. That May Be About to Change",Ideas;Kyung-eun Lee,Ideas;South Korea,"April 10, 2019 12:25 PM EDT","The place Jiyoung had an abortion was the last place on Earth she would have chosen to do it – if only she had had a choice. “Another woman had just undergone surgery before me in the same chair – it was soaked in blood,” recalls Jiyoung, who asked to use a pseudonym because of abortions being illegal and the stigma she would likely face if she went public. “I didn’t complain. I knew this was the only place I could get it done.” This harrowing scene is one that women and girls in South Korea face every day. Research by Pai Chai University estimated that up to half a million women and girls have illegal abortions each year in South Korea, while the government estimate around 50,000 were carried out in 2017. Abortion has been illegal under almost all circumstances for more than 66 years, and having an abortion is a criminal offense. This prevents accurate official data from being collected. More egregiously, the criminalization places women and girls in danger. Denied basic healthcare, they are left with no choice but to risk their physical and mental health with clandestine and unsafe abortions. But this could be about to change. On March 30, more than a thousand women braved a fierce gale and freezing conditions in Seoul to demand that the South Korean government end the country’s draconian ban on abortions. Now, women and girls across South Korea are calling on the government to swiftly reform the Criminal Act to guarantee access to safe and legal abortion services. Under current laws, women who terminate a pregnancy can face fines of up to KRW 2 million ($1,850) or one year in jail. Medical professionals who assist with abortions can face prison terms of up to two years if convicted. The only exceptions are in cases of rape, incest, specific diseases or genetic disorders, or if a woman’s or girl’s health is endangered by the pregnancy. Even in these limited instances, a woman must have the consent of her spouse to get an abortion. The criminalization of abortions in South Korea has led to discrimination and stigmatization for generations of women and girls. These laws leave women in one of Asia’s most “developed” countries being treated like second-class citizens. Now they are fighting back. The Saturday march was part of an unprecedented wave of women’s rights activism, marking a turning point for women fighting deeply rooted gender inequality in the country. All those taking to the streets share a fervent hope that an upcoming Constitutional Court judgment will transform the human rights of women and girls in South Korea. On Thursday afternoon, the court is likely to rule on a challenge brought by a doctor who was prosecuted for carrying out abortions. The verdict is set to have ramifications far beyond this one case. If the court decides that criminalizing abortion is unconstitutional, they are expected to order the government to reform the nation’s highly restrictive laws. It would be long overdue. As local women’s rights activist Jay told us: “The effects of criminalization are manifold. It violates women’s right to health in cases where they are having to undergo abortions in unsafe facilities, without the necessary counseling or support. “Many women also have to contend with male partners threatening to report them to the police and to their families if they are planning an abortion.” This shameful situation cannot go on, and South Korea seems to finally be waking up to this fact. The movement for decriminalization has steadily built up momentum since first gaining traction in 2016. In 2017, more than 235,000 people signed a petition calling for the ban on abortion to be lifted. In late 2018, a government commissioned poll showed that 75% of women wanted the law revised. At Amnesty International, we believe everyone should be free to make their own decisions about their reproductive lives, including when and if they have children. The statistics and research tell us that abortions will always happen in South Korea, regardless of the law. But currently, instead of undergoing the procedure in a safe environment, women and girls who want abortions must risk their freedom — and their physical and mental health. Among them are women like Jiyoung. “After the operation my bleeding was really severe, so I had to go back to that awful hospital that I would rather die than return to. The doctor and nurse paid little attention and offered no real explanation, even as a clump of blood fell out of me. What can you do in a place like that?” This is a position no woman should ever have to endure. It is time for South Korea to ensure they never have to again.

How Ronald Reagan Helped Abortion Take Over the Republican Agenda,Jonathan Bartho / Made by History;More from TIME,;History;Made by History,"April 12, 2024 9:00 AM EDT","Abortion is dominating the news once again, illustrating the political peril Republicans face on the issue.  On April 1, the Florida supreme court upheld a state abortion ban, which in turn triggered an even stricter ban that begins on May 1. Then, on April 8, Donald Trump reversed course and announced he would not support a federal abortion ban and that the matter should be left to the states. Yet Trump’s strategic flip on the issue did not signal that the GOP is abandoning its quest to ban abortion. That became clear within 48 hours when — after the Arizona supreme court found that the state’s almost total 1864 abortion ban was still the law of the land — Republicans in the state legislature thwarted an attempt to repeal it despite a national outcry. These recent events have emphasized how a zealous desire to restrict abortion rights has become a defining characteristic of the modern Republican Party. Yet, that wasn’t always the case. Even as late as the 1980s, Ronald Reagan’s GOP prioritized cutting taxes, reducing the size of government, and winning the Cold War, devoting little energy to fighting cultural battles. But despite this lack of enthusiasm, Reagan was instrumental in empowering a cultural and social conservatism with roots in the white South. This cultural conservatism now dominates the Republican Party and drives the war against abortion rights in 2024.  Historically, the GOP was the more liberal party on abortion — especially given the Democratic Party’s strong appeal to Catholics across the North. That began to change in the early 1970s, as various states loosened their abortion restrictions. At the national level, a Republican shift on abortion first became evident during Reagan’s dramatic 1976 primary challenge against President Gerald Ford.  Read More: Republicans' Lessons from Ohio After losing the first five presidential primaries, North Carolina became a must win for Reagan. He entrusted his campaign in the Tar Heel State to the North Carolina Congressional Club — the political machine of Senator Jesse Helms. A former Democrat, Helms had only joined the GOP six years earlier. He and his lieutenants devised a campaign centered on social and cultural issues, and Reagan stunned the incumbent president by six points.  The victory rescued Reagan's campaign, and demonstrated his popularity with southern conservative voters, donors, and strategists — many, like Helms, recently converted Democrats — who relished Reagan’s anti-statist rhetoric and despised Ford as an establishment moderate. As his campaign struggled to break through in the North, it was southern support that propelled Reagan all the way to the party convention in Kansas City. His Southern success gave Reagan’s backers significant influence as the GOP met to select a nominee and draft a platform.  At a pre-convention meeting, Helms and his allies formulated a range of right-wing policy positions that they wanted to force into the GOP platform. Alongside opposition to gun control and school busing to achieve racial integration, these southern Republicans demanded that their new party explicitly oppose legal abortion. Reagan, though far more focused on economic issues and foreign policy, owed so much of his success to Helms and his political machine that he reluctantly green-lighted their platform challenges.  In platform committee meetings, Ford’s team objected to the planks that the Helms forces were pushing. But wary of risking a delegate revolt that could cost the president the nomination, they too grudgingly acquiesced. Those strategic calculations resulted in a party in which most leaders, convention delegates, and voters were pro-abortion rights running on a platform that demanded a constitutional amendment banning abortion.  Though Reagan lost the nomination, Helms was delighted that he and his allies “were able to project the conservative message to millions of Americans” and make the Republican platform “the most conservative in recent memory.” But he couldn’t have imagined just how profound their impact would be. From that point on, opposition to abortion became a non-negotiable tenet of Republican orthodoxy. Between 1976 and 1980, the emergence of the Christian Right — a largely southern phenomenon and a vehicle for the region’s conservative values and priorities — as an influential GOP voting bloc acted to further cement a national abortion ban as a key element of the Republican Party’s agenda. The anti-abortion campaign, previously led by Catholic groups and hampered by disputes and disagreements, quickly came to be directed by Christian Right organizations that were both politically astute and media savvy.  The rising importance of the movement’s leaders meant that Reagan needed their support in his bid for the 1980 presidential nomination, and he artfully deployed moralistic and evangelical rhetoric to win them over. In August 1980, Reagan addressed Christian Right leaders at the National Affairs Briefing and allied himself with their cause by declaring “I know that you can’t endorse me, but… I want you to know that I endorse you.” Yet, crucially, Reagan maintained a marked distance from the Christian Right’s anti-abortion demands — his speech did not mention the topic once. It set the tone for a presidency in which Reagan’s Administration showed little interest in the abortion issue. While Helms repeatedly attempted to pass anti-abortion legislation in the Senate — with vociferous backing from the Christian Right — Reagan offered nothing more than occasional supportive rhetoric, preferring instead to focus on pursuing his economic priorities. Behind the scenes, Reagan aides expressed relief that they were able to avoid becoming entangled in controversial social issues and had limited themselves to providing only “passive support.” But anger was steadily rising among southern conservatives and Christian Right leaders. In a furious letter to the White House in 1981, Moral Majority vice president Cal Thomas mocked Reagan’s famous “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” question from the 1980 campaign. If the administration continued “allowing the slaughter of one and one-half million unborn babies a year,” he argued, “I will not be able to say that we are better off at all.” With almost no support coming from the White House, efforts to ban abortion ultimately made no substantial progress during the Reagan Administration. But that obscures the role Reagan played in making the anti-abortion rights cause central to the GOP’s agenda and, ultimately, in rolling back abortion rights.  Read More: What to Know About the Arizona Supreme Court Abortion Ban Ruling The Christian Right took an important lesson from the failures of the 1980s. Anti-abortion crusaders needed to shift their focus from Congress to the Supreme Court and the appointment of conservative justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. Here, Reagan’s record drew plaudits from both southern conservatives and Christian Right leaders. While two of his three appointees to the Court — Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy — proved to be moderate conservatives, his third, Justice Antonin Scalia, became a powerful judicial ally for opponents of abortion and an influential force in pushing the Court to the right on social issues.  More broadly, Reagan reshaped the federal judiciary, working to appoint younger, more conservative judges, and ultimately appointing almost half of all federal judges during his eight years in office. Alongside the appointment of Scalia, shifting the previously liberal federal judiciary dramatically rightward was, in the eyes of Moral Majority president Jerry Falwell, Reagan’s “chief legacy.” It was this conservative revolution in the judiciary that eventually provided the avenue for opponents of abortion to achieve their aims.  Reagan’s public embrace of the Christian Right brought the movement political credibility, firmly anchoring them in the Republican Party and moving the social and cultural values of the white South to the forefront of American political debate. Likewise, his deliberate appeals to disaffected southern Democrats in 1976 and 1980 — including newspaper advertisements targeting George Wallace supporters in Texas and appearances with Mississippi’s former Democratic governor John Bell Williams — were vital in convincing conservative white southerners that the GOP was a viable political home after generations of their region being a Democratic stronghold. With Reagan in the White House, conservative southerners regained a status of acceptance and prominence in Washington that they had not enjoyed since the early 1960s. Simply by paying lip service to the southern conservative agenda, Reagan helped the anti-abortion push to garner strength and influence within the GOP. Yet as the Republican Party’s electoral grip on the white South tightened, and without the charismatic leadership of Reagan to unite the party, the divide between Reaganite fiscal conservatives and southern cultural conservatives deepened from the 1990s onwards. As southern conservatives increasingly became the dominant force in the party, the Republican leadership lost their ability to control an ever-more confrontational and demanding base.  The result is that anti-abortion rights forces dominate the GOP in 2024. By allying with southern conservatives, Ronald Reagan helped to empower a cultural conservatism in the GOP that eventually overwhelmed his own political agenda. And when Jesse Helms and his southern conservative allies forced opposition to abortion into the GOP platform in 1976, it proved to be a crucial early step in transforming the identity of the Republican Party.

Supreme Court Will Hear Challenge to Idaho’s Near-Total Abortion Ban,Nik Popli,Politics;Supreme Court,"April 23, 2024 7:00 AM EDT","The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a case on whether Idaho can enforce its near-total abortion ban in medical emergency situations under a federal law that requires most hospitals to treat patients with life-threatening conditions. The case marks the second abortion-related challenge to come before the Justices this term, following the Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in a 2022 ruling that left abortion policy to the states. Legal experts anticipate that the Court's ruling in the Idaho case, called Moyle v. U.S., could establish a significant precedent regarding whether emergency medical care can be denied to a pregnant woman in distress in order to save the fetus. At the heart of the case lies the clash between Idaho’s stringent abortion restrictions and the  federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates hospitals to stabilize patients facing life-threatening conditions regardless of their ability to pay. Idaho contends that EMTALA's language requires equal treatment for both the pregnant patient and the ""unborn child,"" arguing that its near-total abortion ban does not conflict with federal legislation. The Justices must decide whether they believe Idaho’s law conflicts with the federal EMTALA law. If they do, then the fundamental legal question they will have to consider is whether federal law supersedes state law when the two are in conflict, says Jill Habig, a former legal adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris in the California Attorney General’s office who now runs the Public Rights Project. While courts have consistently ruled in favor of federal law under the Supremacy Clause, the Idaho case attempts to challenge this bedrock principle. “What we've learned post-Dobbs, and especially with this right-wing court, is that things that should be simple legally are not actually simple in practice,” Habig says.  The legal battle in Idaho is part of a broader wave of challenges following the 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, when a so-called “trigger” law automatically came into effect in Idaho prohibiting all abortions except in cases where it is deemed necessary to prevent the mother's death. In legal filings, Idaho has noted that the term ""abortion"" is absent from the EMTALA statute enacted by Congress in 1986, arguing that abortion care was not intended as one of the required stabilizing treatments under the law. The statute does, however, include the phrase ""unborn child,"" which the state contends necessitates consideration of the fetus's well-being when addressing medical emergencies. Read More: How Kate Cox Became a Reluctant Face of the Abortion-Rights Movement “Idaho law is perfectly consistent with EMTALA, which provides explicit protections for ‘unborn children’ in four separate places,” the state’s Republican Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement. “The notion that EMTALA requires doctors to perform abortions is absurd.”  Lawyers for Idaho contend that the federal law only requires doctors to administer stabilizing treatments that are ""available"" at a particular hospital, and since abortion is largely prohibited under state law, it is effectively unavailable.  The Biden Administration sued Idaho over its abortion ban in 2022, resulting in a temporary injunction preventing its enforcement in emergency care situations, but the case has raised questions about the ongoing struggle between federal and state authority in shaping reproductive healthcare policy. Should the court side with Idaho's interpretation, it would mark the first instance of a federal statute granting individual rights to a fetus and could pave the way for other Republican-led states to enact similar bans even in emergency situations. Fourteen states have already banned abortion since the fall of Roe v. Wade, and while each of these bans include some kind of exception for the mother’s life, patients, doctors, and lawyers have run into challenges interpreting the statutes’ language. Many states permit abortions in a “medical emergency” but do not offer a concrete definition of that term, says Molly Duane, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights. As a result, some women seeking abortions have been turned away from hospitals in life-threatening situations.  “What we know from the real experiences of patients and medical providers is that doctors are terrified to rely on these exceptions when years of prison time and loss of their medical license are on the line,” Duane says, adding that Idaho’s abortion law could enable state officials to challenge doctors on whether their patient is close enough to death to receive an abortion. Read More: What Blocking Emergency Abortion Care in Idaho Means for Doctors Like Me Several Idaho-based medical providers wrote in amicus briefs that the state’s abortion law does not match up with common medical judgment, forcing doctors to violate their oath and delay medical care until their patient’s condition deteriorates to the point that an abortion is necessary to save their lives. Some OB-GYNs have decided to leave Idaho over fear of being prosecuted for treating patients, according to the briefs. “There is no practice of OB-GYN in which abortion as a health saving life-saving measure can be taken out,” says Dr. Caitlin Gustafson, a family medicine obstetrician in Idaho and co-president of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare.  The outcome of the Supreme Court’s latest abortion-related case is poised to send a signal to states regarding their autonomy in shaping abortion policy. A ruling in favor of Idaho, legal experts say, could enable other states to pass strict abortion bans with fewer exceptions.  “We've seen across the country a race from anti-abortion states to pass more and more extreme bans,” Habig says, “and I think we can expect other states to follow Idaho's lead if the Supreme Court allows Idaho to trump federal law and women's health.” Write to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com",https://time.com/6969108/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban-case/
Biden and Trump Clash Over Abortion in First Presidential Debate,Chantelle Lee,Politics;2024 Elections,"June 27, 2024 10:55 PM EDT","President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump clashed over abortion in the first presidential debate for the 2024 election Thursday night. The two candidates traded barbs with one another when CNN moderator Dana Bash asked where they stood on abortion early on in the debate. Biden committed to restoring Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that protected the right to abortion in the U.S. in 1973 and was overturned in 2022. Meanwhile, Trump, who has said that he wouldn’t sign a federal abortion ban but would let states monitor women’s pregnancies and prosecute people who violate their restrictive laws, applauded the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe while adding that he would support exceptions to abortion bans for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. “It’s bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders,” Trump said. “Everybody wanted it brought back. And many Presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it.” “The idea,” Biden shot back later, “that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about women’s health is ridiculous.” Read More: TV Debates Have Always Been About Sound Bites Over Substance When asked about his stance on abortion pills, after the Supreme Court struck down a challenge to the pregnancy termination pill mifepristone this month, Trump said that he wouldn’t block the medications. But he repeatedly slammed Biden for vowing to restore Roe, erroneously saying that doing so would allow doctors under the Biden administration to “take the life of the baby in the ninth month, and even after birth.” (Abortions don’t happen “after birth,” which would be infanticide, a crime in all states.) Abortions later in pregnancy are rare—in 2021, less than 1% of abortions took place after 21 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Biden condemned Trump’s role in the overturning of Roe, as Trump appointed three of the justices that ruled in favor of overturning it. “It’s been a terrible thing what you’ve done,” Biden said to Trump. The President lambasted abortion restrictions, zeroing in on Republican-led states—like Georgia, where Thursday night’s debate took place—that ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many women even know if they’re pregnant. Trump argued that “everybody, without exception, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives” wanted Roe to be repealed so that states could individually make their own laws on abortion. Biden called that claim “just ridiculous,” arguing that “the vast majority of constitutional scholars” supported Roe when it was first decided. Many polls have shown that Americans now largely support legal abortion. Reproductive rights groups took to social media during the debate, railing against Trump for his comments on abortion. Planned Parenthood Action posted on X: “This disinformation about abortion is meant to confuse people and distract from what Trump and his allies really want to do—ban all abortions.” Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/6993365/biden-trump-abortion-first-presidential-debate-2024/
Donald Trump’s Abortion Logic Is Totally 100% Right,Ideas;Jill Filipovic,Ideas;abortion,"March 31, 2016 4:28 PM EDT","The success of Donald Trump stems from one major factor: the perception that he tells it like it is because he’s beholden to no one. Whether Trump actually does tell the truth is a different question—one more often answered in the negative—but Wednesday, he did something rare for a Republican politician: he told the truth, saying that if abortion were illegal, women should be punished. (He later walked back his comments). Commentators on the left erupted with outrage, and on the right with denial. “No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion,” said Jeanne Mancini, President of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund in a statement. “We have never advocated, in any context, for the punishment of women who undergo abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser of the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List in a statement. “Punishment is solely for the abortionist who profits off of the destruction of one life and the grave wounding of another.” And so went the usual anti-abortion claims: Outlawing abortion should punish abortion providers, not women. Women who have abortions are ignorant victims, coerced or tricked into forsaking their true desire for motherhood by greedy doctors who exploit them for financial gain. These are lies. But they also reveal an important idea underpinning the anti-abortion-rights movement in the U.S.: It’s not about the life of the embryo or fetus. It’s certainly not about helping or protecting women. It’s about hostility to women’s social advancement, which has been rapid, and which would have been wholly impossible without access to contraception and abortion. And it’s not just Trump whose antipathy toward women’s rights and freedoms plays out particularly pronouncedly around abortion rights. It’s Ted Cruz, it’s the anti-abortion movement, and it’s most of the Republican Party. The argument that women would not or should not go to jail for abortion is absurd when one notes that there are women in the United States who have, in fact, gone to jail for abortion; some are sitting in jail right now. Jennifer Whalen, a mother in Pennsylvania, was prosecuted for getting abortion-inducing drugs for her daughter. Purvi Patel is currently sitting in an Indiana prison for allegedly self-inducing her own abortion. And it’s not just abortion. Prosecutors have charged dozens of women with serious crimes including drug trafficking and murder for using drugs while pregnant. When South Carolina passed a law in 1997 qualifying fetuses as persons and harm to them as child abuse, the Attorney General’s Office announced it would prosecute women who had post-viability abortions for any reason, and that it would charge them with murder and potentially seek the death penalty. If a woman takes drugs and has a miscarriage or her child dies soon after birth, she faces jail time in many parts of the U.S. Do we really believe that a woman who pays someone to end her pregnancy won’t be treated the same way? When you make something illegal, it comes with penalties—this is how criminal law works. It’s certainly how it works in El Salvador, where women are in jail, some for having miscarriages the state believes were abortions. It’s how it works in Rwanda, where rape survivors sit in prison for ending their pregnancies. It’s how it works in Ecuador, Malaysia, Mexico, Bolivia, the Philippines—the list of where ending a pregnancy can land you behind bars goes on. American anti-abortion advocates say they would target abortion providers instead of women, because it’s apparently more acceptable to throw doctors in prison for providing care that saves women’s lives every single day. Even if you think that sounds OK, it belies an ignorance of how illegal abortion often works. Trained clinicians able to provide safe and legal abortions, like we have at women’s health clinics across America, are luxuries unimaginable to many women worldwide. Today, in places where abortion is outlawed, there are still some illicit providers who offer surgical abortions. But more often there’s no trained doctor at all: There’s a sister, a mother, a friend, a classmate, a friendly pharmacist, who helps to get misoprostol or other abortion-inducing pills into the hands of a pregnant woman. When these pills are legit and the woman adheres to protocols for misoprostol use approved by the World Health Organization, these clandestine abortions are often very safe and effective, which is why far fewer women die of unsafe abortions today than they did two decades ago. Other times, though, there’s the woman who throws herself down the stairs, or asks her boyfriend to punch her in the stomach, or takes a tincture or tea her auntie says will make her period come, or inserts a stick or a knitting needle or a fireplace poker into her vagina. In other words, it’s often the woman herself who is the abortion provider. When it’s not her, it’s often her friends and her family and her loved ones. Jail abortion providers and you are jailing women and the people who love them. It’s also worth noting that when you make abortion illegal, any death of a fetus or embryo becomes suspect. Just as the death of an infant may lead doctors and law enforcement to suspect child abuse and engage in an investigation, so, too, would miscarriages have to cue scrutiny into the woman’s actions. Anti-abortion activists are also not satisfied to simply outlaw abortion; they want to enshrine into law that personhood exists at the moment of fertilization (they’ve tried to pass such laws in a handful of states, and they’ve failed miserably). That certainly fits with their narrative that life not only begins at conception, but that a fertilized egg is a human being deserving of life and respect and legal protection. It’s an ideologically tidy argument, but it gets messy when confronted with real life. Most fertilized eggs never make it to birth. About half never implant in the uterine wall and are naturally flushed out of a woman’s body, which is why actual medical doctors define pregnancy at the point of implantation, not fertilization. Others do implant, but are lost in early miscarriages, many of which go unnoticed. Still others implant outside of the uterus, often in the fallopian tubes, where they can never grow into a baby but can rupture and kill the woman carrying them. And others develop further, turning into fetuses that are lost in later miscarriages. Establish personhood at the moment of fertilization, and you’ve got an astronomical death rate on your hands. This, too, points to a fundamental inconsistency in the mainstream anti-abortion view: If a fertilized egg really is a human being, imbued with as much of a right to life as you or I, where are the efforts to curb such a high death rate? Why the focus on abortion, which ends the lives of far fewer embryos and fetuses than Mother Nature herself? The response from anti-abortion advocates here is that the millions and millions of fertilized egg deaths are natural, while abortion is intentional. Nowhere else, though, is this the standard for protecting human life. Children in the U.S. used to die in relatively high numbers from natural causes, and so did women in childbirth, and so still do people die from cancer and AIDS and Alzheimer’s and heart disease; we have not collectively shrugged our shoulders and said that it’s natural so we won’t worry about it. Billions of dollars have been put into global efforts to fight the kinds of preventable diseases that kill millions of children, and billions more into researching vaccines and treatments and cures. Yet there has been no concerted anti-abortion effort to demand research funding into why all of these fertilized eggs die, or to find a cure. Perhaps that’s because even the most active anti-abortion advocates know the truth is that a fertilized egg is not the same as a 3-year-old, and they do not genuinely believe that it has the same right to life. Want more evidence? There is now a wealth of research on what decreases the abortion rate and what increases it. One thing that doesn’t seem to have much of an impact is legality. When abortion is legal, abortions happen; when it’s illegal, abortions continue to happen, they just happen clandestinely. Some of them are safe, but others aren’t, and many women end up hurt or dead.   What has been shown over and over to decrease the abortion rate is access to affordable contraception, especially long-acting methods like IUDs; the countries with the lowest abortion rates in the world not only offer abortion legally and often for free, but also make birth control easy to get, offer comprehensive sex education in schools, and don’t rely primarily on shame or fear to keep young people from having sex. Yet not a single major American anti-abortion organization supports affordable contraception access. None of them advocate for comprehensive sex ed. Instead, many of them actively oppose birth control, particularly the most reliable kinds. In Colorado, for example, an innovative family planning program gave free IUDs to more than 30,000 women who wanted them. The state immediately saw 40% drop in unintended pregnancies and a 35% decline in abortions, and saved taxpayers $80 million in Medicaid costs. Seems like the definition of a successful anti-abortion, cost-saving program, something one would think the GOP would trumpet. Instead, anti-abortion groups opposed it, and so Republican politicians cut it. Why? Because as one pastor put it, abstinence until marriage and then embracing as many children as God gives you is the only acceptable way to live your life, and “Let us turn to God, and not to the state, to find the best ways for ourselves and our children.” Restricting access to birth control and abortion is one of the most effective ways to stymy women’s successes and freedoms. Today, the average American woman gets married at 26, at which point she has had close to a decade of sexual experiences. All around the world, the age of sexual initiation is more or less the same—in one’s mid to late teens. The question isn’t whether and when young people have sex; it’s whether sex leads to pregnancy and childbearing, and then whether having a child derails women’s life plans and goals. On an individual level, there are some young women who are able to give birth young and still stay on an upwardly mobile path—graduating high school, going to college, getting a job. But that’s not the norm. More often, early childbearing means it’s all the harder to stay in school and later to have the freedom to pursue whatever one wants. These are burdens that have always fallen on young women, while young men have remained at liberty to move up in the world. Certainly if young women choose to have and continue pregnancies, they should not only have that right, but should also have the kind of social support that will allow them to parent and to stay afloat—social support programs that, notably, anti-abortion Republicans routinely try to cut.The plan, again, isn’t to make parenthood easier or to make motherhood safer. It’s to keep women constrained into a role conservative lawmakers have decided is better for them, against all the evidence provided by women themselves. Look around: When you offer women options and freedoms, they take them. And many women know better than anyone that birth control—and abortion access, if that birth control fails—are what offer them financial security, the future they strive for, and the family they want to build. Because very little of the broader anti-abortion view is politically convenient, you see anti-abortion groups falling back on the claim that fertilized eggs are people and abortion is murder. Which brings us back to Donald Trump.  If anti-abortion advocates sincerely believe abortion is murder, they should also say that women have to be punished for it. If a fetus is the same as a 5-year-old, then a woman who ends a pregnancy should be just as guilty of murder as a woman who pays a hit man to kill her kindergartener. Claiming ignorance that murder was murder wouldn’t work. It’s an ugly thought, and it’s electorally and socially unpopular, and that’s why some of them don’t say it out loud; others realize that while they may find abortion morally wrong, they don’t in their heart of hearts believe removing an embryo from a woman’s body is the same as slaughtering a 5-year-old. But start making those kinds of distinctions and the whole case against abortion falls apart. The outrageous thing isn’t Donald Trump’s original comment. It’s that so few in the mainstream political establishment have bothered to interrogate the reality of the anti-abortion position and its stranglehold on Republican Party policies. When you do, you see that punishing women for making their own reproductive choices isn’t a defective, offensive answer. It’s the entire plan.

What Blocking Emergency Abortion Care in Idaho Means for Doctors Like Me,Ideas;Caitlin Gustafson,Ideas;health,"April 19, 2024 7:00 AM EDT","On April 24, the Supreme Court will hear arguments weighing whether Idaho politicians have the power to block doctors from giving emergency medical care to patients experiencing pregnancy complications—a case that will open the door for other states to prohibit emergency reproductive care and worsen medical infrastructure for people across the board. Once again, politicians have set up a case that could have devastating impacts on the ability of doctors to provide--and for pregnant women to receive--essential reproductive health care. I’m a family physician who’s practiced medicine in rural Idaho for more than 20 years, where I’ve had the opportunity to guide hundreds of patients through their pregnancies. It’s no exaggeration when I say that my state’s health care system is in crisis, thanks in enormous part to our near-total abortion ban. Now, instead of trying to salvage what’s left, Idaho politicians are looking to hasten our downward spiral, making it even harder for doctors like me to provide care to patients in need. I can only hope that the Court will take into account that it’s not just abortion at stake in this case—it’s the future of emergency room care and medicine altogether.   Rural health care has always faced challenges, but in the nearly two years since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it’s gotten exponentially worse. In Idaho, we’ve lost nearly a quarter of our obstetricians since the state’s abortion ban went into effect—colleagues and friends who got into medicine to help people are being forced out of practicing obstetrics in our state. They realized it was impossible to provide adequate care while under the thumb of politicians more interested in advancing their extremist agenda than protecting the health of their constituents.  Idaho’s abortion ban makes it a crime for anyone to perform or assist with performing an abortion in nearly all circumstances. The ban does not even include an exception for when a person’s health is at risk—only for when a doctor determines that an abortion is necessary to prevent the pregnant person’s death. Ask any doctor and they'll tell you that this ""exception"" leads to more questions than answers. Read More: ‘Am I a Felon?’ The Fall of Roe v. Wade Has Permanently Changed the Doctor-Patient Relationship Patients need an emergency abortion for a wide range of circumstances, including to resolve a health-threatening miscarriage. But there is no clear-cut legal definition under the ban of what exactly that looks like or when we can intervene, and doctors—operating under the threat of prosecution—have no choice but to err on the side of caution. “Can I continue to replace her blood loss fast enough? How many organ systems must be failing? Can a patient be hours away from death before I intervene, or does it have to be minutes?” These are the callous questions doctors are now forced to think through, all the while our patient is counting on us to do the right thing and put their needs first. As a result, pregnant patients sometimes make repeated trips to the ER because they’re told time and time again that nothing can be done for them until their complications get more severe. Imagine if someone you love had a 104-degree fever but you were told nothing could be done until it spiked to 106 and your organs were failing. Requiring patients to get right up to the point of no return before administering care is not sound medical policy—it’s naked cruelty, and it’s only going to get worse as long as we allow extremism, not science, to run rampant in our statehouses and trample over our safe system of care. It also violates a longstanding federal law—the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)—that requires hospitals to treat emergencies before they become life-threatening. That’s exactly why the U.S. Department of Justice sued Idaho soon after the state’s abortion ban took effect. The lawsuit argues only that Idaho must allow doctors to provide abortions in medical emergencies when that is the standard stabilizing care, but even that proved too much for state leaders.  Instead, Idaho politicians fought the DOJ all the way up to the Supreme Court. How the Supreme Court rules will have broad implications that will reverberate throughout the country. If the Court holds that federal law no longer protects pregnant people during emergencies, it will give anti-abortion politicians across the country the green light to deny essential abortion care, push providers to leave states where the choices made with their patients can be second-guessed by prosecutors, and continue this cycle of inhumanity for patients.  As we’ve seen in Idaho, policies guided by anti-abortion extremism make health care worse for everyone. This assault on abortion has not ended with abortion—rather, it has extended to more of our rights and health care, with birth control, IVF, prescription drugs, and now emergency medical care all at risk.   This must stop.  For nearly 40 years, federal law has guaranteed that patients have access to necessary emergency care, including when a pregnancy goes horribly wrong. The Supreme Court must uphold this law and ensure pregnant people continue to get the care they need when they need it most. The health of my patients in West Central Idaho—and millions of other Americans across the country—deserve nothing less.

What to Know About the Arizona Supreme Court Abortion Ban Ruling,Solcyré Burga;What the Arizona Supreme Court decision says;What does it mean for women and abortion providers?;Will there be a ballot initiative?,U.S.;Arizona,"April 9, 2024 5:48 PM EDT","The Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year-old abortion ban on Tuesday that would prohibit nearly all abortions in the state except when “necessary to save” a pregnant person’s life.  The decision reversed a previous Arizona Court of Appeals ruling that allowed abortion to remain legal in the state up to 15 weeks, in accordance with a 2022 law, according to Planned Parenthood.  “Make no mistake, by effectively striking down a law passed this century and replacing it with one from 160 years ago, the Court has risked the health and lives of Arizonans,” said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes in a press statement Tuesday, before adding that her office would not be prosecuting any physician or woman under the “draconian law.”  The near-total abortion ban was written before Arizona was officially a state and before women could vote. The ban, which dates back to 1864, would sentence abortion providers to two to five years in prison for providing an abortion. Additional sanctions could be issued to physicians who perform abortions after 15 weeks.  The ban won’t go into effect just yet—as the court stayed its enforcement for 14 days.  “Arizonans deserve the right to make personal decisions about their reproductive health care, free from government interference. We are devastated by today’s ruling but we remain committed to defending reproductive freedom in the courts, at the legislature, as well as in communities across the state towards the passage of the Arizona for Abortion Access Act this November,” said Jared Keenan, legal director of the ACLU of Arizona, in a press release. “The urgency to enshrine the right to abortion in our state’s constitution has never been more necessary.”  The Arizona Supreme Court decision would make it so that “all abortions, except those necessary to save a woman’s life, are illegal,” according to the ruling. There are no exceptions for rape and incest.  “We conclude that [Arizona’s law] does not create a right to, or otherwise provide independent statutory authority for, an abortion that repeals or restricts [the law], but rather is predicated entirely on the existence of a federal constitutional right to an abortion since disclaimed by Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization,” the court said in its opinion. “Absent the federal constitutional abortion right, and because [the law] does not independently authorize abortion, there is no provision in federal or state law prohibiting [the law’s] operation. Accordingly, [Arizona’s law] is now enforceable.” The act has been criticized by several politicians, including the president. “Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest,” President Biden said in a Tuesday press release.  Planned Parenthood says that abortion through 15 weeks will remain accessible “for a limited period of time” because of a separate lawsuit filed in October 2022. In that case, the Maricopa County Superior Court ruled that the state cannot enforce the abortion ban until 45 days after the Arizona Supreme Court made a decision, per Planned Parenthood. That means the ban would not go into effect until June.    “This decision will result in a legal chilling effect on Arizonans who wish to obtain abortion services regardless of the circumstances that lead to their decision, and for those in the medical community who might provide them,” said Pima County Attorney Laura Conover, a party in the case in an emailed statement.“The result of this will ultimately cause an increase in unsafe abortions and threaten the liberties of those involved because the criminalization of abortions will not end the need or desire of those who seek services.”  Arizona for Abortion Access, made up of a number of reproductive rights organizations, is pushing for a constitutional amendment that would give a right to abortion care until fetal viability, or the 24th week of pregnancy. Abortions would be provided after that point if a health care provider says an abortion is necessary to “protect the life or the physical or mental health of the pregnant individual,” under the ballot initiative.  Arizona abortion advocates need to get 384,000 valid signatures by July 3 if they want to put abortion on the ballot this November. Organizers said they exceeded the signature threshold by more than 100,000, but have a goal of 800,000, according to NBC News. The signatures still have to be certified.  Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/6965338/arizona-supreme-court-abortion-ban/
Clarence Thomas Signals Same-Sex Marriage and Contraception Rights at Risk After Overturning Roe v. Wade,Madeleine Carlisle;Julia Zorthian,Politics;Supreme Court,"June 24, 2022 2:45 PM EDT","In his opinion concurring with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the high court should revisit all cases built on similar legal footing—including cases that guarantee the right to contraception, same-sex consensual sexual relations, and same-sex marriage. All three cases—and numerous other landmark decisions—are built upon the right to substantive due process found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, which prohibit the government from depriving “any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” In 1973, the Supreme Court held it was the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that protected a woman’s right to an abortion before fetal viability—the point around 24 weeks of pregnancy where a fetus can survive outside the womb. Since a leaked draft opinion previewed the overturn of Roe in May, progressives have been sounding the alarm that other rights rooted in substantive due process could be similarly under threat. Read More: Supreme Court Overturns Roe v. Wade, Undoing Constitutional Right to Abortion In his majority opinion released Friday, Justice Samuel Alito attempted to assuage those concerns, writing that the Supreme Court “stated unequivocally that ‘[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.’” Thomas signed on to the majority opinion, but wrote a separate concurrence in which he argued all other decisions rooted in the Due Process Clause should be reconsidered by the Supreme Court, hinting that he’d like Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization to be the first in a wave of cases overturning significant precedents. (A concurrence explains a Justice’s reasoning, but is not legally binding.). “I write separately to emphasize a second, more fundamental reason why there is no abortion guarantee lurking in the Due Process Clause,” Thomas wrote. “As I have previously explained, ‘substantive due process’ is an oxymoron that ‘lack[s] any basis in the Constitution.’” Thomas argues that the Constitution’s guarantee of due process before someone is denied the right to “life, liberty or property” has no bearing on what those rights actually encompass. The text of the Due Process Clause itself, he says, therefore “does not secure any substantive rights,” including a right to abortion. For that reason, he argues, the Supreme Court should “reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents.” The argument—which Thomas has made in previous writings—is a seismic departure from how the Supreme Court has historically approached the right to due process. For a century and a half the court has interpreted the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to protect people’s substantive rights, and has built a growing list of liberties entitled to protection. Those rights include the rights to contraception (Griswold v. Connecticut, 1965), same-sex consensual relations (Lawrence v. Texas, 2003) and same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015)—all of which Thomas explicitly named in his opinion as worth revisiting. Thomas’ concurrence is “an ominous preview of how far the Supreme Court may go to undermine existing constitutionally protected rights,” argues Katherine L. Kraschel, a reproductive justice lecturer at Yale Law School. “There are things that we may take for granted that will no longer be guaranteed.” But Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, urges caution. She says that since Thomas’ concurring opinion is not binding, and because no other justice joined him on it, it is fair to conclude the majority of Justices are committed to substantive due process and believe that it does protect against certain fundamental rights. What those rights actually are could still be up for debate, other legal experts say. While Alito wrote in Dobbs that the decision should not necessarily impact other precedent, the opinion still adopts a methodology that implies cases like Griswold and Obergefell were wrongly decided, says Kermit Roosevelt, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania. Alito argues the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in U.S. history and tradition, and one could potentially make the same argument about the right to access contraception or to same-sex marriage, he explains. Read More: The Fight Over Abortion Has Only Just Begun Dobbs is the first time the Supreme Court has overruled a protection rooted in substantive due process since the 1930s, and in so doing it has opened the door to overturning other rights rooted in similar legal principles, argues Bertrall Ross, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. Prior to Dobbs, the court was responsive to social movements and shifts in public opinion, among other factors, when deciding whether a right was protected by the Due Process Clause, explains Ross. Since the Constitution is open-ended, the argument went, the high court can read rights into the Constitution that are not explicitly stated—such as the right to marry, or the right to privacy. But the Dobbs decision shows that “the majority of the current court is much more interested in history and what the Constitution and its provisions meant when they were ratified,” says Ross. “Furthermore, the majority of this Court does not appear to see itself as being bound by precedent. As a result, every case that protected substantive rights under the Due Process Clause would appear to be fair game for the Supreme Court to revisit and undo.” “The court is on a devastating path,” argues Laurence Tribe, Professor of Constitutional Law emeritus at Harvard, “that is likely to jeopardize literally all of the basic bodily integrity rights that people have come to rely on.” Write to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com and Julia Zorthian at julia.zorthian@time.com",https://time.com/6191044/clarence-thomas-same-sex-marriage-contraception-abortion/
The Abortion Fight Isn’t a ‘War on Women.’ It’s a War on Poor Women,Made by History / R.E. Fulton,;History;Made by History,"April 15, 2024 9:00 AM EDT","On April 9, Arizona’s supreme court ruled that its 1864 almost total abortion ban remains in place. That came a week after Florida’s supreme court upheld an abortion ban, triggering an even stricter six-week ban. The onslaught of anti-abortion laws and court decisions has led liberals like California Governor Gavin Newsom to assert that the political right has declared “a war on women.”  This concept isn’t new, but it actually distorts the history of anti-abortion legislation. Abortion regulations have never applied equally to all doctors or all women. Understanding this history reveals that today — as in the past — abortion bans affect both women and providers differently depending upon factors like their race, class, and social standing. The people impacted most have changed over time, but one thing has remained consistent: abortion restrictions are less a war on women than a war on poor women.  The conditions that created these class and social dynamics began to emerge almost two centuries ago. In 1829, for example, New York State enacted a law defining abortion as second-degree manslaughter — but only if the woman was “pregnant with a quick child,” that is, if she’d felt the fetus moving inside of her, something that typically happened around 20 weeks.  In the late 1850s, that law — and others like it — came under attack by Boston doctor Horatio R. Storer. In an 1859 essay, he argued that these laws defined the crime of abortion too leniently. “By the Moral Law, THE WILFUL KILLING OF A HUMAN BEING AT ANY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE IS MURDER.” He also argued, without evidence, that women could face dire medical consequences from an abortion, including, on occasion, death.  But Storer wasn’t just worried about women as a universal class. He reserved his greatest scorn for white middle- and upper-class women, whom he claimed were seeking abortions in greater numbers than poor and immigrant women. He claimed that middle-class women boasted to each other about their successful abortions, in the same way they might brag about a new dress or a social coup. In Storer’s view, these women who sought abortions were not just victims of a purportedly dangerous medical procedure, but dangerous criminals who were outside the reach of the law.  Read More: What to Know About the Arizona Supreme Court Abortion Ban Ruling Storer’s anti-abortion activism occurred at a time when he and other “medical men” of similar social standing were attempting to professionalize medicine by implementing rigorous educational and training standards. As part of this push, these doctors hoped to take over what would become the lucrative fields of obstetrics and gynecology from female midwives and other providers they considered untrained and dangerous — those who Storer claimed “frequently cause abortion openly and without disguise.” In Storer’s view, white, educated “medical men” like him had to seek justice as “the physical guardians of women and their offspring.” It was their responsibility to “stand… in the breach fast making in the public morality, decency, and conscience.” Behind these righteous pronouncements, though, lurked Storer’s unspoken fear: that if men like him did not intervene, middle-class wives would shirk their childbearing duties, leaving their husbands without heirs while poor and immigrant families swelled their ranks.  Storer spent the latter part of the 1850s, and much of the 1860s, organizing letter-writing campaigns by new professional medical societies, including state affiliates of the American Medical Association (AMA). He hoped to pressure states into passing ever-stricter abortion bans. In New York, the effort paid off in 1869 when the legislature made abortion second-degree manslaughter at any stage of pregnancy if it resulted in the death of the mother or the termination of the pregnancy. In the fall of 1871, the new statute led to the conviction of abortion provider Jacob Rosenzweig for manslaughter in the death of Alice Bowlsby in New York City. Railway officials had found Bowlsby's body in a trunk bound for Chicago only days after the New York Times had published an exposé on abortionists, including Rosenzweig, titled “The Evil of the Age.”  The paper had described Rosenzweig as having a $40 degree, and purportedly knowing “more of the saloon business than of medicine.” Nonetheless, he did “a large business” — part of a “frightful profusion” of discreet abortions performed by untrained practitioners.  It took less than two hours for a jury to find Rosenzweig guilty, and a judge sentenced him to seven years’ hard labor in the Albany State Penitentiary, the maximum sentence possible.  Meanwhile, just weeks after Bowlsby's death, a young Albany waitress named Margaret Campbell died from an abortion performed by “Mrs. Dr. Emma Burleigh,” a well known abortionist. After colleagues of Burleigh’s tried to cover it up — including spiriting Campbell’s body away to an unmarked grave in the local cemetery — a second autopsy revealed that the young woman’s abdomen was inflamed, her uterus was missing, and her breasts were full of milk. A laceration was found in her vagina, “occupied by a clot of blood.” The outcome for Burleigh, however, was very different than for Rosenzweig. Under cross-examination at the coroner’s inquest, she got the doctors who performed the autopsy to admit that alternate explanations existed for all of their findings. There was no definitive proof that Campbell had been pregnant, that she’d had an abortion, or that the operation had caused her death. The jury agreed that the cause of death was simple peritonitis, and Burleigh walked free.  The disparity between the two cases was no accident. The abortion statute really wasn’t about protecting women from unqualified practitioners, nor was it a war on women, as Storer might have hoped. Instead, it was a weapon of class warfare.  Rosenzweig was a Jewish immigrant — a dangerous outsider. Meanwhile, Burleigh — who lied about having a medical degree in advertisements, but had taken medical classes — was an educated white woman. That made her less of a threat to the native-born doctors like Storer who were working to consolidate medical authority under their own control.  Class also separated the two victims: Newspaper accounts of Bowlsby’s death painted her as a young lady from “respectable society,” with “relatives in the highest circles.” In other words, she was an ideal victim for the villain of the immigrant doctor. Campbell, by contrast, was, in the words of one prominent abortion opponent, an obscure Irish waitress who was “evidently…not of correct moral habits.”   Read More: How Ronald Reagan Helped Abortion Take Over the Republican Agenda In 1872, New York toughened the law further, defining abortion as a felony with a possible sentence of 20 years in prison. Yet even under this law, wealthy, typically white women continued to seek and receive safe abortions. Often, it was trained male physicians of similar social and class standing who performed them without legal penalties. Strict enforcement of abortion laws didn’t ramp up until the mid-20th century, when medical care moved from private offices exclusive to a well-off clientele into public hospitals and clinics serving the poor along with the wealthy.  Understanding how New York’s abortion laws functioned in the 19th century creates a new perspective on abortion bans in 2024.  They, too, are far more of a weapon of class warfare than a war on all women.  Strict abortion bans are more likely to exist in states where a high number of women of childbearing age have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line. Of the five states with the highest levels of poverty among women of childbearing age —  Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, West Virginia, and New Mexico — all but New Mexico fall into the Guttmacher Institute’s  “most restrictive” abortion law category. Poverty strengthens the effects of abortion bans, since poor women can’t afford to miss work, book travel, arrange childcare, and pay out of pocket for procedures if they do not have health insurance.  Abortion bans also exacerbate poverty. A University of California San Francisco study found that women denied an abortion saw an increase in poverty for at least four years and were more likely to see drops in their credit scores. These impacts don’t hurt poor women in isolation: abortion bans also put their children, their husbands, and their wider communities at a disadvantage by making the cycle of poverty harder to escape.  By contrast, just as in the 19th century, wealthier women — those who have health insurance, who can afford a pharmaceutical or surgical copay, and who have the means to take time off work and travel to a state with more lenient regulations — are far more insulated from the most potent and cascading impacts of abortion bans. So, too, are their families and communities.   As in the 19th century, class, hand in hand with race, provides a more useful lens of analysis for understanding abortion legislation in the U.S. In restricting abortion, “medical men” like Storer worked to consolidate medical authority among the white upper classes. Today, it is often men from a similarly high social and class standing, serving in state legislatures and on courts, who are once again pushing for abortion restrictions that most adversely impact Americans with less social and economic capital.

How Kate Cox Became a Reluctant Face of the Abortion-Rights Movement,Charlotte Alter/Dallas,Politics;abortion,"March 27, 2024 12:06 PM EDT","In the tidy backyard of Kate Cox’s Dallas-area bungalow, there are two child-sized lawn chairs alongside two toddler bicycles, parked beneath a brick wall scrawled with chalk. There are two red-and-white stuffed horses in the playroom, and two sippy cups sitting in the sink. This is the joyful, messy life that Kate and Justin Cox always wanted. Everywhere you look, there are two of everything. The only problem is: there should have been three. Last year, the Coxes were thrilled to learn that Kate was pregnant again. They had always planned to have a large family—three, maybe even four kids. When Cox saw the positive pregnancy test in August, she ran into the playroom to tell Justin, who was wrestling on the floor with their three-year-old and 18-month-old. Justin immediately started planning: Would they need a bigger car? What would it mean for their finances? Kate didn’t share any of those worries. She was just excited. At first, the pregnancy progressed normally. The Cox family designed a little cartoon to announce the happy news to their tight-knit extended family. Kate went to her early prenatal appointments and scans, eager to find out whether the baby was a boy or a girl. When Cox was around 18 weeks pregnant, she got a phone call from her doctor while she was in the car. “She asked me if I was driving,” Kate recalls. “So I pulled the car over into an empty parking lot.” The doctor told her that the results of early screening tests indicated a risk of Trisomy 18, a life-threatening genetic condition. “I cried for a while in the car,” Cox says. “In the same phone call, she told us that we were having a girl.” It took weeks of additional testing, appointments with maternal fetal medicine specialists, terrifying ultrasounds, and excruciating waiting before doctors confirmed the diagnosis. “Each time we had an ultrasound, there was more bad news,” Cox recalls, speaking slowly during an interview in her living room in early March. “The neural tube, the heart, the brain, the skull, the limbs. It was hard, because when you looked it was very visible, and you could see on the ultrasound that she wasn't like our other babies. By the end, sometimes I couldn't look at the screen.” Trisomy 18 is almost always a fatal condition. In rare cases, babies with milder forms of the disease can survive for years, even into adolescence. But Cox’s doctor told her that there were so many malformations to her daughter’s brain, spine, and neural tube that the baby would probably die in utero. If not, she would be placed directly into hospice care after being born, where doctors did not expect her to survive more than a few days. “Every single case of Trisomy 18 I’ve seen has demised—if not in utero, then within hours to days after birth,” says Dr. Damla Karsan, Cox’s Ob-Gyn. “Even if they do survive, the standard of care is comfort care, do not resuscitate.” Read More: She Wasn't Able to Get An Abortion. Now She's a Mom. Soon She'll Start 7th Grade. The diagnosis also put Cox’s own health and future fertility at risk. Her pregnancy was becoming increasingly complicated. She went to the emergency room several times for cramping, elevated vitals, and fluid in her birth canal. If the baby died in utero, Cox could get a significant infection. And because she had delivered her first two children via C-section, a third delivery carried increased risk of uterine rupture. If she was induced or had another C-section, her doctor told her, she might never be able to have children again. “The more C-sections you have, the more risk of hysterectomy, hemorrhage, uterine rupture,” says Dr. Karsan. “She was at heightened risk.” Given the fatal diagnosis and her own medical history, Kate and Justin decided to terminate the pregnancy. “It was really painful, of course, because we wanted our baby so badly,” Cox says. “But we didn't want her to suffer, and the risks to me were too high. I also have two other babies and they need their mommy. So I had to make a decision with all of my babies in mind.” But abortion is illegal in Texas in all but the most urgent medical situations. Doctors who perform them face immense legal risks. And Cox’s physician told her that because the fetus still had a heartbeat, Cox probably did not qualify for a medical exception. “I couldn't believe that I wouldn't qualify, given the risk I faced in my pregnancy. My baby was not going to live,” she says, pausing to wipe away tears. “So I was really shocked that I couldn't get medical care here in Texas. I wanted to be in my home. I wanted to have my doctors that I trust close by. I wanted to be able to come home and hug my babies, and be close to my mom, and be able to cry on my own pillow.”  But that was not possible. And so, instead of becoming a mother of three, Kate Cox has become an unlikely national figure—the first pregnant woman in the midst of a health crisis to sue for the right to an abortion since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Now, months after she was forced to leave her home state to terminate her nonviable pregnancy, Cox is speaking out in detail for the first time about her experience. She has become a reluctant advocate for reproductive rights, the most prominent example of how abortion bans can endanger even women who desperately wanted to be mothers.   Before this ordeal, Kate and Justin Cox had never thought much about abortion. “I wanted a big family,” Kate says, sitting at her kitchen table, underneath a big print of a Madonna and Child. The living room is scattered with unicorn books; there’s a stuffed Olaf, the snowman from Frozen. “I just didn't think it was going to be something that would ever be in my life.” The Coxes weren’t especially political in general. Neither Kate nor Justin are reliable voters, they say, and don’t necessarily identify with either political party. Between raising two toddlers and working full-time jobs (Justin’s in IT; Kate works at a nonprofit), they were just “trying to stay afloat,” as Kate puts it. They didn’t pay much attention to the news. When the Supreme Court issued the Dobbs decision, it floated across their radars, but didn’t seem to matter very much to their lives. When Texas’s strict abortion ban went into effect shortly after, neither paid much attention, because they both assumed that there would be medical exceptions. When Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned that doctors who provided abortions could be held criminally liable, the news barely registered.  Once Cox’s doctor told her that she couldn’t get an abortion in Texas, Cox started Googling to learn more about the state law. That’s how she came across the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), a legal advocacy organization that had filed a lawsuit, Zurawski v. Texas, on behalf of 2 Ob-Gyns and 20 women in Texas who were denied abortion care, asking the court to clarify the scope of the state’s “medical emergency” exception to its abortion ban.  Cox sent a cold email to CRR, and was connected to Molly Duane, a senior staff attorney who is the lead attorney on the Zurawski case. Cox explained that her fetus had a fatal diagnosis and that her doctor had told her that because of her medical history, continuing the pregnancy carried risks for her own health and future fertility. Duane agreed to help her try to obtain an abortion in Texas.  CRR is representing dozens of patients challenging abortion restrictions in multiple states, but Cox’s case was different because she was currently pregnant and in medical crisis, says Nancy Northup, President of the Center for Reproductive Rights.  “Kate was the first time since Roe was overturned that a woman who was currently pregnant, needing an abortion under the health exemption, went to a court to get a court order for an abortion,” Northup says. Her situation, Northup says, exposes how some medical exceptions to abortion bans are written in a way that makes them nearly impossible to apply. “What Kate Cox’s case shows is that this argument of the states that they have exceptions to their blanket abortion bans for the health of the woman is false. They don’t have exceptions, and they won’t allow exceptions to be applied.” On Dec. 7, a Texas judge granted Cox a temporary restraining order, allowing her to terminate her pregnancy and shielding her doctors from prosecution under Texas law. But almost immediately, Attorney General Paxton petitioned the Texas Supreme Court to halt the lower court’s order, and threatened local hospitals with legal action if they allowed the abortion to proceed.  At that point, Kate was roughly 20 weeks pregnant. After a few days of waiting for a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court,she and Justin decided they couldn’t wait any longer. They left their two young children with relatives and went to New Mexico to terminate her pregnancy. On Dec. 12, she was finally able to get an abortion, but only after uprooting her life to travel out of state. “That experience added a lot of pain and suffering to what was already the hardest and most difficult time in our lives,” she says.  Before the termination, they named the baby Chloe Jones. “It was kind of a name that was in our hearts for our next baby girl,” Cox says with a small smile. “And she'll always be our baby.” The middle name was after Kate’s grandfather, she adds, “so that way she would know who to look for in heaven.” Months later, Cox finally feels like she can talk about the ordeal in detail. She recalls how the weeks between getting the Trisomy 18 diagnosis and finally terminating her pregnancy were excruciating. She would take her children to the grocery store, and people would smile at her and ask when she was due. Acquaintances would ask if she was having a baby shower. Her three-year old daughter was so excited about another sibling; she didn’t understand that there would not be a new baby coming home.  Although Kate did not want an abortion, she says she is “grateful” she was able to get one. “The alternative would have been worse,” she says. “I didn't want to have to wait until my baby died in my belly, or died during birth, or have to hold her in my arms as she suffocates or has a heart attack.”  The experience has opened Kate and Justin’s eyes to the ways their family could be affected by laws that seemed to have little to do with them. “As a nation we have a lot to learn about abortion,” says Cox. “Sometimes prayed for, wanted pregnancies end in abortion. It's medical care.” Kate’s trauma has made Justin think of abortion as much more than a women’s issue. “It impacts the fathers, just like it does mothers,” he says. “Don’t just shut your mind to it and think: this doesn't involve me. If you wait until it impacts you, then it’s too late.”  A few weeks after her abortion, Kate was chasing her kids and her nephew around her house when she saw a missed call from “Joseph Biden.” She thought it was a prank caller or a nasty heckler. But after a few text messages, she realized that the President and First Lady were, in fact, trying to reach her.  Read More: Biden's 2024 Strategy On Abortion. “I actually had my son on my hip, and he had peed through his diaper all down my side,” she says, laughing for the first time since our conversation began. “I certainly never thought I would get an opportunity to speak to the President. If I did, I didn't think it would be with pee down my side. That's how it goes for moms sometimes.” The President and First Lady “shared really kind words about what we went through as a family,” she recalls, and invited her to sit in the First Lady’s box at the President’s State of the Union on March 7.  Cox says the family doesn’t have concrete plans to do more explicit advocacy around abortion, but she does plan to “continue sharing our story when we can.” She says she’s “grateful” for the Biden Administration’s work on reproductive rights, and supports the work Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are doing around abortion access. “I don’t particularly enjoy being involved in politics,” Cox says. Right now, she doesn't have any plans to appear in any Biden ads ahead of the 2024 election. But, she adds: “Never say never.” And whether or not they choose to be in the public eye, both Coxes say they now plan to become regular voters, a political evolution that reflects the way in which abortion access has transformed from a question of feminist choice into a question of medical necessity. “What I've learned from this experience is that if you are pregnant, if you love someone that is pregnant, if you may become pregnant, you have to vote like your life depends on it,” Cox says. Justin adds that abortion access is now his “number one issue.”  Kate and Justin get up from the kitchen table and slip back into the familiar routine of busy parents with things to do. There’s trash that needs to be taken out, a dog that needs to be walked, two sippy cups that need to be washed. Their kids will be home soon.

What Trump’s Abortion Comments to TIME Reveal About His Plans For a Second Term,Philip Elliott,Politics;The D.C. Brief,"April 30, 2024 6:55 PM EDT","This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Eight years ago, the final Saturday before the Iowa caucuses brought forward all of the contradictions and chaos of then-reality star Donald Trump’s candidacy for the presidency. We stood in a chilly airplane hangar in Dubuque as the score from and Trump’s private 757 did a flyby. After an outdoor series of attacks against Sen. Ted Cruz—his chief rival at the time—and a 90-minute drive south, we were settling into the red-velvet theater seats of the Adler Theater in Davenport for a friendly Q&A sessions between Trump and his most unlikely of endorsers, then-Liberty University President Jerry Fallwell, Jr. In a nod to just how surreal the whole weekend had become, vendors had buckets of popcorn available, as if the first leg of the Republican presidential primary were on the level with a circus or county fair. That January day, we all thought we were watching a sideshow and not the main event. And when the thrice-married New York playboy who had years earlier proclaimed himself pro-choice was now promising to nominate judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade, there were plenty of people who didn't believe him. Trump spent the next four years proving those doubters wrong. As President, he pushed Congress to pass a 20-week abortion ban and appointed scores of anti-abortion judges, including three justices to the Supreme Court who made the end of Roe possible. For years now, many have assumed Trump supports finishing what he started, and restricting abortion access across the country.   But that's not where Trump's position lies anymore.  Flash forward to this month for the latest chapter of our collective struggle in understanding Trump and Trumpism, thanks to an exclusive interview between Trump and TIME’s Eric Cortallessa. The whole interview—and accompanying cover story—is worth the considered read, but one part cannot help but stand out. It’s an argument that seems to come from a different person than the man speaking on stage during that frigid weekend in western Iowa, but it’s what the undisputed leader of the Republican Party now says he believes: on abortion, Trump is now a nihilist.  Put simply: The current patchwork system in which every state’s abortion policy is different is exactly how things should remain in Trump’s mind. That state of affairs is bound to leave both supporters of reproductive rights unsatisfied as well as those who view terminating a pregnancy at any stage as tantamount to murder. In Trump 2.0’s America, red states gonna red state; blue states gonna blue.    Later in the interview, Eric pressed Trump on red states taking even more restrictive measures to prevent abortion access, like tracking pregnancies. Trump’s response was militantly laissez faire: “I think they might do that.” What about states prosecuting pregnant persons who defy an abortion ban? Trump said, “It’s irrelevant whether I’m comfortable or not. It's totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions.” Trump’s latest position is not all that dissimilar to how states have limits on gun rights or require car insurance. Trump and his advisers have decided that deep-red states should be free to enact a total ban on abortions if that is what they want, while allowing true-blue states to provide the procedure to their own whims. Basically, it’s a choose-your-own-future landscape that is defined by geography more than circumstance. One area where Trump can’t completely cede taking a position to states is abortion medication, which is regulated on the federal level and accounts for roughly two-thirds of terminated pregnancies. Trump initially punted on the issue, promising Eric an answer in 14 days. More than two weeks later, Eric asked Trump again about that in a phone call, and he punted again.  Perhaps Trump has always been this indifferent to this most hot-button of issues and only in pursuit of the drama. He seldom seemed to believe even his harshest rhetoric on reproductive rights. ​​As a candidate, he at one point supported punishing pregnant individuals who defy abortion bans, and then immediately backtracked, saying only going after the healthcare professionals who provide the procedure. Now, he’s suggesting that, under his watch, the federal government would get out of the abortion regime altogether. Yet Trump’s allies, many of whom belong to groups preparing to help staff his administration, are not on board with Trump’s new position, and are likely to push for an approach like Trump’s first term—nominating anti-abortion judges and instituting regulations that reduced access to the procedure. Notably, Eric couldn’t exactly pin down Trump on what he would do if a federal abortion ban reached his Oval Office desk.    Eric’s whole interview is worth the read because it gives a tangible, in-Trump’s-own-words playbook of what a second term would mean for America and the world. But the sections about abortion rights in particular is illuminating because it shows just how little culpability Trump is willing to take for the new abortion patchwork his justices created, or how little he seems interested in either going back to an era when abortion rights were protected, or moving to implement a national ban. Against that by-definition-uneven playing field, Trump is now seemingly content to lean back in his armchair and watch states divvy up which of them will be providers of abortion and which will be a dessert for the procedure. It’s a remarkably passive posture for someone who fancies himself the center of every circus tent.  Make sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter.

What Pope Francis’ Abortion Announcement Really Means,Elizabeth Dias;The Most Surprising Photos of Pope Francis,World,"September 1, 2015 10:35 AM EDT","Pope Francis announced Tuesday that all priests will have the authority to absolve the Catholic sin of abortion during the upcoming Extraordinary Jubilee Year of Mercy, which will begin Dec. 8. It is a bold move, and a spiritual one. Pope Francis is not addressing politicians. He is providing guidance to his Pontifical Council for the New Evangelization as he prepares the Catholic Church for a year of intentional mercy designed to foster spiritual renewal. Pope Francis’ offer is also not new — it widens a common Catholic practice. Traditionally bishops are the ones who have the authority to grant forgiveness for certain grave sins like abortion, and they have in the past also shared that power with priests. As the top bishop, the Bishop of Rome, Francis is making that practice as wide as possible during the Jubilee Year. Forgiving abortion is not the same as saying abortion is now acceptable: forgiveness implies a turning of heart, with the goal of change. Pope Francis made this clear in his papal bull announcing the Jubilee Year in April. “This is the opportune moment to change our lives! This is the time to allow our hearts to be touched! When faced with evil deeds, even in the face of serious crimes, it is the time to listen to the cry of innocent people who are deprived of their property, their dignity, their feelings, and even their very lives,” he wrote. “To stick to the way of evil will only leave one deluded and sad. True life is something entirely different. God never tires of reaching out to us. He is always ready to listen, as I am too, along with my brother bishops and priests.” The Vatican made this clear again Tuesday after the Pope’s letter was announced. “Forgiveness of the sin of abortion does not condone abortion nor minimize its grave effects,” Father Thomas Rosica, the Vatican’s English-language press assistant, explained to reporters in an email. “The fact that this statement is coming from the Pope and in such a moving, pastoral way, is more evidence of the great pastoral approach and concern of Pope Francis.” While the news spread quickly Tuesday, focusing solely on abortion misses the bigger picture of what Pope Francis is trying to do. Before he even mentioned indulgences for abortion in his letter, Pope Francis specifically addressed groups of people that can be easy to overlook — the sick, the elderly, the deceased, and the incarcerated — and directed special care be given to them during the Jubilee Year. His attention to those in prison is particularly noteworthy, as he imagines ways for them experience entering a church symbolically. “May the gesture of directing their thought and prayer to the Father each time they cross the threshold of their cell signify for them their passage through the Holy Door, because the mercy of God is able to transform hearts, and is also able to transform bars into an experience of freedom,” Pope Francis writes. The move is also about the importance of the act of confession itself, and creating an environment of openness and safety in the church for people to confess. Abortion divides — it divides families, partners, communities, politics. In the Catholic Church, it also keeps people from experiencing the full communion of the church and being able to participate with others in church life. Confession for Catholics can be an opportunity for healing in a way that mere punishment prevents. The Pope’s goal is to bring people together, and confession is a way to experience reunion. Confession itself is an act of utmost spiritual importance for Pope Francis. Francis has made confession central to his personal pastoral style from a young age, and even not in church contexts. Austen Ivereigh, one of Pope Francis’ biographers, tells the story in his book The Great Reformer about how Francis, then Jorge Bergoglio, disciplined one of his students when he taught secondary school decades ago. The student, Roberto Poggio, had slapped a younger boy during a sports game. “Bergoglio asked him to come to a classroom at a particular time,” Ivereigh recounts. “When he got there, he saw ten of the his friends sitting in a circle and Bergoglio sitting off to one side. ‘He told me I should tell my friends in detail what happened, and it became something that stuck with me for life. They were understanding, they gave advice, and somehow I felt as if a load been lifted from me — I felt no reproach or criticism from them,’ Poggio recounted.” It is another reminder that Francis is a Pope with a purpose. He is structuring his mission to be pastoral and healing for all people, and especially those that the Church and society marginalize.

Abortion Restrictions May Be Making It Harder for Patients to Get a Cancer and Arthritis Drug,Jamie Ducharme,Health;abortion,"July 6, 2022 5:48 PM EDT","Soon after she started taking the drug methotrexate in February, Jennifer Crow noticed a significant improvement in her inflammatory arthritis pain. Since then, she’s taken the drug weekly. So her stomach dropped on July 1, when she got an automated call from her pharmacy saying her methotrexate refill for the month hadn’t been approved. Crow, who is 48 and lives in Tennessee, was confused by the disruption, until she saw on social media that other people were reporting similar denials. Methotrexate—which in high doses is used as a chemotherapy drug—is sometimes prescribed to induce abortions, complicating its use in states that have restricted abortion access in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Crow eventually did get her medication after her doctor re-processed the refill request, but she says temporarily going without it caused her pain and fatigue to flare up—and made her nervous about the future. While neither Crow’s doctor nor her pharmacy explicitly said that methotrexate’s link to abortion affected her prescription, she feels the timing is suspicious. Her home state of Tennessee currently forbids most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and is set to implement a near-total abortion ban next month. Crow hopes that, moving forward, pharmacies will have clearer policies about how to handle non-abortion-related methotrexate prescriptions. But if not, “we’re going to be test cases,” she says. “That still worries me.” Methotrexate is an antimetabolite, a class of drug that suppresses certain cellular functions, which is often administered orally or by injection. It’s approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat some cancers, but it’s also commonly used for conditions including lupus, arthritis, and psoriasis. Doctors also use it to end ectopic pregnancies, in which a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus, resulting in an unviable pregnancy that carries the risk of life-threatening complications for the pregnant person. Methotrexate ends the pregnancy by preventing cells from dividing.  While methotrexate is not one of the drugs typically used in an elective medication abortion—those drugs are mifepristone and misoprostol—it can be used for that purpose. Pregnant people are advised not to take methotrexate because it may cause serious harm to the fetus. Some states, like Texas, have laws that specifically list methotrexate as an abortion-inducing drug, placing restrictions on its use. Texas’ law does note, however, that such drugs are prescribed for non-abortion-related reasons that are exempt from those regulations. Other states make similar distinctions. In Kentucky, a “trigger” law banned nearly all abortions in the state after Roe v. Wade was overturned, though that policy is now tied up in court. But on July 1, the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy emailed pharmacists and pharmacy interns in the state to remind them that, under Kentucky state law, “if a pharmacist receives a prescription and it doesn’t say, ‘for the induction of abortion,’ they can assume that it’s not for abortion,” explains executive director Christopher Harlow. This means pharmacists may fill prescriptions for drugs like methotrexate normally, if there’s no indication that it’s meant for abortion. Harlow says the board has not received any reports of patients being denied prescriptions. But other organizations say they have. “We have heard of a handful of cases of patients being completely denied [prescriptions] simply because they’re of childbearing age,” says Steven Newmark, director of policy at the Global Healthy Living Foundation, a nonprofit that supports people with chronic illnesses. Other patients have been told they “need to go back to their doctor, or the pharmacist has to check with the doctor, or the doctor is being wary and more reluctant” to prescribe drugs like methotrexate, Newmark says. Michael Murphy, advisor for state government affairs at the American Pharmacists Association, says pharmacists may be reluctant to fill methotrexate prescriptions if they practice in states where providers can be held legally or financially liable for performing abortion services. Laws vary quite a bit from state to state, and many leave enough gray area that it’s not always obvious when or how someone could be liable. It’s also not clear how many patients have been denied methotrexate, though a number of people have shared their experiences on social media. Several health groups—including the Lupus Foundation of America, Arthritis Foundation, and American College of Rheumatology—recently posted statements about reported access issues and told patients to contact them if they ran into problems. Murphy says reports of patients being denied methotrexate are anecdotal, so it’s hard to get a handle on how common they are. But, he says, “any reports of patients not being able to receive their medications and maintain that continuity of their care is very concerning for us as pharmacists.” Newmark says he hopes states will pledge to preserve access to these medications, hopefully before it becomes a widespread issue. “If things don’t get remedied quickly,” he says, “it’s going to require more action.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com",https://time.com/6194179/abortion-restrictions-methotrexate-cancer-arthritis/
"America’s High-Tech Surveillance Could Track Abortion-Seekers, Too, Activists Warn",Rebecca Chowdhury;Data collection and sharing;Local surveillance;A history of digital evidence and pregnancy;An uneven toll,Tech,"June 6, 2022 9:51 AM EDT","Alejandra Pablos leans into the camera, and her curly black hair frames her face. “We are going to hear about abortions,” she says to viewers watching via Instagram Live. Every Tuesday, Pablos hosts virtual Abortion Speak Outs. Dressed in a cozy gray top, she reminds viewers that they can join via video to share their own experiences. “I’m going to be the first person to share,” says Pablos in a soothing tone as she frames her hands around her face, revealing delicate tattoos. Her nails are a deep maroon with immaculately shaped tips.  Pablos works as an organizer with the Reproductive Justice Coalition in Phoenix, Arizona. Her Instagram account is filled with memes, videos and TikToks affirming the importance of access to safe and legal abortions. She was born in Mexico but moved to the US with her family as a baby. She’s currently undocumented.  “Many of us don’t have choices,” says Pablos matter-of-factly, sharing that the last time she was pregnant, she actually wanted to have the child, “but I also knew that I was facing deportation, and literally a year after having that abortion, I was arrested by ICE.”  Pablos was detained by immigration authorities, known as Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and held for 43 days in Eloy Detention Center, a facility much like a prison, in 2018.  Pablos’s situation is, in some ways, unique. As both an undocumented immigrant and a pro-choice advocate in a state poised to implement an exceptionally stringent abortion ban, she uses social media to tell her story. But these aspects of her life also highlight the risks that women in the U.S. stand to face more broadly, if Roe v. Wade is overturned.  When abortion was previously criminalized within the United States prior to 1973, law enforcement didn’t have the technology and surveillance data that police departments and other authorities can now access. For clues about what a present-day wave of enforcement could look like, pro-choice advocates and academics point to the ways that federal, state and local authorities currently monitor many immigrants, Black people and BIPOC communities using data from social media such as Instagram and Facebook, surveillance on streets and roads, and other sources.  The issue is especially urgent for Black and Latinx and low-income women, because they are more likely to seek an abortion according to the Guttmacher Institute. But in the wake of a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion on May 2, which proposed overturning Roe, these questions suddenly became even more urgent and more broad. If abortion is criminalized, tactics and tools already used by law enforcement and immigration authorities could be adapted to track anyone seeking or even considering an abortion, according to advocates and academics who study the issue. A group of senators has also urged stronger rules on data privacy in order to protect abortion seekers, in a letter to Apple and Google. Pablos recognizes all of these intertwined surveillance systems and says that, together, they weave a web that can be hard to escape. “The same state that is trying to deport me,” she says, “would also force me to be pregnant even if I didn’t decide to create a family.”  Pablos’s personal life has been deeply affected by two areas of governmental policy: immigration and reproductive rights. Arizona has notoriously harsh anti-immigration laws. Arizona also has especially restrictive abortion laws. Earlier this year the state passed a 15-week abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. Abortion seekers are also required to receive an ultrasound regardless of whether it is medically necessary. If Roe is overturned, abortion will automatically become illegal in the state.  Both of these aspects fuel her work as an organizer, and they’ve painted a picture of how data can be collected and shared by authorities.  Pablos’s decade-long struggle with ICE originally began when she was stopped by local police in 2011 and then arrested and convicted for driving under the influence and possessing drug paraphernalia. It’s an example of how local and federal authorities collaborate to share data, which may offer a glimpse of what is to come if Roe is overturned. For example, Pablos acts as an abortion doula who supports pregnant people both emotionally and financially. This includes driving people to clinics to receive an abortion. In Arizona, seemingly mundane activities like driving can carry great risks for undocumented individuals who could be deported after a traffic stop. Despite local laws preventing police from racially profiling drivers or contacting immigration authorities during a routine traffic stop, human rights advocates allege that police are still engaging in these practices.  “I give rides to people daily; what are those rides going to look like now?” says Pablos. “As an undocumented person taking people through [police] checkpoints even though I know that I’m legally allowed to be here right now, that is really scary.” The data shared between agencies is extensive, advocates say. “The systems that didn’t talk to each other are talking to each other a lot more,” says Patrice Lawrence, executive director of the UndocuBlack Network. Federal authorities like ICE have access to a complex web of databases that glean data from a variety of sources including fingerprint data collected when someone is arrested.  According to ICE‘s website, these data sharing programs enable the agency to work with “law enforcement partners in the shared responsibility for ensuring the safety of our communities” by “using biometrics to identify foreign-born individuals arrested for criminal offenses.” Read more: Inside the Effort to Promote Abortion Pills For a Post-Roe America “We now have evidence of a massive militarized and profitable technological surveillance machine that is being relayed against Black and brown communities,” says Paromita Shah, executive director of Just Futures Law, “it’s a threat to migrants, and it’s also a threat to all of our well-being.” This data collection could affect citizens and non-citizens, alike, organizers say—whether or not people have interacted with police. The Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law, a Washington, D.C. think tank, released a major report on ICE in May. It claims that ICE can access the driver’s license data of 74% of adults. The agency has already used facial recognition technology to search the driver’s license photographs of 32% of adults in the US, according to the report. These activities are well-funded—immigration agencies earmark millions of dollars to collect data. For example, Mijente, a Latinx advocacy organization, has found that ICE contracted with a data broker to access license plate databases in order to track the movement of cars. The contract is worth $22.8 million. These lucrative contracts enable ICE to track the movement of cars in cities where nearly 70% of adults live according to the Center on Privacy and Technology.  Advocates also argue that ICE will go to extreme lengths to track undocumented immigrants. The agency has identified and detained immigrants based on data collected when they paid a gas, electricity or internet bill according to a Just Futures Law  report. ICE is able to access this information through contracts with private data brokers which enables the agency to access the information of over 218 million utility customers across the country, according to the Center on Privacy and Technology. Just Futures Law estimates these contracts are worth over $43 million. Criminal justice organizers warn this surveillance data also flows the other direction, too, from federal authorities to state or local law enforcement. “The broader information-sharing environment is vast,” says Hamid Khan, an organizer with STOP LAPD Spying Coalition, who describes this phenomenon as the “datafication of our bodies.” Khan also points to fusion centers as important elements of how data-sharing happens. Fusion centers are hubs designed to facilitate information sharing between federal, state and local agencies, created after 9/11 and quietly operating ever since. Although some fear deportation as Roe v. Wade hangs in the balance, others fear attracting the attention of local law enforcement.  On a local level, some police departments rely on technology that analyzes individuals’ social media accounts to allegedly prevent crime. In the past this technology has flagged individuals as gang members based on their Facebook friends list or who’s next to them in a photo. Civil rights groups in Chicago, New York and Minnesota have critiqued these databases as clear examples of racial profiling.  Advocates fear that similar databases may be created in states where abortion is likely to become illegal if Roe v. Wade is overturned. “As long as there’s a police department somewhere who wants to have a registry of pregnant people and abortions, there’s probably going to be an industry willing to do it or get paid to do it,” says Cynthia Conti-Cook, a Ford Foundation tech fellow and civil rights lawyer. Just Futures Law has documented how ICE has also monitored the social media of immigration activists like Pablos, which concerns advocates like Shah. She says, “People are posting images on social media about being at an abortion protest; maybe being shown at a clinic. All that social media scraping is low-hanging fruit for law enforcement and ICE.” An ICE spokesperson told TIME: “Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests.” Advocates say these ongoing surveillance tactics could be directed against abortion seekers or providers in states that restrict or criminalize abortion. In a new report, the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project predicts that state officials will “turn to the surveillance tools that have become so central to American policing, using technology to peer into the most intimate aspects of our lives.”  Police departments have already gone to great lengths to investigate pregnant women, by looking at their digital footprints.  While the leaked Supreme Court memo indicates the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade, BIPOC advocates in states that have restricted access to abortion argue they already live a post-Roe reality, where technological devices and internet activity are used as evidence in court.  Purvi Patel, for example, was convicted of feticide and neglect of a dependent for taking abortion drugs in Granger, Indiana in 2015. The prosecutor used data from her cell phone and iPad to build a case against her. Evidence presented included text messages to a friend about becoming pregnant and purchasing pills, proof from her email that she purchased the pills online and other online research she conducted. Without this data, the case would have depended solely on the testimony of medical providers and experts. Patel was initially issued a 20-year sentence but after significant public outcry and a long legal battle, an appeal’s court ultimately threw out her feticide conviction and she was released from prison.  “They’re using this evidence to imbue intent about a pregnant person’s state of mind,” said Conti-Cook, “because if you ever once consider your pregnancy a crisis they’re going to not just take that at face value, but start reading into that.” Conti-Cook has also studied the case of Latice Fisher, who was accused of second-degree murder in Mississippi after giving birth at home to a stillborn baby in 2018. Fisher, who is Black, had her phone searched by law enforcement, which used her internet searches for abortion pills as evidence in her trial. After significant public pressure, the charges against Fisher were dropped, and she was released from prison.  Police are increasingly searching cell phones as part of arrests they make for petty crimes such as graffiti or shoplifting, according to a report looking at police departments across the country by Upturn, a policy think tank focused on technology. The report shows how the technology law enforcement uses to search an individual’s phone during an arrest is so advanced it can map all of the cell phone activity that took place at a specific location ranging from phone calls to app usage to photos.  Police departments emphasize the vital role this technology plays when investigating serious crimes such as homicide and child sexual abuse. There are various instances in which the technology has provided breakthroughs when investigating serial killers. Upturn found that in addition to these instances, the technology is also used for minor crimes such as marijuana possession or vandalism. This use of technology is extremely widespread. Upturn estimates that over 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country have purchased some form of this technology spanning across all 50 states. The toll of this technology is uneven, says Conti-Cook, noting that both Patel and Fisher were women of color. “It’s also very fair to assume that the people who are going to be the most criminalized by this evidence or see this evidence come up are going to be people of color,” Conti-Cook says. Black immigrants may face even more layers of risk if abortion is criminalized, says Lawrence. She notes that law enforcement disproportionately targets Black individuals; the Stanford Open Policing Project has found that Black drivers across the US are 20% more likely to be stopped than white drivers.  Regardless of the risks, Pablos is committed to continue her work. She has dealt first-hand with the realities of seeking an abortion in a conservative state and navigating criminal charges while fighting her deportation case. These challenges have taught her that immigration and reproductive justice issues are rooted in struggles for self-determination. “If our autonomy is already taken away from us, then we have nothing left to lose,” Pablos told TIME. For her, the only answer is to continue on despite the danger. Pablos says: “We’re going to keep doing this work no matter how bad it gets because it’s a matter of life and death.”  Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/6184111/abortion-surveillance-tech-tracking/
Louisiana Could Soon Classify Abortion Pills as Controlled Substances. Here’s What to Know,Chantelle Lee;What is SB 276?;Is abortion banned in Louisiana?;Are mifepristone and misoprostol addictive drugs?;Why are many doctors against the amendment to the bill?;What do people who support the bill say?;What happens next?,U.S.;Louisiana,"May 23, 2024 9:40 PM EDT","A bill passed by Louisiana lawmakers Thursday could see the state become the first in the country to classify two abortion-inducing drugs as controlled and dangerous substances—a move doctors and reproductive rights advocates say could have far-reaching implications for health care access in the state.  The bill, SB 276, passed the state Senate with a vote of 29 to 7, after having passed in the House with a vote of 66 to 30 on Tuesday. It will next go to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign it into law. Supporters of the bill say it will protect pregnant people from coerced abortions, while opponents argue that the two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, have many other uses aside from abortion, and that reclassifying them as controlled substances would make it more difficult for patients to access the drug when needed. Here’s what the bill would do, and the controversy surrounding it. The bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Thomas Pressly, initially only focused on criminalizing intentionally using medications to cause or attempt to cause an abortion without the pregnant person’s knowledge or consent. Pressly said he sponsored the bill after his sister learned that her husband had given her abortion-inducing drugs without her knowledge or consent. Several Louisiana doctors and reproductive rights advocates say they were concerned not by the initial bill, but by its amendment, which was added late in the legislative process. The amendment labels mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV drugs under Louisiana’s Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law. Schedule IV drugs are considered to have potential for abuse or dependence, and include Valium and Xanax. Under the bill, if a person knowingly possesses these drugs without a valid prescription, they could face fines or jail time. Yes. Louisiana has a near-total abortion ban in place with limited exceptions, such as if the fetus has a fatal abnormality or if continuing the pregnancy could risk death. But both mifepristone and misoprostol are allowed in Louisiana for non-abortion related purposes, such as stopping uterine hemorrhaging caused by complications from childbirth, inducing labor, and preparing the uterus for procedures like IUD insertions and biopsies. Because of this, opponents of SB 276 argue that the bill could reduce access to health care. Read More: What Abortion Laws Look Like in the U.S. One Year After the Fall of Roe v. Wade The Food and Drug Administration does not view mifepristone and misoprostol as having a significant risk of abuse or dependence. Years of research has found that both medications are safe. Dr. Jennifer Avegno, an emergency medicine physician and director of the New Orleans Health Department, tells TIME that the amendment to the bill could create a “false narrative” that the drugs are dangerous. Avegno, who co-wrote a letter to lawmakers signed by more than 200 Louisiana doctors objecting to the bill’s amendment, says numerous doctors agree that the drugs don’t belong on the Schedule IV list because they lack the potential for addiction. “You have to have a clear demonstration that you have a high risk for abuse, dependence, addiction, or you’re a public health hazard,” Avegno says about Schedule IV drugs. “None of the hundreds of physicians that we’ve worked with on this have ever experienced the drugs being used in an addictive manner or abuse.” Doctors say that the bill could block access to the drugs for non-abortion purposes. Classifying the drugs as controlled substances would require doctors to have a special license to prescribe them, which some may not have. “There are just so many different regulations that you’d have to go through,” says Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a family doctor and medical director at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which serves Louisiana and southeast Texas. This could cause delays in patients receiving access to these medications, sometimes in serious or life-threatening situations “Any delay in getting that medication is the difference, quite frankly, between life or death,” Avegno says. “So it’s not the abstract that we’re talking about and it’s not sort of these unusual, rare cases. These drugs are used all day, every day.” Read More: Doctors Are Still Confused by Abortion Exceptions in Louisiana. It’s Limiting Essential Care Patients also may become reluctant to take the drugs even when necessary because they may not understand that they’re safe to use, and pharmacists may be reluctant to fill these prescriptions, Avegno adds. “What we’re already seeing is that women who are being prescribed misoprostol for miscarriage are even now being told by their pharmacy, ‘I can’t fill that, that’s the abortion drug’ because there persists so much fear out there,” Avegno says. “So if it’s happening now, when it’s not labeled as a controlled, dangerous substance, how often is that going to happen when it is?” Louisiana has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country, and doctors worry that this amendment could exacerbate the situation. Proponents of the bill argue that SB 276 would not prohibit doctors from prescribing these medications, but would instead prevent people from misusing them. “What we’re trying to do here is add an additional opportunity to keep bad actors from getting these medications,” Pressly said during the Senate meeting Thursday. The senator called the amendment “a proactive step” to prevent what happened to his sister from happening to others. Louisiana Right to Life, an anti-abortion group that worked with Pressly on the bill, has argued that state law does not say that drugs need to be addictive in order to be classified as controlled substances. The group’s communications director, Sarah Zagorski, says that she does not think the bill would impede access to the drugs for non-abortion needs. “The legislation itself says that for legitimate health reasons that this medication is completely legal,” she says. “Physicians prescribe controlled substances every single day, they know the protocols for that; this is no different than that.” Read More: What to Know About the Arizona Supreme Court Abortion Ban Ruling The bill is now waiting to be signed into law by Gov. Landry. If he does, the law would take effect Oct. 1. Doctors and reproductive rights advocates say that they’re concerned that SB 276 could inspire similar bills in other states. And many worried that there could be more unforeseen consequences. “There’s so many unknowns with this because this is just unprecedented,” says Dr. Nicole Freehill, an ob-gyn in Louisiana.

"Supreme Court Overturns Roe v. Wade, Undoing Constitutional Right to Abortion",Abigail Abrams;Madeleine Carlisle,Politics;Supreme Court,"June 24, 2022 10:49 AM EDT","The U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, striking down the constitutional right to abortion established in the landmark ruling nearly 50 years ago. On June 24, the high court ruled that pre-viability bans on elective abortions are constitutional, with Justice Samuel Alito writing the majority opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts filed his own opinion concurring in the judgment that pre-viability bans can stand, but declining to overturn Roe. The court’s three liberal Justices—Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—dissented. After nearly half a century of constitutional protections for abortion, the ruling fundamentally reshapes access to reproductive health care across the U.S. Thirteen states have already enacted “trigger laws” that are designed to ban all or nearly all abortions once Roe is overturned, and those will now go into effect—some immediately and others in the coming hours and days. More bans are expected to come soon. At least nine other states have laws on the books they will likely try to put into effect, according to an estimate from the Guttmacher Institute, a research center that supports abortion rights, and others are considering special legislative sessions to introduce new restrictions in response to the ruling. Oklahoma had already outlawed nearly all abortions before the Supreme Court ruled, and other conservative-led states moved to advance bans of their own following a historic leak of a draft opinion in May that previewed the seismic shift to come. Read More: What the Supreme Court’s Abortion Decision Means for Your State “Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided,” Alito wrote, comparing Roe to the case that established the “separate but equal” doctrine used to justify segregation for decades. “A right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions,” Alito also wrote in the majority opinion. “On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973.” The decision largely reflects the draft opinion authored by Alito and first reported by Politico on May 3. The three liberal Justices authored the dissent. “With sorrow—for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection—we dissent,” the Justices wrote. They decried the impact the decision could have on the legal doctrine of stare decisis, which states that courts must adhere to legal precedent even if they disagree with it, except in exceptional circumstances. The three liberal Justices argued that in overturning Roe, the Supreme Court betrayed “its guiding principles.” Chief Justice Roberts also invoked stare decisis in his concurring opinion, in which he said he would take “a more measured course” than the path of the majority. He agreed that the “viability line” established by Roe—which barred states from banning abortions before the point around 24 weeks of pregnancy when a fetus can survive outside the womb—should be “discarded,” writing “that line never made any sense.” But he said he would not go as far as to overturn Roe itself. “The Court’s opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us,” Roberts wrote. In the majority opinion, Alito argued that Roe and 1992’s Planned Parenthood v. Casey—which affirmed the right to abortion while creating a new test requiring restrictions on abortion access to not pose an “undue burden” on the person seeking an abortion—were exceptional cases that merited breaking from stare decisis. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Alito wrote. “Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.” The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, centered on a 2018 Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a direct contradiction of the precedent established in Roe. A federal district court and the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit both struck down the Mississippi law for violating Roe, but when the state appealed the case to the Supreme Court, the Justices decided to review the case. The move came as a surprise to lawyers on both sides. Once the case reached the high court, Mississippi argued not just in favor of its law, but also for the Supreme Court to fully overturn Roe and Casey. Read More: Meet the Pharmacist Expanding Access to Abortion Pills Across the U.S. On June 24 the Supreme Court agreed, overturning both Roe and Casey and ruling the Constitution does not grant the right to abortion access. The decision is a sweeping victory for the conservative legal movement, which developed in the 1970s and ’80s, in part through opposition to Roe. The Supreme Court’s stunning decision in Dobbs marks the culmination of decades of work by conservative legal scholars and anti-abortion activists, who directed money and voters to Republican politicians they hoped would nominate conservative judges. Former President Donald Trump nominated a wave of conservative federal judges, including three Supreme Court Justices—Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett—building the most conservative Supreme Court in a generation and providing the crucial votes needed to overturn Roe. For abortion-rights activists, the decision is a crushing loss that they argue violates a person’s fundamental right to bodily autonomy and endangers women’s health and economic independence. The decision in Dobbs will exacerbate the vast differences in rights Americans are granted depending on where they live, as some states are poised to outlaw abortion entirely and others stand to become havens for the procedure. The decision runs counter to public opinion: a May 19 NPR/PBS NewsHour/Maris national poll found that 64% of Americans opposed overturning Roe v. Wade, while 33% supported it. Abortion rights will now likely play a major role in the midterm elections, as the decision lands in the midst of summer primaries and just months before November. Read More: Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers Are Collecting Troves of Data That Could Be Weaponized Against Women Activists on both sides are already gearing up for the next legal battles the Dobbs decision may ignite. Progressives worry the arguments made in the decision could be used to overturn other landmark cases rooted in similar legal grounding in the “right to privacy,” which the Supreme Court ruled in 1965’s Griswold v. Connecticut is established in the Bill of Rights. In Roe, eight years later, the Supreme Court ruled it was the right to privacy—this time specifically found in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment—that protected “a woman’s qualified right to terminate her pregnancy” until fetal viability. Historic rulings in the LGBTQ civil rights movement—including 2003’s Lawrence v. Texas, which legalized same-sex sexual activity, and 2015’s Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage—are also built on the right to privacy. Several other landmark cases, like 1967’s Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage, are similarly built upon rights found in the 14th Amendment without being explicitly listed. In the majority opinion, Alito rejected the possibility of Dobbs impacting those decisions, writing that the court “stated unequivocally that ‘[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.’” But in his concurrence, Thomas argued that the court should reconsider what rights are found in the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment, explicitly naming Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Anti-abortion advocates immediately cheered the court’s ruling overturning Roe. “Today we celebrate a historic victory for human rights as the Supreme Court overturns the dated Roe decision, ending half a century of abortion on demand that left more than 60 million dead children in its wake,” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, one of the largest anti-abortion groups in the country, tweeted. The organization added that its work has just begun. “Today’s Supreme Court decision ushers in a new era in the fight for the unborn and their moms, with each state and Congress a battleground for life.” For their part, abortion-rights activists decried the decision and promised to continue their work to help people access abortions in the new post-Roe reality. “The Supreme Court has now officially given politicians permission to control what we do with our bodies, deciding that we can no longer be trusted to determine the course for our own lives. But make no mistake—we are a movement that will demand we are treated like equal citizens,” tweeted Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood. “We mean it when we say it—care, no matter what.” Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com and Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com",https://time.com/6189476/abortion-supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade/
Ohio Votes to Protect Abortion Access in Major Statewide Victory for Reproductive Rights,Sanya Mansoor,Politics;abortion,"November 7, 2023 9:21 PM EST","On Tuesday, Ohio’s voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing an individual right to abortion and other kinds of reproductive health care.  Issue One put Ohio at the center of the nation’s abortion battle after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. Tuesday’s victory for abortion rights means that the state’s proposed ban on abortions after about six weeks cannot go into effect. Now, abortions will be allowed until viability, which was the standard under Roe. (Abortions after that time could only be considered if the treating physician considers the abortion “necessary to protect the pregnant woman's life or health.”)   The results, called by the Associated Press, are a huge win for abortion rights in one of the year's most closely-watched votes. The outcome doesn’t “change the law on the ground immediately but it will have huge implications for what comes next,” says Chris Devine, an associate professor of political science at the University of Dayton.  Democrats may now look to the use of the citizen ballot initiative in Ohio as a reliable tactic to protect abortion rights. Six states had abortion-related measures on the ballot in 2022; all six were victories for abortion-rights advocates, including those in more conservative states such as Kansas and Kentucky. “We've had lots of abortion ballot initiatives in conservative states prevail but they've all been narrower questions,” says Mary Ruth Ziegler, law professor at UC Davis. Ohio is “a good litmus test for how far a ballot initiative strategy can go.”  “What it suggests is that voters in a lot of conservative states are not as far to the right on abortion as their state lawmakers,” Ziegler adds. Gabriel Mann, a spokesperson for Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights,  says the campaign was inspired by victories for abortion-rights advocates in Kentucky and Michigan. “It really showed that this is a midwestern value…that it’s possible to pass this here,” he says. In the lead-up to the vote, Republicans attempted to make it more difficult to pass a constitutional amendment in the state. After that failed, abortion rights supporters took issue with how the Ohio Ballot Board summarized their proposed amendment. The text refers to an “unborn child,” instead of a “fetus”—leading them to argue that the wording was biased. But a majority of voters still voted in favor of the amendment on Tuesday, which now will enshrine in the state constitution “an individual right to one’s own reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion.”  The controversy may not be over. Conservatives fear the “including but not limited to” phrasing could open the door up to mean gender-affirming care. “Issue One is really a wolf in sheep's clothing,” says Mark Weaver, a Republican strategist.  Campaign organizers denied any attempt to address gender-affirming care. “Issue One is a single issue subject that directly addresses reproductive care,” says Mann.  Despite victory at the polls, abortion rights advocates are expecting legislative challenges about the amendment’s language. “That’s not going to end the fight,” Mann says.

Republicans Move at Trump’s Behest to Change How They Will Oppose Abortion,THOMAS BEAUMONT and CHRISTINE FERNANDO / AP,Politics;abortion,"July 8, 2024 2:11 PM EDT","(MILWAUKEE) — The Republican National Committee’s platform committee has adopted a policy document that reflects former President Donald Trump’s position opposing a federal abortion ban and ceding limits to states, omitting the explicit basis for a national ban for the first time in 40 years. The committee, according to two people briefed on the language, agreed on the text, “We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights.” Two anti-abortion activist leaders spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal party deliberations. The move comes as Trump imposes his priorities on the committee as he seeks to steer clear of strict abortion language, even while taking credit for setting up the 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court. Trump appointed three of the six justices who voted in the majority to overturn the 1973 abortion rights precedent. The abortion language was first reported by The New York Times. Marjorie Dannenfelser, SBA Pro-Life America president, praised the committee for reaffirming “its commitment to protect unborn life through the 14th Amendment.” Dannenfelser stopped short of endorsing the document's reflection of Trump's view that the matter rests entirely with states. “Under this amendment, it is Congress that enacts and enforces it's provisions.” Read More: How Far Trump Would Go The platform is a statement of first principles traditionally written by party activists. Trump's campaign wants the group drafting this year's platform to produce a shorter document that excludes statements favored by many conservatives but are potentially unpopular with the broader electorate. The platform committee begins its meeting Monday, a week before the start of the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president. Trump has faced months of Democratic criticism over abortion as President Joe Biden's reelection campaign has highlighted that Trump nominated half of the Supreme Court majority that struck down the nationwide right to abortion in 2022. But among the vocal abortion opponents on the platform committee, some say the aspiration of a federal ban on abortion after a certain stage in pregnancy must remain a party principle, even if it's not an immediately attainable policy or one that necessarily helps the Trump campaign in November. “I see that as problematic. We still need these principles clearly stated. Some of these battles are not over,” said Iowa state Rep. Brad Sherman, a platform committee member who supported Trump’s winning Iowa caucus campaign in January and also supports a federal limit on abortion. While the abortion statement is likely to be the most contested provision in the platform, there may also be disputes over Trump’s preference for tariffs and his isolationist approach to foreign policy and U.S. involvement in global conflicts, particularly in helping Ukraine as it battles Russia. Conservative activists who are accustomed to having a seat at the table fumed over what they said was a secretive process for selecting committee members and the meeting taking place behind closed doors. “For 40 years, the Republican Party and the GOP platform have massively benefitted from an open and transparent process,” said Tim Chapman, the incoming president of Advancing American Freedom, a foundation headed by Trump’s former Vice President Mike Pence. Trump’s campaign has sought to reshape the Republican National Committee into a campaign vessel. It signaled in a memo last month from senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles that “textbook-long platforms ... are scrutinized and intentionally misrepresented by our political opponents.” Trump ally Russ Vought is serving as the policy director of the Republican Party’s platform writing committee while also leading the effort to draft the 180-day agenda for Project 2025, a sweeping proposal for remaking government that Trump said Friday he knew “nothing about” despite having several former aides involved. Trump had supported federal legislation in 2018 that would have banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, though the measure fell short of the necessary support in the Senate. However, after the 2022 midterm elections, Trump blamed Republicans who held strict anti-abortion positions for the party's failure to secure a larger House majority. He has since been critical of the most stringent abortion bans in individual states. Read More: How Ronald Reagan Helped Abortion Take Over the Republican Agenda An AP-NORC poll conducted in June 2023 found that about two-thirds of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The poll also found that 6 in 10 Americans think Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide. Biden's campaign has criticized Republicans for making the platform committee meetings in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, closed to the news media and reminded voters of Trump's onetime support for a 20-week abortion ban. Tamara Scott, who is one of Iowa's two Republican National Committee members and also a platform committee member, said Trump could campaign on the position he holds and also embrace the platform to reflect a longer-term goal of a federal limit. “It’s our vision. It’s our foundational principles. It’s who we are as a party,” Scott said. “I agree a platform must be clear and concise but it must convey our core principles.” To several on the committee, that means maintaining support for an “amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to children before birth,” the passage first included in 1984. Trump was urged to keep that language in the platform, according to a letter signed by leaders of groups opposed to abortion, including Dannenfelser, Ralph Reed, Faith and Freedom Coalition founder and chairman; Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. That passage, once removed, would be difficult to restore in future platforms, Dannenfelser said. “The conversation about the platform is about the future. It’s about presidential campaigns 10 years from now, and Senate campaigns and House campaigns, Republican campaigns everywhere,” Dannenfelser said. “It’s not just about this election. And that’s why it matters.” ___ Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed from Washington.

What Idaho’s Texas-Style Abortion Ban Means for the Rest of the Country,Abigail Abrams;What impact would the Idaho ban have? ;‘A transition moment’ for abortion;‘Stuck in Limbo’,Politics,"March 15, 2022 2:59 PM EDT","Idaho became the first state on Monday to pass a bill modeled after Texas’ strict law that uses private citizens to enforce a ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and to avoid court challenges to the ban’s constitutionality.  The Idaho House, which has a Republican majority, voted 51-14 in favor of the bill, and the state Senate approved it earlier this month. It now heads to Gov. Brad Little, a Republican. While Little has not commented on this bill specifically, he signed a similar abortion restriction last year. Idaho’s move exemplifies the battle over abortion access that’s playing out in states across the country, just months before the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling that could unwind or overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion. Under current law, states cannot ban abortion before a fetus is viable, which typically occurs between 23 and 24 weeks of pregnancy. But the Supreme Court’s conservative majority signaled last spring that it may be willing to change that standard when it agreed to hear arguments over a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks. As anti-abortion state lawmakers await the Court’s decision, they are rushing to pass new legislation that would restrict abortion. Even as Roe technically remains the law of the land, the shifting legal and political landscape is making it more difficult for abortion rights advocates to stop them. Read More: Mississippi’s Last Abortion Clinic Faces the Supreme Court If Idaho’s governor signs the new bill, it will take effect 30 days after that signing—changing the state’s law just months before the Supreme Court is expected to rule. At least 10 states have introduced bans copying parts of Texas’ private enforcement mechanism, which was explicitly designed to avoid judicial review. The anti-abortion state lawmakers’ strategy has worked so far, as the Supreme Court has declined to block the Texas law since it took effect in September. The Texas Supreme Court also recently said it could not stop the ban because the law prohibits state officials from enforcing it. Idaho’s lawmakers on Monday said this was a positive sign for their bill. “Texas’ clever, private course of action did good,” Republican State Rep. Steven Harris, the bill’s co-sponsor, said on the House floor ahead of the vote on Monday. “It stopped physical abortions, chemical abortions in their tracks.” He added that despite legal challenges in front of the Supreme Court, “abortions are still being stopped in Texas.” Democratic lawmakers pushed back ahead of the vote. “This bill is not clever, it’s absurd,” state Rep. Lauren Necochea said during debate. “Its impacts are cruel and it is blatantly unconstitutional.” While Idaho’s bill was modeled after the Texas bill’s enforcement mechanism, there are some key differences. The Texas law allows any private citizen to sue anyone who “aids or abets” someone in getting an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which happens around six weeks, before many people know they are pregnant. The Texas law also provides a reward of at least $10,000 plus legal fees for successful plaintiffs. The Idaho bill, in contrast, narrows the potential litigants, allowing only family members of the fetus, including the mother and father, the fetus’ siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles, to sue. The bill also says that such family members can only sue abortion providers. It sets a minimum reward of $20,000 plus legal fees, and allows lawsuits for up to four years after an abortion. The Texas law has no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The Idaho bill does allow for certain, limited exceptions. A pregnant person must have filed a police report claiming the rape or incest—a process that is likely to deter many from using the exception. The bill states that a rapist cannot sue an abortion provider if his victim seeks an abortion, but it is ambiguous on key details. The bill does not say, for example, whether an accused rapist can sue an abortion provider if his alleged victim seeks an abortion; rape trials often take months or years to complete. The bill does allow a rapist’s family members to sue. Read More: States Push New Abortion Bans, Preempting the Supreme Court Planned Parenthood, which runs the only three abortion clinics in Idaho, says all three will comply with the bill if it becomes law. In Texas, data showed that abortions in the state dropped 60% after its abortion ban went into effect. Abortion rights advocates say the decrease may be larger in Idaho due to the existing barriers and the rural nature of the state. To access an abortion, a person must gather the money to pay for it, as well as arrange travel and other considerations including time off work and child care. This is already more difficult for people with low incomes, people of color and those in rural areas, advocates note. If patients have to travel out of state, all of those steps are more difficult. “This bill would have a devastating impact on the people of Idaho,” says Dr. Erin Berry, Washington state medical director of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaíʻi, Alaska, Indiana, and Kentucky, who also provides abortions in Idaho.  Berry has been working with other Planned Parenthood facilities and independent abortion clinics in the region to coordinate on how they will help patients find appointments, but she says the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation. “Every clinic that I’ve talked to in the region is understaffed,” she says. “We already struggle with the patients that we have because of staffing and so we are doing the best that we can to prepare, to increase appointment times, to increase staffing—but we have our limits.” Planned Parenthood is looking at how to challenge the law in court, says Lisa Humes-Schulz, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates Northwest, the organization’s advocacy arm in the region.  Last year, Idaho passed another law criminalizing abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, but because lawmakers knew it was likely unconstitutional, it contained a trigger that would only allow it to go into effect if a U.S. appeals court upheld a similar law in another state. Some lawmakers also raised that concern this year. The state’s deputy attorney general issued an opinion saying the new bill would also “likely be found unconstitutional under the Court’s current jurisprudence.” If it is challenged, the Idaho ban would eventually be heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has been more open to abortion rights in the past than the conservative Fifth Circuit, which heard the Texas case, Humes-Schulz says. But, she adds, former President Donald Trump changed the make up of the Ninth Circuit by appointing more conservative judges.  “We also know that coming down the pike is that challenge to Roe vs. Wade at the Supreme Court, so we do fear that even if we do secure a victory that could be short lived,” Humes-Schulz says. “What this bill is really doing is expediting what could already happen if the Supreme Court does open the door in June.” Advocates are weighing similar considerations in other states.  Oklahoma, which has seen a colossal increase in demand for abortions from patients fleeing Texas over the past six months, has introduced several aggressive abortion restrictions, including its own Texas-style six-week ban and a bill that would ban abortions 30 days after a person’s last menstrual period, effectively outlawing all abortions.  Florida recently passed a 15-week ban modeled on the Mississippi law in front of the Supreme Court, and Arizona is considering a 15-week bill too.  West Virginia lawmakers tried to pass a 15-week ban, but over the weekend in the last minutes before their legislative session ended, they opted instead to ban abortions if someone is seeking one because of prenatal testing. Kentucky, meanwhile, is moving a package of abortion restrictions that advocates say would effectively end all abortion access in the state by creating new medically unnecessary requirements that providers cannot meet. Many of these bills would not have made it as far in previous legislative sessions. But, like in Idaho, their sponsors often say they have been inspired by the Supreme Court or Texas case and want to have new laws in place in case the justices rule in their favor. “We are absolutely in what is likely to be a transition moment for the abortion rights and abortion access movement,” says Elisabeth Smith, director for state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Roe v. Wade is good law. There is a federal constitutional right to abortion. And yet, we have seen states enact more and more blatantly unconstitutional abortion bans and abortion restrictions.” Read More: Justices Seem Poised to Weaken Roe v. Wade Even with Roe still technically in place, the coming Supreme Court decision has already affected the way that activists and abortion providers advocate against proposed restrictions and challenge them in court. One change is that the bills this year seem to have been written more quickly than in the past, according to Smith, and are “poorly drafted.” That means they are sometimes written in confusing ways, or fail to convey the lawmakers intensions, leaving advocates to interpret the scope of the legislation impact. Fewer lawmakers also seem concerned about their laws being challenged in court, Smith and other reproductive rights advocates say. In the past, abortion rights groups would often promise to sue states over unconstitutional abortion restrictions and announce legal challenges immediately after governors signed bills into law. This year, groups have often been more cautious in public statements—promising to “explore all legal options” or “continue fighting” rather than committing to one course of action. “In previous years, we made that argument. And said, in many contexts, if you pass this law, we will file a lawsuit. Now even that threat is ignored, because these hostile legislators really do think that the end of Roe is here,” Smith says. When abortion rights groups do sue, the new legal landscape may prove complicated. Some bills, like Idaho’s, include emergency clauses that allow them go into effect much more quickly than other legislation. This can make it difficult to prepare a lawsuit and get a law blocked before it takes effect, says Hume-Schulz.  Laws that go into effect after June, when the Supreme Court term ends, may be judged by a different standard. The Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the Mississippi abortion clinic in the challenge to Roe before the Supreme Court, notes that the uncertainty over the future of abortion law makes it difficult to plan ahead. “Until we know, we will be in a place of having arguments about current law that are strong and have been upheld for decades, but we don’t know what our next arguments will be,” Smith says. Read More: Abortion Pill Use Spikes As States and Courts Restrict Access In some cases, legal uncertainty has led lower court judges to put cases on hold until the Supreme Court rules. For example, the state of Arkansas asked the Eighth Circuit last summer to delay ruling on an embattled state abortion ban until after the Supreme Court rules. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals later made a similar move in case about Georgia’s six-week abortion ban.  In contrast, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals recently allowed a Tennessee law that bans abortions sought because of the fetus’s race, sex or Down syndrome diagnosis to take effect. The judges then halted progress on an appeal, leaving the abortion providers challenging the Tennessee law “stuck in limbo,” says Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project and one of the lawyers in that case.  While the Sixth Circuit majority did not give a reason for the delay, Judge Karen Nelson Moore, who wrote a dissent in the decision, criticized her colleagues’ decision and said the only explanation was that they are hoping to apply a new standard after the Supreme Court rules on Roe. “This majority’s decision at this juncture showcases a growing trend among federal courts to use facially neutral mechanisms to delay the adjudication of laws that significantly impair constitutional rights,” she wrote. Amiri says that the Sixth Circuit Court judges’ decision is, so far, an outlier. But as more abortion restrictions are passed and potentially challenged this year, Moore’s dissent signals that other courts may act similarly. While all eyes are on the Supreme Court’s pending decision, activists on both sides of the debate are trying to shape abortion access more immediately. Many of the changes that happen in the next few months will define the battlefield for what’s to come.

Two Courts Ruled on Abortion in Emergency Situations. One Got It Right,Ideas;Greer Donley;Kimi Chernoby;Skye Perryman,Ideas;abortion,"August 26, 2022 9:21 AM EDT","For more than 35 years, people in the United States experiencing medical emergencies have been entitled to receive stabilizing treatment in most hospitals. Sometimes that emergency care is an abortion because medical emergencies can arise in pregnancy for which abortion is the only treatment that can help. But that federal protection is now being tested following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs. Over the past two months, the country has moved from a place where abortion was constitutionally protected to one in which state officials are seeking to prevent their pregnant citizens from accessing federally protected and medically necessary emergency care. Their attempts to enforce abortion bans in emergency situations and undermine bedrock principles of emergency medicine are out of step not only with the views of the majority of the American people but also with the expertise of the nation’s medical, health, and hospital communities. The Biden Administration has been in court working to protect pregnant patients from state laws that deprive them of this protection – and its position is on solid legal ground. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), passed in 1986 by a bipartisan majority in Congress and signed by a Republican President, requires that all hospitals with emergency rooms that accept Medicare funds provide emergency services to patients who present with emergency medical conditions, including active labor, regardless of their ability to pay. The medical community has made clear that there are certain emergent conditions that require a pregnancy be terminated or fetal tissue to be expelled to protect the life and health of the person carrying the pregnancy. These instances typically arise where a fetus cannot survive regardless of medical interventions. Despite this, a range of state efforts would criminalize doctors who provide abortion even in such emergency circumstances, leaving physicians and their patients in an untenable and unsafe position.  The United States Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, and settled case law interpreting it, provides that federal law is the “supreme law of the land” and trumps state law when the two conflict. Accordingly, in the weeks following the Dobbs decision, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a guidance statement reminding hospitals and their medical providers that when abortion is necessary to stabilize a patient’s medical emergency, EMTALA requires that it be offered. Of note, this guidance did not create a new policy or new obligations, merely reiterated obligations already required under the law. Read More: The Devastating Implications of Overturning Roe Will Go Far Beyond Abortion Patients The guidance was immediately attacked by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and two interest groups, who filed suit in federal court in Texas to invalidate the guidance. Shortly thereafter, in a separate lawsuit, the Biden Administration challenged Idaho’s abortion ban in federal court, arguing that its lack of a health exception unlawfully conflicts with federal protections under EMTALA. The lawsuit argued that the law in Idaho would criminalize doctors for providing abortion in emergency circumstances and force them to choose between complying with state or federal law – a choice where the consequences could involve prison time. (For transparency, we note that one of us, Skye Perryman, leads an organization that represented a coalition of medical and health organizations in filing amicus briefs in support of the government’s position in the Idaho and Texas cases.) This week, a federal court in Idaho agreed , enjoining Idaho’s abortion law to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA. Deferring to the medical community, the court concluded that “Idaho’s criminal abortion law will undoubtedly deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations,” subjecting “women in medical crisis to periods of serious physical and emotional trauma as they wait to get nearer and nearer to death.” As the Court put it, “Dobbs did not overrule the Supremacy Clause. Thus, even when it comes to regulating abortion, state law must yield to conflicting federal law.” But a day before the Idaho decision, a federal court in Texas endorsed Paxton’s attack, preliminarily enjoining the Biden Administration’s guidance interpreting EMTALA in Texas. This court reasoned that the statute protects both pregnant people and their fetuses. It failed to address the fact that, in many medical emergencies, pregnant women are faced with the situation where their wanted pregnancy is nonviable. This equivalence between the value of a nonviable fetus and a woman’s life is quite troubling. Read More: An Alabama Clinic Reinvents Itself for a Post-Roe World These cases will presumably be appealed to the Ninth and Fifth Circuits, potentially setting up the first post-Dobbs circuit decisions related to abortion, which will concern the limits of state power. There could end up being intense pressure on the Supreme Court to weigh in. Though the Supreme Court in Dobbs purported to “return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives,” it did not allow states to ignore their obligations under federal law. And as many legal scholars predicted, the federal courts will be dealing with the chaos Dobbs caused for years to come. Emboldened by the new post-Dobbs reality, elected leaders are showing their true stripes. Almost overnight, exceptions to abortion bans that most Americans believed were settled are under attack. Indeed, most state bans now lack rape and incest exceptions. Not only are health exceptions being stripped too, but states are even considering laws without exceptions for the life of the pregnant person. All of this is occurring while the United States is in the midst of a maternal-mortality crisis: we have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the industrialized world. Women are twice as likely to die from childbirth in the United States as in countries such as the United Kingdom. The crisis disproportionately affects women of color and Black women in particular, who are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than their white counterparts. Clearly, this movement seeking to deny pregnant women of emergency care is not about life. To mitigate the carnage of state abortion bans, courts must affirm that longstanding federal law requires all states to permit medically necessary abortions in emergency situations. At the same time, citizens also have a role in holding their elected leaders accountable. The state attorneys general defending these laws and the legislatures and governors who enact them are all elected. Those who not only seek to ban medically necessary abortions but also fight in court to deprive their own citizens of federal protections that save pregnant patients’ lives should be held to account.

Here’s How Conservatives Are Using Civil Rights Law to Restrict Abortion,Abigail Abrams,Politics,"January 1, 2020 12:01 AM EST","Six states passed laws in 2019 banning abortions once a “fetal heartbeat” is detected, which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy. While most of these new laws were challenged in court and are temporarily blocked, the trend has continued: another 10 states introduced similar bills in 2019 and more are expected this year.  The sudden success of these measures is not an accident. They are the result of a concerted new strategy by abortion opponents, researchers have found.  Instead of focusing on religious or women’s health concerns, supporters of Georgia’s “heartbeat” bill advanced their arguments by “co-opting the legal successes of progressive movements” such as the civil rights movement and the LGBT rights movement, according to a new study, published in Sexual and Reproductive Health Matters. Throughout the testimony surrounding the bill, Georgia state lawmakers and community members argued that fetuses are a class of persons entitled to protection under the law, just like black Americans and LGBT Americans. “If you think back to the same sex marriage debate, the state of Massachusetts recognized the franchise of marriage more expansively in Massachusetts than the minimum requirement of federal law,” argued bill sponsor and Georgia State Rep. Ed Setzler in a quote mentioned in the study. “This is walking that same tradition.” The idea that fetuses deserve rights is not a new concept, but it was once considered a fairly fringe idea. When the first “heartbeat” bill appeared in Ohio in 2011, anti-abortion groups were divided over whether to support it. But since President Donald Trump got elected and tipped the balance of the Supreme Court, abortion opponents have embraced the strategy. “We were surprised at the references to particular progressive victories, including things like the passage of the 14th Amendment [and] same sex marriage,” says Dabney Evans, an associate professor at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health and co-author of the study, which may be the first systematic analysis of the political language around early abortion bans in the United States. She and other researchers examined the testimony and legislative debate advocating for Georgia’s six-week abortion ban last March.  So-called “heartbeat” bills have been controversial in part because they seek to ban abortions at a stage when many women do not yet know they are pregnant, which reproductive rights advocates say means they ban nearly all abortions. Doctors like Dr. Jen Gunter have also noted that, despite the frequently used “heartbeat” language, the cardiac activity measured at six weeks comes from a cluster of cells called the fetal pole rather than from something that looks like a heart.  Evans and her co-author, Subasri Narasimhan, a post-doctoral fellow at Emory’s Center for Reproductive Health Research in the Southeast, noted several examples of legislators and community members “misrepresenting medical science” in their support of the Georgia bill. But the arguments went further, the study says, explaining that the Georgia bill’s supporters were effectively “foreshadowing their legal strategy for a future claim before the U.S. Supreme Court.”  The study outlines three major arguments that the bill’s supporters used to advance their argument. They first asserted that a “heartbeat” was a sign of life and therefore personhood. Then lawmakers and community members said that if fetuses were living, they were a “vulnerable” class of people who deserve rights and protections. And finally, the study explains, the bill’s supporters said that Georgia should be allowed to expand rights and protections to this new group as a matter of states’ rights. In the Georgia legislature, Setzler, the bill’s sponsor, cited the Dred Scott v. Sanford decision to imply that the Supreme Court had similarly ruled incorrectly in Roe v. Wade. “A 7-2 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857 said Dred Scott was property, he wasn’t a person,” Setzler said during a committee hearing in March. “The same Supreme Court, by a 7-2 decision, that didn’t recognize Dred Scott, didn’t recognize the humanity of a child in the womb and it’s our opportunity to fix that.” Another state legislator balked at the comparison and referenced the Three-Fifths compromise as a time when legislators dangerously intervened to decide who was human. But Setzler was undeterred: “Can you help me, through this bill, fully recognize them so it’s not three fifths of a person but a full person?” he asked. The researchers called these comparisons “false equivalencies,” but added that they add a new dimension to the anti-abortion advocates’ playbook. While previous debates over abortion might have included religious language or restrictions on what providers must do in the name of women’s safety, the study found very little religious rhetoric, and concerns about women’s health were largely brought up by the bill’s opponents.  “In the recent past, anti-abortion advocates have responded by co-opting the language of women’s health and science, focusing most recently on women’s health protection,” the researchers wrote. “While not abandoning this explanatory position, current anti-abortion efforts like HB 481 appear to be layering on a protectionist argument for unborn persons.” Pro-abortion advocates who fought Georgia’s bill — including those now challenging it in court — have argued that this and other heartbeat bills would actually harm precisely the communities that civil rights laws are designed to protect. An abortion ban, they say, will disproportionately hurt people of color and LGBT people in Georgia who already face barriers to accessing health care.  As is standard practice, the study does not include the names of participants it quotes, but all of the material the researchers analyzed comes from publicly available videos of committee hearings and legislative sessions. TIME reviewed the videos to match Setzler’s quotes with those mentioned in the study. While Evans and Narasimhan only studied the arguments around Georgia’s abortion ban, they believe their findings will be useful to researchers, community members, activists and legislators in many other states. That’s in large part because many of the “heartbeat” bills being considered around the country are based on model legislation from a group called Faith2Action, which says it provides “the largest network of pro-family organizations.”  “In public health, often people examine the outcomes of policy or legislation, but the process itself is often overlooked,” Narasimhan says. Here, the process is still ongoing as many state legislatures will reconvene this month, and Narasimhan expects other states to make similar arguments to those made in Georgia.  The study also provides a learning opportunity for voters, she added. “This is part of the democracy that we live in,” she says. “This legislative debate is public record. Our analyzing it in this systematized way is bringing forth information into the public record as well and allowing people to hear and see what these debates look like and what tactics are being used for things that will ultimately impact them.” Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/5753300/heartbeat-bill-civil-rights-law/
New Poll Reveals Real Dividing Line Between Abortion Supporters and Opponents,Philip Elliott,Politics;The D.C. Brief,"May 2, 2024 7:00 AM EDT","This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Across nearly every faith and in all but five states, a majority of Americans support at least some access to abortion. That's a major conclusion of a new massive survey of 22,000 people from the Public Religion Research Institute.  But the survey's most revealing insight is the group in which anti-abortion sentiment remains strongest: white Christian nationalists.  On a state-by-state level, the more prone to Christian nationalism, the less likely PRRI found support for abortion. Statistically, it’s Mississippi at one end and Oregon at the other. Unsurprisingly, that spectrum also overlays neatly with the efforts to protect or scrap access to abortion. It’s a quiet chasm, but one that speaks to the latent threat of white Christian nationalism that Democrats and more than a few Republicans have been reluctant to confront head-on. “Clearly, the higher the score for Christian nationalism among state residents, there's a clear linkage in terms of attitudes about abortion,” PRRI’s president Melissa Deckman told me this week ahead of the data’s public release. “It shows how clearly the Christian nationalist influences are making policy, and it's really pretty stark.” Just 25% of those identified as Christian nationalists say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. White Christian nationalists were the most opposed to abortion, with a scant 29% weighing in on the side of abortion. Hispanic Christian nationalists (34%) and Black Christian nationalists (59%) were more supportive of abortion rights. Among those who completely rejected the tenets of Christian nationalism, the question of abortion rights is almost unanimously—93%—supported.  The D.C. Brief has previously flagged the pernicious elements of Christian nationalism—specifically, white Christian nationalism—and its bleed into U.S. politics. The theology that the United States is a uniquely divined project that has its governance and godliness intertwined and blessed has been used aplenty by some of the most cynical political artists in the nation, and to great effect. A politician who can claim to be on a mission from God is not subject to the same level of fact-checking as one running on mortal rationality. In states with total bans on abortion, a staggering 53% of residents say they still support abortion rights in most or all cases. Put plainly: this aspect of democracy is not working, and it reveals a huge gap in our understanding of our neighbors. The threat here is not just to reproductive rights but also to the GOP brand for a generation. “I'm someone who studies Gen Z, and I'm telling you, Gen Z women are not buying anything that the GOP is selling these days. Part of it's linked to their stance on abortion and LGBT rights,” Deckman says.  Nationally, among all Americans, there is a whopping 50-point gap between Democrats and Republicans. A solid 86% of Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while just 36% of Republicans say the same. To say the parties are working off different playbooks is an understatement. They’re not even working with the same set of rules. Abortion is shaping up to a defining issue in this campaign season. In a recent interview with TIME, former President Donald Trump basically confirmed a newfound nihilistic approach in which he pledged to leave it entirely to the states to decide their own levels of abortion access and regulation. But his strongest supporters are cheering on the crackdowns across red states. Florida, for instance, on Wednesday put into effect a ban on abortions at the six-week mark, ending its stand-alone status as an abortion haven in the South. The next closest state Southerners can turn to for the procedure is Virginia. Yet, as suggested in earlier surveys and confirmed yet again with PRRI’s data, only five states remain where supporters of abortion rights are in the minority: North Dakota and South Dakota at 47%; Arkansas at 46%; and Idaho and Utah logging in at 45% support.  In the seven battleground states that are expected to define the presidential race—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—a collective 64% of residents say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Even red states are seeing a whiff of goodwill toward abortion rights; 57% of residents there say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, including 59% of women.  For decades, Democratic strategists treated abortion as a third-rail of an issue. Once Roe v Wade fell, that stopped being the case. Members of most religious traditions now see abortion as a part of the healthcare system that should be legal in most or all cases. Of the survey’s 16 breakout categories—including unaffiliated—just four have majority net disapproval of abortion rights. As expected, white evangelical Protestants top the roster with 72% saying abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. Latter-day Saints, or Mormons, follow at 69%, Hispanic Protestants say the same at 58%, and Jehovah’s Witnesses weigh in at 54%. But Jews, Catholics, mainline Protestants, and Muslims alike are all fine leaving the decision with patients and their health providers. That may explain why, when put to voters, protecting abortion rights has prevailed at the ballot box every time it’s been put there since the Dobbs decision. And it’s why, heading into the final push toward November, most Democrats have decided that abortion is not an inconvenient distraction best left on the shelf. White Christian nationalism and its loud minority may now be the albatross on U.S. policy making, but it’s a pretty useful demagogue, too. Make sense of what matters in Washington.

What the Buffalo Tragedy Has to Do With the Effort to Overturn Roe,Jasmine Aguilera;Abigail Abrams;A history of ‘replacement theory’ in the anti-abortion movement,Politics;abortion,"May 21, 2022 8:00 AM EDT","In the week since a gunman killed 10 people in a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., countless articles and television spots have unpacked the racist conspiracy he shared in a hate-filled manifesto before his shooting spree. The conspiracy—the so-called great replacement theory—is the idea that Democratic lawmakers and other elites are working to force white people into a minority in the United States, usually by increasing immigration. Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson has hammered on the idea more than 400 times while railing against immigration on his show, according to a New York Times investigation, and elected Republicans, including Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida have bluntly echoed the language in comments and campaign materials criticizing Democrats’ immigration policy. But the conspiracy theory also animates another cornerstone of the modern Republican agenda: opposition to abortion.  The anti-abortion movement was born in the 19th century of white fears of a declining white birth rate, says Jennifer Holland, assistant professor of history at the University of Oklahoma. The idea was that by allowing white women to receive abortions, lawmakers were leaving white populations vulnerable to demographic “replacement” by non-white or immigrant groups with higher birth rates. In the 1870s and ’80s, the fear was primarily focused on Jewish and Catholic immigrants, especially those from Italy or Ireland, who had higher birthrates than white Protestants at the time; now, white power organizations that embrace “replacement theory” focus on Black and Latino communities, which have higher birth rates than whites.  While the Buffalo gunman did not explicitly mention the word “abortion” in his manifesto, he references birth rates more than 40 times, according to a TIME analysis, and repeatedly expresses his belief that “white birth rates must change.” This week, Matt Schlapp, the head of the Conservative Political Action Conference, explicitly linked replacement theory, immigration and anti-abortion, telling reporters in Hungary that overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision enshrining a right to abortion, would be a good “first step” in fixing the U.S.’s immigration “problem.” “If you’re worried about this quote-unquote replacement, why don’t we start there?” he said. “Start with allowing our own people to live.” The modern mainstream anti-abortion movement denounces racist groups and ideologies. In January, after white supremacists marched alongside protesters at March for Life event, then showed up at the March for Life rally in Washington, DC, the anti-abortion movement’s biggest annual gathering, organizers decried any association with them. “We condemn any organization that seeks to exclude a person or group of people based on the color of their skin or any other characteristic,” Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, said in a statement to TIME after the January rally. Neither Mancini nor National Right to Life, another prominent national anti-abortion group, responded to TIME’s requests for comments for this article. But if mainstream anti-abortion activists flatly reject rightwing extremists, the relationship is complicated by the fact that rightwing extremists see the anti-abortion movement as a useful political ally—and a potential pool of new recruits. In December, Thomas Rousseau the leader of the white nationalist group Patriot Front reminded his members of approaching opportunities to recruit and proselytize. “Our two March For Life events are coming up,” he wrote to his followers, according to leaked chats published by media nonprofit Unicorn Riot. “The aim is to be more understated, friendly, in smaller groups, and get as many flyers out as possible.”  Rightwing extremists attach themselves “like a leech” to traditional Republican constituencies, Mike Madrid, a veteran Republican strategist who has been critical of the party in the age of Trump, told TIME earlier this year. In doing so, he says, they legitimize and normalize their extremist positions.  Read More: The Coming Battle Over the Anti-abortion Movement’s Future Some mainstream anti-abortion activists worry that racist and nationalist groups appear to be increasingly vocal at their events. “When you breed this nationalism together with a movement that’s largely religious, you start to see these types of things crop up,” says Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, the founder of the anti-abortion group New Wave Feminists, which calls itself a “pro-life feminist” organization. “But never to the degree this year. I was horrified that an actual white supremacy group was there” at the March for Life rally in D.C. In 2018, Herndon-De La Rosa’s organization pushed out its vice president, Kristen Hatten, after she began sharing white supremacist ideas, including reportedly sharing a Tweet that mocked the idea of Muslims becoming a British majority on social media, according to HuffPost. Hatten later told HuffPost: “I’ve said I identify with the alt-right to a large extent, and I do…That said, there are elements within the alt-right with whom I don’t see eye to eye. I am not a national socialist nor am I a ‘Nazi.’ I am not a eugenicist. In fact I remain pro-life.” Belief in rightwing conspiracies is ascendent in an increasingly conservative Republican Party, says Kurt Braddock, assistant professor of communications at American University and a faculty fellow at the school’s Polarization and Extremism Research Innovation Lab. “What we’ve seen from the Right in recent years is that what was originally on the fringe in 2015, from 2016, forward, the fringe has moved more and more into the mainstream,” he says. Nearly one in three American adults now hold a belief that is in line with the “replacement theory.” According to an Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published May 9, a third of Americans believe “a group of people is trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants for electoral gains.” Another 29% shared the concern that a rise in immigration is leading to native-born Americans losing influence in culture and politics. Prior to the Civil War, abortion was legal with minimum restrictions in the U.S. But when the war ended, white Protestant Americans’ fears shifted. After slavery was outlawed, the women’s suffrage movement began, and immigration increased, the idea that a white Protestant America would soon be “diluted” or “replaced” by immigrant groups gained steam. In 1858, group of physicians with the American Medical Association, led by Horatio Storer, began lobbying lawmakers to begin restricting and banning abortions on the grounds that a low birth rate among whites would allow immigrants, particularly Catholics from Ireland and other parts of Europe, to overtake white Protestants demographically.  While “replacement theory” wasn’t given a name until 2012, these 19th century activists embraced the notion and language explicitly. “If a majority of all the youths and children under fifteen years of age in a place is made up from those of a foreign parentage, and is relatively increasing in number every year, how long will it be before such a power will be felt in the management, if not in the control, of the municipal government of those cities and towns?” said one of those physicians, according to researchers at Northwestern University and University of California, Berkeley. Storer’s movement was successful. By the year 1900, abortion was illegal in all U.S. states, marking a profound shift in four decades. (Ironically, Storer would in the later years of his life convert to Catholicism, according to James Madison University’s undergraduate research journal). “It really is a radical break from American laws before then,” Holland, at the University of Oklahoma, says. Prior to this group of physicians involvement in the procedure, abortion was widely legal and was inherited by English common law. “The question is, why would state legislatures be open to [abortion restrictions]?” Holland adds. “It very much has to do with race.” Read more: How the ‘Great Replacement Theory’ Has Fueled Racist Violence Even on its own terms, the logic of anti-abortion racism is deeply convoluted. People of color receive disproportionately more abortions than white Americans. But Seyward Darby, author of Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism, says logic is not the point. “You have to step away from theory, and you have to realize the kind of wider world worldview,” she tells TIME. “What they ultimately want is a series of policies, including making white women have more babies, by force if necessary, and then finding ways if not to reduce the number of children who are not white in the country, then to marginalize them to such an extent that they have no power.” Some far right anti-abortion extremists oppose both immigration and abortions for white women only, and throughout history, similar racist thought has undergirded forced-sterilization campaigns of women of color. “For white supremacists, they are not seeking to end abortion because of any kind of morality related to the fetus itself,” says Alex DiBranco, executive director of the Institute for Research on Male Supremacism, an organization of experts and scholars who study misogynist movements and ideology. “They’re very much seeing this as a strategic and tactical way to force white women to give birth.” With “replacement theory” and other racist ideologies no longer relegated to 19th century lobbying efforts or the fringes of the internet, experts on political extremism say that Americans must now grapple with the implications of these beliefs on mainstream politics. “It’s difficult to get into the minds of the people that engage in this violence and say that they’re pro life,” says Braddock, at American University. “Generally speaking … a lot of these individuals, what they’ll say is that they had to engage in violence to precipitate something that would inherently make the world better around them.” With reporting by Vera Bergengruen Write to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com and Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6178135/buffalo-shooting-abortion-replacement-theory/
Why Donald Trump’s Savvy Pivot On Abortion Shouldn’t Surprise You,Philip Elliott,Politics;The D.C. Brief,"April 9, 2024 11:45 AM EDT","This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. It was a moment some on the right had long suspected would come but many rank-and-file members refused to admit was possible: their champion against abortion rights, Donald Trump, would go wobbly.  The former—and perhaps future—President this week declined to endorse a federal ban on abortion. Instead, the presumptive Republican nominee said it should remain up to the states to negotiate an inconsistent landscape when it comes to when pregnancies can be terminated. The New York mogul notably didn’t back a federal 15-week ban on abortions, which GOP leaders like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Trump’s former counselor Kellyanne Conway support, showing that Trump’s dominance over the GOP does not always translate to an easy marriage of ideas or ideology. (As President, Trump supported a 20-week federal ban, although his hard lines on abortion rights were incredibly fluid.) The rage from his anti-abortion base came immediately, but it’s not entirely clear if there will be any electoral consequences for Trump. There is no conservative alternative to his candidacy, and President Joe Biden has made restoring the federal right to an abortion protected for a half century via Roe v. Wade a campaign promise. Put simply: Trump shifted his position in a way that will anger his right flank that has nowhere else to go and could soften Democrats’ grip on the female vote. The move may be as insincere as it is smart. Conservative lawmakers and leaders alike were hardly shy about their frustrations.  ""I respectfully disagree with President Trump’s statement that abortion is a states’ rights issue,"" said Graham, a South Carolina perma-apologist for Trumpism. “I will continue to advocate that there should be a national minimum standard limiting abortion at [15] weeks because the child is capable of feeling pain, with exceptions for rape, incest[,] and life of the mother.” Responded Trump: ""Many Good Republicans lost Elections because of this Issue, and people like Lindsey Graham, that are unrelenting, are handing Democrats their dream of the House, Senate, and perhaps even the Presidency.” As is his nature, Trump didn’t show any sign of contrition. If anything, he actually revealed something more significant: he made it clear his choice was about politics, not principles.  Conservatives have made this bargain with Trump before. In 2015, he basically promised religious leaders that he would outsource his nominations for judges to conservatives who have spent a generation preparing for the end of Roe. In turn, religious leaders—especially when it became apparent Trump was heading toward the Republican nomination—rallied behind the thrice-married alleged adulterer who in the weeks before the 2016 votes were cast allegedly used a fixer to pay off a porn star. Former Vice President Mike Pence, a devout Christian who joined the Trump campaign as its fig leaf to the religious bloc of voters, expressed frustration with Trump’s new position this week. “However much our Republican nominee or other candidates seek to marginalize the cause of life, I know pro-life Americans will never relent until we see the sanctity of life restored to the center of American law in every state in this country,” he said. And Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, the anti-abortion rights group that advised many in the Trump orbit over the years, similarly slammed the switch. Its leader, Marjorie Dannenfelser, blamed Trump’s consultants for missing the party’s base. But SBA Pro-Life America nonetheless repeated its pledge to help Republicans retake power, joining other groups like Students for Life, the Faith and Freedom Coalition, the Family Research Council, National Right to Life, and CatholicVote.  While there can be some sincere outrage over Trump’s callous flip-flop in an election year, most of the feigned shock is for show. As one friend—former TIME correspondent Elizabeth Dias—wrote in 2016, religious conservatives made their bet: Trump would be a vessel for their ambitions. (Dias and another former campaign trail pal of mine, Lisa Lerer, will unpack all of this in their new book out in June about the fall of Roe from their perches in The New York Times’ Washington bureau.) It is important to be honest right now. Conservatives, especially in the self-described pro-life wing of politics, have always known Trump was using them just as much as they were playing with him. It was an unnatural alliance between a playboy and pastors, but it served their needs to give Trump power. Now, firmly atop that MAGA machine, Trump does not need the anti-abortion activists as much. He can take them—and their votes and dollars—for granted because he knows this truth: Where else are they going to go? It may be crass, but Trump is reading the battlefield accurately.

"For People With Disabilities, Losing Abortion Access Can Be a Matter of Life or Death",Jamie Ducharme,Health;abortion,"January 25, 2023 10:09 AM EST","These days, Flora Ellis’s mother keeps a stash of morning-after pills in a closet in their Oklahoma home. That’s not just because she’s a “cool mom,” although Ellis, 20, confirms that she is. It’s because Ellis was born with a connective-tissue disorder that prevents her body from properly making collagen. In addition to limiting her mobility and contributing to frequent injuries, Ellis’s condition means that pregnancy comes with a chance of organ rupture. Now that abortion is banned in Oklahoma, neither Ellis nor her mother want to take chances. Ellis’s health issues prevent her from using some forms of birth control, so the trove of morning-after pills serves as an extra insurance policy. “It makes me feel very unsafe that I might have less access [to abortion] now,” Ellis says. The fall of Roe v. Wade, and the subsequent wave of abortion bans and restrictions in U.S. states, have grave implications for the estimated 26% of U.S. adults with a disability. Pregnancy can be dangerous for anyone, says Dr. Louise Perkins King, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School, but people who enter pregnancy with underlying health issues are at even greater risk. Ensuring that all people, including those with disabilities, have access to essential medical care includes guaranteeing “the option of termination if it’s better for their health,” Perkins King says. In addition, abortion bans represent a threat to bodily autonomy, “a core principle of the disability rights movement,” as the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) wrote in a statement after a draft of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe leaked last May. “Policies that restrict access to abortion will drastically exacerbate threats to the autonomy, health, and overall well-being of disabled people.” Since then, a dozen U.S. states—including many in the South, the U.S. region with the highest rate of disability—have almost entirely banned abortion. For people with disabilities, those laws only compound long-standing obstacles to abortion care, says Joy Moonan, a Texas-based disability advocate and attorney who has cerebral palsy. Even securing reliable transportation to an abortion provider can be a challenge for someone with limited mobility, Moonan says, and many health care providers aren’t well-versed in caring for people with disabilities. In 2022, Senators Tammy Duckworth and Patty Murray introduced legislation meant to ease that problem by funding training programs for providers, as well as recruiting more people with disabilities into the health-care field, but it hasn’t progressed since being introduced. “People with disabilities also have sex. They want to start families, they want to date,” Moonan says. But “people don’t see people with disabilities that way.” Indeed, the U.S. has a terrible track record when it comes to providing ethical care for people with disabilities. Forced sterilization was common for much of the 20th century, and many states still have laws that allow it. Wanda Felty learned that reality after her daughter Kayla was born. Kayla’s brain did not fully form in utero, leading to significant cognitive and visual impairment. When Kayla, now 34, was young, well-meaning people told Felty to consider having her daughter’s uterus removed as a precaution against pregnancy, since sexual violence against people with disabilities is common. Almost 40% of female rape victims had a disability when they were assaulted, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Felty was floored, then angry, that anyone would suggest removing part of her daughter’s body without a medical need. Those emotions came rushing back after Roe fell last year. Felty, who lives in Oklahoma, works for an organization that supports people with disabilities and their families. After Oklahoma banned abortion, she began fielding calls from frantic parents who wanted to learn about sterilization for their children with disabilities—and got angry all over again. Though Felty was raised to believe that abortion is wrong, lived experience has changed her perspective. She’s enraged that, because lawmakers have taken away the option of abortion in some states, families are now making heartbreaking choices to protect their children. “We’ve taken away rights [instead of] protecting them from violent crimes,” she says. While most abortion bans do include narrow exceptions for victims of rape and incest, as well as medical emergencies that put the parent’s life at risk, providers in restrictive states may be hesitant to offer abortion care even if it fits one of those exceptions, for fear of legal, financial, or professional consequences. The loophole for medical emergencies can be particularly murky, since it’s not always clear what constitutes a “life-threatening” complication. That scares Ellis. Given her connective-tissue disorder, “there’s a risk when I get pregnant. Does [abortion] count [as life-saving] then?” Ellis says. “Or does it have to be once my uterus rips apart?” Keeley Knight, 24, has similar concerns. She was born with an under-developed heart and has known since she was a teenager that pregnancy and childbirth could place a potentially fatal amount of strain on her cardiovascular system. She has long used an IUD to prevent pregnancy, and she and her husband recently moved from Oklahoma to Kansas City, Mo.—in part because Knight would have better access to abortion, if necessary, with a short trip over the border to Kansas. Knight says many people she knows are deeply opposed to abortion, viewing it as against “God’s will.” But that argument doesn’t make any sense to her. “Me and God have fought for my life to get this far. You have no idea how hard we have fought,” Knight says. “I’m not going to just give that up because I got pregnant.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com",https://time.com/6248104/abortion-access-people-with-disabilities/
Supreme Court Unanimously Strikes Down Challenge to Abortion Drug Mifepristone,Nik Popli,Politics;abortion,"June 13, 2024 1:59 PM EDT","The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously rejected a challenge to curtail access to the commonly-used abortion pill mifepristone, with the Justices finding that a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations had no legal basis to challenge the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the medication. As a result, the lawsuit has been dismissed and the abortion pill can remain widely available. ""Because plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone, plaintiffs are unregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA’s regulation of others,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the unanimous decision. The case centered on the accessibility of mifepristone, the only drug approved specifically for terminating pregnancies, and whether the government applied a lawful review process of the drug when it first came out. The Supreme Court decided to hear the case after a lower court in 2023 revoked the FDA’s 23-year-old approval of mifepristone, a move that would restrict how the pill is delivered and distributed. The restrictions, if allowed to go into effect, included cutting off access to the pill through the mail, barring telemedicine prescriptions, and reinstating a seven-week limit on its use—even in states where abortion remains legal. Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California at Davis with an expertise in abortion, described the opinion as a “very narrow textbook ruling on standing” that “doesn’t tell you much beyond the narrow question in the case.” “I'm sure the abortion rights movement is happy that access to mifepristone is unchanged today,” she tells TIME. “At the same time, this ruling doesn't say anything about any of the substantive arguments made against mifepristone. All of the arguments are just as alive today as they were yesterday, if other plaintiffs can raise them.” Medication abortion has become an increasingly common and safe method for terminating pregnancies; more than five million women in the U.S. have used mifepristone for abortions since its approval, and six in 10 abortions last year were performed through medication, up from 53% in 2020, research published in March 2024 from the Guttmacher Institute shows. Although dozens of countries have approved mifepristone for use, including the U.S., its safety has come under scrutiny after the fall of Roe v. Wade. The plaintiffs in the case—led by a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations—argued that the FDA did not adequately study the safety risks of the drug before approving it for sale in 2000, claiming that doctors have had to treat patients who suffered from complications from mifepristone. The Justices, however, said that the doctors did not suffer the type of direct harm that would give them legal grounds to bring the lawsuit. The FDA has also countered safety concerns about mifepristone, pointing to data documenting the drug’s efficacy and safety, ​​terminating pregnancies successfully  99.6% of the time with a complication rate lower than Tylenol. “The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to elective abortion and to FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,” Kavanaugh wrote in the ruling. But “those kinds of objections alone do not establish a justiciable case or controversy in federal court.” Ziegler says the Court’s opinion could offer a potential roadmap to future plaintiffs who do want to establish standing in later cases. It could also enable former President Donald Trump, if he were to be elected to a second term, to prompt the Department of Justice to enforce the rarely used, anti-obscenity law known as the Comstock Act to curtail access to mifepristone, she says. Trump has publicly said that abortion rights should be left to the states, but he declined to comment when asked by TIME in May if he would enforce the Comstock Act. In their ruling, the Justices did not address the plaintiffs’ claim that the FDA’s approval of mifepristone and subsequent modifications to allow mail delivery violated the Comstock Act, which governs how the U.S. Postal Service handles the delivery of contraception and items considered “obscene.” Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas repeatedly invoked the Act during oral arguments. “This is a prominent provision. It’s not some obscure subsection of a complicated, obscure law,” Alito said. “Everybody in this field knew about it.” The ruling marks the first time that the Justices have considered efforts to restrict abortion since their 2022 decision to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. Following that ruling, 14 states completely banned abortion—including medication abortion—and six states began requiring patients to see their physicians in person before getting prescriptions for abortion pills. The issue has become a rallying point for Democrats, and polls show that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022 was met with disapproval by a majority of Americans. President Joe Biden, who has promised to restore abortion protections if Democrats win control of Congress, said in a statement that the Supreme Court’s decision “does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues” and criticized Republicans for allowing extreme abortion bans in certain states.

What Abortion Laws Look Like in the U.S. One Year After the Fall of Roe v. Wade,Sanya Mansoor;Lon Tweeten,U.S.;abortion,"June 21, 2023 5:17 PM EDT","One year has passed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade— unleashing a flurry of abortion restrictions affecting millions of Americans. While abortion until the third trimester of pregnancy remains legal in most states, abortion restrictions have spread across the country since the court reversed almost five decades of precedent in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. More than half a dozen bans immediately took effect under “trigger laws” designed to kick in once Roe no longer applied. In the year since, more states moved to ban abortion through legislative action. Some of those abortion restrictions have been blocked by state courts. Bans on abortion vary in terms of how many weeks after pregnancy they apply—with some taking effect as early as six weeks, before some people may know they are pregnant. Some bans make exceptions for rape or incest; others don’t.  Not all states have moved to restrict abortion since the Supreme Court ruling. Many have expanded access. In some cases, state supreme courts have recognized abortion as a fundamental right. Governors and legislatures have passed laws to protect those seeking or providing an abortion from laws in other states, as many people who want an abortion now are crossing state lines to obtain one. TIME compiled data about abortion restrictions in all 50 states, and D.C. Here’s a look at the landscape of abortion rights in the United States. -With reporting by Julia Zorthian Write to Sanya Mansoor at sanya.mansoor@time.com and Lon Tweeten at lon.tweeten@time.com",https://time.com/6288526/abortion-laws-map-2023-dobbs-anniversary/
His Pregnancy Came as a Shock. Florida’s Abortion Law Made It Harder,Ideas;Shefali Luthra,Ideas;Books,"May 15, 2024 12:04 PM EDT","These are independent reviews of the products mentioned, but TIME receives a commission when purchases are made through affiliate links at no additional cost to the purchaser. Jasper never considered he might be pregnant. Despite the nausea, the stomach pain, the fatigue, the possibility never crossed his mind. He was about six months into testosterone therapy, a form of gender-affirming care.  It had taken ages to get his father and stepmother on board—though 18 years old at the time, Jasper lived with and relied on them for support. But looking in the rearview mirror, he knew treatment was one of the best things he’d ever done for himself. Feeling the peach fuzz grow on his face, hearing his voice deepen, noticing as his jawline shifted and his eyebrows darkened—it was the first time in his life that Jasper felt truly at home in his body. The treatment made him look and feel like himself; it also meant he barely menstruated. That wasn’t a big deal, though. Ever since puberty, he had never had regular periods. Their absence didn’t even register. In June 2022, Jasper caught COVID-19 while traveling with his boyfriend’s family, and between the viral symptoms and newfound back soreness, it became, through no fault of his hosts, one of the most miserable vacations he’d ever taken. When he returned to Orlando, Jasper kept waiting for the pain to get better. When it persisted a month later, he visited a doctor who still couldn’t figure out what was wrong. Nobody thought to check for pregnancy. Then the nausea began, followed by mysterious new stomach pains. After enduring an additional month of discomfort, he scheduled another doctor’s visit. Maybe, they told him, he had an autoimmune condition; perhaps it was rheumatoid arthritis, which ran in his family. But the stomach pains posed a mystery. They referred him for an ultrasound. In August, Jasper scheduled the appointment, choosing a Saturday so he wouldn’t need to take time off work.  He was lying on the table when the clinician broke the news. “Well,” she said. “Of course, you know that you’re pregnant right?” Jasper sat up. “You’re joking.” The telltale symptoms he’d struggled to place were actually something so simple. Still, Jasper couldn’t believe it.  She showed him the screen. “I’m surprised nobody told you,” she said, “because you’re so far along.” From the clinician’s reading of the ultrasound, it looked like Jasper was about 12 weeks pregnant, already through his first trimester. He’d heard about Roe v. Wade being recently overturned but hadn’t yet learned what that meant in his home state—that as of July 2022, while abortion in Florida would still be legal, the state would begin enforcing a law that prohibited the procedure for anyone past 15 weeks of pregnancy. When the nurse told him, it sank in how little time he had.  If Jasper wanted an abortion, he had three weeks to make up his mind, raise the money, and schedule not one but two appointments. That spring, the state courts had upheld a law mandating that anyone seeking an abortion needed to make two visits to the clinic, the first for counseling and the second—at least 24 hours later—for the procedure itself. He had no idea how long he might have to wait to be seen by a doctor. All he knew was he had to move quickly. Jasper left the clinic to call his boyfriend from the car. The phone kept ringing, finally going to voicemail. Jasper called back. It went to voicemail yet again.  Sobbing, he dialed Planned Parenthood. It took him five or six tries before someone answered. He told the woman on the phone he had just found out he was 12 weeks pregnant. Jasper had always figured he’d want an abortion if he were to get pregnant, but now, facing the decision, he was no longer sure what to do. He needed to know his options. How quickly could they see him? Though decades in the making, Roe’s undoing in June 2022 caught many abortion opponents by surprise—particularly elected Republican officials who had long campaigned on outlawing the procedure as early as possible. Abortion bans were and remain unpopular with the vast majority of American voters, including in Florida. But restrictions have historically been a way to maintain favor with influential hardline groups. Conservative-led statehouses could pass laws restricting abortion, assuming they would be blocked under Roe and lawmakers would never face any actual consequences.  After Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, passing an abortion ban meant dealing with the human toll. In Florida, a once-purple state tilting red, that tension was even more potent. In the months before Roe’s overturn, the GOP-run state legislature, urged on by ultra-conservative governor Ron DeSantis, had passed a 15-week abortion ban. The law couldn’t take effect as long as Roe was intact—it posed a clear violation of the federal abortion protection—but functioned instead as a contingency plan, an indication of how Florida would restrict access if and when Roe fell. Poll after poll showed most Floridians opposed this policy. A year before, when Republican state legislators had attempted to ban abortions for anyone past 20 weeks, the bill could not even get out of committee. The right to an abortion was supposed to be sacrosanct in Florida—in 1989, the state’s Supreme Court found that it was protected in their constitution. Until the 15-week ban, which went into effect in July 2022 after the Dobbs decision left abortion restriction to the states, abortions for people up to 24 weeks of pregnancy had been allowed.  Supporters attempted to frame their law as a middle-ground, noting most abortions do occur within the first trimester. And in Florida, only 6% of all abortions done in 2021 happened after 12 weeks of pregnancy. But that argument failed to consider who would be affected by a 15-week ban, a law criticized by medical providers, who noted there is no health-based reason to deny someone an abortion at that point. Historically, the people who sought abortions later in pregnancy have been those who could not afford to get to a clinic earlier—those for whom pulling together money, time off work, and childcare to make an appointment represented tremendous obstacles. There were people who did not learn until later about the risks to their pregnancies because doctors couldn’t detect them yet, or those, like Jasper, who did not realize they were pregnant, for whom a 15-week deadline meant almost no room to decide what to do.  Still, when Roe fell, Florida offered access for people living in Louisiana, Georgia, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama, all of which had more restrictive abortion laws. In the ensuing year, it was one of only four states in the Southeast that allowed abortion at all. And as the third-largest state in the country by population, Florida had the most options, with more than 60 clinics.  In 2022 alone, Florida recorded a 38% increase in abortions from the previous year. Nine months after Dobbs, 12,460 more abortions than usual were recorded, an average increase of almost 1,400 more abortions per month. No state in the country experienced a larger jump.  With abortions after 15 weeks outlawed, appointments quadrupled across the state’s Planned Parenthood affiliates. Most came from out of state, from across the South. Florida became arguably the nation’s most important abortion sanctuary.  Jasper had finally gotten through to someone who could schedule an abortion consultation. His window to decide was rapidly closing, but there weren’t any openings for weeks. Things had been hectic all summer, with patients from all over the South flocking to the Orlando clinic. By the time they could find an opening for Jasper’s first appointment—the consultation, not the procedure itself—it would be after the 15-week deadline.  Jasper didn’t want to tell his family. He’d begun rebuilding his relationship with them, but things felt fragile. And his stepmother, raised Catholic, deeply opposed abortion. If Jasper had to leave Florida, his boyfriend had family in Las Vegas, where abortion was legal up to 24 weeks. They’d have a place to stay, and an excuse for why they were leaving. Running the numbers mentally, he could probably find round-trip tickets for $200.  “Wait,” the woman on the phone broke through his thoughts. “We just had a cancellation.” It was in four days. Jasper would get an ultrasound, go through his state-mandated counseling, and decide what he wanted to do about his pregnancy. Without thinking, he took it. Still crying, Jasper tried calling his boyfriend again. This time, he was able to deliver the news. The thought flickered through his mind: if he had been born cis, he never would’ve had to worry about pregnancy or abortion. This was yet another way his body didn’t fully feel like his own, and another way it felt like Florida—which had also recently passed a law outlawing gender-affirming care for people younger than 18—was attempting to deny him basic physical autonomy. In four days, he knew, he’d be confronted with the decision about whether he wanted to end his pregnancy or if he could envision life as a parent. He hardly felt prepared.  Right after Dobbs, 13 states were early adopters in banning abortion almost entirely. Anti-abortion advocates now had time to focus on the next phase: states that didn’t outlaw abortion right away, but that incrementally limited access such that, in a few years, the procedure would become largely unavailable.  Polling from the Public Research Religion Institute after Roe fell showed almost two-thirds of Floridians believed abortion should be legal in most or all cases. Another survey, conducted in the last week of February 2023, found 75% of registered voters did not support a law banning abortion after six weeks, which is before many women know they are pregnant. The distaste was bipartisan: a majority of Republicans in the poll said they wouldn’t back such a ban. Yet what constituents wanted didn’t matter. Months after Dobbs and the institution of the 15-week ban, Florida Republicans won a supermajority in the state’s legislature, and DeSantis cruised to reelection. Pressure from the state’s anti-abortion lobby was immediate, along with mounting attention from national anti-abortion groups, who identified Florida as a priority state. Given its large population and geographic significance, they assessed correctly that Florida-specific restrictions would have outsize importance.If the GOP wanted to hold onto their support, they’d have to push for more than just a 15-week cutoff.  On March 7, 2023, Florida’s Republican lawmakers introduced their six-week bill. Unlike legislation in most other GOP-led states, it did introduce exceptions for people who had become pregnant as a result of rape or incest. Still, exceptions applied only up to 15 weeks of pregnancy, and only if people could produce documents such as police reports, restraining orders, or court orders certifying that they had in fact become pregnant as a result of rape or incest, a stipulation that made the carveout functionally unworkable, given how few survivors ever report rape or incest and the tight turnaround for people navigating trauma.  The six-week ban lingered in court for almost a year, finally taking effect May 1, 2024—after the court’s conservative majority eviscerated the state’s abortion-rights protection. Suddenly, the closest option for someone in Miami was Virginia or Illinois, a distance unfathomable for most medical care.   This latest prohibition has put an end to the notion that a Republican-led state could “compromise” on abortion. The decision has opened the door for the state to go further, potentially outlawing abortion completely within years.  Even before the six-week ban, when the cutoff for the procedure was at 15, Jasper had little time to decide what to do. At his consultation, Jasper learned that his pregnancy was not 12 weeks as he had been told but closer to 14.  The clinic was still quiet when Jasper arrived for his abortion, but it filled with patients over the course of the morning. Some looked like they were there for birth control, others he deduced were in a similar situation to him. One girl clutched pictures from her ultrasound. Seeing the fear and confusion on her face was like looking in a mirror.  The abortion was simple: he received a mild sedative, medication to open up his cervix, and a straightforward surgery to remove the fetus. It was a safe, easy procedure—and immensely painful. And then it was over.  Jasper’s boyfriend had picked up pho from a restaurant they both loved, and the two watched TV in bed all evening. Over seven days, Jasper had learned he was pregnant, processed the news, scheduled an abortion, and after two visits to a clinic, terminated his pregnancy. He didn’t regret it. But the feeling stayed with him—a nagging voice asking, what if? What if he’d been able to give birth and put up a child for adoption? Could he have become a parent, young as he was? He’d never had the chance to consider.  He wished he’d had more time. But that was a luxury nobody could afford.

Lawmakers Scramble to Reform Digital Privacy After Roe Reversal,Nik Popli;Vera Bergengruen,Politics;abortion,"July 1, 2022 12:44 PM EDT","Before Roe v. Wade granted women the constitutional right to abortion in 1973, most abortion procedures were kept hidden, even from close family members. Some women destroyed evidence and traveled in the wee hours of the morning to cover their tracks. But with today’s advances in technology, even though it’s never been easier or safer to access abortion at home, keeping it private could turn out to be much harder. The websites and apps that people use every day leave a digital footprint that’s nearly impossible to hide. The Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade on June 24 has directed a spotlight on the question of digital surveillance, as Google searches, location information, period-tracking apps and other personal digital data could be collected and used as evidence of a crime if one seeks to terminate a pregnancy—or helps someone do so—in states where it’s illegal. The prevalence of abortion pills, which allow people to end their pregnancies in their own homes, raises new privacy issues, as most patients must order the pills over the Internet or access a telemedicine appointment to have the medication prescribed. While some lawmakers have been fighting for this issue for years, legislation that would enshrine safeguards against the collection of personal data by governments and companies for criminal surveillance and corporate profit has stalled. But the urgency has intensified in recent weeks. “The answer can’t be just don’t use technology,” Rep. Sara Jacobs, a Democrat from California who introduced a digital privacy bill in June, tells TIME. “These are services that are very helpful to people. The answer is for us in government to do our job and put the protections in place.” The day of the Supreme Court’s decision, Google search interest for “how to get an abortion” was more than six times higher than the previous day. Internet searches like these could turn up in criminal cases, and it’s hardly out of left field. In 2017, prosecutors used a Mississippi woman’s search history for pregnancy-terminating medication as evidence in a trial over the death of her fetus. And in 2015, prosecutors used text messages about abortion pills, exchanged between friends, to convict a woman of child neglect and feticide. “The current privacy protections are fairly weak,” says Hayley Tsukayama, a senior legislative activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for digital rights. There is no single, comprehensive federal law regulating how user data is collected, stored or shared, leaving the issue of digital privacy largely up to companies to decide, she says. Period-tracking apps, for example, which millions of people use to help track their menstrual cycles, could sell information to third parties. “You can ask websites and apps to stop collecting your information, and you can even ask them to stop selling it,” Tsukayama says, but without a federal data privacy law in place, “You can’t really force them.”  Here’s a look at recent bills that have been introduced at the federal and state levels aimed at protecting digital privacy. My Body, My Data Act The My Body, My Data Act, introduced in the House on June 16 and later in the Senate, would task the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with enforcing a national privacy standard for reproductive health data collected by apps, cell phones and search engines. It would require that companies collect and store only the health information that is strictly needed to provide their services. It would also give users the right to access or delete their personal data. Rep. Jacobs, who introduced the bill, says digital privacy concerns are especially acute in states like Texas and Oklahoma where citizens can access up to $10,000 rewards for reporting those who violate the states’ abortion laws. “It would make it so that a small right-wing nonprofit group in Texas couldn’t just buy up or get access to this data and create a mass surveillance system,” says Jacobs, “to be able to turn people in who are seeking abortion as is incentivized in the Texas bounty law.” Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden and Mazie Hirono, longtime proponents of digital privacy reform, introduced the bill in the upper chamber. The bills have been endorsed by Planned Parenthood, NARAL, National Abortion Federation, URGE, National Partnership for Women & Families, Feminist Majority and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Jacobs says there’s a “very good chance” that the Democrat-led House votes on the bill soon. “I think that people really recognize the urgency of this moment,” she says. But the chances it passes the sharply divided Senate are steeper, privacy experts tell TIME. Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act Another bill, called the Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation (SAD) Act, was introduced on June 23 by a group of Democrats led by Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York and Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, as well as Sens. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.  It aims to crack down on misleading advertising by anti-abortion pregnancy centers, known as crisis pregnancy centers, which often style themselves as reproductive health clinics without making it clear they are faith-based organizations whose mission it is to dissuade pregnant women from having abortions.  Read More: Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers Are Collecting Troves of Data That Could Be Weaponized Against Women A recent TIME investigation found that these pregnancy centers also collect vast troves of personal data on the women who come to them for help. These women often do not understand that they are providing detailed health information—including addresses, marital status, demographic information, sexual and reproductive histories, test results, ultrasound photos, and information shared during consultations—to organizations run by the anti-abortion movement. Because most pregnancy centers, which outnumber abortion clinics three to one across the country, are not licensed medical clinics and offer services for free, privacy lawyers tell TIME that they are not legally bound by federal health data privacy laws. “By promoting deceptive or misleading advertisements about abortion services, crisis pregnancy centers jeopardize women’s health and well-being,” Sen. Menendez said in a statement. The SAD Act directs the FTC to prohibit deceptive practices by these centers, and authorizes the agency to enforce these rules and collect penalties.  Some abortion providers already began taking steps to safeguard patient information prior to the Supreme Court ruling. Many are now using paper records, making phone calls instead of texting or e-mailing, and using encrypted messaging apps.  Health and Location Data Protection Act Yet another bill, the Health and Location Data Protection Act, introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, on June 15, would ban data brokers from selling or transferring a person’s medical and sensitive personal information, with a few limited exceptions. It would also give the FTC $1 billion over 10 years to enforce these rules. “Data brokers profit from the location data of millions of people, posing serious risks to Americans everywhere by selling their most private information,” Warren said in a statement the day the legislation was introduced. Recent reporting from Vice found that for $160, one could buy a week’s worth of data on where people who visited more than 600 Planned Parenthood clinics came from and where they went afterward. Although that data was not tied to people’s names, privacy advocates argue that such details are discoverable if an individual’s travel patterns are unique. Acquiring and selling user data, experts say, is a billion dollar industry that continues growing.  “Data collection and processing is really at the heart of a lot of business models now,” EFF’s Tsukayama says. “It’s very difficult to convince people to change that unless there are some penalties or some other mechanisms to push that change.” Read More: America’s High-Tech Surveillance Could Track Abortion-Seekers, Too, Activists Warn State Legislation In some states, local lawmakers have taken matters into their own hands. Pennsylvania state Rep. Mary Jo Daley, a Democrat, introduced legislation on May 4 that would bar pregnancy centers in the state from sharing client data without permission. She noted a recent decision by the state’s Office of Open Records that said that pregnancy centers in the state were risking client’s privacy rights by sending their data—including names and the services they received, as well as their pregnancy status, sexual history and STD information—to Real Alternatives, the state-funded network of anti-abortion pregnancy centers. “My bill would regulate what [data] they collect and the authorizations that they would be required to have, providing information to the woman so they would know exactly what they are signing on to,” she told TIME. “On its own this is a dangerous invasion of privacy but considering recent movement to deputize private citizens into vigilantes to regulate reproductive health, the threat is becoming even more imminent.” Right now, though, states can only do so much, says Alan Butler, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Because the U.S. lacks a comprehensive set of federal digital privacy laws, women in states banning abortion are especially vulnerable.  “The states that are more likely to restrict abortion rights,” he says, “are also the states that don’t have strong privacy laws.”  Write to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com and Vera Bergengruen at vera.bergengruen@time.com",https://time.com/6193224/abortion-privacy-data-reform/
NA,19 minute read;More From TIME;Marta Sowinska;Justyna Szymura;Izabela Sajbor;Dorota Lalik;Joanna;Maria,,"October 13, 2023 1:04 PM EDT","This project was supported by the Pulitzer Center Krzysztof Sowinski has cried every day since his wife Marta, who was five months pregnant, died of sepsis in 2022; he believes doctors put Marta’s life in danger by not giving them the option to terminate the pregnancy while the fetus’ heart was still beating. Janusz Kucharski also lost his partner Justyna to sepsis in the fifth month of a pregnancy. She left behind two boys. It is likely, reproductive-rights advocates say, that these women would be alive if not for Poland's increasingly restrictive abortion laws. Abortion has been illegal in the country since 1993, but a 2020 ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal, which went into effect the next year, removed one of the exceptions to the law—fetal abnormalities—and imposed a near-total ban on abortion. Now women can terminate a pregnancy only if the women’s life or health is at risk (including mental health risks with a psychiatric diagnosis) or if there is reasonable suspicion that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Yet as examples from across the country indicate, what the law allows is not actually what is happening in practice. The consequences of the reproductive-­rights rollback have been dire. Women who have abortions are not prosecuted under the law, but doctors and others who help women terminate pregnancies, up to the point of viability, may face up to three years in prison. If an abortion takes place beyond the point of viability, then the person who aided in the abortion may face up to eight years in prison. This creates what many consider a “chilling effect,” as doctors scared of running afoul of the law hesitate to take lifesaving steps for pregnant patients. “Patients are powerless and doctors are increasingly fearful,” says Professor Marzena Debska, a gynecologist at Debski Clinic in Warsaw. The concerns are similar to those raised in the U.S., where the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade allowed states to enact severe restrictions on abortion. Women in Texas, Tennessee, Idaho, and Oklahoma have sued their states, claiming a lack of clarity in the laws is preventing doctors from performing abortions on women with serious pregnancy complications. Over the last 30 years, 60 countries have liberalized abortion law, with only four rolling back its legality: the U.S., Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Poland.  Officially in 2020, there were seven maternal deaths in Poland. In 2021, there were nine. Such low figures have persisted for more than a decade, but experts say the data is unreliable. “Every year we estimate that there are almost three times as many deaths as appear in the statistics. If a patient dies in the intensive care unit, for example, and not in the gynecology and obstetrics department, nothing in the certificate will link her death to the pregnancy,” says Dr. Katarzyna Szamotulska, head of the epidemiology and biostatistics department at the Mother and Child Institute in Warsaw. (Poland’s Ministry of Health declined to answer multiple requests for comment about the reliability of the statistics.) With doctors reluctant to intervene, infant mortality rates have also risen, says Dr. Gizela Jagielska, the deputy director of the public hospital in Olesnica and a gynecologist who performs many of the few legal abortions that still take place in Poland.  Jagielska says the anti-abortion movement calls her a “baby killer” but she is undeterred. “I act according to the law, using the premise of saving a woman's life. I will continue to work no matter what, because who else will help these women?” she says. “I get threats, I am called the butcher of Olesnica. I'm not afraid. I only feel sorry for the couples who come to me for consultation. These are the most traumatic moments in their lives, and they have to hear that they are murderers.” Because Poland’s ruling right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) supports the restrictions, many are looking to the Oct. 15 parliamentary elections to produce change. Others are looking to the courts. Attorney Jolanta ­Budzowska is representing families in criminal-negligence cases against doctors in relation to pregnant women who died and suffered harm in hospitals. She has also filed a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights against the Polish government on behalf of some of the families. “I think there are more such cases. And even more where women are survivors, but they have gone through a trauma and want to forget about it,” Budzowska says.   In 2019, even before the latest restrictions, the U.N. Committee Against Torture concluded that denying access to legal abortion in certain circumstances involves such intense physical and mental suffering as to constitute torture, and called on Poland to act. “A year ago, I helped another pregnant woman who was told by doctors to wait four days until the fetus died,” Budzowska says. “She got sepsis. She paid for it with depression.” In an opinion for the Office for Patients' Rights, Professor Krzysztof Preis of the Medical University of Gdansk wrote that “the action prolonging the patient's mental suffering was inhumane and cruel treatment, completely unjustified medically."" To grasp the human consequences of Poland’s abortion restrictions, TIME interviewed the families of pregnant women who arrived at hospital with second-trimester pregnancy complications and later died, as well as one woman who terminated her pregnancy and another who delivered a boy with severe health complications (the child died days later). Below are their stories.  For more than five years, Marta, 36, and Krzysztof Sowinski, 40, tried everything to have a baby, including in vitro fertilization. Marta miscarried twice, in 2019 and 2020. On Dec. 31, 2021, she discovered she was pregnant again. “I loved our baby from the first line on the pregnancy test,” Krzysztof told TIME in July 2023, as he began to cry. On April 15, 2022, at 20 weeks, Marta started having contractions so Krzysztof drove her to the hospital in the southern Polish city of Katowice. The next morning Marta did not feel well, but the fetus's heart was still beating so she hoped for the best, Krzysztof says. “Later she called me, shivering with cold: ‘Something is wrong with me. Maybe it's some inflammation.’” She developed a 100°F fever, leukocytosis, and a fast pulse. The doctor gave her hydroxyzine, an antihistamine with a sedative effect; paracetamol, a medication used to reduce fever; and an antibiotic, according to medical records obtained by Krzysztof and reviewed by TIME. At 1 a.m., Marta started bleeding from her birth canal. The fetus’s heart had stopped beating but the doctors moved her into the delivery room anyway. “I joined her at 3:40 a.m. and held her hand the whole time,” Krzysztof says, visibly shaking. Medical records note that Marta was “rude, abusive, and undermines the midwives’ decisions.”  Marta’s bloodwork from the hospital's laboratory time-stamped 3:51 a.m. showed a procalcitonin (PCT) test reading of 14.4—when a reading above 2 indicates a very high risk of sepsis. (The hospital told TIME in a statement that doctors only became aware of the PCT reading hours later; the hospital did not respond to inquiries as to why this delay occurred.) She delivered a stillborn boy at 5:19 a.m. “I said goodbye to the boy two hours later. We already knew that we would give him a funeral. I cried for hours in the waiting room, so Marta couldn’t hear me,” Krzysztof says. The hospital wrote to TIME in a statement that ""the patient wanted wholeheartedly to save the pregnancy and even after finding out that the fetus had no heartbeat she did not consent to the proposed medical action (inducing a miscarriage).” Krzysztof tells it differently: “She wanted a baby but didn't want to die for it. At first she did not consent, but after 40 minutes, she said OK. If they had explained to us 12 hours earlier that Marta’s life was in danger, and the pregnancy had to be terminated to save her, neither of us would have given it a second thought. Abortion was not a taboo subject for us. We trusted them. Who am I to check the doctor's every step?”   Marta’s condition continued to deteriorate into the morning. By mid-afternoon, doctors raised the prospect of removing her uterus.  But it was too late. “Marta fell into a coma after the procedure and doctors told me to go home, saying she could remain in this state for many days. A few hours later, I received a call that Marta had died,” Krzysztof says. (Medical records do not mention a coma.) “She was my only friend,” he adds. “The day she died, she said I could do whatever I want with our three embryos, frozen in a fertility clinic. Sometimes I think about surrogacy outside of Poland, but then I realize the whole point of having children is to raise them together. But maybe it is a way to make a part of her alive again?”  Before Justyna Szymura's death in December 2020 at age 34, Janusz Kucharski, 42, never cried. Now he tells their 4-year-old son, Dawid, that a man also has the right to grieve. He says he will not forgive the doctor who patted him on the back and told him that “nothing could be done” just after Justyna died.  While Justyna lay dying, the largest protests in the nation since the fall of the communist rule in 1989 filled the Polish streets. Following the Constitutional Court ruling in October 2020 to further restrict abortion access, more than 1,000 demonstrations were organized, with over 1 million people participating.  Justyna was 18 weeks pregnant when she started bleeding from her birth canal and went to the hospital in Wodzislaw Slaski on Dec. 9. Bloodwork results at 9:08 p.m. showed a high C-reactive protein (CRP) test, which indicated inflammation in her body, according to an opinion issued by Professor Miroslaw Wielgos, an expert witness for Poland’s Office for Patients' Rights, on Justyna’s care. Wieglos' opinion states that  she was given an antibiotic and apparently left alone for 12 hours.  Professor Wielgos wrote in his opinion that the antibiotic could not have worked because “two weeks earlier, a culture from the genital tract showed the presence of a bacteria resistant to its action.” He also criticized the hospital’s decision to leave Justyna alone for 12 hours: ""The consequence [of high leukocytosis and CRP] should be the monitoring of the effectiveness of the treatment by repeating the tests after a maximum of 4-6 hours.”  The next morning, Justyna texted Janusz: “I fainted in the bathroom. I'm vomiting since 5 a.m. and I have diarrhea.” Doctors began inducing a miscarriage at 9:20 a.m on Dec. 10. ""Perhaps it would have been undertaken several hours earlier, if the inflammatory parameters had been properly monitored,"" wrote Professor Wielgos. Laboratory test results soon showed a further increase in CRP, and there was a sharp increase in PCT as well as more vomiting, the appearance of chills and a fever, wrote Professor Wielgos in his opinion. He wrote that doctors needed to "" immediately intensify action and proceed with instrumental emptying of the uterine cavity,"" but instead they proceeded with the induction of the miscarriage. By 11:30 a.m., no fetal heart function was detected. Justyna gave birth to a stillborn boy at 1:30 p.m. She named him Antoni. Due to persistent hemorrhage, a decision was made to surgically remove the uterus to which Justyna gave her consent. After being transferred to ICU, she died of sepsis the next day, at 1:30 p.m. on Dec. 11. In the death certificate, the hospital wrote that the cause of death was ""multiple organ failure."" In an email statement on Sept. 22 to TIME, they said that the “patient was given due care by the medical staff adequate to her condition.” The hospital said in a subsequent statement that “the immediate cause of death was hemorrhagic shock with blood clotting abnormalities and associated multi-organ lesions. The hemorrhage, on the other hand, was caused by uterine cancer. Thus, the cause of death was not related to pregnancy, much less to childbirth, but to cancer.” According to Budzowska, who is representing Janusz and Dawid, an exam confirmed a placental site tumor, but Budzowska says, “Our main allegation is that the inflammation was poorly treated, and the patient was not supervised, which led to the development of sepsis and septic shock. If Szymura had survived and the placental site tumor had been detected, she would have undergone chemotherapy and had about an 85% chance of survival.” According to Poland’s Central Statistical Office, not a single woman in the Silesian province, where Wodzislaw Slaski is located, died that year due to obstetric complications.  Izabela Sajbor, 30, was 22 weeks pregnant when her water broke in the early morning of Sept. 21, 2021, and she went to the Joannitas hospital in Pszczyna, in southern Poland.  By the evening of Sept. 21, Izabela was shaking from a fever. Bloodwork earlier in the day had indicated elevated CRP levels, according to medical records reviewed by TIME. “Thanks to super PiS they’ll wait until it’s dead. If not, great, I can expect sepsis!” Izabela messaged her mother Barbara Zientek, who lived in Cwiklice, a 15-minute drive from Pszczyna, but was unable to visit her daughter in hospital because of pandemic-related restrictions. Prenatal testing earlier in Izabela’s pregnancy indicated that the fetus might have Edwards syndrome—a congenital syndrome due to an extra copy of the 18th chromosome that is usually fatal; about 90% of babies with this condition do not survive the first year—though Skrobol says Izabela had shared this information only with her husband. Izabela never had amniocentesis to confirm a diagnosis.  ""They can't do anything, because someone could think they did it on purpose,” she texted her mother. “My life is at risk. And I have to wait. Kisses mommy,” she also wrote. (TIME has reviewed the messages.)   Doctors had administered fentanyl and Diazepam, according to TIME’s review of the medical records. That evening, “Izabela was crying for help,” Skrobol says. “She was heard by other patients. ‘I have someone to live for!’ she yelled, thinking about her 8-year-old daughter, Maja."" Izabela died at 7:35 a.m the next morning, less than 24 hours after she was admitted.  According to Budzowska, three doctors have been charged with endangering life and health, and one of them has been charged with causing death. All three doctors pleaded not guilty. The hospital in Pszczyna has not replied to multiple requests for comment. Dorota Lalik, 33, was 20 weeks pregnant when her water broke on May 20, 2023. She and her husband, Marcin Lalik, 27, were visiting family in Nowy Targ at the time, so he took her to the hospital named after Pope John Paul II in the southern Polish town. Doctors performed an ultrasound that showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.  Dorota had a headache on May 22, and bloodwork indicated her CRP was rising, according to Budzowska’s review of the medical documentation. (Budzowska, who is representing Dorota’s family, declined to share the documentation with TIME citing an ongoing investigation.) On the 23rd, she began vomiting, and her headache worsened. “No one informed us that the chances of saving our baby were close to zero, and sepsis was almost inevitable,” Marcin says. “Usually women want to fight for their child. The most important thing is to honestly explain to them what their situation is. And observe them carefully, because the threat of sepsis can be, though not always, caught at an early stage,” said Dr. Krzysztof Preis, a gynecology consultant for the Ministry of Health for the Pomeranian region. Professor Preis said he would decide whether to terminate a pregnancy as soon as the first signs of an infection appeared, but for years, doctors in the region “hid behind the ‘conscience clause,” and declined to perform an abortion if it conflicted with their beliefs. “But for me,” he said, “to put a woman's life at risk contradicts the Bible."" Dorota had been jotting down a few words daily with a pencil in her prayer book, but by that night, she no longer had the strength to write. She spoke to her husband for the last time at 9 p.m. and told him she loved him. As a devout Catholic Dorota opposed abortion, but Marcin says it is hard to say what she would have chosen if given the option to terminate the pregnancy. “But for sure it is better to save one life than to lose two,” he tells TIME.  On May 24, doctors ordered a second ultrasound and found the fetus’ heart had stopped beating. Three hours later, and after discussion with a regional consultant, doctors decided to remove the fetus as well as Dorota’s uterus. Dorota died at 9:34 a.m. from sepsis despite 90 minutes of attempted resuscitation.  In June a patients’ rights ombudsman Bartlomiej Chmielowiec stated that ""the investigation revealed a number of irregularities that occurred during the patient's stay in the hospital. No additional measures were taken in view of the rising CRP; adequate antibiotic therapy was not implemented in time and the patient was not offered induction of miscarriage on May 22 (the day after admission to the hospital) in view of the rising CRP. The supervision of the pregnant woman was not carried out in accordance with due diligence and in accordance with current medical knowledge."" In August, Marek Wierzba, the head of the hospital, sent a letter expressing condolences and “deep regret for the death of Mrs. Lalik and her unborn child"" to Marcin Lalik. ""The management of the hospital in Nowy Targ apologizes for the violation of the rights of Mrs. Dorota Lalik to health services corresponding to the requirements of current medical knowledge, immediate provision of health services in case of danger to health and life, health services related to childbirth, health services provided with due diligence and to information about her health condition,"" Director Wierzba wrote. ""The death of a pregnant patient is a huge tragedy not only for the relatives of the deceased or the public, but also for the management and staff of the Hospital,"" the hospital said in a statement to TIME. ""The patient was kept informed of her and the baby's condition. Both the patient and the family received support from a psychologist. “To the best of our knowledge, neither in 2005 nor thereafter has there been any official declaration from the hospital that pregnancy terminations will not be performed at our facility. We have not reached any document or record that confirms this. The same goes for invoking the conscience clause. We are committed to ensuring that a similar situation does not occur again."" The hospital then outlined steps it had taken to ensure ""a similar situation does not occur again,"" including someone to restructure the gynecology-obstetrics department and conducting training sessions. ""Out of respect for the family and relatives of the deceased, as well as the applicable laws (confidentiality of medical records), the Hospital Director maintains his position and will not comment on the entire case until it is clarified by the relevant authorities."" Joanna and Marek, 26 and 32, learned in May 2023, about four months into Joanna’s pregnancy, that the fetus had a diaphragmatic hernia, a birth defect in which there is an opening in the diaphragm that allows abdominal organs to move into the chest. (TIME is using pseudonyms for Joanna and Marek because of privacy concerns.) They consulted a doctor who told them the child had about a 50-50 chance of surviving birth. “The doctor was not sure if he would have legs and could be missing other organs,” Marek told TIME from Olesnica hospital in August. The doctor told them he could operate to move the organs to the right place and sew up the diaphragm once the child was born but it would be expensive. Given the political landscape, the couple was afraid to ask about terminating the pregnancy. “I am chronically ill and I thought it was all my fault. I was told by a doctor to stop crying and deal with it,” Joanna says. “I was afraid that something would happen to me or the baby. At 21 weeks, I ordered pills online to induce an abortion at home, but the package came empty. I was going out of my mind and I ended up in the ER with a panic attack.” It is then that Joanna and Marek decided to take action. The Foundation for Women and Family Planning (FEDERA), a Polish nonprofit that fights for reproductive rights, referred them to Dr. Jagielska. On Aug. 1, when Joanna was 27 weeks pregnant, they traveled 250 miles from their home in northern Poland to the hospital in Olesnica. A few hours after arriving, Dr. Jagielska administered a fetal intracardiac potassium chloride injection to the fetus’s heart to terminate the pregnancy. They decided not to see the baby afterward.  “The fetus had almost no lung tissue. It would have died immediately or a few hours after birth,” Jagielska recalls.  While Joanna and Marek were waiting for the abortion, in another room at Jagielska’s hospital in Olesnica, Maria, 25, a Ukrainian refugee who came to Poland following Russia’s full-scale invasion of her country, gave birth to a boy on Aug. 1, 2023. (TIME is using a pseudonym for privacy concerns.)  Test results earlier in Maria’s pregnancy indicated the baby had hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluid in the brain, which Dr. Jagielska says is likely because Maria had toxoplasmosis, a common infection caused by a parasite. But according to Jagielska, medical records from a previous physician did not mention any treatment. “How can you not notice that there is water instead of a brain?” asks Jagielska. “Unfortunately such things are on the rise. A few days ago I had a patient with a fetus missing half of the heart. These doctors just don't want to take responsibility for what happens next.” Dr. Jagielska, along with 11 other doctors, paramedics, and nurses tried to save Maria's son who, after several hours, was taken to a specialized hospital in Wroclaw, in southwestern Poland. Maria was in shock and, due to the language barrier, barely understood what was happening. A month later, by the decision of a neonatology consultant in the Lower Silesia region, the baby’s life support was switched off. “I don't know how I'd feel if I knew about the malformations from the beginning,” Maria told TIME in Olesnica hospital the day she gave birth on Aug. 1, “but I would like to have been given a choice.”—With reporting by Kasia Strek Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/6320172/poland-abortion-laws-maternal-health-care/
The Suffragettes Would Not Agree With Feminists Today on Abortion,Ideas;Marjorie Dannenfelser,Ideas,"November 4, 2015 9:26 AM EST","For many people, the word “suffragette” conjures up images of the frothy Mrs. Banks in the movie Mary Poppins, who returns home from a London rally for women’s rights to tell her sister suffragettes’ (her nanny and housemaids) to “take heart for Mrs. Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again!” The suffragette movement is the subject of the new movie Suffragette. Starring Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter and Meryl Streep, it tells the story of the struggle for women’s rights in Great Britain from the viewpoint of a young, working-class mother. Thousands of women like her fought courageously for the right to vote so they could use that power to improve the economic and social conditions that oppressed them and their families. In America, too, brave and farsighted suffragettes worked to obtain the right to vote, and thus the right to true citizenship, for women. Their victory paved the way for the full participation by women in the economic, social and political spheres. Our nation has been incomparably enriched by their contributions and accomplishments. But would those early pioneers recognize the movement that claims to speak for the rights of women today? On the issue of abortion, they would not. Many of today’s feminists see abortion as one of the touchstones of their movement. Yet many of the early leaders of the women’s suffrage movement in the U.S. believed that the rights of mother and child are inextricably linked and that the right to life and the right to vote are rooted in the inherent dignity of each human person. The public statements of many early champions of women’s rights in the U.S. make clear their opposition. Elizabeth Cady Stanton referred to abortion as “infanticide” and wrote that “when we consider that women are treated as property, it is degrading to women that we should treat our children as property to be disposed of as we see fit.” Victoria Woodhull, the first female candidate for president, wrote: “Every woman knows that if she were free, she would never bear an unwished-for child, nor think of murdering one before its birth.” And Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to receive a medical degree in the U.S., wrote: “The gross perversion and destruction of motherhood by the abortionist filled me with indignation, and awakened active antagonism.” Mrs. Pankhurst’s American counterpart, Susan B. Anthony, was a friend and heroine to many of these women. Along with Cady Stanton, she founded The Revolution newspaper, which served as a mouthpiece for the American women’s suffrage movement. Anthony funded the paper herself, refusing the capital that would have resulted from allowing advertisements for “restellism,” as abortion was then called. The Revolution published a piece, attributable to Anthony, that said abortion was a choice that would burden both a woman’s “conscience in life and soul in death” and also ultimately an exploitation of women. Anthony has been my organization’s namesake since 1992, when we began the Susan B. Anthony List to amplify the voices of pro-life women in federal and statewide office. She understood that the rights of one group could not be built upon the broken rights of another. That’s why, for example, she worked so closely with her friend Frederick Douglass to advance not only women’s suffrage, but voting rights for African Americans as well. “Men, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less,” she said. Today, our mission is equally simple. Women who join us reject the idea that feminism requires them to be at war with their own children, or to direct their tax dollars to organizations that perform abortions. In so doing, they honor the legacy of the original champions of women’s rights.

Fetal Personhood Laws Are a New Frontier in the Battle Over Reproductive Rights,Madeleine Carlisle;The implications of fetal personhood on pregnancy;Did fetal personhood laws exist before Roe fell?,Politics;abortion,"June 28, 2022 4:40 PM EDT","In the early 1970s, when lawyers representing the state of Texas argued Roe v. Wade before the U.S. Supreme Court, they argued that a fetus is a person. Because a fetus is a person, they told the Justices, a fetus is entitled to all the protections guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment including a right to “life.” In 1973, the high court ruled that Texas was wrong. “The word ‘person,’ as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn,” wrote Justice Harry Blackmun in his landmark opinion. The Supreme Court held that personhood could not be granted to a fetus before “viability”—the point around 24 weeks of pregnancy when a fetus can survive outside the womb—and established a constitutional right to abortion access. But nearly 50 years later, Roe was overturned, and Justice Samuel Alito declared in the Supreme Court’s majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization on Friday that Roe was “egregiously wrong from the start.” Now, laws that establish fetal personhood—meaning they extend the legal rights of people to a fetus or embryo before viability—could be the next frontier in the legal battle over reproductive rights in the United States.  Not all abortion bans establish fetal personhood. But all pre-viability fetal personhood laws ban abortion—and could have even broader implications for reproductive healthcare access and the potential criminalization of pregnancy. “Abortion laws regulate a procedure,” says Rebecca Kluchin, a professor at California State University, Sacramento, who recently wrote a piece for the Washington Post criticizing such policies. “Fetal personhood laws allow the state to regulate pregnant women.” While 13 states had already enacted “trigger laws” designed to ban all or nearly all abortions once Roe was overturned, at least six states have also introduced legislation to ban abortion by establishing fetal personhood, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Litigation over such laws has already begun. Last year, Arizona’s Republican Governor Doug Ducey enacted an abortion ban that gave “an unborn child at every stage of development all rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents.” Cathi Herrod, the president of the conservative Christian advocacy group Center for Arizona Policy (CAP), says CAP supported Arizona’s law because they “stand for the belief that human life begins at the moment of conception, that life is a human right, and unborn children deserve protection.”  The ACLU of Arizona and the Center for Reproductive Rights sued, and on Saturday filed an emergency motion asking a judge to block the implementation of the law in the wake of the fall of Roe, arguing the law’s “vagueness” violates the right to due process and could put abortion providers and pregnant people at risk of criminal prosecution. The judge has yet to rule on the motion and a hearing will be held in July. (Brittni Thomason, spokesperson for the Arizona attorney general’s office, says they “anticipate filing a legal brief” on the matter “next week.”) Read More: The Fight Over Abortion Has Only Just Begun The Supreme Court declined to weigh in on fetal personhood in Dobbs: “Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth,” Alito wrote. It remains to be seen how fetal personhood will hold up in court in Arizona and elsewhere. “I think the challenge for many of us is that we will be living in a legal gray area for a long time,” says Dana Sussman, the deputy executive directive at the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, which provides legal defense for pregnant people, including women who have had abortions. “Case law will have to be developed, or statutes will have to be clarified, because the scope of [Roe’s fall] is just so monumental, I don’t know that anyone truly has an answer to how this will all play out.”  Critics of fetal personhood laws argue the state cannot bestow legal rights onto a fetus or embryo without subjugating the rights of the pregnant person.  In theory, fetal personhood laws could impact the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF), a procedure that uses a combination of medicines and surgical procedures to help sperm fertilize an egg and then implant the embryo into the uterus. A round of IVF can create multiple embryos, which can be frozen indefinitely. Fetal personhood laws could also impact contraception access, given that some members of the anti-abortion movement argue that IUDs and the emergency contraception Plan B can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg and violate personhood, explains Mary Ziegler, an abortion law historian at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say that those forms of contraception work by preventing fertilization in the first place.) Fetal personhood laws could also have major implications for pregnant people. If a fetus is legally considered a person, then child endangerment laws can apply. A state could potentially say pregnant people can only eat certain foods, or punish a pregnant person who is seen drinking, or compel someone to have a cesarean section they are refusing, says Kluchin. If a pregnant woman must undergo chemotherapy for cancer treatment, adds Ziegler, she could in theory be told to delay care until she gives birth so she does not harm the fetus, as the New Yorker reports has “routinely” occurred with pregnant women in Poland. (Many U.S. abortion laws have narrow exceptions for when the mother’s life is in danger.)  Establishing fetal personhood could put people who self-induce abortions at risk for criminal prosecution, says Jolynn Dellinger, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke Law School. It could also impact people who miscarry. Leslie J. Reagan, a professor of history at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, says prior to Roe, if someone went to the hospital or called a doctor about a miscarriage, they were often questioned on whether they had induced an abortion. Reagan’s research found that beginning in the early 1900s and running up until Roe in the 1970s, doctors and nurses sometimes functioned as the arm of the police, even threatening to deny care to patients if they did not provide information. “They were all suspects,” says Reagan. “[Doctors] couldn’t tell if it was a natural miscarriage or whether they had induced it, and they came to assume that anyone who came in bleeding, miscarrying, had induced it—and began to ask questions.”  Roe explicitly banned laws from establishing fetal personhood before the “viability” line. But the logic of fetal personhood has been used for decades in policies and enforcement against women, particularly low-income women of color, in the later stages of pregnancy. A peer-reviewed study by the National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW) found 413 cases from 1973 to 2005 of women who were arrested or otherwise deprived of their physical liberty because they were accused of hurting their fetus, often because they were found to have tested positive for drugs. And the numbers are picking up: a similar study by NAPW examining data from 2006 to 2020 found roughly 1,331 examples of such cases. (The majority of cases in the NAPW study resulted in healthy birth outcomes.) Some states have laws specifically extending a viable fetus separate legal protections from those of the pregnant person, while in others prosecutors have extended child endangerment or homicide laws to instances where a fetus was harmed.  With the fall of Roe, anti-abortion activists are calling for broader laws that extend similar legal protections to embryos and fetuses. Some were previously ruled unconstitutional, like Georgia’s HB 481, which includes language that states “natural persons include an unborn child,” allows people to claim a fetus as a dependent on tax forms, and requires state officials to count a fetus toward Georgia’s population for official population count purposes. The law was struck down in 2020, but after the Supreme Court overturned Roe on Friday, Georgia’s attorney general filed a notice requesting the decision be reversed. Read More: The Failure of the Feminist Industrial Complex A federal fetal personhood law was also introduced last year in both chambers of Congress. The Life at Conception Act, which would extend fetuses and embryos a constitutional “right to life” beginning at the moment of fertilization, has 164 cosponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives. Still, many of these new laws will likely face legal challenges. While there is no longer a constitutional right to an abortion, fetal personhood laws could still be challenged for violating state constitutions, or for violating the constitutional right to due process because of vague wording, like the ACLU’s lawsuit in Arizona claims. “There are a lot of unanswered questions that we’ll have to see laid out,” says Ziegler. “[Fetal personhood laws] are much more likely to be enforceable than would have been the case before, but we still can’t be sure until the litigation is done.” —With reporting by Abigail Abrams/New York Write to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com",https://time.com/6191886/fetal-personhood-laws-roe-abortion/
Doctors Are Still Confused by Abortion Exceptions in Louisiana. It’s Limiting Essential Care,Anisha Kohli;Debates in Louisiana;Physicians’ confusion,U.S.;abortion,"May 24, 2023 3:11 PM EDT","The Louisiana state legislature shot down two bills last week that aimed to clarify the legality of abortion and miscarriage care in pregnancies with complications. The existing laws in Louisiana allow for abortions in certain cases when a pregnant patient’s life or health may be at risk, but physicians have criticized the texts for being confusing and limiting their ability to provide essential medical care. Just like health care providers in other states, they’ve grappled with the issue since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year—in Louisiana’s case, Governor John Bel Edwards signed laws banning elective abortions and criminalizing providing them soon after the decision. Currently, there are 14 states where most abortions are banned. “It’s impossible to spell [out] every single presentation that a patient [with a nonviable pregnancy] might have in law,” Dr. Jennifer Avegno, New Orleans Health Department director and an emergency physician, tells TIME. “I use my good faith medical judgment and as long as that’s in accordance with the medical standard of care, then you really shouldn’t question that right.” Avegno testified in front of the Louisiana House in support of one of the bills, saying she spoke on behalf of countless colleagues throughout the southeast who’ve had to navigate a perplexing and constantly shifting legal landscape. Here’s what to know: Louisiana’s near-total abortion ban allows for few exceptions in circumstances where a pregnant patient’s life or essential organ is at risk, or when the fetus is deemed medically futile and unable to survive outside the womb. But the law doesn’t use very much medical terminology, physicians say. “The initial law tried to clarify, ‘Let’s name all the conditions we can possibly name and those will be okay.’” The list compiles just over two dozen conditions, but, says Avegno, “as any practicing physician will tell you, there are always going to be new ones or ones you haven’t thought of.” Republican Rep. Mary DuBuisson proposed House Bill 461 in March, which would ammend the law to allow for abortion procedures to be legal for any treat patients who have been diagnosed “in good faith medical judgment” as having pregnancies that have ended, are in the process of ending, or that entail complications that render them nonviable. In other words, it removes the requirement of the diagnosis of a few specific conditions. At the bill’s hearing, DuBuisson emphasized that she does not support abortion broadly, but under the current state law “we are not protecting mothers,” she said. “We are leaving them to hemorrhage and carry a dead child until they can die ‘naturally.’” A second bill, HB 598, introduced by Rep. Candace Newell, would expand treatment for ectopic pregnancies, clarify that molar pregnancies could be treated, and permit abortions for cancer patients. Other Republican lawmakers at the hearing responded that the law appeared clear to them and that they hadn’t received complaints from doctors in their constituencies. Benjamin Clapper, executive director of Louisiana Right to Life, a major anti-abortion group in the state, also testified calling the bills “pro-abortion,” claiming that they would make it easier to perform elective abortions. The legislature’s criminal justice committee oversaw the hearings and ultimately rejected both bills. And two weeks ago, the Louisiana legislature shot down other proposals to allow for abortion exceptions in cases of rape and incest. In Louisiana, abortion providers who violate the abortion-ban law face up to 15 years in prison and $5,000-$200,000 fines. Physicians have reported feeling fearful of providing pregnancy care that they would have in the past. “It’s so critical that physicians feel that they have the ability to make the judgment that is best for their patients without fear of misinterpretation and real consequences,” Avegno says. In October, Stephen Russo, lead attorney for the Louisiana Department of Health, told doctors that with the new statute, abortion is “more of a criminal nature and really it isn’t something that the [health] department has the authority to police,” the Louisiana Illuminator reported at the time. Russo said his agency wasn’t responsible for addressing physician confusion and that the state attorney general’s office would be better suited. But, notes Avegno, that’s not practical. “No one’s going to call the lawmakers and say, ‘Oh, this was kind of a scary one. I didn’t know what to do,” Avegno says. “These are the same lawmakers that want to throw physicians in jail.” Dr. Michele Heisler, medical director for the nonprofit, Physicians for Human Rights, and a professor at the University of Michigan points out the insurance dilemma. With only a handful of conditions listed, insurance and Medicaid may not cover treatment for pregnancy complications outside of the list. Patients could be asked to pay thousands of dollars up front before receiving any treatment. “It can prevent many low-income women from having the option of not carrying a pregnancy to term,” Heisner says. “Knowing that their baby’s going to die is just incredible psychological trauma.” Avegno says confusion trickles down to patients. With misoprostol, for example—a medication that can be for abortions, but also to manage miscarriages or induce labor—“there have been women trying to get them filled at the pharmacy and being told incorrectly, ‘Oh, no, that’s illegal,’” she says. Misoprostol is legal, but Avegno adds that such misinformation spreads quickly. Physicians in Texas, Tennessee, Ohio, Utah, and Oklahoma have faced similar confusion to those in Louisiana. In April, Heisler co-authored a report in which researchers posed as prospective patients seeking emergency pregnancy care and contacted 34 Oklahoma hospitals. The study concluded that none of the hospitals could articulate clear and consistent policies and 22 hospitals were unable to provide information about abortion procedures when a pregnant patient’s life is threatened. Heisler says ambiguity in these laws has left hospitals and other institutions to interpret things differently. “The care you’ll get as a patient, and the options that you may not even know about really vary widely,” she says. If a pregnant patient isn’t going to die, but would have to spend the rest of their life on dialysis, face liver failure, or permanent infertility, those are not currently cases that justify termination in some states, Heisler says. “Every medical situation is different. There’s no way to practice good medicine under a list.” Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/6282288/louisiana-abortion-exceptions-confusion-doctors/
"After Abortion Ban, Arizona Just Became the Most Important State in 2024 Politics",Nik Popli,Politics;abortion,"April 10, 2024 4:36 PM EDT","There’s no state that political pundits will be watching more closely this fall than Arizona. Voters in one of the nation’s biggest electoral battlegrounds are set to determine the outcome of a tossup Senate race, a pair of close congressional seats, and the winner of its 11 Electoral College votes—and now a recent court ruling has ensured abortion will be an animating issue at the ballot box. After the state Supreme Court decided on Tuesday to bring back a 160-year-old near total ban on the procedure, Arizona has effectively been thrust into the center of the national abortion debate that is expected to dominate the upcoming presidential election and once again test Republicans’ messaging strategy after Roe v. Wade was overturned. “I don't think it can be overstated the impact this week's ruling will have on the November election,” says Barrett Marson, an Arizona-based Republican strategist who predicts the key battleground state now leans blue. “Everything that you thought was conventional wisdom about Arizona was thrown out the window overnight.” Democrats have already seized on the ruling to transform the 2024 race into another referendum on abortion rights, blaming former President Donald Trump for overturning the constitutional right to abortion and encouraging disaffected Democrats in the state to turn out in November. “This ruling is a result of the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women’s freedom,” President Joe Biden said in a statement after the ruling. He has promised to codify the right to an abortion if re-elected with Democratic control of Congress. Read More: What to Know About the Arizona Supreme Court Abortion Ban Ruling Stacy Pearson, a Democratic strategist based in Arizona, says that Democrats have an opportunity to capitalize on the court ruling and convince undecided voters in the state, particularly women, that their candidates will support women’s reproductive rights. “The Supreme Court woke up folks that hadn't been paying attention and that is not going to end well for Republicans,” Pearson says. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to travel to the state on Friday to emphasize the Biden Administration’s support for abortion rights. “It will be the overarching issue of 2024,” Marson says, adding that Arizona Republicans in districts considered safe should now be worried that the abortion issue has made their districts competitive as the fight to regain reproductive rights has in recent years become one of the most potent issues in motivating Democrats to vote. Abortion defining 2024 political races isn’t what most Republicans would prefer. Kari Lake, the expected GOP candidate in Arizona’s Senate race, attempted Tuesday to soften her stance on abortion when she came out against the Arizona Supreme Court ruling despite praising the same ban during her unsuccessful bid for governor in 2022.  “Smart Republican campaigns will take the abortion issue off the table, and focus on hammering Democrats on the economy and border,” says a GOP consultant and Trump ally who requested anonymity to candidly discuss the candidates’ messaging strategies. Asked if Trump should stop taking credit for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, the consultant replied: “We need to move on and focus on popular issues in the abortion debate—protecting [in vitro fertilization] IVF and child tax credits.” But pivoting away from abortion in Arizona—and elsewhere—may be nearly impossible. Polling data shows that most Americans disapproved of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, and about 1 in 8 voters say that abortion is the most important issue driving their vote this fall, according to a recent KFF survey. Republicans have struggled to find a winning message on abortion that resonates with voters, and candidates have paid the price in almost every election where abortion was on the ballot. Marson says the abortion issue will likely be an “albatross around Trump’s neck” in the coming months as he attempts to woo moderate voters without isolating the conservative religious voters in the Republican Party. Trump on Monday declined to endorse a federal abortion ban, instead calling on states to set their own policies. But two days later, he said that Arizona went too far: “I think it’ll be straightened out and, as you know, it's all about state’s rights and it will be straightened out,” Trump said Wednesday at a campaign event in Atlanta. “I’m sure the governor and everybody else have got to bring it back into reason, and that it will be taken care of I think.” Liberal organizers in the state are also trying to put abortion directly on the ballot. A measure that would enshrine abortion in the Arizona constitution has already gathered enough signatures to be placed on the ballot, the organizers say, giving Democrats another opportunity to protect abortion in the state. Several other states, including Florida and Maryland, will also have abortion petitions on the ballot in November. Arizona is a critical state in the expected presidential contest between Biden and Trump. Biden helped secure his victory in 2020 by flipping Arizona, which had voted for Trump in 2016. And the Senate battle shaping up between Lake, an ardent Trump ally, and Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, could be decisive to the balance of power in Congress.  After Wednesday’s ruling, abortion is likely to influence each of those high-stakes contests. “It’s the white hot issue on November's ballot,” Pearson says.

Was Iceland Really the First Nation to Legalize Abortion?,Lily Rothman;Kingdom of Iceland: Vintage Photos From a Long-Ago Island,History;health,"January 28, 2015 7:00 AM EST","Ask the Internet which country was the first to legalize abortion and you’re likely to find some confusing answers, many of which point in one direction: Iceland. It’s true that, 80 years ago, on Jan. 28 of 1935, Iceland’s “Law No. 38” declared that the mother’s health and “domestic conditions” may be taken into consideration when considering whether to permit doctors to perform an abortion. And, according to the 1977 book Abortion by Malcolm Potts, Peter Diggory and John Peel, that law stuck for decades.  However, there are a lot of caveats to that “first” label. For one thing, abortion spent centuries as neither illegal nor legal, before becoming formally legislated, which happened in the 19th century in many places. Iceland, then, was the first Western nation to create what we might now recognize as a common modern abortion legalization policy, with a set of conditions making the procedure not impossible but not entirely unregulated.  Some other nations that passed abortion laws before Iceland’s (like Mexico, for example) also included conditions, like rape, under which it would be permitted. And, as Robertson’s Book of Firsts clarifies, the Soviet Union had actually legalized abortion, on demand, more than a decade earlier. The difference was that (a) the Soviet law didn’t last, as that nation underwent a series of regime changes, and (b) the conditions for legality were different. Though abortion was later strictly limited in Russia, legalization was apparently no small thing when it was first introduced.  As TIME reported on Feb. 17, 1936: A not entirely enthusiastic participant last week was Dictator Joseph Stalin at the celebration by massed Communist delegations from all over Russia of the tenth anniversary of the founding in Moscow of the Union of the Militant Godless. This unprecedented Jubilee of Godlessness could only be compared to that celebrated by Bolsheviks in honor of the tenth anniversary of the Legalization in Russia of Abortion.

Veterans Affairs’ New Policy to Provide Abortions Sets Off Battle With Conservative States,Abigail Abrams;Legal and logistical challenges,Politics;abortion,"September 15, 2022 11:21 PM EDT","A new Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rule is setting up a major clash between conservative states and the federal government, as Republican lawmakers vow to fight the policy that the VA will provide abortion services even in states that have outlawed the procedure. Under the new rule, which took effect on Sept. 9, the VA will provide abortion counseling and abortions in cases of rape, incest, or when a pregnancy threatens the patient’s life to veterans and their eligible family members. This represents a historic change: the VA previously did not provide abortions for veterans under any circumstances and did not allow its providers to counsel patients about the procedure.  The move is a direct result of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade this summer, which set off a wave of abortion bans and restrictions around the country. VA leaders said those restrictions created “urgent risks” for veterans and forced the agency to act. “This expansion is a patient safety decision first and foremost,” Dr. Shereef Elnahal, VA under secretary for health, told members of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee on Thursday. “It is important to emphasize that VA is taking these steps with our primary mission in mind: to preserve the lives and health of veterans.” The policy was cheered by Democrats, who have been pressing President Joe Biden to find ways to expand abortion access since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization eliminated the federal right to abortion. They said they hoped VA’s move would have broad appeal, given that the rule only allows for abortions in circumstances that track with other federal policies. Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called the change a “common sense policy” at a news conference on the topic last week, while Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who lost her legs serving in Iraq, questioned why the government would be comfortable letting her use her body for war but not for her choice of how and when to start a family. “When is it that American women have the right to bodily autonomy?” she asked.  Republicans disagree. Many states that have enacted near-total abortion bans do not have exceptions for rape and incest, so conservatives argue the VA is overreaching its authority. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said last week he would enforce his state’s abortion ban, which outlaws all abortions except in cases that threaten the life of the pregnant person, against any practitioner who violates it. “I have no intention of abdicating my duty to enforce the Unborn Life Protection Act against any practitioner who unlawfully conducts abortions in the State of Alabama,” he said in a statement. “The power of states to protect unborn life is settled.” Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, whose state abortion ban also only allows for abortions in life-threatening cases, similarly told TIME she would enforce her ban despite the VA policy. “I stand ready to challenge the Biden Administration for trying to circumvent Arkansas law,” Rutledge said in a statement.  The Hyde Amendment prohibits federal funding for most abortion-related services, but it allows for similar exceptions to the VA’s rule—and it only applies to funds appropriated for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, not the VA. Republicans argue the VA’s policy violates other laws, including the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, which excluded abortions from the medical care the VA was allowed to provide. Democrats counter that the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 allows the VA secretary to “furnish hospital care and medical services” determined to be “needed,” including abortion. VA officials and legal experts say the agency is is on solid legal footing as it institutes the new policy, particularly due to the legal principle of federal preemption. “The federal government gets to make law and states can’t say, ‘we don’t want to follow that,’” says David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University. “So a state that tried to sue to say the VA can’t do this would be contravening that fundamental principle of American law.” The outcome of the legal debate could affect thousands of women seeking care. About 260,000 women veterans of reproductive age live in states with severe abortion restrictions, according to Kayla Williams, a RAND Corporation researcher and former director of the VA’s Center for Women Veterans, who testified at the hearing. She estimated that about 96,200 VA patients could be affected by the policy change. Elnahal said he initially expects about 1,000 VA-supported abortions to be performed a year, but that could grow in future years as the number of women veterans is increasing rapidly. Republicans said during Thursday’s committee hearing that they would support legal challenges to the policy and threatened to go after the VA’s budget if they retake control of Congress in November. “This is not only wrong, it’s illegal,” said ranking committee member Rep. Mike Bost, a Republican from Illinois. He said he was working with colleagues on the House appropriations committee and in the Senate on potential sanctions. “Abortion is not health care, no matter what those on the other side of this issue may feel.” Regardless of whether the VA policy is challenged in court, it will be complex to implement, and it’s unlikely that its providers will be ready right away to provide a range of abortion services.  One of the biggest challenges is the fact that the VA is essentially building infrastructure for the plan in real time. The VA has not said when its facilities will start providing abortions. Elnahal told lawmakers the agency is working to ensure that facilities have proper staffing and training to carry out the policy, making pregnancy testing available at all locations, and conducting a survey of the availability of ultrasound machines. “We believe medication abortion will be the first available and most common type of abortion provided, so we are working to ensure providers have access to training as well as the needed medications,” he said. If the VA is not immediately able to provide needed care, Elnahal said veterans and beneficiaries can use community providers or travel to other community or VA facilities, and the VA will cover the cost of that transportation where applicable. But the legal landscape is complicated. For those providers working at VA facilities on federal property, Elnahal said “they will be protected under federal supremacy and the full force of the federal government will be there for them should they be challenged on that.” But the same legal protections would “not necessarily be available” for providers working in non-VA facilities in states that have banned abortion, he said. This could make it difficult to find community providers willing to help in states that have outlawed abortion, especially as many abortion clinics in those states have closed or stopped offering the procedure. “As the abortion infrastructure and the infrastructure for care across the country continues to shut down as a result of state level bans, VA is going to have a really hard time implementing this policy,” Lindsay Church, executive director of Minority Veterans of America who testified at the hearing on Thursday, told TIME. The Constitution does provide some protections for people traveling to federal land to conduct federal business, Cohen and other legal experts say. The 14th Amendment’s privileges or immunities clause could be used to protect patients or providers if states try to go after people for providing abortions at VA facilities. But Rachel Rebouché, dean of Temple University’s Beasley School of Law and an expert on reproductive health law, says the clause has been interpreted narrowly in the past and it’s unclear how far the protections would go.  Even if states don’t take that legal route, Rebouché says they have the power to make doctors’ lives difficult if they participate. “States could target you in other ways. They could say that it’s unethical, or they could attack your license. State medical boards have really broad authority to define what is ethical practice,” she says.  “It really is going to shine a spotlight on tensions between federal and state regulations,” Rebouché adds. “It really is going to test our fundamental assumptions about federalism, about how states should treat each other, about the role of federal law in the abortion arena.” Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6214024/veterans-affairs-abortion-fight/
The Surprising Role of Clergy in the Abortion Fight Before Roe v. Wade,Gillian Frank,History;faith,"May 2, 2017 12:30 PM EDT","“Today I want to speak to The Challenge of the Sexual Revolution, or to The Use of the Body in Regard to Abortion,” declared the Reverend Charles Landreth on, June 6, 1971. From the pulpit of First Presbyterian Church in Tallahassee, Fla., Landreth invited those present to imagine different situations that led to a “problem pregnancy.” Landreth prodded his congregants, asking them to consider what an unwanted pregnancy and lack of access to abortion could mean to an older married woman, a young woman who had been raped or a high-school girl “scared literally to death to tell her staunch Catholic parents and therefore very tempted to run to a quack.” That Sunday, at Tallahassee’s oldest church, Landreth argued that Jesus’ declaration that the first stone should be cast by those “among you without sin” was a “radical challenge to the Scribes and the Pharisees and to their conception of morality and authority.” Invoking these scriptural passages, Landreth protested against the immorality of Florida’s laws, which prohibited abortion unless the pregnancy endangered a woman’s life. Toward the end of his sermon, Reverend Landreth revealed to his congregation what they may have already learned from Florida newspapers in the preceding weeks: he and his colleague Leo Sandon had been helping women in Tallahassee obtain abortions. Landreth and Sandon’s abortion referral activities at Florida State University had drawn the attention and anger of a state senator and a district attorney who in turn denounced them in the press. After twice appearing before a grand jury, the clergymen worried that they would be charged and prosecuted. But Landreth and Sandon were not alone. Their experiences reveal how, in the half-decade before Roe v. Wade, respected religious leaders participated in a nationwide struggle to make abortion more accessible. This largely forgotten history undercuts the popular myth that religious people oppose abortion rights. Fifty years ago this month, in May of 1967, as mainline Protestants and Reform Jews called for the liberalization of abortion laws, a group of clergy in New York City founded the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion (CCS), an international network of clergy that helped women obtain legal and illegal abortions from licensed medical professionals. When Landreth spoke out, it was as part of CCS, which by then counted over 2,000 other ministers across the United States and Canada as members. “Whenever we try to make conditions for each other more human, we are engaged in a religious pursuit,” Landreth once explained. “Christians and the Christian church simply cannot turn their backs on the problem of abortion and the dilemmas which it creates.” As trusted members of their communities to whom congregants turned for counseling, clergy witnessed a medical crisis unfolding because of restrictive abortion laws. In the 1950s and 1960s, prohibitions against abortion drove anywhere between 200,000 and 1.2 million women to obtain illegal abortions. By the end of 1972, the CCS had helped between a quarter and half a million women obtain safe legal and illegal abortions from physicians. CCS members also demanded that their state legislators repeal abortion laws, and publicly testified for that cause. In 1968, Reverend Carl Bielby spoke with Michigan lawmakers who were conducting public hearings on that state’s abortion laws. Bielby was a leader of Michigan’s CCS. At the hearing he represented the Michigan Council of Churches’ position that, “as a matter of human right, each woman be given the control of her own body and procreative function, and that she has the moral responsibility and obligation for the just and sober stewardship thereof.” Likewise, Reverend Allen Hinand of the Philadelphia CCS proclaimed at a 1972 legislative hearing that it was time for women to “rise up and take control of a situation and a choice that belongs to them as females.” Most importantly, CCS clergy emphasized that no single religion had a right to impose its religious values upon others. For these clergy, freedom of religion had to include freedom from those religious groups that sought to place restrictions on abortions. Many branches of the Clergy Consultation Service operated openly and advertised their abortion referral services, citing “higher laws and moral obligations transcending legal codes.” They publicly challenged restrictive abortion laws as infringements upon religious freedoms, and sought media coverage to widely broadcast their message. Some district attorneys and state politicians investigated and attempted to disrupt the CCS’ referral networks in Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. Undercover female investigators would pose as pregnant women to survey and analyze CCS activities. Clergy members and CCS-approved abortion providers feared arrest and prosecution. Indeed, Florida’s state-led anti-abortion efforts prompted Reverend Landreth’s sermon in the summer of 1971. Fearing prosecution, he decided to challenge two Florida statutes, which prohibited advising, aiding or assisting women “to procure miscarriage” and likewise banned the circulation or distribution of material that gave “any  advice, direction, information or knowledge may be obtained for the purpose of causing or procuring the miscarriage of any woman pregnant with child.” With the official backing of both the Synod of Florida’s Presbyterian Church and his own First Presbyterian Church, Landreth filed a lawsuit and asked for an injunction prohibiting the district attorney from prosecuting the CCS. In September of 1971, a three-judge panel rejected the clergymen’s case as “too speculative.” The court did not rule on the validity of Florida’s abortion statutes. However, other courts were willing to evaluate the constitutionality of these statutes as numerous groups challenged abortion laws. Three months later, an Alachua County judge declared these same statutes unconstitutional when he voided charges against a University of Florida student who had circulated a list of abortion referral agencies on campus. The following year, Florida’s Supreme Court invalidated the state’s abortion law as unconstitutionally “vague, indefinite and uncertain.” The history of Reverend Landreth and Reverend Sandon’s brief and unsuccessful legal battle is remarkable, not because of what it accomplished, but because it occurred at all. Across the country, most police, politicians and prosecutors turned a blind eye to the CCS or quietly endorsed its activities. The moral authority of CCS clergy offered them protection when they broke the law. The Reverend Charles Straut led the New Jersey branch of the CCS and managed, among other things, to have his group’s phone number listed on the first page of every New Jersey phone directory from 1968 onward. In an interview, he reflected on how his status as a clergyman enabled him to avoid punishment: “It’s hard to remember and hard to imagine if you are not old enough to remember how clergy were treated in those days.” Fifty years ago, the CCS offered public moral and practical support to women who wanted abortions and to the doctors who performed them. After Roe, many branches of the CCS disbanded while others merged with local Planned Parenthoods or formed new reproductive health organizations. The CCS, in other words, shaped many of the institutions that continue to help women control their reproductive lives. Recovering the history of the CCS reminds us that contemporary demands for reproductive rights and abortion access, far from being secular or immoral, had and continue to have deep moral and religious roots.

We Don’t Have to Imagine the Consequences of Abortion Bans. We Just Have to Look to the Past,Leslie J. Reagan,History;Opinion,"May 16, 2019 12:34 PM EDT","On Wednesday, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed the nation’s most extreme abortion bill. If it goes into effect, it would ban abortion almost entirely in the state — in every stage of ­pregnancy — and make it a felony for providers to perform the procedure. It would also send Alabama back to the 19th century. The state first made abortion a crime a bit more than 150 years ago, and others passed similar measures through the middle of that century. Prior to that wave of legislation, common law had allowed abortion until quickening, when the woman first perceived fetal movement — usually around the middle of a pregnancy. Only at the point of quickening was life recognized as having begun. A small group of elite physicians working to professionalize medicine initiated a campaign to criminalize the practice of “bringing on the menses.” They aimed to eliminate their competition by casting midwives and “irregular” doctors as criminals. To gain legislative support, these doctors raised questions about exactly who was having babies, who was aborting and who should populate the nation. They knew well-to-do white women were having fewer children, and that the families of immigrants, Catholics and, after the Civil War, freedpeople, were larger. To put it plainly: Lawmakers hoped to force middle-class white women to have more babies by removing the option of abortion, thus preventing the country from being “taken over” by “foreigners” and people of color. The resulting laws punished everyone involved in abortion: providers and assistants; partners who helped pay; even advertisers. All faced jail and fines. And though some anti-abortion commentators claim women were not punished when abortion was illegal, many statutes explicitly included them, too. Today, Alabama’s new legislation follows other restrictive measures around the U.S. — like the Georgia “heartbeat” law, which bans abortion before many women even know they’re pregnant. Because Roe v. Wade guarantees the right to an abortion before viability, the point at which a fetus can potentially survive outside the womb, these laws are sure to be challenged as unconstitutional and therefore likely to be put on hold. But if Roe is overturned, as many suspect it will be, history tells us a lot about what we can expect. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter Once that wave of 19th century abortion bans went into effect, police and prosecutors threatened, arrested, interrogated, investigated and occasionally prosecuted women for the crime of abortion. Police and doctors routinely questioned women who miscarried to determine if they’d had an abortion. If the patient refused to answer, the doctor might refuse lifesaving treatment for the complications that can follow abortions when the procedure is poorly performed. In at least one case, police surrounded several women as they left their provider, arrested them and took them to a doctor who performed gynecological exams on them, overseen by police, for evidence. Some women in such situations were told that if they did not testify, they could be subject to prosecution. As far as is known, those patients — though publicly humiliated and subjected to unwanted and invasive procedures — were not charged, but others throughout history have been. Making abortion illegal never meant abortion didn’t happen. For the entire century of criminalized abortion, women of every class, marital status, religion and race still obtained them. Before Roe, hospitals had entire wards for patients experiencing sepsis after shoddy or self-­induced abortions. Chicago’s Cook County Hospital had 5,000 patients annually in the abortion ward — women who were bleeding, infected and sometimes dying. That fact is part of the reason why, though doctors led the charge to make abortion illegal, a century later the majority of doctors reversed their position. Today, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes the new restrictive laws. Dozens of medical historians have also released a statement outlining the historical consequences of the Ohio “heartbeat” bill and opposing similar legislation. If those laws are upheld, we can expect many of the old methods of enforcement to be re-enacted. Unlike the Americans of the 19th century, we already know what that looks like. But we have another thing they didn’t, too: a large, organized movement fighting to keep that from happening. Historians’ perspectives on how the past informs the present Leslie J.

It’s Been 50 Years Since Colorado Passed This Groundbreaking Abortion Law,TIME Staff,U.S.,"April 25, 2017 8:44 AM EDT","(DENVER) — Tuesday marks 50 years since a groundbreaking Colorado law significantly loosened tight restrictions on legal abortions. Before the law, Colorado — like many states — allowed abortions only if a woman’s life was at stake. In 1967, a Democratic freshman state lawmaker introduced a bill that allowed abortions if the woman’s physical or mental health was threatened, if the unborn child might have birth defects or in cases of rape or incest. Rep. Richard Lamm said he feared he might be committing political suicide by introducing the bill to the overwhelmingly male, Republican-dominated Legislature. But within weeks, Republican Gov. John Love signed the bill into law, making Colorado the first state to loosen restrictions on abortion — six years before the U.S. Supreme Court would legalize it nationally. “I was pushing on a half-open door. It gave way so much more easily than I ever dreamed it would,” recalled Lamm, now 81, in an interview with The Associated Press. But all abortions still had to be approved by three-doctor panels at participating hospitals and were only permitted during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy. Instead of ending his newfound political career, Lamm went on to serve three terms as the state’s governor. He is currently the co-director of the University of Denver’s Institute of Public Policy Studies. Lamm said recently that when he introduced the legislation, the women’s movement was just starting to take off and the concept that citizens should have more personal freedom was becoming more important in society. At the time, abortion was not one of the Colorado Republican Party’s most pressing issues and there was no organized opposition in the state to abortion rights because the idea was so new, Lamm said. Key to Lamm’s effort was ally Ruth Steel, an activist who had lobbied lawmakers in 1965 to allow public health officials to discuss and to provide birth control with residents. She worked closely with John Bermingham, a Republican state senator who is now 93 and retired, to shepherd the contraception bill though the Legislature. While on lobbying trips to the Capitol, Steel dressed formally, wearing a hat and gloves, but had no qualms talking to lawmakers frankly about issues related to sex, Lamm said. A woman in charge of proofreading bills in the basement of the Capitol was essential to advancing the bill through the Legislature, Bermingham said in an interview. Bermingham learned that she supported the bill, and he asked her to wait until a Senate leader who opposed it would be away so the bill could be introduced without being assigned to a committee seen as sure to kill it. While the bill was under debate, a woman denied an abortion at Denver’s public hospital shot herself in the abdomen and survived. The fetus did not survive. The doctor who treated the woman testified on the bill, Bermingham said. After the Legislature approved the measure, opponents picketed outside the governor’s mansion. Love, a Republican who died in 2002, said at the time that he struggled with what to do with the bill. He said he was conflicted over whether abortion would be used as an alternative to birth control. In the era of divisive and turbulent social and political change, he said his mail was about evenly divided between supporters and opponents. Love ultimately decided to sign the bill to keep government out of what he viewed as a personal decision, said his son, Dan Love. The elder Love was re-elected in 1970. Eleven other states followed suit. And four more lifted all abortion restrictions — New York, Washington, Hawaii and Alaska — before 1970. The 1973 Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion nationwide. In Colorado, opponents had feared the state would become “an abortion mecca” for women seeking to end their pregnancies. That did not happen, partly because women who wanted abortions had to appear before a hospital panel and could not simply show up and get them. There were only 10 abortions reported to the state health department in 1966. Between the law’s signing in April and the end of 1967, 120 abortions were reported. The patients ranged from a 12-year-old girl who had been raped to a 48-year-old woman. About a quarter were from outside Colorado. Most were performed based on psychiatric grounds or therapeutic reasons with no additional specifics provided.

NA,,,"March 1, 2024 12:32 PM EST","On a recent trip to Louisiana, I sat across the breakfast table from Dr. Nicole Freehill, an OB-GYN who has been practicing for more than a decade, as she explained how caring for her patients has changed since the state banned abortion in June 2022. She described the helplessness of telling a teenage survivor of sexual assault, pregnant and desperate not to be, that there was nothing she could do for her. “There are patients where you just know from the way they’re looking at you that traveling to another state is not an option,” Freehill said. “It’s untenable.” Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, 14 states including Louisiana have banned abortion completely. What’s happening in Louisiana is a microcosm of what’s happening across America: the anguish of having a fundamental right stripped away and the resilience of people working tirelessly to help in the midst of a dire situation. Now, with the future of reproductive health care, including fertility treatment, hanging in the balance, the Supreme Court is preparing to decide the fate of one of the last remaining lifelines for people in states like Louisiana: abortion pills. Even before Roe was overturned, pills were the most common form of abortion in the United States. A safe, effective, and FDA-approved method for ending pregnancy and treating miscarriages, abortion pills work best when taken within about the first 13 weeks. Pills can be prescribed remotely by licensed providers in the U.S. and sent through the mail without an in-person visit, which is crucial in rural areas and states that have banned or severely restricted abortion. Aid Access, an organization dedicated to providing abortion pills by mail, reports that they receive more requests from people in Louisiana than in any other state. All of this is at stake right now, as the Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments in a case that could impose extreme and medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion pills. The case, brought not by medical experts but by anti-abortion activists, gives the Court a chance to override the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, one of two drugs used in medication abortion. All of this despite the fact that mifepristone has been used safely and effectively by more than 5 million people over the last two decades and rigorously tested in more than 100 scientific studies. It’s safer than Tylenol, Penicillin, or Viagra. No matter where you live, this case should be on your radar. Restricting access to abortion pills would have sweeping implications for 65 million women of reproductive age living in the U.S.—not only in states with abortion bans, but in places like New York and California. This has nothing to do with science and everything to do with banning the most common method of abortion in the country. (In fact, in February 2024, an academic journal retracted two studies cited in a lower court ruling to restrict medication abortion, citing factual errors and “a lack of scientific rigor.”) If the Supreme Court decides once again to advance a political agenda at the expense of people’s lives and access to essential health care, we don’t have to imagine what the consequences will be—we’re already living with them. Researchers estimate that, since Roe was overturned, there have been more than 64,500 pregnancies as a result of rape in states with abortion bans. (Louisiana, like many other states with total bans, provides no exceptions for rape and incest.) While some abortion bans include exceptions when the life of the pregnant person is at stake or the pregnancy is incompatible with life, experiences like Kate Cox’s in Texas and Nancy Davis’ in Louisiana illustrate the horrifying truth: In the moments when these exceptions are most urgently needed, they do not work. In the last year and a half, Americans have been confronted again and again with the devastating impact of abortion bans. Brittany Watts in Ohio was brought up on charges and hauled before a grand jury for having a miscarriage. “Ashley,” a seventh-grader in Mississippi, became pregnant after being sexually assaulted by a stranger in her yard; unable to afford the nine-hour round trip to the closest abortion provider, she’s now a mom. In Texas, Yeniifer Alvarez-Glick died as a result of the state’s abortion law. Equally chilling are the stories we’ll never hear: In the first six months of 2023, there were an estimated 1,800 additional births in Louisiana, suggesting that many people who cannot access abortion in their community are left with no choice but to simply remain pregnant. Read More: She Wasn’t Able to Get an Abortion. Now She’s a Mom. Soon She’ll Start 7th Grade.  But abortion bans are just the beginning of efforts to restrict Americans’ reproductive decisions, not the end. After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos had the legal status of children, several fertility clinics in the state paused treatment, devastating patients whose journeys to parenthood were abruptly put on hold. Anti-abortion groups have advocated for so-called “personhood” language—like the provision in Louisiana state law declaring that “every unborn child is a human being from the moment of conception and is, therefore, a legal person”— as a path to criminalize not only abortion, but everything from birth control to IVF. Adding insult to injury is the fact that, in a country that is already home to the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, pregnancy care is suffering as a result of abortion restrictions. According to one study, women in states that banned abortion post-Roe were up to three times as likely to die during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period. Another study found that 93% of OB-GYNs in states that have banned or severely restricted abortion have been unable to follow standards of care because of abortion laws. Kaitlyn Joshua, a mom and community organizer from Baton Rouge, has described being turned away from not one but two emergency rooms while having a miscarriage. Terrified and bleeding through her jeans, Joshua was told by doctors that while a surgical procedure or pills could help with her pain and speed up the process, they could not treat her as a result of Louisiana’s abortion ban. “I was in total disbelief that I could live in a country that would put me in this predicament,” she said. For Joshua, that was just the beginning. She shared her experience with a reporter and at a public forum held by the hospital. Messages poured in on social media from Louisianans denied care or told their only option would be to travel hundreds of miles to access abortion. When we met up at a coffee shop during a break in her Saturday errands, she bounced her four-month-old baby on her lap and told me she is determined to keep speaking out: about the devastating impact of abortion bans, about the barriers to care faced by Black women in the South, and about why anyone who can get pregnant should read up on abortion pills. “You never know when you might need them,” she said. Spend any amount of time in Louisiana, or any state that has banned abortion, and the growing divide between the ideology of those in power and the will of the people they represent becomes painfully clear. A majority of Americans, including a majority of Louisianans, believe abortion should be legal. Two-thirds of Americans want abortion pills to remain accessible, including more than half of Republicans. A poll a year after Roe was overturned found that one in four Americans said state efforts to ban or severely restrict abortion have made them more supportive of abortion rights, not less. Every time voters have had the chance to decide on this issue, abortion rights have won. Read More: Doctors Are Still Confused by Abortion Exceptions in Louisiana. It’s Limiting Essential Care When the Supreme Court overturned Roe, it was like a match on dry kindling. There were hundreds of protests in the weeks that followed; some called it “the summer of rage.” More than one pundit wondered whether women in America could possibly sustain that level of fury for the long-term. A year and a half later, it’s clear: We can and we will. After all, it’s outrageous that nine unelected Supreme Court justices, not one of whom has spent a single day in medical school, are once again in a position to determine the rights and futures of millions of people. It’s infuriating that so many of the Republican politicians pushing for a national abortion ban—including likely presidential nominee Donald Trump—are permitted to spout myths and misinformation without ever having to answer for the cruelty inflicted on people all over this country. And it’s unconscionable that anyone who does not want to be pregnant or have a child—for any reason—would not have the freedom to make that decision on their own terms. On a sunny Friday in January, Petrice Sams-Abiodun, Vice President of Strategic Partnerships for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, walked me through the beautiful New Orleans health center, newly opened in 2016. The waiting room was bright and airy, with private spaces for patients who need a few minutes to themselves and shelves of children’s books for anyone who shows up with a toddler in tow. She showed me the rows of exam rooms, the state-of-the-art lab for test results, the paintings by local artists on the walls—and the extra-wide hallways, surgical sinks, and restrooms built to exact specifications to comply with the state’s targeted restrictions on abortion providers. The state refused to grant Planned Parenthood’s license to provide abortions, and then Roe fell, and the point became temporarily moot. Sams-Abiodun pointed out the recovery room where patients could rest after an abortion, comfortable recliners still in boxes, dust gathering on the state-mandated nurse’s station. “This room makes me the proudest and the angriest,” she said. The truth is, it’s not enough to stay angry. We need to channel our rage into action. And in Louisiana and across the country, Sams-Abiodun and so many others are doing exactly that. Abortion funds are gathering resources to help people travel out of state. Activist networks are helping connect people to care, including abortion pills by mail. Health care providers are sounding the alarm about the crisis unfolding before our eyes. Legal groups are litigating on behalf of abortion seekers. Organizers are working tirelessly to spread word about what’s happening, from state legislatures to the highest court in the land. People who have never considered themselves “political” are signing up to volunteer for candidates and campaigns. Local and national journalists are doing extraordinary, powerful reporting. Everywhere I go, people are sharing their own stories, and doing brave, important work in incredibly tough circumstances. Because when the alternative is giving up on entire swaths of the country, there’s really no alternative. “It’s like walking through the mud,” one clinic staff member told me. “It isn’t easy, but you just have to keep going.” Cecile Richards is the co-founder of Charley, a chatbot that provides information about abortion options in every zip code in the U.S., and a co-chair of American Bridge 21st Century.

"Despite the Ohio Vote, History Reveals the Problem With a State-by-State Strategy on Abortion",Felicia Kornbluh / Made by History,;History;Made by History,"November 8, 2023 3:20 PM EST","On Tuesday, Ohio voters added language to their state constitution that protects the right to “make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” The amendment allows an abortion ban after “fetal viability,” but with an exception for cases in which an abortion is “necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”  The overwhelming vote, of 56.62% in favor and 43.38% against, demonstrates majority support for abortion rights and exemplifies the fact that this extends even to states dominated by Republicans. The Ohio GOP has won eight of the last nine gubernatorial elections, and the party has had unified control of state government since 2011. They used this power to stack the deck against the referendum; in August, they forced a vote on whether to raise the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment from a simple majority to 60%. Even after voters soundly rejected that measure, Republicans continued to spread misinformation about the abortion initiative and even paraphrased the language of the amendment in potentially misleading terms on the ballots voters received.  Read More: In Victory for Abortion-Rights Advocates, Ohio Rejects Effort to Make it Harder to Change State Constitution With this vote, Ohio becomes the fourth state since 2022 to pass a constitutional measure to safeguard abortion rights, and the seventh to use the referendum process to protect those rights in some way. The results are the latest evidence that bypassing state legislatures that are tilted against abortion rights with direct-to-the-people referendums is a winning strategy for preserving or enhancing reproductive freedom. But they also indicate that these state-by-state battles are wearying, expensive, and perhaps unsustainable. The history of these fights dating back to the 1960s highlights this duality: state-by-state campaigns can be inspiring and successful, but they’re also an endless game of whack-a-mole for advocates of reproductive rights—one that might not be winnable in the end.   In the late 1960s and into 1970, reproductive rights activists made substantial progress at the state level. They took advantage of shifting public opinion that went from majority opposition to legal abortion access to majority support.  State legislatures were slow to change policy in line with this shift. So feminists and their allies used every strategy and resource available to them, from mass organizing and demonstrations, to legislative lobbying and pressuring elected officials in their home districts, to encouraging medical, public health, and legal leaders to change the policies of their professional bodies to reflect the safety of legal abortion and the risks to pregnant women when the procedure was criminalized. They won reforms that expanded access to abortion in 13 states and made it mostly accessible in an additional four states.   New York State was the location of the biggest and most high-profile win. In July 1970, the state began to implement a transformative abortion law, which granted New Yorkers and anyone who could get to New York access to safe, legal, and somewhat affordable abortion care through the 24th week of a pregnancy. The win reflected the rising power of a coalition that joined activists for women’s rights with “Reform” Democrats like the Black Assemblyman Percy Sutton from Harlem, and Austrian Jewish refugee Assemblyman Franz Leichter, who worked together to pull the Democratic Party to the pro-civil rights left. But things grew far more challenging for the movement after the victory in New York. Although public opinion kept moving in the direction of more liberal abortion laws, conservative lobbyists for the Catholic Church and other abortion opponents counter-mobilized aggressively and it became difficult to keep up. The momentum toward changing state policies halted, and the democratic process that had seemed to be working so well essentially stopped working. In addition to the New York victory, 1970 also saw Alaska and Hawaii loosen their abortion laws through legislative action, and activists in Washington state won a major reform via a hard-fought popular referendum campaign. But no other states moved forward over the next three years.  Even in New York, progress in making the state political system respond to what the people wanted was shaky at best. This was in part a product of the exhaustion of feminist and “Reform” forces, who had given their all to the effort to change the law. Meanwhile, conservative lobbyists, representing the Catholic hierarchy and to a lesser degree evangelical Protestants and Orthodox Jews, had deep pockets to fund their work and the imagery of tradition and “family values” on their side.  The upstate New York Democratic legislator whose vote had been decisive in the pro-abortion rights vote of 1970 lost his seat and his political career soon thereafter. This served as a warning to other politicians about what might happen if they crossed anti-abortion forces. In 1971, New York legislators backed by conservatives on the outside introduced 30 different bills in the state legislature to restrict abortion access. Feminists and liberals who favored easing abortion access had to beat back each of these—even as they were trying, unsuccessfully, to improve on the 1970 law.  Read more: Ohio Votes to Protect Abortion Access in Major Statewide Victory for Reproductive Rights In the crucible of these fights, conservative Republicans learned how to use their clout to grind the machinery of government to a halt. Five intransigent senators, who refused to approve the state budget, got the liberal administration of Governor Nelson Rockefeller to strip abortion procedures from the health insurance coverage low-income people received through Medicaid. This cut was reversed by the courts in the short run, but eventually became the model for the national Hyde Amendment, which for almost five decades has forbidden the spending of any federal Medicaid dollars on abortion procedures.  In 1972, anti-abortion advocates in New York almost won—despite public opinion being staunchly against them. Only a veto by Gov. Rockefeller saved the 1970 abortion reform law from a full repeal.  These events forced advocates to conclude that the state-by-state approach was not sustainable. They had to pivot to an effort to change national law—once considered a pie-in-the-sky position within the feminist movement. Working with activists in the Women’s National Abortion Action Coalition, Representative Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) introduced national legislation to protect abortion rights.  At the same time, feminist litigators were at work in the lower federal courts, eventually believing that they might be able to win in the U.S. Supreme Court. Quietly, some of the justices on the Court seem to have come to the same conclusion: Justice Harry Blackmun kept in his files both a New York Times article that reported on the latest polls revealing majority support for abortion rights, including among lay Catholics, and an article from the journal Science News arguing that the roiling, back-and-forth battles over abortion in New York State proved “that a definitive ruling from the Supreme Court is necessary.”  In 1973, this change in strategy led to Blackmun’s opinion in Roe v. Wade, which determined that the Constitution protected a right to an abortion through the second trimester.  The Court’s decision to overturn Roe in 2022 reignited a state-by-state strategy to protect abortion rights. Such campaigns remain exhausting and expensive, even as they’ve proved successful. Ohioans for Reproductive Rights, the umbrella organization pushing for the amendment, reported spending $26 million since Labor Day alone, not including what they spent to fight the August initiative. This represents an expenditure of resources and person-power that might be unsustainable. As in the past, the resources it requires to make policy match public opinion—and to keep fighting essentially the same battles repeatedly—illustrates the benefit in seeking a national solution.   That’s especially true because only 26 states allow popular referendums like Tuesday’s vote. And several of the states that don’t—including Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama—have the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Gerrymandering and geographic polarization guarantee that Republican legislators in these states care primarily about what the small sliver of older, whiter, more religious, more extreme voters who show up for primaries think and make victory highly unlikely for pro-reproductive rights forces.  This reality will thwart the will of the majority that wants to be protect reproductive rights unless Congress enacts national protections. House Democrats passed a bill to do just that in 2021 and 2022, but it failed to win the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster in the Senate. It’s easy to say that state-level debates are a key part of democracy. But when the system is structured in such a way that legislatures can ignore the will of the people, and non-stop campaigns require tens of millions of dollars, waging a state-by-state battle simply means that millions of people lose control of their reproductive health. That’s the lesson of history.

Abortion Restrictions Hurt Women’s Mental Health,Haley Weiss,Health;abortion,"January 26, 2024 10:05 AM EST","Abortion restrictions affect women’s health in more ways than one. According to a new study published in JAMA, simply living in a state that limits access to abortion is linked to worsened symptoms of anxiety and depression in women of childbearing age.  To find this pattern, a team at Johns Hopkins University analyzed responses from more than 700,000 people to the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey between Dec. 2021 and Jan. 2023. The survey asked people to rank their anxiety and depression symptoms on a scale of 0 to 4, allowing the research team to assign averages to various groups across the three time periods they looked at.  They were primarily interested in what happened to the mental health of women ages 18 to 45—a window they defined as childbearing age—after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal constitutional right to abortion in June 2022. They zoomed in on women who lived in 13 states with so-called “trigger laws,” or preemptive abortion bans designed to snap into effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned. From June 2022 through the end of the year, these women had larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms than those in the 37 other states. “The pattern is abundantly clear,” says Jennifer Payne, professor and vice chair of research in the University of Virginia’s department of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences, who was not involved with the study. The finding reinforces that the Supreme Court’s decision “was a shock,” she says. “This is not something that most women were expecting.” Several previous studies have drawn associations between restrictive abortion laws and poorer mental health, one of which found a 10% increase in the prevalence of mental distress in women who faced the possibility of losing abortion rights in the months after the Supreme Court’s decision.  Though the symptoms of anxiety and depression included in the study were limited to those below the threshold for diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorders, Payne says she would expect that the same pattern might appear in diagnostic data as well. “We know that the effects of abortion refusal increase the risk for the development of major depression,” she says.  Read More: What Abortion Laws Look Like in the U.S. One Year After the Fall of Roe v. Wade There are many reasons why a woman might be negatively affected by abortion restrictions even without needing the procedure, says Payne. “Most women, whether they're under the age of 45 or not, felt that this was a misogynistic attack on their rights,”she says. The study’s authors also point out that abortion restrictions could spur fears about further governmental attempts to control womens’ health, such as limiting access to contraception.  Other patterns emerged from the data as well. In a result that Payne called “terrible, but slightly funny,” the study’s authors found no statistically significant difference between anxiety and depression symptoms in men across states or time frames.  Questions remain about what future data might show. The newest survey data included in the study was collected a year ago; has women's mental health declined further during that time? “Certainly, the trigger states are having horrendous outcomes—doctors are leaving the states, people are being charged inappropriately for things,” Payne says. Based on that, one might expect the gap to widen, she says, but it’s also possible that the discrepancy in the study represents an initial shock felt by women in trigger-law states that’s since abated. Other states, too, have written and enacted new abortion restrictions since Roe was overturned, which may have impacted women in untold ways. What is clear so far, says Payne, is that abortion restrictions have significant public-health impacts beyond the realm of women's reproductive health.

The Democratic Party Is More Extreme on Abortion Than Ever,Ideas;Marjorie Dannenfelser,Ideas;politics,"July 26, 2016 4:47 PM EDT","On Monday night the Democratic Party ratified a platform custom made to reflect Hillary Clinton’s policy agenda. And just when you thought the Party couldn’t get more extreme on abortion, think again. The last time the Democratic Party nominated a Clinton for the presidency was 1996. Bill Clinton was no friend to unborn children, twice vetoing the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. But Bill Clinton and the Party’s platform were at least willing to pay lip service to pro-life Americans, especially those within the Democratic Party. It was Bill Clinton who said abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” with the last word indicating abortion isn’t something to be celebrated. And in 1996, the DNC adopted a platform that characterized abortion as a “difficult issue” and because of that, “we respect the individual conscience of each American.” It called for making abortion “less necessary” and “more rare.” Comparing it to the previous platform, this was new language geared at keeping pro-life Democrats in the Party, likely upset with Clinton’s first veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban just months before the 1996 convention. Eighty-one Congressional Democrats voted for the ban. It also came in the wake of the 1992 Convention, in which Gov. Bob Casey Sr. was denied the opportunity to speak because of his pro-life views. Fast forward to the 2016 Democratic platform. Long gone is the goal of making abortion “rare,” along with the idea of “respect[ing] the individual conscience of each American” on the issue. Instead, the 2016 platform calls for quite the opposite: the repeal of the Hyde Amendment. Repealing this longstanding amendment to a bill would mean abortions for Medicaid recipients, paid for with taxpayer funds. Forcing Americans to pay for the abortions of others hardly respects conscience rights; it’s a direct assault on them. National Right to Life’s Douglas Johnson has testified before Congress that “over one million Americans are walking around alive today because of the Hyde Amendment. … We believe that the Hyde Amendment has proven itself to be the greatest domestic abortion reduction law ever enacted by Congress.” With the Party’s platform veering hard to the left on abortion, some will point to Clinton’s selection of Sen. Tim Kaine as some sort of counter-balance. There is reason for the confusion as Kaine has tried to have it both ways on abortion. He most recently told CNN: “I have a traditional Catholic personal position, but I am very strongly supportive that women should make those decisions and government shouldn’t intrude.” Voters should not be fooled by his equivocation: Sen. Kaine’s “traditional Catholic personal position” has never affected the way he’s voted in the Senate, as evidenced by his 100% pro-abortion rights record. His most egregious votes include voting against a ban on later-term abortions, and voting to send taxpayer funding to America’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood. Further, if Sen. Kaine truly had a “traditional Catholic personal position,” it would preclude him from having a pro-abortion rights public policy position. The Catechism of the Catholic Church clearly states that the rights of the unborn person “must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority.” The Church’s teaching applies to those in the public square. Despite all this, the Democratic Party and their allies will undoubtedly try to use Kaine as a way to keep the 32% of Democrats who consider themselves pro-life to stay in the tent.  The GOP shouldn’t let them get away with it. Instead, it’s time to expose the Democratic Party’s extreme stance on abortion, especially their support of later term abortions and their call for taxpayer-funded abortions by repealing Hyde. Doing so would galvanize the GOP’s base while drawing in some of those pro-life Democrats who feel abandoned by their Party. It’s exactly what SBA List is doing door-to-door in key battleground states: Targeting pro-life Democrats, including Hispanics, and informing them of the extreme pro-abortion rights votes and stances taken by Hillary Clinton and down-ballot Democratic candidates. Both parties should take notice. Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/4424971/democrats-extreme-abortion/
The Biggest Ob-Gyn Group Donates a Lot to Anti-Abortion Politicians,Haley Weiss;More from TIME,Health;abortion,"May 1, 2023 2:34 PM EDT","A new analysis shows that the U.S.’s largest professional organization of ob-gyns has spent a considerable amount of money in the last decade helping anti-abortion legislators get elected to Congress. From 2012 to 2022, of the 294 federal legislators who received campaign donations via the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ (ACOG) political action committee, 39.5% have actively worked to constrain abortion access in the country. Of those donation recipients, 70 explicitly opposed Roe v. Wade.  These data, published Apr. 28 as a research letter in JAMA Network Open, are surprising in the context of ACOG’s stated support of abortion rights and access, says lead author Dr. Benjamin Brown, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Brown University’s medical school. ACOG’s website says that abortion “is essential for people’s health, safety, and well-being.” “ACOG consistently states that abortion is essential health care in its clinical guidance and public statements,” Brown says, but “the fact that ACOG has spent over $1.25 million on anti-abortion legislators in the last decade suggests that ACOG’s political donations may be undermining its stated commitment to abortion access and patient autonomy.”  Read More: Where 2024 Republican Hopefuls Stand on Federal Abortion Restrictions  In an email to TIME, ACOG said that “there is indeed a tension to balancing the many policy priorities of a membership organization that is dedicated to the many facets of medical care. To help balance the various priorities of ACOG, Ob-GynPAC”—the group’s political action committee—“considers many factors when evaluating candidates such as voting history on ACOG priority issues, including maternal mortality, reproductive health care, sustainability of practice, and access to care.” The $1.25 million sum accounts for nearly 38% of ACOG’s total donations in the decade leading up to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Brown found. That this share is so large may reflect some of the ways in which the sharp political disagreements surrounding abortion access presumably cause division even within the ranks of the industry’s leading medical group.  Much of ACOG’s non-financial advocacy work, such as briefs filed in various abortion-related court cases, do align with the group’s stated policy priorities, which include that “politicians must never interfere in the patient-physician relationship or impose unjustified restrictions on medical practices.” In legal challenges against abortion, ACOG has long played a “critical role,” says Brown, and “it’s because ACOG has this critical role that it’s also essential that ACOG’s political donations work in concert with its other advocacy.” “Ob-GynPAC’s funding formula is not fully transparent,” says Brown, which makes it hard to track why the money was funneled to specific politicians. But stances beyond abortion—like those that affect maternal health, patient coverage, and all other women’s health issues—are also important to ACOG’s members, and may play large roles in their funding decisions, he says. However, with abortion access especially imperiled, Brown says, “supporting anti-abortion access legislators has real potential to harm patients” and is nearly impossible to do without contradicting ACOG’s key goals. In order to best serve patients and prioritize their needs, Brown would like to see ACOG and other organizations begin to make their funding formulas public. “I hope that these data spark a renewed conversation about how ACOG apportions its resources,” he says.

Ukraine’s Women Refugees Face the Harsh Reality of Poland’s Abortion Restrictions,Amie Ferris-Rotman,World;abortion,"June 21, 2022 12:24 PM EDT","In the early days of May, in the third month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a mother in her early 40s crossed the border into Poland, seeking safety for herself and two teenage children. She also carried with her a secret: as Russians advanced on her hometown, she was raped by Russian soldiers.  She didn’t want anyone to know what happened, according to the Polish NGO that came to her aid. Her husband, who is in the Ukrainian army, was fighting and away from home. Once in Poland, the woman discovered she was pregnant. But getting an abortion in a country with a near-total ban, and navigating this terrain in a new language, was far from simple.  “She called me crying, ‘please take it out of me, help me,’” says Krystyna Kacpura, president of the Foundation for Women and Family Planning (Federa), a Polish reproductive rights organization. Federa was able to organize a rare medical abortion for the woman in a Warsaw hospital, using a small exception in the law for cases of rape. “She was so afraid her husband and children would find out. But we managed to do it all in secret,” says Kacpura.  More than 6 million Ukrainians, mostly women and children, have fled their country since the war began, creating Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War Two. Poland has taken the lion’s share, earning praise from Western powers, even as that generosity has raised uncomfortable questions about its treatment of asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa.  But the longer the war continues, and with it the sexual violence committed by Russian troops against Ukrainian women and girls, the more Ukrainian refugees in Poland will need access to emergency contraception and abortion services. The country’s reproductive rights campaigners and providers of abortion advice are working in overdrive to navigate some of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws. “We are shocked by the number,” says Kacpura, referring to the amount of people seeking Federa’s help. Other abortion-rights groups are reporting a similar uptick. Phone calls and messages to the hotline belonging to the Polish branch of the non-profit Women on Web, which provides abortion pills up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, have shot up by nearly a third. “We do not judge people’s circumstances and we do not ask how they became pregnant,” says Executive Director Venny Ala-Siuara, from its headquarters in Montreal, Canada.  Allegations have emerged of a systemic, coordinated campaign of sexual violence by Russian forces in Ukraine, according to Kateryna Busol, a Ukrainian lawyer specializing in international human rights and an Academy Associate at Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia Program in London. Evidence of atrocities, including myriad reports of rape, are the subject of multiple investigations from the International Criminal Court, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other groups. But war crimes are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute. Read More: Ukrainians Are Speaking Up About Rape as a War Crime to Ensure the World Holds Russia Accountable  So far, Ala-Siuara’s organization has provided abortion pills to more than 50 Ukrainian refugees in Poland, who range in age from 20 to 35. Federa receives between five and 30 calls a week from Ukrainian refugee women in Poland, asking for help accessing abortion services or emergency contraception, commonly known as the “morning after pill.” Ewa, who works on Women on Web’s help desk in Poland, says that not all the women they’ve helped have suffered sexual violence at the hands of Russians. “Sometimes their lives have changed dramatically and they need to start from scratch. Their husband may have died, or it’s just a difficult time to have a baby,” she says. (Ewa spoke on condition that only her first name is used, citing concerns over repercussions given Poland’s restrictive abortion measures.) Federa has also worked with the International Planned Parenthood Federation to dispatch emergency contraception and abortion pills to Ukrainian medical facilities that are currently under Russian occupation.  While exact numbers are hard to pin down, and the scale of the violence is difficult to verify, U.N. officials have as of early June received over 120 reports of rape. The number is understood by the U.N. and rights groups to be only a small fraction of actual cases. Officials in Kyiv have also said the number is at least in the hundreds.  Since the start of the war, Harvard University’s Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict research group has documented “gang rape, mutilation of genitals, the threat of rape, and people forced to watch their friends and relatives raped by others,” says Ukrainian academic and member Marta Havryshko, who is also a URIS Fellow at the University of Basel in Switzerland. “We have many, many cases.” Since coming to power in 2015, Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS) has repeatedly moved to curb sexual and reproductive health and rights, frequently targeted LGBTQIA+ people, and threatened to abandon domestic violence protection measures for women.  In 2020, Poland tightened its already restrictive abortion laws, ruling that pregnancies could be terminated only in cases of incest and rape, and when a mother’s life is at risk. Abortions even in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, which had formed the majority of legal terminations before then, were no longer permitted. The measure was passed by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal, whose independence has been eroded by the ruling party, rights activists say.  At least one Polish pregnant woman has died since the new restrictions came into place. Her death sparked widespread women-led protests across the majority-Catholic country and strengthened its pro-choice movement. Although emergency contraception remains available by prescription in Poland, it’s notoriously difficult to obtain. Kacpura recalls how she procured emergency contraception for two girls, aged 16 and 17, who crossed the border into Poland at the beginning of the war. They had been raped early that morning by Russian soldiers at a checkpoint and arrived, “so frightened, with no money, no knowledge of English.”  Kacpura sent them to a clinic in Warsaw where they were tested for HIV and given medication as as a prophylactic against other sexually transmitted diseases before moving on to France to rejoin their families.  The Polish government has said that female refugees from Ukraine seeking contraception and abortions will be subject to the same rules as the Polish population. The number of Polish women receiving abortions after rape is practically non-existent: in 2020 there were only two terminations granted on these grounds of Poland’s 1,000 or so legal abortions.  “But if a Ukrainian woman can now get an abortion in a hospital in Poland, maybe Polish women can too,” says Kacpura, describing how Federa managed to comply with Polish legislation’s complicated, multi-layered procedures to prove that a woman became pregnant through rape, including getting a prosecutor’s opinion on the matter.  On the other hand, members of Roman Catholic group Ordo Iuris, meaning Order of Law, an influential non-governmental group against abortion, have been calling hospitals to ensure that they are complying with the strict rules.  Providing police reports for sexual violence is also difficult in any situation, let alone for women raped during wartime in another country. What’s more, Ukrainian women and girls crossing the border into Poland often arrive with no knowledge of the restrictive laws. Federa set up a Ukrainian-language hotline explicitly to help women in need of abortions in Poland in the early days of the war, complementing its Polish hotline. Another hotline for Ukrainian refugees in Poland, called Martynka, was established in late March and works with Women on Web and German-based organizations. Federa has also published manuals explaining how to seek help and advice. “We understand that they’re going through heavy emotions,” says Ewa from Women on Web, where she receives requests for help from women responding to the organization’s campaigns on Instagram and Facebook.

Court Says Texas Can Ban Certain Emergency Abortions. What That Means,Mallory Moench;More From TIME,U.S.;abortion,"January 4, 2024 8:46 AM EST","Texas hospitals cannot be required to perform emergency abortions to stabilize the life of a patient, a federal appeals court ruled, despite federal guidance to the contrary.  The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists and Christian Medical and Dental Associations. The judges wrote in their opinion that the Biden Administration's guidance—which says hospitals receiving Medicare must provide abortions if they were a necessary medically stabilizing treatment—oversteps its authority and runs counter to state laws.  Circuit court decisions can be appealed and either party can petition the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. The Justice Department declined to comment in an email to TIME on Wednesday.  The ruling means that the status quo remains in Texas, which bans abortions except for narrow exceptions when the pregnant patient is “at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” The state is the largest in the country to enact restrictive abortion laws in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, overturning the Roe v. Wade ruling which guaranteed abortion access nationwide.  Alliance Defending Freedom’s Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives Ryan Bangert, who argued before the court on behalf of the two medical groups, said in a statement that “hospitals—especially emergency rooms—are tasked with preserving life. The 5th Circuit correctly ruled that the federal government has no business transforming them into abortion clinics.” Senior Staff Attorney Rabia Muqaddam of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing plaintiffs in other Texas abortion cases, tells TIME in an emailed statement Wednesday that the ruling “shows a complete disregard for the lives of pregnant people.”   Texas is at the forefront of abortion litigation as the legal landscape around the procedure continues to evolve. Tuesday’s ruling continues to leave medical providers in Texas to decipher the state’s law and determine whether an abortion is medically necessary to save a patient, at the risk of criminal repercussions. Paxton had threatened to criminally prosecute doctors and hospitals if they provided an abortion to a plaintiff in another high-profile legal case. Texas woman Kate Cox petitioned state courts to allow her to terminate her pregnancy because of a condition that gave her fetus very low chances for survival, but after legal whiplash between different courts, she left the state to receive an abortion just before the Texas Supreme Court denied her case. Center for Reproductive Rights spokesperson Kelly Krause tells TIME in an email that ""the exceptions are incredibly unclear and doctors are terrified to rely on these vague exceptions when they could face life in prison.""  In another ongoing Texas case, 20 women who were denied abortions sued the state over its near total abortion ban. Attorneys delivered oral arguments before the Texas Supreme Court in November and are awaiting a ruling.   The state’s top court suggested last year that the Texas Medical Board issue guidance to doctors on abortion law, but the medical board punted back to the legislature to specify. The legislature did clarify in a follow-up law that doctors can abort in cases of two specific life-threatening pregnancy conditions.  After Dobbs, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued its own guidance that said hospitals must provide an abortion if it is a stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve an emergency medical condition, in line with their obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986.  After Texas and anti-abortion groups sued, a U.S. Justice Department attorney argued before the court in November that the guidance provided needed safeguards and ruling against it was an error with “potentially devastating consequences for pregnant women within the state of Texas,” the Associated Press reported.  Muqaddam says that the appeals court’s interpretation was a “radical narrowing” of the law that means everyone who comes into an emergency room in Texas is entitled to stabilizing care––“unless they happen to be a pregnant person who needs an emergency abortion to be stabilized.” Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/6551740/texas-ban-emergency-abortions-appeals-ruling/
New Abortion Clinics Are Opening Near Borders and Airports to Stretch Access as Far as It Will Go,Jamie Ducharme,Health;abortion,"June 9, 2022 3:31 PM EDT","After more than five years working together in reproductive health clinics in the Washington, D.C., area, nurse-midwife Morgan Nuzzo and ob-gyn Dr. Diane Horvath realized they could do it better. They started fantasizing about a clinic of their own, where clinicians of different backgrounds would provide compassionate, high-quality care; employees would be fairly compensated and patients met with respect; and abortion would be treated as essential medical care that everyone should be able to access. Partners in Abortion Care, their all-trimester clinic, is set to open this fall in College Park, Md., a location they hope will be convenient not only for themselves as D.C.-area residents, but also for patients in Maryland and beyond. After the leak of a draft decision suggesting that the Supreme Court could soon overturn Roe v. Wade, which would likely result in the ban or significant restriction of abortion in 26 states, that location became more crucial than ever. College Park is within 40 miles of three major airports and close to several highways, making it a relatively easy destination for travelers. And if nearby states like West Virginia and Ohio crack down on abortion as expected, Maryland could become a magnet for people who need to travel for care—even more so if neighboring Virginia enacts stricter policies in the future, as some advocates fear will happen. Unlike those states, Maryland is expanding abortion access. It allows abortions up to the point of fetal viability (around 24 weeks of pregnancy) and permits later procedures if the parent’s health is at risk or the fetus is diagnosed with a serious health issue. Plus, starting July 1, nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants—in addition to doctors—can perform abortions there, which will expand the pool of potential providers and may therefore increase the number of patients clinics can serve. “We know that the volume of patients is going to go up in Maryland,” Horvath says. “There is no possible way to increase capacity at existing clinics to take on the number of people who are anticipated to need to travel.” Many people already have to travel to get an abortion, due to state-level restrictions and dwindling numbers of clinics. In 2017, 74% of abortion patients in Wyoming, 57% in South Carolina, and 56% in Missouri left their home state to get care, one study found. But if the Supreme Court’s draft decision is similar to the final one, that inconvenience is about to affect a lot more people. Across swaths of the South, Midwest, and Southwest, people would have to travel out of state or find a way to access abortion pills if they needed to end a pregnancy. Clinics in “abortion islands” like Illinois—states with strong abortion protections in place, but surrounded by those likely to ban it—are already bracing for a post-Roe onslaught of new patients. New clinics like Partners in Abortion Care, situated in geographically strategic areas where they can absorb as many patients as possible, may help ease that bottleneck—but they’re not likely to be enough on their own, says Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who studies abortion access. New facilities “will improve appointment availability. They will reduce travel distances. They will have an impact,” Myers says. “But there are going to be women who want abortions and can’t get them because of these bans, no matter how many clinics open.” The cost of an abortion, either through pills or a procedure, can range from hundreds of dollars to more than $1,000. If someone also has to travel for that care, they must shoulder the financial and logistical costs of transportation, lodging, missed work, and child care. Local abortion funds have long provided practical support like money for travel and assistance finding child care. (At Partners in Abortion Care, a local investor is considering buying an apartment near the clinic to use as an “abortion Airbnb,” Nuzzo says, where people could stay for free before and after their procedures.) But even with this type of aid, research suggests travel is a deterrent for many people seeking abortions. In a paper published last year, Myers estimated that about one in five people seeking an abortion in the U.S. would not get one if they had to travel 100 miles to do so. Her research suggests around 100,000 people in the U.S. will not be able to get a desired abortion in the year following a theoretical repeal of Roe v. Wade due to increased distance from providers. “Middle-income or wealthy people, particularly white people, living in banned states will always still be able to get abortion care,” as long as they can hop on a plane, says Liza Fuentes, senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights nonprofit. For many other people who need an abortion—who, Guttmacher research shows, tend to be lower-income and already parents—it’s not that simple. Some clinicians are leaving states that are likely to ban abortion and setting up shop elsewhere to help minimize the distance that patients must travel. Shannon Brewer, the director of Mississippi’s last remaining abortion clinic—which is at the heart of the case that caused the Supreme Court to reexamine abortion issues—recently said she may start practicing in New Mexico, a state with no major abortion limits that is sandwiched between Texas (which already bans most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy) and Arizona (one of the states expected to crack down on abortion if Roe is rolled back). Jennifer Pepper, executive director at CHOICES Memphis Center for Reproductive Health, is also planning to open a clinic in a new state if and when hers is forced to stop offering abortion care. (Tennessee has a “trigger law” in place, which would ban most abortions within a month of Roe being overturned.) She and her team found a space in Carbondale, a city in southern Illinois about a two-hour drive from St. Louis and a three-hour drive from both Memphis and Nashville. They’re preparing to open in August. CHOICES provided 3,900 abortions in its Memphis clinic last year and expects to exceed that number in Illinois. But they can’t serve everyone. If Roe is overturned, multiple Tennessee clinics would have to stop offering abortion services, and there’s no way CHOICES could absorb all of those patients with one new facility. “It’s just a math problem that doesn’t work out,” Pepper says. Modeling that Myers conducted for TIME suggests the Carbondale facility could reduce travel requirements for about 3 million women, mostly in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas. Other advocates are eyeing Illinois, too. Dr. Douglas Laube, an abortion provider in Wisconsin, told local news outlets that he is thinking of opening a new clinic just over the state border. Planned Parenthood is also expanding operations in Illinois, as the Washington Post has reported. Julie Burkhart, a longtime reproductive health advocate and founder of the nonprofit Wellspring Health Access, is fighting hard to keep abortion accessible further West—but not without significant opposition. In 2020, Burkhart started talking with local advocates who wanted an abortion clinic in Casper, Wyo. At the time, Wyoming had few legal barriers to abortion care and a clear need for more providers. Abortion services were only available in Jackson, just over the Idaho border, so opening one in Casper, a city less than 200 miles from Nebraska and South Dakota, would expand access across the region. “Wyoming was just a perfect state,” Burkhart says. Then, in March 2022, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon signed a trigger law that would ban most abortions five days after a Supreme Court overrule of Roe v. Wade. With the Casper clinic set to open around the same time the Supreme Court makes its final ruling, Wellspring may only be able to offer abortions for a matter of days or weeks—if it opens at all. In late May, the clinic’s building was damaged in a suspected arson. The damage is still being assessed, but it may be necessary to gut the building’s interior and replace its electrical system, possibly forcing Wellspring into a temporary space. Burkhart says she knows it sounds crazy to move ahead despite these obstacles, but she’s doing it anyway. “These things cannot go unchecked,” she says. “It’s important for good people, people who want social justice and equality, to stand up even taller.” New clinics can help keep abortion accessible, but more tools are needed. Abortion pills—which can be prescribed remotely, then sent to patients by mail for use early in a pregnancy—could be a workaround for some people, but their legal status varies by state. Some states don’t allow the pills to be prescribed via telehealth, limiting their utility for people who don’t live near abortion providers, and legislators in 22 states have advanced bills that would either ban or restrict access to the drugs. At least for now, however, the reproductive rights group Plan C helps people across U.S. states and territories find information about how to get the pills. Appointment capacity is another major issue. Patients already face long waits in clinics across the country, even in abortion-friendly states like New York and California, Myers’ research shows. To help ease those backlogs, Myers says more states should permit non-physician providers to offer abortion care, as states like Maryland, Connecticut, and Delaware are doing. For Nuzzo, that point is personal. As a nurse-midwife, she says she’s long been doubted by the medical community or treated as lesser than a doctor. “My profession is this punching bag, and everybody’s punching down,” Nuzzo says. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, for example, vetoed the law that will allow non-physicians to provide abortions in Maryland, citing fears that it would reduce the quality of care. (He was overruled by state lawmakers.) Nuzzo and Horvath are determined to prove that doing things differently can improve care. They believe theirs will be the only all-trimester abortion clinic in the country owned by women, as well as the only one operated by a physician and a midwife together, in one of the few states actually expanding abortion access—not restricting it. Getting their clinic ready to open hasn’t been easy. Horvath and Nuzzo have contributed thousands of their own dollars and bought a vintage ultrasound machine and exam table on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace, to hold them over until they can afford newer versions. They’re constantly worried about the security of their clinic and of their future patients, even in an abortion-friendly state and with enough community support to crowdsource almost $260,000. Living in uncertainty about the future of their profession has also taken a mental toll. But if their model works, they hope to work with other abortion providers and advocates to open clinics in other parts of the country, with the goal of keeping care as accessible as possible even in a post-Roe reality. “We want to start from a place of abundance,” Horvath says, “and think of what abortion care could look like even in this time where everything is so dire.” Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com",https://time.com/6185519/abortion-clinics-travel-state-borders/
How a New Study on Premature Babies Could Influence the Abortion Debate,Eliza Gray,Politics;Health Care,"May 12, 2015 1:51 PM [ET]","A new study showing that a tiny percentage of extremely premature babies born at 22 weeks can survive with extensive medical intervention could change the national conversation about abortion, though the research is unlikely to have a major effect on women’s access to abortions in the short term. Anti-abortion advocates said the study—which was published by the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday and found that 3.5% percent of 357 infants born at 22 weeks could survive without severe health problems if hospitals treated them—could benefit the anti-abortion movement by sparking discussion about the viability of premature babies. “Some people are strongly committed to pro-life, some are strongly committed to the other side,” but many fall somewhere in the middle, said Burke Balch, director of the Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics for the National Right to Life Committee, the non-profit advocacy organization. “The fact that those children could survive will affect those in the middle.” The anti-abortion movement has tried to shift attention away from women who seek abortions—as in, debates on whether abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest—and instead focus on the unborn baby, using the argument that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks to justify state bans on abortion after that time. Some 13 states have banned abortion after 20 weeks, according to Naral Pro-Choice America, a non-profit advocacy organization. Other states, such as Wisconsin, South Carolina and West Virginia have started debating such measures this year. The 20-week bans, Balch said, are partially designed to bring the focus back to the child—and the new data on premature babies will make that easier. “It strengthens the persuasiveness argument, even if it doesn’t impact the legal argument,” he said. While anti-abortion advocates hope the study will shift public opinion, the fact that a small number of babies can survive at 22 weeks with extraordinary interventions will likely not have a large impact on a woman’s ability to get an abortion today, experts said. The Supreme Court has held that states can restrict abortions if the fetus is viable—able to survive outside the womb—even if the mother’s health is not threatened by the pregnancy. But there is no strict legal definition of viability; instead, it is determined on a case-by-case basis by the individual doctor. While it is possible that the study could affect a doctor’s decision about the viability of a pregnancy, doctors would usually focus more on the details of the specific case. And few doctors and clinics offer abortions at such a late stage anyway, experts added. “Viability has never been a set number,” said Eric Ferrero, vice president of communications at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the reproductive health non-profit. “It is determined by each doctor based on the woman and the pregnancy and it varies. That’s what the medical community has said and what Roe v. Wade says, and that’s unchanged by this study, which is about the extremely intensive care that is provided in some places.” Though the new research has sparked discussion of abortion, its real relevance is for expectant parents researching the medical treatment available for premature babies, particularly those who may want to find out whether their hospital provides interventions to save babies at 22 weeks. “I think it’s important information, especially for women excited about having a baby,” says Elizabeth Nash, an expert on state laws governing reproduction at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group focused on reproductive health. “It’s much more tangential to abortion, except that abortion opponents will look to this information to try to restrict access, and that’s where we have to pay attention.” Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/3850412/premature-babies-study-abortion-debate/
How an Abortion-Clinic Shooting Led to a ‘Wrongful Life’ Lawsuit,Jennifer Latson,History,"December 30, 2014 10:30 AM EST","At a time when antiabortion violence had become disconcertingly common, John Salvi put a grim face on the epidemic. On this day 20 years ago — Dec. 30, 1994 — the 22-year-old New Hampshire hairdresser who’d plastered a picture of a fetus on his pickup truck walked into a Brookline, Mass., Planned Parenthood clinic and sprayed the waiting room with gunfire. Then he did it again, at another abortion clinic two miles away. A beauty school classmate described Salvi in the way we often hear people described after they commit mass violence: quiet, emotionless, off. But a week before the shootings, something triggered his rage, according to his boss at the Eccentric Beauty Salon, where he worked as a trainee: not a debate over reproductive rights, but being told he wasn’t ready to cut a client’s hair. The day after the Brookline shootings, Salvi was arrested when he opened fire at a clinic in Norfolk, Va. In total, he killed two people, wounded five and terrified abortion providers and their patients across the country. Among the terrified was a woman named Deborah Gaines, who had been awaiting her appointment in one of the Brookline clinics when Salvi started shooting. He killed the receptionist and shot a patient administrator, then chased Gaines and others who fled the building, firing as he followed. Gaines escaped with her life — but so did her unborn daughter. Gaines was so distraught after the shooting that she couldn’t bring herself to return for another appointment, according to the Washington Post‘s DeNeen L. Brown, and she ultimately carried the baby to term. She later sued the clinic for between $100,000 and $500,000 to help raise the child in a controversial “wrongful life” case, which was settled out of court. Her attorney argued that the clinic should have had tighter security measures in place, given the increasing outbreaks of violence against abortion providers. Since they hadn’t, he said, Gaines had been denied her right to terminate her pregnancy. Meanwhile, some in the pro-life community argued that the birth of Gaines’ daughter was the silver lining to the tragedy. A handful even argued that Salvi, who committed suicide in prison in 1996 while serving two consecutive life terms, could be considered a hero for ensuring that the child was born. But Gaines, a single mother who had three other children and was receiving public assistance when she made the abortion appointment, didn’t see it that way, according to Brown. “I know ignorant people out there are going to say if it weren’t for John Salvi, this baby wouldn’t be here,” Gaines told the Post reporter. “But this does not make him a hero.” Read TIME’s original coverage of the shootings, here in the archives: An Armed Fanatic Raises the Stakes Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/3648437/john-salvi-shootings/
‘Am I a Felon?’ The Fall of Roe v. Wade Has Permanently Changed the Doctor-Patient Relationship,Abigail Abrams;Varying guidance;‘Am I a felon?’,U.S.;abortion,"October 17, 2022 7:00 AM EDT","A few days after the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in June, Dr. Mae Winchester got a call late at night. One of her patients had developed sepsis after her water broke at 19 weeks of pregnancy. Sepsis can be fatal, and normally Winchester, a maternal-fetal medicine physician in Ohio, would rush her patient into the operating room and provide an abortion. But this time, she felt she had to call her hospital’s lawyers first. The lawyers agreed that treating this patient with an abortion would be legal under Ohio’s new abortion ban, which contained an exception to prevent the death of the mother. But in other cases, Winchester says care has been delayed, or the lawyers have disagreed with her, and she hasn’t been allowed to provide the care she deems necessary. “Meanwhile, the patient is just sitting in the operating room by herself,” Winchester says, “not knowing what I can do.” Winchester is just one of many doctors throughout the country struggling to navigate the complicated and rapidly shifting legal landscape of abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade with its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. With abortion rights now left up to the states, physicians and other medical providers are confused about what services they are legally allowed to provide, often forced to consult lawyers on decisions they used to be able to make on their own, and scared for their patients’ lives. In Wisconsin, where a ban dating back to 1849 prohibits all abortions except to save the life of the pregnant patient, groups of lawyers and doctors are collectively trying to come up with guidance on what situations pose a serious enough threat to a patient’s health to justify an abortion. In Texas, some hospitals have created committees to review such situations, while others have established protocols requiring multiple doctors to sign off on medically necessary abortions. With a state law allowing private-citizen lawsuits in effect, physicians are concerned that anyone—from a local politician to a patient’s family member to a nurse or cleaning staff member—could file suit if the person disagrees with their decision. And in Idaho, the state’s total abortion ban has led doctors to discuss medically transporting patients out of state if they need serious treatment and drastically affected care for even ectopic pregnancies, a condition in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, making the pregnancy nonviable and potentially life-threatening if untreated. TIME spoke with more than a dozen doctors, health care lawyers, and hospital ethics committee members in nine states, who all said their efforts to interpret state laws are failing to clarify the chaos of conflicting, sometimes century-old or hastily written laws. Those laws have created new regulations, reporting requirements, penalties, and definitions that many argue do not take into account the complex and inherently dangerous reality of pregnancy. For a half-century, physicians have provided abortions to treat a wide range of medical situations including hemorrhaging, miscarriages and even cancer. Now 14 states ban or tightly restrict abortion, with at least 10 other laws tied up in court. Most provide only narrow exceptions. The laws are often vague, and the few that try to spell out conditions that qualify for abortions do not cover all possibilities. Doctors say they are being forced to navigate legal concepts they don’t have the training for while being prohibited from using their own expertise to treat patients. Attorneys with little experience in reproductive health care say they are likewise scrambling to understand complex medical situations and develop procedures for ever-growing lists of complications, knowing their guidance could be challenged any time someone disagrees with their interpretation of untested laws. Many warn the dynamic will permanently change the doctor-patient relationship. While some physicians and lawyers have spoken out about this dynamic, many others are afraid to do so. Some universities and hospitals have told their staff not to give interviews about abortion, while others have made it clear they would rather their staff not speak publicly or have said they can only do so without identifying their employer. Doctors and lawyers at major private and public institutions in multiple states told TIME they weren’t comfortable speaking about their handling of abortion post-Roe, and many of those who did said they would only do so as private citizens, unaffiliated with their official positions. Already, doctors and lawyers say that the threat of criminal penalties, massive fines, or lost licenses is affecting how and when they decide to proceed with abortions, often leading to delays in care. “This assignment of criminal penalties has made our physicians much more interested in trying to interpret the statute, and they’re taking a much more conservative view,” says Lisa Larson-Bunnell, a lawyer at a hospital in Missouri, where a trigger law banned all abortions except in cases of medical emergency hours after the Supreme Court’s decision. The doctors who spoke with TIME all emphasized that when patients are imminently dying, they have intervened and would do so again. But there are plenty of situations when a pregnancy is seriously harming a patient’s health or a patient is experiencing a problem that could quickly become dire, doctors say, and delays caused by the new laws make those situations more dangerous. Doctors are not used to discussing their medical decisions with hospital lawyers, says Dr. Alison Haddock, an emergency medicine physician in Houston and board chair of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Before her state outlawed abortion, it was “exceedingly rare” to talk to a lawyer during her shift, and those conversations would more likely revolve around guardianship for an elderly patient or someone with psychiatric or social work needs. “Not where you have a patient who is medically quite ill in front of you, and you know the treatment plan and can’t complete it,” she says.  For many doctors, explaining the new order of operations to patients is just as difficult as processing it themselves. “I went into this field to be able to help patients and their families get the best pregnancy outcome that’s possible and to be their support and their guidance through difficult times,” says Dr. Kylie Cooper, a maternal-fetal medicine physician in Boise, Idaho. “I have patients asking me, ‘Are you going to be able to help me if something unexpected or dangerous happens?’ And for the first time in my career, I have to tell them that I don’t know.” In many states, decisions about how to comply with abortion bans vary by city or even by hospital, as different institutions establish their own guidance. This variation is “one of the worst things that can happen,” says Larson-Bunnell. “There is solidarity in numbers. And when you have individual physicians and you have individual hospitals or health systems that are behaving differently, that causes there to be more scrutiny on hospitals when they do decide to proceed with an abortion.” Cooper and other ob-gyns at her hospital have formed a committee to help advise other physicians and medical staff on how to care for patients under the state’s new abortion ban, which technically has no exceptions that would protect doctors from being charged, and says that providers can defend themselves from criminal prosecution by arguing an abortion was necessary to save the pregnant woman’s life. A judge ruled in August that physicians in Idaho must be allowed to provide abortions in medical emergencies, but Cooper says the law is still causing confusion and adding legal and logistical hurdles for all pregnancy care in the state. In many cases, the lawyers advising physicians on navigating these laws are malpractice attorneys or hospitals’ general counsels, not specialists in reproductive health. Winchester’s hospital added forms that are designed to document how any abortion situation falls under the law’s exceptions. “Our physician notes used to be just for physicians to communicate, and now it has become: this is what’s going to protect me if someone comes after me because of my medical care,” Winchester says. (Ohio’s abortion ban is now blocked, but the state’s attorney general is appealing the judge’s decision.) Read More: ‘Never-Ending Nightmare.’ An Ohio Woman Was Forced to Travel Out of State for an Abortion When Texas implemented new laws last fall banning abortions after about six weeks and limiting abortion medications, Dr. Patrick Ramsey, maternal-fetal medicine fellowship director at University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, worked with the legal department at his institution to create a list that could serve as a starting point for discussions about which conditions would threaten a pregnant patient’s life or be considered a medical emergency. They then instituted new policies requiring two attending physicians to sign off on procedures in some cases, added extra documentation to their electronic medical records to match the state’s new laws, and decided that no residents, who are still completing their training, would be responsible for documenting these cases. “It’s creating more administrative headaches and taking away from patient care,” Ramsey says. The confusion extends beyond obstetrician-gynecologists to include emergency physicians, family medicine doctors, oncologists, pediatricians, and more. In large hospitals, doctors can ask an ob-gyn to advise on a pregnant patient, but in smaller hospitals or rural areas, emergency physicians often provide obstetric care and may have to make decisions on their own or wait to hear back from a larger institution elsewhere, says Dr. Daniel Elliott, board president of the Indiana chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians.  Some hospitals are involving ethics committees or clinical ethicists, who can provide bedside consultations for doctors making tough decisions. But this will be limited by each state’s law and a given institution’s risk tolerance, says Micah Hester, who chairs the department of medical humanities and bioethics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences College of Medicine and consults on cases at UAMS hospitals. Even in risky medical situations, “any ethics committee or ethicist would be hard pressed to recommend going against the law,” he says, “knowing that doing so puts the provider and the woman at certain kinds of very important legal risks.” The varied statutes and penalties, combined with frequent legal changes, have made it difficult to provide uniform advice. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), for example, recommended that hospitals form task forces to help doctors make decisions about what medical emergencies fall under their state laws’ exceptions, but it cautioned that it would be “impossible” and “dangerous” to create a finite list of conditions for doctors to follow. The Wisconsin Medical Society moved away from providing specific recommendations and has opted for webinars and ongoing updates to its members about the state’s ban. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) has formed a national task force of doctors, policy experts, and lawyers to try to help its members navigate emergency care under state abortion bans. But even when groups do issue documents breaking down their state’s laws, they can’t predict how individual prosecutors will react. Even some hospitals that have provided guidance or put committees in place have sometimes told physicians to make decisions on their own on a case by case basis because if they are performing an abortion, it should be a true emergency. “It’s just, there you are, out there on an island,” says Dr. Jennifer Smith, an ob-gyn in the St. Louis area.  The restrictive state laws put physicians “between a rock and a hard place,” says Dr. Wendy Molaska, a family medicine physician in Wisconsin and president of the Wisconsin Medical Society.  The federal Emergency Medical And Labor Treatment Act (EMTALA) requires emergency departments to stabilize any patient who arrives in an emergency or in labor, or transfer them to a facility that can treat them. If physicians trying to comply with abortion bans that only include life exceptions wait too long, Molaska says they fear hurting the patient—and violating federal law in the process. That gives them an impossible choice, she says: “Am I a felon? Or am I a malpracticing physician?”  Medical malpractice insurance doesn’t cover criminal charges, and most doctors don’t have their own legal advisers. Dr. Judith Williams, an ob-gyn in Memphis, works in private practice and treats patients at two hospitals in her area. Neither of them have provided guidance on the state’s abortion law, which, like Idaho’s ban, prohibits abortion in all circumstances—with no exceptions for lifesaving care—and only allows providers to argue they were acting to save the patient’s life or prevent “serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function” as an affirmative defense. Williams asked how her hospitals were handling the new law, and says she was told the institutions wouldn’t offer guidance because their lawyers did not handle criminal cases. So instead, she spoke to a patient who is a criminal defense attorney for legal advice. And when Williams recently had a different patient whose fetus was diagnosed at 19 weeks with anencephaly—a condition in which the fetus’ brain doesn’t develop—she called her lawyer patient to ask whether she could help the other woman find an abortion in another state. “When I called her, she said, ‘Probably the best thing that you can do is just give the patient her prenatal records and don’t have on paper anywhere that you facilitated this,’” Williams says. “That is terrible.” A number of high-profile cases of patients being denied care in life-threatening or emergency situations have emerged in the months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. But while some anti-abortion doctors have argued that these instances are rare and that state laws do allow providers to treat those patients, other physicians say such situations are happening regularly. High-risk ob-gyns in multiple states told TIME they are seeing patients on a weekly basis whose care is affected negatively by their states’ abortion laws.  Evidence backs them up. A study of two hospitals in Dallas from the first nine months after Texas’ six-week abortion ban took effect in September 2021 found that patients had to wait an average of nine days for their pregnancy complications to be considered life-threatening enough to qualify for an abortion. Because of these delays, most of the patients observed experienced serious health consequences, including hemorrhaging, sepsis, and in one case a hysterectomy.  Some anti-abortion politicians have acknowledged the laws are causing issues in recent months. Republican lawmakers in South Carolina spoke out after hearing stories of harrowing experiences from their constituents, and despite the state calling a special session to pass new abortion restrictions last month, lawmakers have not been able to agree on a new bill. But in other cases, they are insisting the laws provide appropriate exceptions and doctors are interpreting them incorrectly. In Texas, state Sen. Bryan Hughes, who helped author his state’s six-week ban, wrote a letter to the Texas Medical Board in August raising concerns about “allegations that hospitals, their administrations, or even their lawyers may be wrongfully prohibiting or seriously delaying physicians from providing medically appropriate and possibly life saving services” to patients with pregnancy complications. “Texas law makes it clear that a mother’s life and major bodily function should be protected,” and any allegation “should be investigated,” he wrote, according to the letter, which has not been previously reported. More doctors have started to speak up about their concerns. A coalition of medical groups, including the ACEP, ACOG, and the American Medical Association, filed amicus briefs in two cases about EMTALA laying out the many harms they say the laws can cause, and other providers have written op-eds in their local newspapers and testified when states have considered new abortion bans. But in the meantime, doctors worry about how the confusion and stress will affect their patients and their ability to practice long-term. Doctors in multiple states told TIME that they or their colleagues are relocating to states with fewer abortion restrictions.  Shortages of ob-gyns and primary care providers are common around the country, and maternity care deserts are growing. A new report released Oct. 12 by March of Dimes found that 36% of counties nationwide have no obstetric hospital or birth center and no obstetric providers, with many of the highest concentrations of these care deserts in states that now ban abortion. States that restrict abortion also have high maternal and infant mortality rates and worse birth outcomes, something that doctors predict will worsen if more providers decide they can’t practice there. “The price that citizens of Texas are going to pay for this over the next decade or two will be unfixable,” says Dr. Charles Brown, chair of the Texas district of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Those that do remain say they are still worried about practicing under the new laws, but are trying to provide the best treatment they can. “Do you want your patient to be the example of what can go wrong?” says Williams in Tennessee. “I really do not want that to occur at my hands. And I simply am not going to let it occur at my hands.” Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6222346/abortion-care-after-roe-doctors-lawyers/
These Are the States That Voted to Protect Abortion Rights in the Midterms,Katie Reilly;Kentucky;Michigan;Vermont;California;Montana,U.S.;abortion,"November 9, 2022 2:19 PM EST","In nearly all states where the question was on the ballot on Tuesday, voters moved to protect abortion access—a major victory for abortion-rights supporters after the Supreme Court’s decision in June, overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. “Voters are rejecting the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe and issuing a clarion call that they want their rights constitutionally protected,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement, calling Tuesday’s ballot measures “an example of what is possible for other states.” Kentucky, Michigan, Vermont and California all voted to protect abortion rights, while the results of a ballot measure in Montana are still pending. These are the states that had abortion-related measures on the ballot: In deeply red Kentucky, voters rejected a measure that would have excluded abortion rights from the state’s constitution. It would have amended the document to say that “nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.” About 53% of voters opposed the measure, while about 48% voted in favor.  The outcome won’t immediately affect abortion access in the state, but it signals where most voters stand on the issue after the Republican-led state legislature passed a ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The state Supreme Court is currently considering a legal challenge to that abortion ban. “This is a victory for bodily autonomy and the right of all Kentuckians to make the best decisions for themselves, but the fight is not over,” Amber Duke, interim executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement. “We will now continue our fight in state court to restore abortion access in the commonwealth.” It was similar to the outcome in Kansas in August, when voters overwhelmingly rejected a measure that would have amended the state constitution to say it did not contain a right to an abortion.  Both ballot measures provide an example of how abortion-rights advocates can use ballot measures to protect abortion access moving forward, even in Republican-leaning states. Michigan was one of three states—along with Vermont and California—that voted to protect the right to abortion by enshrining it in the state constitution, which abortion-rights advocates hailed as a “a seismic win.” About 56% of Michigan voters supported a measure that will establish a “new individual right to reproductive freedom,” including the “right to make all decisions about pregnancy and abortion.” About 44% of voters opposed the measure.  The amendment is expected to invalidate a 1931 abortion ban still on the books in Michigan.  “Post the Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade, state constitutions are really the vehicle, the mechanism for protecting abortion rights in every individual state,” says Elisabeth Smith, director of state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, who spent Monday door-knocking around Detroit, encouraging people to vote “yes” on Michigan’s ballot measure. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also won reelection Tuesday, after abortion became a central issue in her campaign. Her Republican challenger, Tudor Dixon, supported an abortion ban except if a pregnant patient’s life is at risk, and she did not support exceptions for cases of rape or incest.  Whitmer had prioritized abortion access as a campaign issue and vowed to continue vetoing anti-abortion legislation as governor. “For three and a half years, the threat of my veto is what has kept Michigan pro-choice, frankly, with the legislature that we have,” Whitmer told TIME during the summer, describing the stakes of her reelection campaign. Vermont will also amend its state constitution to include “an individual’s right to personal reproductive autonomy,” after more than 75% of voters supported the measure. The measure had broad support in the state, including from Republican Gov. Phil Scott.  “It is more important than ever to make sure the women in our state have the right to make their own decisions about their health, bodies, and their futures,” Scott said in July, announcing that the proposal would appear on the ballot.  California voters supported a measure that will enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, with 65% voting in favor and 35% in opposition.  The amendment says that the “state shall not deny or interfere with an individual’s reproductive freedom,” including “their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives.” The measure was put on the ballot following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which turned abortion rights back to the states.  In Montana, results are still pending on a referendum that would declare an embryo or fetus a legal person entitled to medical care if they are “born alive” at any stage of development, including after attempted abortions.  Health care providers who violate the law would face a fine of up to $50,000 and 20 years in prison.  Opponents of the measure, including the Montana Medical Association and other medical groups, argue it would negatively affect people with severe pregnancy complications and would criminalize doctors who provide palliative care to newborns with fatal health conditions.

Abortion Bans Strip People of Their Human Rights. Here’s Why We Must Stand In Solidarity Against Them,Ideas;Uma Mishra-Newbery;Jaime Todd-Gher,Ideas;abortion,"September 27, 2019 9:02 AM EDT","Banning abortions isn’t particularly effective. When governments restrict access to abortion, abortions actually continue to take place at roughly the same rate, according to the World Health Organization. But they get less safe. When abortion services are denied or limited, coat hangers, toxic herbal medicines and unqualified practitioners step into the breach, while medical professionals who provide proper care are criminalized. Total bans or restrictive abortion laws in countries like El Salvador, Poland and more recently several U.S. states (including Louisiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri) are designed to control and confine women and girls to stereotypical gender roles. They are an affront to their human rights and dignity and constitute gender discrimination. For transgender and queer people who need abortions, such restrictive laws are the latest in a long line of attacks on their rights and freedoms. Organizations defending human rights have documented the agony and despair stemming from restrictive abortion laws around the world. One of the most harrowing stories is that of “Ms Y”, a woman who was granted asylum in Ireland after being beaten and raped by paramilitaries in her own country. Ms Y tried to kill herself several times when she was told she could not end her pregnancy, which was the result of rape. She was eventually forced to give birth by C-section. At every step of the way, the Irish authorities’ concern for the protection of the fetus trumped any consideration of Ms Y’s mental and physical health. Last year Ireland joined the list of nearly 50 countries that have expanded access to lawful abortion over the last few decades. It was a historic move which came too late for Ms Y, but which will protect others from suffering the same trauma. More recently, we have seen the horrific impact of criminal abortion laws being used to punish people for suffering pregnancy-related complications. In El Salvador, women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths are routinely “suspected of having abortions” and charged with homicide. In April 2016, Evelyn Hernández, a 21-year-old El Salvadorian woman, suffered an obstetric emergency at home, resulting in the loss of her pregnancy. She was arrested, tried and sentenced to 30 years in jail for aggravated homicide. In February this year, a higher court overturned this ruling and ordered a re-trial — which found Evelyn innocent. However, on Sept. 6, the Salvadoran Public Prosecutor’s Office announced that it would appeal that judgement – showing the authorities’ obsession with charging her under the country’s draconian laws. We must continue to stand up to governments’ efforts to control women’s and girls’ bodies. According to the US-based reproductive health non-profit the Guttmacher Institute’s latest report, as of 2017, 42% of women of reproductive age live in the 125 countries where abortion is highly restricted (prohibited altogether, or allowed only to save a woman’s life or protect her health). Jurisdictions around the world are going to extreme lengths to restrict abortion access — stripping those who can get pregnant of their human rights and bodily autonomy. Any person who does not control what happens to their body cannot be free. The debate around abortion should go beyond whether a person’s life is endangered by pregnancy. At the core of the issue is a person’s right to make decisions about what happens to their body. This right is critical to enabling all people who can get pregnant to fully exercise their human rights and to live their lives with dignity. Governments must not only decriminalize abortion and ensure access to safe abortion in practice, but also create social conditions in which people can make pregnancy-related decisions free of oppression, discrimination, stigma, coercion, violence, lack of opportunities or punishment. More and more countries have woken up to this fact, despite the alarming rollback of reproductive rights in some countries, like the United States or Poland, driven by anti-choice groups and supported by populist politicians. Over the last 25 years, around 50 countries have changed their laws to allow for greater access to abortion. Although national contexts vary, one thing has united all successful campaigns to reform abortion laws: women speaking out. From Ireland to South Korea, activists have helped dispel the stigma and secrecy surrounding abortion by sharing their stories. In Argentina and Poland, over a million women have marched to demand that their voices be heard. People who need, or have had, abortions deserve our support and solidarity. Whether by donating time and resources to national abortion networks, taking to the streets in protest or educating people in our lives about the need for safe abortion, we all have a role to play in reclaiming our rights. At the same time, governments must expand access to safe, lawful and affordable abortion and contraception for all people. Not only is it the humane thing to do, it is a state obligation under international law. It will prevent countless deaths, life-long trauma and life-changing injuries.

What to Know About Ohio’s Abortion Ballot Initiative,Sanya Mansoor;What the abortion ballot initiative says;Support for Issue 1;What’s at stake? ,Politics;abortion,"August 2, 2023 7:00 AM EDT","In Ohio, Democrats are trying to add abortion protections to the state constitution through a ballot initiative. But Republicans are attempting to block the move in the political bellwether state by raising the threshold for a ballot initiative to succeed.  In an August 8 special election, voters will decide whether ballot initiatives need to pass with 60 percent of the vote instead of the current simple majority; this vote takes place before Ohioans head to the polls in November for the abortion measure. That could make all the difference for abortion rights in the state: A USA Today/Suffolk University survey that polled 500 likely voters in July found that 58% supported a constitutional amendment that would add abortion protections. An Ohio Northern University poll of registered voters conducted in July found that neither side had majority support—with 42.4% approving of Issue 1, the measure to increase the passing margin, and 41% disapproving. Abortion is currently legal in Ohio until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, but isn't protected by the state constitution. The state enacted an abortion ban that kicked in at around six weeks of pregnancy after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year but a lower court issued a stay; that ruling is being appealed. The proposed constitutional amendment would preserve the ability for abortion to occur until viability. Here's what to know about the fight over Ohio's proposed ballot initiative. Read More: ‘Never-Ending Nightmare.’ An Ohio Woman Was Forced to Travel Out of State for an Abortion The proposed amendment to codify abortion rights in the state constitution would ensure a ""fundamental right to reproductive freedom"" with ""reasonable limits"". Restrictions would apply after a fetus' viability outside the womb, which was the standard under Roe v. Wade. Abortion-rights activists collected more than 700,000 signatures to secure a November 7 ballot initiative. As of July 25, Secretary of State Frank LaRose said nearly 496,000 of those were valid signatures, which was enough to put the amendment to a vote.  Issue 1 is the separate measure being voted on Aug. 8 that would raise the threshold to pass a ballot initiative from a simple majority to 60 percent. It would also require signatures to be collected in all 88 counties, instead of 44, and eliminate the 10-day grace period to ensure all signatures are valid.  LaRose previously said at a Seneca County dinner for Lincoln Day that the measure “is 100% about keeping a radical, pro-abortion amendment out of our constitution,” but later told the Associated Press that the comment was taken out of context. Republican state Rep. Brian Stewart, who introduced the measure, framed the effort as a way to keep Ohio a ""pro-life"" state in a memo to his Republican colleagues, CBS News reported.  Republicans say Issue 1 will keep special interest groups from holding undue sway over Ohio’s politics. They point, in particular, to how casinos cashed in on a 2009 ballot initiative to legalize gambling. “Ohioans don't want corporate special interests to litter our state constitution with guaranteed profit making schemes the way that the casino industry has done,” says Mark Weaver, a Republican strategist and ad maker for the Vote Yes campaign for Issue 1. Allowing for a higher vote threshold encourages bipartisan cooperation, Weaver says: “When you can pass something with 50% plus one, it's possible for one party or one ideology to dominate the policies."" Supporters of Issue 1 also point out that the U.S. Constitution requires a two-thirds vote in Congress to propose an amendment. There is a lot of out-of-state money in Ohio regarding Issue 1 funneling in from both sides. Illinois billionaire and GOP mega donor Richard Uihlein has spent more than $4 million to push for a ‘yes’ vote and assist Save Our Constitution, which raised $4.8 million and spent $1.6 million, according to Cleveland.com and other local news reports. On the other side, One Person One Vote has raised $14. 8 million and spent $10.4 million to try to defeat Issue 1, according to Cleveland.com. Bob Clegg, an Ohio-based GOP strategist, points out that even if Democrats succeed in adding abortion protections to the state constitution in November, Republicans could force another ballot initiative vote since they control both chambers of the state legislature by significant margins. “It could be a very short-lived victory,” Clegg says. “My big fear about all of this is that in Ohio we may start legislating by constitutional amendment,” Clegg says. “The constitution should be there to dictate how the government is run… It’s a process document. It’s not a policy document.”  The simple majority requirement and citizenship ballot initiative has been in place in Ohio since 1912, and was first instituted as a response to rampant government corruption. Republicans’ attempts to change the voting threshold ahead of a key abortion vote could backfire, says Susan Burgess, a political science professor at Ohio University. “Generally speaking, people don't tend to like changing the process midstream,"" she says. ""And when you pair that with potentially taking away a group of peoples’ rights, that is a very dangerous place for Republicans to be.” If Issue 1 passes, it could affect much more than abortion rights in the state. “Conflict about abortion is spilling over into areas unrelated to abortion because if Ohioans voted for this, it would change their ability to do direct democracy on any issue,” says Mary Ruth Ziegler, law professor at UC Davis. Kayla Griffin, Ohio state director of All Voting Is Local Action and an opponent of Issue 1, worries that the measure could affect everything from minimum wage to fair maps. Democrats and voting advocates argue that citizen-led ballot initiatives are key to combating gerrymandering by more accurately capturing the popular will. “Ohioans can use the citizen-ballot initiative process as a measure of last resort because Ohio is so gerrymandered,” Griffin says. “To say that only 40% of the state will actually be able to determine what happens with the majority of the state is egregious.” (In June, the U.S. Supreme Court directed Ohio's top court to reassess the legality of the state's congressional districts. Republican state lawmakers had argued in appeals that the Ohio Supreme Court had wrongfully struck down GOP-drawn U.S. House districts. Last June, that court rejected a second map drawn by Republicans as gerrymandered and sent it back for a third attempt.) Citizen-led ballot measures have become increasingly used by abortion rights’ supporters to preserve access as state legislatures enact bans. Six states had abortion-related measures on the ballot in 2022. All six were victories for abortion-rights advocates, including those in more conservative states such as Kansas and Kentucky. In most cases, they won by a margin of less than 60%. In California, Michigan, and Vermont, voters approved ballot measures codifying abortion rights into the state constitution. Ballot initiatives restricting access failed in Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana. Griffin worries that other states will follow suit with making it harder for ballot initiatives to succeed. “If Ohio can change the law on how a person accesses the ballot initiative, you better believe places like Florida and Georgia and Texas, are also going to try to change their laws to do the same,” she says.

Why Access to Birth Control Is No Substitute for Abortion Rights,Ideas;Krystale E. Littlejohn,Ideas;health,"September 17, 2021 2:57 PM EDT","We have reached a dangerous new place in the battle over bodies and birth control in the United States. After years of attacks, this month Texas effectively made most abortions illegal, when a law took effect—after the Supreme Court declined to block it—that prohibits abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy, and allows private citizens to sue anyone who facilitates one after that. I empathized with the instant expressions of fear and grief that many people committed to abortion rights expressed at the news. But, having studied the history of birth control in the U.S., I also grew worried about what was likely to come next: calls for people who can get pregnant to find a long-term form of birth control. Indeed, when Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed to the Supreme Court, one commentator suggested that focusing on access to long-acting reversible contraceptives for women could be a solution to impending abortion restrictions. Others have championed contraceptive access for women in the wake of bans. These suggestions are part of a larger social approach that often redirects attention to women’s use of contraception when support for abortion comes up. This is familiar for many menstruating people who already bear the burden of preventing pregnancy, especially when facing partners who won’t wear condoms. It’s all a predictable cycle at this point—one in which, as is so often the case, individual American women end up asked to take responsibility for something that is really a society-wide problem. It may seem reasonable to position long-term prescription birth control for birthing bodies as a solution to impending abortion restrictions. But the pill and other forms of long-acting reversible contraception must work alongside abortion, not as an alternative to it. For one thing, there are important reasons why people may choose not to use that form of contraception. While almost half of sexually active American women ages 15-44 who were not seeking pregnancy reported using a reversible prescription method in 2016 (and another 22.4% were sterilized), the reality is that those contraceptives aren’t perfect. Side effects are the leading cause of stopping them because of dissatisfaction. One study of contraceptive preferences among women seeking abortion found that 78% of them deemed it extremely important that the method have no side effects. That’s a tough proposition with prescription methods. Condoms, however, are an accessible alternative that protect users against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, and without side effects—though, with typical use, they are more likely to fail to prevent pregnancy. Perhaps not coincidentally, the condom was the method most commonly used by abortion patients in 2014, according to a 2018 analysis conducted by a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute. When the average American woman’s reproductive life span can last over 30 years, abortion availability is a necessary option. Just as importantly, encouraging prescription birth control use as the solution to the loss of abortion rights is a continued reflection of the feminization of contraceptive responsibility. If there’s anything that I’ve learned from my research on the burdens of preventing pregnancy, it’s that women need both birth control and abortion. The U.S. has a nasty history of choosing birth control to solve issues understood as social problems instead of addressing those issues head on. We need practices that maximize reproductive freedom, not practices that condone uneven responsibility. Though we as individuals can’t change what the Supreme Court has done, we can change the ways that we perpetuate gender inequality in our relationships, whether friendly or intimate. There’s no way to fulfill the promise of the pill without wholeheartedly rejecting suggestions that people who can get pregnant must use prescription birth control to remedy a system that failed them. Promoting abstinence won’t work because many young people who plan to abstain don’t actually do so. Instead, it’s time for partners and others in our society to step up. The data don’t look good on that front. The percentage of men who consistently take contraceptive responsibility via condom use is strikingly low. A 2017 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that only 23.9% of men aged 15-44 used a condom every time they had sexual intercourse in the month before the survey. This pales in comparison to the 69% of women aged 15-44 who reported successfully accomplishing the much harder task of never missing a pill over the same time period. Indeed, the pill is only as effective as it is (91%, in practice) because users commit to taking it every single day despite lack of recognition for their efforts. Partners finally accepting their share of responsibility for preventing pregnancy is only one solution, however. Concerted social action to halt the erosion of reproductive rights is also vital. Texas is not the only state that will try to enact this kind of legislation. Florida has already signaled that it will follow suit and others will too. Rather than uncritically calling for menstruating people to use contraception, those of us worried about giving Americans control over pregnancy should focus on activities that bear directly on improving access to abortion. This includes getting in touch with elected representatives to demand action, contributing to funds for people in need of care, and dedicating time to local reproductive justice organizations that agitate for change on the ground. Each of these activities supports people’s reproductive freedom. Peddling prescription birth control without considering people’s needs does not. To be clear, contraceptive access and affordability are still important issues, and the nation should not ignore people’s desires to have the full spectrum of contraceptive options available to them, including long-term methods. There are many people who want them and they should get them. The challenge is to remember that the fight for reproductive freedom must always center the right to both contraception and abortion—because that’s also what people want. Indeed, that’s what they need. The hallmark of American society is supposed to be maximizing people’s chances for better lives for their families. If we want to see this dream realized, we have to protect abortion. Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/6099174/abortion-rights-birth-control/
Meghan Markle Is Being Drawn Into the Irish Abortion Debate. Here’s Why That’s a Big Deal,Ciara Nugent,World;royals,"July 11, 2018 11:55 AM EDT","An Irish politician has pulled Meghan Markle into Ireland’s abortion debate, potentially conflicting with a centuries-old tradition that royal family members not air their views on political subjects. After the Duchess of Sussex attended a garden party Tuesday night at the British ambassador’s residence in Dublin, Irish Senator Catherine Noone tweeted she had “had a chat” with her about the May referendum that approved scrapping Ireland’s abortion ban, according to the Irish Times. “She watched with interest and was pleased to see the result,” Noone wrote. Noone then appeared to backtrack her statement with another Tweet, saying: “I should say she seemed pleased—she was interested and very measured, not political at all.” Both tweets were later deleted, the Irish Times reports, and Noone told the Irish Independent her words had been “unintentionally misleading.” But Una Mullally, a writer who was also at the party, shared similar comments about a conversation she apparently had with Markle, which she has not deleted: The royal family has maintained political neutrality since the 17th century, when King Charles I lost his head during the English Civil War. There is no law against the royals having political opinions, but since the Queen’s constitutional role is to represent the entire country, the royal family typically refrains from taking sides in political issues to avoid making life difficult for her. The principle has been in the news a few times recently. In the run up to the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union in 2016, when British tabloid The Sun published a front page article with the headline “Queen backs Brexit.” Buckingham Palace dismissed the claims, saying: “The Queen remains politically neutral as she has for 63 years… The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.” Markle, however, is a seasoned activist who before her marriage to Prince Harry had criticized President Donald Trump as “misogynist” and had posted a photo of a Brexit protester. Robert Lacey, royal expert and biographer of the Queen, told the Guardian before the royal wedding that the monarchy’s neutrality protocol could present “an existential problem” for Markle. Neither Buckingham nor Kensington Palace have commented on Noone or Mullally’s claims. Write to Ciara Nugent at ciara.nugent@time.com",https://time.com/5335554/meghan-markle-ireland-abortion/
The Midterms Could Determine Abortion Access in These States,Abigail Abrams;Governors and attorney general races;A renewed focus on state legislatures;Democrats look to ‘not-radical’ mainstream Americans;Looking to state Supreme Courts;Ballot Initiatives,Politics;abortion,"July 1, 2022 6:39 AM EDT","In Wisconsin, the Supreme Court’s decision last Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade had an almost instantaneous effect: as soon as the Justices issued their opinion, medical providers across the state immediately stopped providing abortions.  That’s because Wisconsin is one of several states that already had a law banning abortion on its books, leftover from before Roe established the right to abortion in 1973. In this case, the law dates back to 1849, the year after Wisconsin became a state. While the law has not been used in modern times and Wisconsin’s Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul promised he wouldn’t enforce it, the Supreme Court decision meant that local prosecutors could suddenly choose to act on the law. So providers are treating abortion as effectively illegal until something happens to clarify the situation. The state’s Democratic leaders are now scrambling to find that something.  On Tuesday, Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the viability of the 173-year-old law, and Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, tells TIME he is “looking at every angle” to protect abortion rights in the state. But the politics are challenging. Republicans control Wisconsin’s State Senate and State Assembly, which limits Democrats’ ability to pass any legislation protecting abortion rights, and both Kaul and Evers are up for reelection this year—facing off against Republican opponents who have promised to uphold the 1849 law. With midterms fast approaching, these Wisconsin races are now squarely in the national spotlight, as the country watches to see whether the state will ban abortion.  Wisconsin is not alone. While about half of the states are expected to ban or tightly restrict abortion within months and 20 states and D.C. are moving to protect abortion access, a smaller group are in political limbo. In nine states, the legality of abortion is currently being contested. In at least six—Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina, and Kansas—the outcome of the 2022 midterms could determine the future of abortion rights in the near future.  In most of these nine states, abortion has became a top campaign topic. Democrats are hoping to leverage the issue to energize their base and retain moderate, suburban swing voters, who have been key to their success in recent elections, while Republicans are taking a mixed approach. Some state GOP candidates are doubling down on their support for abortion bans with limited or no exceptions, while others have gone quiet on the controversial topic in the week since the June 24 ruling, focusing instead on the economy or on criticizing Democrats more broadly.  As the full effects of the Supreme Court’s ruling continue to unfold, these state-level races—for governor, attorneys general, state Supreme Court judges, legislative seats, and ballot initiatives—will determine the scope of access in key areas nationwide.  Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania offer perfect case studies. In all three states, Republicans control the state legislatures and Democrats control the governors’ mansion. All three current Democratic governors have vetoed anti-abortion legislation passed by Republican lawmakers in the past, and their presence in office is now the main obstacle to new anti-abortion legislation. Wisconsin’s Gov. Evers is trying a range of tactics to stop his state’s abortion ban. He called a special legislative session earlier this month to repeal the 1849 law. When Republican lawmakers adjourned without taking action, Evers promised to offer clemency to doctors charged under the law, announced he would not appoint state prosecutors who agree to enforce the law, and says he is still considering further executive action.  “We’re going to do everything we can,” Evers tells TIME. “Thank goodness we have some states around us that can help us provide the services that are necessary, but that’s not the answer. That’s a stop gap.” Evers also supports Wisconsin attorney general Kaul’s recent lawsuit, which argues that the 1849 ban should be found unenforceable because Wisconsin has passed more recent abortion laws that supersede it, and because the old law had already fallen into disuse even before Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit faces a difficult battle in the courts, as it will likely work its way to the state Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 4-3 majority. Kaul remains confident his argument will prevail. “We’re right on the law,” he tells TIME, adding that the consequences of the legal battle are steep.  “We’ve had sexual assault nurse examiners reaching out to our office already to ask about things like emergency contraception, questions about whether the law applies in cases of rape or incest,” Kaul says. “We’ve got this 19th century law that people are going to be trying to apply to 21st century medicine. And unsurprisingly, the language in the statute leaves important questions unclear.” Read More: Without Roe v. Wade, U.S. Maternal Mortality Rates May Get Even Worse Both of Kaul’s Republican opponents in the state attorney general race say they would enforce the 1849 law and criticize him for filing suit. “The Attorney General’s job is to uphold the law, not work to overturn it. This is simply another election year stunt to gin up the Democrats’ demoralized base,” former state Rep. Adam Jarchow said in a statement. Eric Toney, the district attorney for Fond du Lac Couny, Wisc., called the move a “political stunt.”  The Wisconsin governors’ race reflects a similar standoff. All of Evers’ potential Republican opponents have said they would enforce the 1849 law. The three who attended a debate this week said they would remove district attorneys who refuse to do so, according to the AP. Wisconsin’s Republican lawmakers have said they may update the 1849 ban next year; Evers says that if he wins reelection, he will veto any such effort.  A recent Marquette University Law School poll showed Evers leading each of his Republican challengers, but the race is expected to be tough. The Marquette poll, which was conducted a week before the Supreme Court’s decision on Roe, found that Republican voters were more enthusiastic about voting than Democrats. But Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster, says that with abortion suddenly a “surging concern,” Democratic voters may be newly motivated. The issue of abortion “was already a very clear distinction in a number of the races,” she says. “If anything, the differences have become more stark, and I think it could massively influence Senate races and gubernatorial races and AG races.” Read More: Democrats Want Biden to Do More on Abortion, But He Faces Tricky Legal Challenges Like Wisconsin, Michigan has an old abortion ban on the books—this one from 1931— that makes abortion a felony with no exceptions for rape or incest. It’s temporarily blocked in state court, due to a lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has also filed a lawsuit against the 91-year-old law, arguing that it violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution. She recently reiterated a call for the state’s Supreme Court to consider her case and decide whether Michigan’s constitution protects the right to abortion.  Whitmer and Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel are also both up for reelection, and like in Wisconsin, their Republican opponents say they would uphold the 1931 ban.  State-level races in Pennsylvania, where abortion is currently legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, are similarly fraught. Pennsylvania has a number of abortion restrictions in place already, and Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has vetoed multiple anti-abortion bills during his tenure.  Wolf cannot run again due to term-limits. The Democratic candidate to replace him, Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro, has said he would also veto any abortion restriction. But his Republican opponent, Doug Mastriano, has said he supports a total abortion ban with no exceptions, including for the life of the pregnant person.  If Mastriano wins in Pennsylvania, the Republican-controlled legislature is all but certain to change the state’s abortion laws, which would be a huge shift for one of the most populous states in the country. And if Michigan and Wisconsin ultimately ban abortion, it would leave the Upper Midwest and Rust Belt states with very little access to the procedure. In some states like Arizona and Georgia, abortion is already likely to be restricted by the time the midterms comes around in November. But the make-up of state legislatures could still determine future changes in the states’ abortion laws. Arizona’s 15-week abortion ban is set to take effect in September. The state also has a 1901 law on the books that criminalizes all abortions unless the pregnant person’s life is in danger. The state’s Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich announced Wednesday he would ask a court to throw out an old injunction blocking the 1901 law, thus allowing it to take effect. Brnovich is up for reelection, and the state’s Republican Gov. Doug Ducey is term limited, so both of those positions could change party hands this year. But Arizona is also a place that Democrats hope to make gains in the state legislature, where Republicans currently hold a slim majority. “The Roe ruling gives us an opportunity to go more on the offensive,” says Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), which helps Democratic candidates for state legislature.  The DLCC hopes to pick up seats in Arizona and Pennsylvania’s House and Senate, as well as in Georgia’s House this year. It will make a play to flip Republican majorities in New Hampshire and Michigan, and in Minnesota’s Senate. The DLCC has also seen an increase in support around abortion, Post says. After the Supreme Court draft leaked in May, the group raised $650,000 in the first 48 hours. In the first 48 hours after the Court’s decision last Friday, it raised nearly four times what it had the previous month at that time. Democratic strategists say the party is pinning its hopes on suburban voters, who they expect to be motivated to go to the polls by the Supreme Court ruling. The Maricopa County suburbs around Phoenix and the Philadelphia suburbs are particularly ripe for Democrats, says David Cohen, co-founder of Forward Majority, a Democratic group launched after Trump was elected to focus on state legislature races.  “This Court has a radical view of the future. And in my experience with swing voters, they’re not radical. That’s the whole deal,” says Cohen. “This perspective is going to be uniformly rejected by people who are mainstream Americans.”  North Carolina, which also has large suburbs around Raleigh, is another state where the legislature could help determine the future of abortion policy. Abortion is legal there up to 20 weeks and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is not up for reelection this year. But Republican lawmakers are aiming to win a veto-proof majority, which would allow them to pass new abortion restrictions. That goal is not out of reach: Republicans currently hold 28 out of 50 seats in the state Senate, just two short of a veto-proof majority, and 69 out of 120 seas in the House, just three short of what they need. In 2023, Virginia’s state legislative elections will be key to abortion access there. Democrats spent millions trying to defeat Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin last year and highlighted his anti-abortion views, but voters still elected him. Now Youngkin has called for at least a 15-week abortion ban in the state, and said he is open to stricter limits. “Virginia will be a huge state of focus for us in 2023. We have to take back the House and hold on to the Democratic majority in the State Senate,” Post says.  The stakes are considerable. Virginia hosts many out-of-state patients coming from the South, where abortion is quickly being banned. Losing that oasis of abortion rights would force many people to travel much longer distances to find appointments.  Read More: What Abortion Providers in Anti-Abortion States Will Do Post-Roe  Partisan majorities could change hands this fall in state Supreme Courts in North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan, according to Bolts, which tracks down-ballot races. In North Carolina, where Democrats currently have a 4-3 majority, a shift could have a significant impact on abortion access. A Democratic-majority would likely strike down state abortion restrictions, while a Republican majority would be more likely to uphold future bans. In Ohio, where Republicans currently hold the majority, Democrats are hoping to shift that balance. Democrats also have to play defense in Michigan and Illinois, where they are at risk of losing their existing state Supreme Court majorities. The DLCC is planning to throw its support behind races where state Supreme Courts could weigh in on redistricting fights and determine a state’s legislative control. The last major way midterms could affect abortion access is through ballot initiatives. The most notable one is in Kansas, where voters will decide on Aug. 2 whether to amend the state constitution to say that it does not support abortion rights. The amendment explicitly gives the Republican-dominated state legislature the authority to pass new abortion restrictions or bans. This would reverse a previous ruling from the state’s majority-Democrat Supreme Court, which said in 2019 that the Kansas constitution protects the right to bodily autonomy. Right now, abortion is legal up to 22 weeks of pregnancy in Kansas, and the state is currently a key outpost of abortion access in the Midwest. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is up for reelection in what is sure to be a challenging fight, and Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature. So without the state constitution’s protection, Kansas is likely to see more abortion restrictions.  Democrats in Michigan are also hoping to put a measure that would codify abortion rights on the ballot in November. Supporters are still collecting signatures for the measure to qualify, but that could be another way that abortion rights advocates seek to protect the procedure in the state. Many of these abortion laws in battleground states won’t be settled until at least November, but the landscape for access is likely to keep changing even before then. More states are expected to ban abortion in the coming weeks, and the Supreme Court’s ruling has kicked off a host of legal battles over laws that are already in place. As more of the country restricts access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care, this year’s elections in the remaining states—where laws are unclear and partisan control is on the ballot—now carry extraordinary weight.

New Corporate Policies on Abortion Travel Spark Worries About Employees’ Privacy,Katie Reilly,Business;abortion,"June 30, 2022 11:07 AM EDT","In the hours after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday, eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion, several major U.S. corporations announced they would cover travel expenses for employees who had to cross state lines to obtain an abortion.  Dick’s Sporting Goods announced it would provide up to $4,000 in travel expense reimbursement to employees who live in states with abortion restrictions, so they “can access the same health care options, regardless of where they live, and choose what is best for them,” CEO Lauren Hobart said in a LinkedIn post. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said it would offer travel expense reimbursements “to the extent permitted by law” for employees who need to access reproductive care in another state. “We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved,” a Meta spokesperson said. Disney told employees that a benefit offering them access to care in other states extends to “family planning (including pregnancy termination),” according to a company spokesperson.  They’re among more than 25 companies—many of them household names—that announced such policies in the weeks leading up to the Supreme Court’s decision or after the official ruling on Friday.  But as the dust settles in a post-Roe America, companies’ involvement in their employees’ abortion care also raises a host of new legal and privacy issues. And abortion-rights advocates are frustrated that people who become pregnant in states where abortion is illegal or heavily restricted will have to depend on their employer as they navigate complex health decisions.  “Certainly women who have to access care are not overjoyed that this is where we find ourselves. This is a policy failure. This is a systemic failure,” says Erika Seth Davies, CEO of Rhia Ventures, a fund focused on reproductive health care that has encouraged companies to improve access to abortion. “And now we’re having to look to the private sector to just see to it that people can get what they need, and that’s a very precarious position.”  Kayte Spector-Bagdady, a lawyer and bioethicist at the University of Michigan who focuses on health data, says she appreciates companies that are making well-intentioned efforts to support employees’ access to abortion. But there’s still a lot of uncertainty regarding what these policies will actually mean for employees; whether the benefits will be managed by health insurance providers, supervisors, or a human resources department; whether employees can use their health savings accounts for abortion care; and how employees’ privacy will be protected. Read More: What Abortion Providers in Anti-Abortion States Will Do Post-Roe “People think of health information as being protected because it’s about your health, and that’s not accurate,” she says. “I have a lot of concerns regarding the legality of the way they arrange this funding for travel, as well as the kinds of privacy protections that are in existence to protect the kind of information being generated in these relationships.” She acknowledges that company reimbursements are a valuable resource for people who could otherwise not afford to travel for abortion care, but sharing that kind of personal information with an employer poses additional challenges. “It’s a terrible position to put people into,” she says, referring to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.  The end of Roe v. Wade has given rise to new concerns about how sensitive abortion data—including period-tracking apps or internet searches for abortion-inducing medication—could be exploited amid efforts to criminalize abortion and potentially penalize people who have an abortion and those who help them. Read More: Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers Are Collecting Troves of Data That Could Be Weaponized Against Women So far, no states have criminal penalties for people who seek abortions—but there are signs that such laws may be coming. Texas and Oklahoma passed laws allowing private citizens to sue abortion providers and others who help someone get an abortion. It’s not yet clear if companies paying for employees’ abortion-related travel could also be liable, though a group of Republican lawmakers in Texas pledged to introduce legislation that would stop corporations from doing business in the state if they pay for abortions in other states, the Texas Tribune reported. And earlier this year, a Republican in Louisiana introduced a bill that would classify abortion as homicide and would allow prosecutors to criminally charge abortion patients. The bill was withdrawn after criticism, but it alarmed abortion-rights advocates.  Roughly half of Americans receive health insurance through an employer—and experts note that employers have previously had access to other sensitive health information for their employees, which is often protected by federal health data privacy laws. But it’s not yet clear how every company will handle their new abortion-access policies—especially if threatened with legal or financial penalties. “When we’re talking about telling your employer that you’re going to get an abortion and the employer giving you cash to support that decision, that is far outside any scope of protected health data,” Spector-Bagdady says. “And also, I fear, opens women up to additional layers of potential discrimination.” She says companies need to prioritize data privacy to protect employee information as much as possible, while they roll out new policies supporting abortion access, “both to protect the company itself, but also in some states, the woman from criminal liability.” Read More: What to Know About Abortion Pills Post-Roe So far, no states have passed laws restricting patients’ ability to travel out of state for an abortion. But reproductive rights advocates worry that anti-abortion lawmakers could also pursue that in the future. “Employers should make sure that in providing these payment systems, they are standing in the shoes of the employee for a moment and thinking, ‘You know, what protections are necessary to ensure that employees can be comfortable taking advantage of them?’” says Liz Brown, an associate professor of business law and ethics at Bentley University in Massachusetts.  One of the most important protections, she says, is confidentiality, “so that an employee doesn’t have to, for example, ask their boss or have their boss know.” With Roe overturned, 26 states are likely to ban abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advocates for abortion rights. And low-income people and women of color are likely to be most heavily affected by lack of access to abortion, further exacerbating racial disparities in healthcare.  Brown says it’s important for companies to keep that in mind and extend abortion-access policies to all front-line retail or service workers, not just employees in corporate offices. “I would strongly encourage employers to broaden access to this particular benefit as much as possible, considering the racial imbalance in the population that’s going to be most affected by these restrictions,” Brown says. So far, many large retailers have remained silent on this issue. That’s also why United for Respect, a nonprofit advocating for retail workers, has called on Walmart to follow other companies and enact a similar abortion-access policy for retail employees. (A spokesperson for Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) “With a heavy concentration of retail locations in the south—where several states have abortion trigger laws in place—Walmart has an opportunity and a duty to step up and ensure its associates are supported in decisions they make about their own bodies,” Bianca Agustin, corporate accountability director at United for Respect, said in a statement.  “As the largest private employer in the nation, Walmart executives can set the standard for other companies by supporting their associates and providing adequate maternity leave, paid sick leave, and covering the cost of expenses for associates who need to travel across state lines to access abortion services.” And many advocates for reproductive rights have called on companies to do more than offer health benefits, but to stop donating to legislators who have supported anti-abortion legislation. “We should have never gotten here—to this point where corporations are reactively—and falsely —committing to fighting for abortion access,” UltraViolet, an organization that advocates for gender equality and reproductive health, said in a tweet. The group says that corporations have donated more than $195 million collectively to anti-abortion lawmakers since 2020. Davies thinks that companies’ abortion-access policies represent a step in the right direction, but it’s only a start. She would like to see more companies lobby Congress for federal policies that support reproductive health care and protect abortion access.  “We don’t have to be in this position of having to, again, look to the private sector for this coverage and this access,” she says. “How are companies leveraging their political spending? Is it in alignment with the values that they espouse? And if it’s not, then it should be.” Write to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com",https://time.com/6192361/companies-abortion-travel-paying-privacy/
"Abortion Complication Rates Are ‘Lower Than That For Wisdom Tooth Extraction’, Study Says",Mandy Oaklander,Health;Healthcare,"December 9, 2014 4:15 PM EST","People who get abortions are less likely to have complications than people who have their wisdom teeth removed, finds a new study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. Researchers at University of California San Francisco wanted to understand, from a medical standpoint, the safety of abortions, so they analyzed 54,911 of them performed from 2009-2010 on women, as well as the health care services the women received in the six weeks following the abortion. Of those abortions, only 2.1% resulted in a complication—considerably lower than the 7% complication rate for wisdom tooth removal and 9% rate for tonsillectomy, the authors point out. Major complications that required hospitalization, surgery or a blood transfusion occurred in only 0.23% of the women in the study—126 cases. That’s lower than the rate of major complications for colonoscopy, says study author Ushma Upadhyay, PhD, an assistant professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at UCSF. Fewer than 2% of abortions resulted in a minor complication. Medication abortions—a sequence often called the “abortion pill“—had the highest rate of complications at 5.2%, “the vast majority of which were minor and expected,” the study authors write. Those minor complications often mean they come back for another dose to complete the abortion. According to the study, 23 states now have regulations that an abortion clinic must meet standards for ambulatory surgical centers. 8 states have hospital transfer agreement requirements, and 13 require hospital admitting privileges. The typical explanation for these regulations has been that safety is a factor, but the researchers hope to remove that as an issue. “Across the country, there are a record number of restrictions against abortions,” Upadhyay says. “I think basically that they’re supported by the public because they seem like they are needed”—but abortion providers sometimes can’t get admitting privileges, so abortion clinics often end up being shuttered, she says. “I hope [the data] clarifies that abortion is a safe procedure, and that it’s not this scary procedure it can be made out to be in the media or public policy,” Write to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com",https://time.com/3623572/abortion-safe-complications/
Meet the Pharmacist Expanding Access to Abortion Pills Across the U.S.,Abigail Abrams;New FDA regulations transformed access to abortion pills;Preparing for the next shoe to drop,Politics;abortion,"June 13, 2022 7:00 AM EDT","On a recent spring evening, Jessica Nouhavandi found herself at the National Abortion Federation conference, surrounded by abortion providers talking excitedly about one key question: how to expand access to medication abortion in more states.  Nouhavandi’s company, Honeybee Health, is a crucial part of that goal. Barely four years old, the online, California-based mail-order pharmacy start-up is already one of the nation’s leading distributors of abortion pills. At some point, one of Nouhavandi’s fellow conference attendees asked if she could have imagined this moment just a few years ago. Nouhavandi remembers shaking her head in disbelief, her voice growing stronger with an unexpected surge of pride. “It was a very emotional moment to think of how far we’ve come in such a short amount of time,” she says.  A few days later, Nouhavandi got emotional for a different reason. On May 2, Politico published a draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. Most abortion providers had been expecting the outcome, but the leaked draft confirmed their worst fears and focused the country’s attention on the stakes of the fight that abortion-rights advocates like Nouhavandi have been waging.  If the Supreme Court does overturn Roe, about half of U.S. states are expected to ban or severely restrict abortion. Advocates see medication abortion—a regimen of two drugs that can now be mailed directly to patients’ homes or to another location of their choosing—as key to the future of abortion access in the United States. Nouhavandi, 37, is leading that fight. Read More: Inside the Effort to Promote Abortion Pills For a Post-Roe America.  Nouhavandi is co-founder and lead pharmacist at Honeybee Health, the first mail-order pharmacy in the U.S. to ship abortion pills. It’s now one of just two American pharmacy companies doing so—six months after the FDA permanently removed a requirement that the pills be dispensed in person and more than a year after the agency said it would stop enforcing the regulation during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Honeybee now operates in 48 states and territories, and works with a wide range of providers, from independent abortion clinics to most of the major abortion telehealth startups, to primary care practices starting to prescribe abortion pills for the first time.  With her signature collection of colorful glasses and broad smile, Nouhavandi has become a familiar face and critical resource as providers and activists scramble to find creative ways to educate patients and clinicians about abortion pills before the Supreme Court’s final ruling, which is expected at some point in June or early July. “Every person should have the choice to do what’s best for them. And that’s not always the case with health care in our country,” Nouhavandi says. “But as long as there are still states that are protecting the right to abortion … we’ll continue to find ways to support people, especially those that need it most.” When Nouhavandi and her co-founder Peter Wang launched Honeybee Health in 2018, abortion access was not particularly on their minds. They’d been operating a regular community pharmacy outside Los Angeles and thought a new, online, mail-order pharmacy could help lower prescription drug costs by offering generic medications from wholesalers without going through health insurance.  But in 2020, when coronavirus precautions made people want to stay home and orders from Republican state officials temporarily closed some abortion clinics, providers began exploring how they might get abortion pills to patients outside of a traditional office setting. While other medical appointments largely moved online, specific requirements for mifepristone, one of the two drugs involved in medication abortion, prevented clinics from using telehealth appointments or mailing the medication. So medical groups sued the FDA, asking the agency to allow them to mail the pills during the ongoing public health emergency. In July 2020, a federal district court judge in Maryland agreed, and temporarily suspended the in-person dispensing requirement, saying providers could offer telemedicine appointments and then mail the pills to their patients. (The Supreme Court later reinstated the regulation after a challenge from the Trump Administration, but the FDA said it would stop enforcing it last spring and then permanently removed it in December.) The ruling was transformative for abortion-rights advocates. But for the first several weeks after the judge’s decision, providers weren’t sure how using a pharmacy would work since the FDA still imposed special requirements on the drugs, says Elisa Wells, co-founder and co-director of Plan C, which aims to increase information about abortion pills and advises many abortion providers.  “Everyone was working from home, so the providers we had been working with were getting [the pills] shipped to their homes, which were then their offices,” Wells says. “They were packaging them up themselves, and they were figuring out how to print labels. All this stuff that a pharmacy would normally do for you.” One day, Wells was on a webinar where an ACLU lawyer said the court ruling should allow providers to contract with online pharmacies. A number of providers had already been in touch with Nouhavandi, and they started more serious discussions about how Honeybee could help. “It wasn’t even a question,” says Nouhavandi, who has long had an interest in reproductive health and access. “It was yes, absolutely, let’s figure out how to do this.” Honeybee had to figure out every detail from scratch: how they would receive prescriptions, what directions to patients should say, what information pharmacists needed if patients called Honeybee with questions instead of their own clinician. Nouhavandi brought in abortion providers to help educate her staff.  The process wasn’t easy. For starters, few people knew about abortion pills. When Nouhavandi texted her group chat of college-educated friends that she was starting this new project, her peers said they’d never heard of medication abortion. Even in pharmacy school, Nouhavandi says, “it’s just not something that is extensively taught. So pharmacists must go out of their way to get up to speed.” This lack of information was due in part to the restrictions that the FDA has put on mifepristone since the drug was first approved in 2000. Most notably, the FDA required it to be dispensed in a clinic, doctor’s office or hospital. Providers are also required to get specially certified to prescribe the medication, must counsel patients on the risks, and then have the patient sign a form confirming they’ve been told that same information. These steps, while each relatively small, collectively created regulatory barriers that providers argue are not medically necessary and do not exist for even some highly addictive drugs.  Read More: Republican States Crack Down on Access To Abortion Pills As Supreme Court Decision Looms. Abortion-rights activists, doctors, and researchers have spent years amassing data that shows medication abortion is safe and pushing for the government to treat it like other drugs with similarly low risks. They applauded the FDA’s December decision to remove the in-person dispensing requirement, but many were frustrated the agency didn’t go further. The FDA left the other requirements in place and added a new one: that pharmacies like Honeybee have to get certified to distribute mifepristone.  The FDA told TIME that after reviewing data and published literature about mifepristone, it concluded it was safe to get rid of the in-person requirement “provided all the other requirements of the [drug safety program] are met, and pharmacy certification is added.” But the new certification requirement “came out of left field,” Nouhavandi says. One major wrinkle was that no certification process currently exists. Mifepristone’s manufacturers are working with the FDA to get a procedure approved, but that process could still take months.  In the meantime, the FDA has still paused enforcement of the in-person dispensing requirement during the pandemic public health emergency, and is allowing mail-order pharmacies to ship the pills as Honeybee has been doing. Amidst this confusing regulatory landscape, other larger pharmacies have not jumped to enter the market. TIME asked the five biggest pharmacy companies in the U.S. about whether they planned to seek certification, and most did not respond or declined to comment. CVS told TIME that retail pharmacies are not currently allowed to distribute mifepristone, and said it would review any changes from the FDA in the future.  Nouhavandi says she expects that some of the larger companies are “probably not wanting to touch this subject.” That’s been a boon to Honeybee’s business, which increased its revenue from just $27,000 when it launched near the end of 2018 to more than $14 million in 2021. But Nouhavandi says that as she has embraced distributing medication abortion, it’s been “disappointing” to see hesitancy from some investors. While her board and current investors are very supportive, she says, others she meets with—including people who say they support women’s health—are “skittish” about helping startups that work on abortion. And while Honeybee Health is based in a state that has moved to protect abortion rights, not all companies are in the same position. “We’re both supportive and outspoken regarding abortion rights,” Nouhavandi says. “But not all of our pharmacist colleagues have that level of support in their local environment.” Despite the regulatory hurdles and the looming ruling on Roe, Nouhavandi feels energized. “I’ve never been more focused and excited as I have been in the last year,” she says. Which is good, because these days the business is crazier than ever. Since the Supreme Court leak, Honeybee has seen an 80% increase in demand for abortion pills, which now make up roughly 30% of the company’s orders. Honeybee has grown to nearly 75 employees. A self-described coffee fiend who was never very good at work-life balance, Nouhavandi now regularly works 14-hour days packed with six to 10 meetings—often with investors, regulatory advisors, and lawyers. When we spoke, she was working out of a coworking space in Las Vegas, where she’d gone to consult with a provider interested in using telehealth to prescribe abortion pills. If Roe is overturned, not that much will change for Nouhavandi. Already 19 states effectively outlaw mailing abortion pills, and Honeybee only ships to states where doing so is legal. “We have to stay within the law to ensure that we can continue to doing this work. Because this is the first time pharmacy is doing this, the scrutiny on us is even more,” she says.  Some abortion telehealth companies and clinics work with patients who drive from states where abortion pills are restricted to a state with more permissive laws, in order to take their telehealth appointment and pick up pills. Others know that patients might give pills to a friend in a state with more restrictions once they secure the medication themselves. Honeybee can’t control what happens to the medication once it’s in patients’ hands, but Nouhavandi emphasizes that the company is determined to abide by local laws. “We understand that we’re part of a bigger fight,” she says. “And so we can’t just go rogue and push the boundaries, because it really jeopardizes the whole movement.” As the potential end of Roe draws closer, Honeybee has put more information about medication abortion up on its website, and Nouhavandi says that she knows disseminating accurate information, and countering misinformation, will be one of the major fights ahead. Right now, she’s trying to help more providers get certified to prescribe mifepristone, while positioning her own company to grow if demand requires it. “If that volume increases significantly, we’re totally prepared,” she says.  Honeybee Health is not a panacea, Nouhavandi acknowledges. Every patient can’t use medication abortion, and Honeybee Health can only mail the pills to states in which abortion is legal. But by working to make the pills widely available, the company can help offload demand, allowing the shrinking number of clinics to handle the expected influx of people traveling to get procedural abortions across state lines.  And that, Nouhavandi says, will remain her focus even in a post-Roe America. The goal, she says, is to make it “as easy as possible for patients and providers alike to get access” to abortion—now and in the future.

Florida’s Six-Week Abortion Ban Would Limit Access Across the South,Haley Weiss,Health;abortion,"April 19, 2023 4:14 PM EDT","In a move that could reshape access to abortions for pregnant people in Florida and the surrounding region, Gov. Ron DeSantis recently signed a ban on abortions after just six weeks of pregnancy. Although the state is still awaiting a verdict from the Florida Supreme Court on whether a 15-week ban signed into law last July can continue to be upheld, this even stricter bill is now waiting in the wings to replace it.  That move would be a sharp right turn for the state. Until recently, Florida has, for the most part, been an easier place to receive abortion care than most states that surround it. Before the 15-week ban passed in July 2022, Floridians could get abortions until 24 weeks of pregnancy (though they were—and still are—subject to a number of barriers to care, including a mandatory 24-hour waiting period enacted one year ago). Following the repeal of Roe v. Wade, Florida saw the largest 6-month increase in legal abortions for any state. People who had to travel across state lines for care likely accounted for about 5% of those abortions; the nearby states Georgia and South Carolina effectively have six-week bans, while Alabama and Mississippi both ban abortion outright. A six-week ban would more closely align Florida with its neighbors and effectively ban most abortions in the state, says Dr. Shelly Tien, a maternal fetal medicine physician who provides abortion care at Planned Parenthood clinics across Florida. Many people aren’t even aware they’re pregnant by six weeks; a two-week delay in a menstrual cycle is fairly normal and could happen for a “multitude of health reasons,” says Tien. “These bans make it impossible as health-care providers to provide the care that we were trained to provide to our communities.” Read More: Abortion Rights Benefit People Who Want Kids, Too If and when the six-week ban takes effect, people who might otherwise have sought care in Florida will end up having to travel many states away to get an abortion. The resulting influx of patients could further strain already overburdened care systems in those states. Florida is “one of the few remaining options for women who are already desperate not to be pregnant and already traveling really far,” says Tien. But not, it appears, for long. Florida’s new six-week ban will erode access even further by allocating $25 million from the state toward funding anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers, which are known to offer misinformation aimed at dissuading those seeking abortion from going through with it. Funding these types of facilities can make some vulnerable people less inclined to get proper care at legitimate clinics, says Tien. “These centers may not be providing scientific, evidence-based information for patients, which is our primary responsibility as health-care providers.” The bill allows exceptions for rape, incest, medical emergencies, and fatal fetal abnormalities at varying cutoff points, but these aren’t easily categorized in practice. “There are many complex and nuanced health situations that arise that don’t fit these narrow exceptions,” says Tien. “As physicians and health-care providers, it is our primary pressing professional and ethical duty that we are proactive in offering interventions before patients get too sick.” Because of this, she says, “we see health-care providers placed in a difficult position,” afraid that the counseling and interventions upheld by the best medical standards won’t be respected in a court of law. Because of this, practitioners say, strict bans such as Florida’s often end up contradicting politicians’ stated intentions to protect and provide for expectant and new mothers. “If we truly wanted to shift the focus to supporting patients and their families, then we should be providing services for prenatal care, expanding Medicaid and insurance coverage for pregnant women who don’t have that care, supporting education and teaching for nurses and health care providers, and supporting birthing hospitals so that they can keep their labor and deliveries in their NICUs open,” says Tien.

Abortion Pill Use Spikes As States and Courts Restrict Access,Abigail Abrams,Politics,"February 25, 2022 4:01 PM EST","Abortion pills are now the most common method of ending a pregnancy in the United States for the first time since they were approved more than two decades ago, according to preliminary data released Thursday. The surge in popularity comes as Republican-controlled states are increasingly restricting surgical abortions and the Supreme Court is weighing a case that could result in a significant blow to abortion access, or overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that established a constitutional right to abortion.  The report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research center that supports abortion rights, found that medication abortion—a two-pill regimen approved in the U.S. to end pregnancies up to 10 weeks—accounted for 54% of abortions in 2020. This marks a significant jump from 39% in 2017, the last time the report was released.  “People really like that [medication abortion] removes a lot of the barriers,” says Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group at the University of California, San Francisco. “They don’t have to take time off from work and especially for people living on low incomes and people of color, it makes life a lot easier and they’re able to integrate this healthcare into their lives.” But the increasing availability of abortion pills has put the method in the crosshairs of a national battle over abortion. As progressive groups and the Biden Administration have sought to make them more accessible, Republicans and conservative activists around the country are adding new restrictions. Nineteen states currently ban telemedicine visits for medication abortion, and at least 16 state legislatures have introduced bills this year to ban or limit medication abortion in various ways. Read More: States Push New Abortion Bans, Preempting the Supreme Court Medication abortion had been growing in popularity before the coronavirus pandemic, but COVID-19 likely made the method more appealing as people sought to minimize medical procedures and trips to health facilities.  In 2020, medical associations sued the federal government to lift the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) requirement that the first abortion pill, mifepristone, be dispensed to patients in person. The FDA temporarily removed that requirement last spring and, in December, the Biden Administration made the move permanent. The FDA’s decision allows patients to receive the abortion pills by mail after they have a telemedicine appointment with a provider. Abortion opponents fear that even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, people will be able to end their pregnancies using abortion pills. Anti-abortion groups like Susan B. Anthony List and Students for Life of America have made limiting the pills a priority, and are encouraging states to restrict them particularly in light of the FDA’s decision.  “We are trying to really start educating our movement and Christians broadly across the country about what these pills really are, and how just very dangerous they are to women,” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, told TIME earlier this year. Doctors and abortion rights advocates stress that years of research has shown medication abortion is safe. “We did an analysis of 11,000 medication abortions in California and found that the rate of major adverse events was less than a third of 1%. So it is extremely safe,” Upadhyay says. “We also know that it’s safer than Tylenol and safer than Viagra.” Read More: Mississippi’s Last Abortion Clinic Faces the Supreme Court The fight over medication abortion is already playing out in Texas, where nearly all abortions after six weeks have been banned since Sept. 1. Texas also prohibits telemedicine visits for medication abortion and medication abortions after seven weeks, before the FDA’s approved cutoff.  Even with these restrictions, Texas has seen a spike in people ordering abortion pills online since its six-week ban went into effect, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Friday. Orders for the pills from the international nonprofit Aid Access increased 1,180% in the first week after the Texas law took effect, going from nearly 11 purchases per day to more than 137 per day. While purchases leveled off over the next three months, the researchers found they stayed 174% higher during that time than before the law was in place.  This is exactly what abortion opponents want to avoid. “We’ve seen even in Texas as the Heartbeat Bill is still in effect, we see that the pills are going out the back door,” Sue Liebel, state policy director at SBA List, said in January. “So this is an issue.” For the Texas researchers, this is evidence that the use of medication abortion is not going away. “We know that putting abortion restrictions in place does not mean the need for abortion just goes away. It’s still there. And people will look oftentimes for other ways to get the care they need,” says Abigail Aiken, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the lead author of the study.  Aid Access can mail people abortion pills even in states like Texas that have outlawed sending the pills by mail because it is based outside the U.S. Aiken says that people are also increasingly turning to other online retailers to buy abortion pills on their own from services without doctor supervision, a process known as self-managed abortion, which her research has found can be safe and effective.  Texas’s Health and Human Services agency recently reported that abortions in the state dropped 51% in September 2021 when the state’s six-week law went into effect. Those numbers, and the increase in medication abortion reported by Guttmacher, do not include abortion pills taken outside the formal health care system, so the total number of people using abortion pills in the U.S. is likely higher than reported, experts say, and only going to increase. “I think as we see more restrictions,” Aiken says, “we’ll see self managed abortion play an increasingly important role in providing an option for people.”  Write to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6151460/abortion-pill-roe-wade-access/
Pro-Life Congressman Explains Why He’s Now Pro-Choice,Maya Rhodan,Politics;Congress,"January 28, 2015 2:31 PM EST","Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan has officially changed his stance on abortion—from pro-life to pro-choice. Ryan, who has been serving in the House of Representatives since 2003, says he has self-identified as pro-life for the majority of his political career, having being raised Catholic. But the Ohio representative wrote in an op-ed published by the Akron Beacon Journal on Wednesday that his conversations with women across Ohio and the country about the myriad reasons that lead them to have an abortion led him to change his mind. “These women gave me a better understanding of how complex and difficult certain situations can become. And while there are people of good conscience on both sides of this argument, one thing has become abundantly clear to me: the heavy hand of government must not make this decision for women and families,” Ryan writes. Ryan goes on to say, “each and every American deserves the right to deal with these difficult situations in consultation with their families, close friends, or religious advisers.” The op-ed comes nearly a week after some Republican women in the House of Representatives stopped a vote on an anti-abortion bill because of language included in it that would have but restrictions on women seeking to end pregnancies that resulted from rape. A vote on that bill was scheduled for Jan. 22, the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, Roe v. Wade. As recently as 2009 Ryan trumpeted his record on pro-life legislation, while promoting a bill that would reduce unintended pregnancies in an effort to find common ground among pro-choice and pro-life communities. In 2013, Ryan opposed a ban on abortions after 20-weeks, saying it was “dangerous in its implications.” Douglas Johnson of National Right to Life Committee, a leading pro-life organization, calls Ryan a “pro-life impersonator” and notes he’s never consistently voted pro-life—according to the organization’s scorecard, he’s voted “against” them more times than he has for them throughout his time in office. “This is dog-bites-man from my perspective,” Johnson tells TIME. Yet given his past self-identification as pro-life, Ryan’s stance is now abundantly clear. “I am a 41-year-old father and husband whose feelings on this issue have changed. I have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator, and I am not afraid to say that my position has evolved as my experiences have broadened, deepened and become more personal. And while I have deep respect for people on both sides of this conversation, I would be abandoning my own conscience and judgment if I held a position that I no longer believed appropriate,” he writes Women’s health organization Planned Parenthood has lauded Ryan’s pivot on the divisive issue saying in a statement that they look forward to working with him. “Congressman Ryan joins the overwhelming majority of Americans who want women to have access to abortion and don’t want politicians to interfere in women’s personal medical decisions,” said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement.

Trump’s Anti-Abortion and Anti-Immigration Policies May Share a Goal,Ideas;Reva Siegel;Duncan Hosie,Ideas;politics,"December 13, 2019 4:35 PM EST","As a candidate, Donald Trump promised to restrict abortion and immigration. As President, he has delivered on these promises. He has stacked the federal bench with conservative judges hostile to reproductive rights. He has emboldened states to pass strict abortion laws. Simultaneously, he has initiated sweeping changes to American immigration law and demonized immigrants. In the abstract, these two issues—restricting abortion and immigration—appear separate and disjointed. On this account, those who oppose abortion are worried about life-taking and those who oppose immigration are worried about job-taking. But the President has a growing number of supporters who understand opposition to abortion and immigration as intertwined—as means of preserving a white, Christian America. And the Trump Administration is taking concrete steps to encourage this ideational fusion. Consider the events of last week. The Trump Administration dispatched officials to the International Conference on Family Policy. There, Trump officials lauded Hungary’s “procreation, not immigration” policies, which oppose refugees and immigration and instead subsidize traditional, nuclear Hungarian families to have more children. These policies coincided with a new Hungarian constitution, which protects fetal life from the moment of conception. Joe Grogan, an assistant to the president and director of the Domestic Policy Council, praised Hungary for the “courage and creativity” of these policies and said the Trump Administration was “inspired” and came “in support and solidarity.” He took the occasion of celebrating Hungary’s fertility-boosting programs to affirm the Administration’s opposition to abortion. Hungary’s “procreation, not immigration” policies have their roots in “replacement theory.” This doctrine holds that white women are not producing enough babies and Christian, western civilizations will be “replaced” through the twin forces of falling birth rates and increasing immigration. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, for example, has argued that “there are political forces in Europe who want a replacement of population” and has vowed to fight those who want “an exchange of populations, to replace the population of Europeans with others.” Orbán was once a rare world leader to explicitly engage in this demographic discourse. Not anymore. Many were shocked when Trump defended the white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville while chanting “you will not replace us.” Fewer commented on his remarks this year, when Trump told the U.N. that the “free world must embrace its national foundations … not attempt to erase them or replace them.” As President, Trump has ominously tweeted that “we don’t want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!” and denounced an ostensible immigrant “invasion” of America. And he’s appointed aides on the far-right of immigration policy like former chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Stephen Miller, as well as aides who have dabbled in replacement talk. Miller, the President’s chief immigration adviser, has recommended articles on white nationalist websites at the forefront of disseminating “replacement theory.” The International Conference on Family Policy was not a one-off. In March, White House officials, Republican members of Congress and evangelical leaders attended the “Make Families Great Again” conference at the Library of Congress. Hosted by the Hungarian Embassy, the event focused on Hungary’s policy response to the decline of its birth rate below replacement level and promoted Orbán’s “Family Protection Action Plan.” Speakers at the event exhorted women to have more babies. Prominent conference attendees included Valerie Huber, a U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) official and prominent advocate of abstinence-only education; Mercedes Schlapp, then White House Director of Strategic Communications; Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to President Trump; and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council. Also in March, Trump’s HHS awarded $5.1 million in Title X family-planning funds to Obria, an organization that subsidizes crisis pregnancy centers, refuses to provide or refer for abortion or contraception and aims to be the pro-life “led by God” alternative to Planned Parenthood. In 2015, Obria’s founder and current chief executive explained, “When [Europe’s] nations accepted contraception and abortion, they stopped replacing their population. Christianity began to die out. And, with Europeans having no children, immigrant Muslims came in to replace them, and now the culture of Europe is changing.” She warned that America is “on the same track as Europe” and that “[i]n only two of the past 40 years have we replaced our population.” The New York Times has reported on regulatory changes initiated by HHS that “make it easier to provide money to faith-based organizations like Obria.” Mother Jones suggested that “Obria may represent the future of the Title X program” under Trump. Most troubling, certain Republican members of Congress seem to be embracing this fusion of abortion and immigration, which suggests this ideational framework will outlast the Administration. Congressman Andy Harris (R-Md.), a staunch pro-life advocate, told the International Conference on Family Policy that “civilizations actually can become extinct” without “an adequate replacement.” He warned that the American birth rate has fallen “below replacement birth rate” and called for preserving the American “culture of civilization” through more births, not immigration. He added that the United States should craft policies that recognize the benefits of the “presence of a man in the family.” Congressman Steve King (R-Iowa) believes, in his words, that “cultural suicide by demographic transformation must end.” He told a right-wing Austrian website that “if we continue to abort our babies and import a replacement for them in the form of young violent men, we are supplanting our culture, our civilization.” Replacement theory, of course, is not new in American political culture and history. The doctors who led the Civil War-era campaign to enact laws criminalizing abortion warned that “native born” Americans were not bearing children at the same rate as immigrant families. Dr. Horatio Storer, the leader of the physicians’ campaign to criminalize abortion, asked whether America would “be filled by our own children or by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their loins depends the future destiny of the nation.” Now, about 150 years later, the Administration is yoking “family values” to openly nationalist and racialized demographic anxieties that Trump himself invokes – a move that seems to appeal to his loyalists. We observe, for instance, that white evangelical Protestants are among the strongest supporters of Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. While some pro-life organizations joined religious leaders in opposing the Administration’s treatment of immigrant children at the border, other pro-life organizations were conspicuously silent, or even supported, Trump’s family-separation policies. For some growing number of Americans, two seemingly disparate goals of restricting abortion and immigration are beginning to align as serving convergent ends. President Trump’s critics have described the “Make America Great Again” movement as unprincipled and unsystematic—a transactional vehicle for winning spoils, from conservative judges to tax cuts to deregulation. Yet we are witnessing the emergence of a disturbing internal logic in Trump’s agenda. Trump, of course, has not yet built a wall between the United States and Mexico. But he’s helped build something far more durable: a bridge between abortion and immigration restriction that is infusing pro-family advocates with the energies of nationalism. These advocates talk about protecting life—but care whose life is saved. Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/5748503/trump-abortion-immigration-replacement-theory/
"After Supreme Court Leak, Republican-led States Ready Legislation to Ban or Criminalize Abortion",Abigail Abrams;Anti-abortion state lawmakers seize the moment;Resurrecting pre-Roe abortion bans,Politics,"May 6, 2022 2:27 PM EDT","Less than 48 hours after a leaked draft decision showing the Supreme Court set to overturn Roe v. Wade, Republicans in the Louisiana House of Representatives advanced a bill classifying abortion as homicide from “the moment of fertilization” and allowing prosecutors to charge both patients and providers with murder. “We cannot wait on the Supreme Court,” State Rep. Danny McCormick, the bill’s sponsor, said during a committee hearing on Wednesday.  Louisiana already has a trigger law in place that would let the state immediately ban abortion if the final Supreme Court decision does in fact overturn Roe v. Wade. But Brian Gunter, a pastor who worked with McCormick on the bill, characterized the complete ban as “woefully insufficient.” Financial penalties for violating the law were not enough, he explained. “No compromises, no more waiting,” he said at the hearing. The bill passed out of the committee with a 7-2 vote.  While the Louisiana bill is more extreme than most other states’ proposed legislation, it exemplifies a larger trend sweeping Republican-led state legislatures nationwide. Emboldened by the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion, many states are scrambling to shore up their anti-abortion legislation or preparing to revive old laws that impose significant penalties. Consequences include lengthy prison sentences for providers, suspending physicians’ medical licenses, and sizable fines on people who perform abortions. Even as national Republicans emphasize that fears of prosecutions are overblown, state lawmakers are readying laws that will not just ban abortion, but criminalize it.  “If the draft opinion that we saw earlier this week is anything close to the actual opinion, it’s going to give state legislatures carte blanche to restrict, ban abortion in all sorts of different ways,” says David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University’s Kline School of Law. “It says ‘Get prepared with the most extreme bills possible. And when we give you the go ahead, hit the ground running.’” Conservative state lawmakers’ eagerness to act aggressively stands in contrast to most Republican in the U.S. Congress, who largely avoided talking about the substance of the Supreme Court draft this week, in favor of focusing on the leak. Some Republican governors also pumped the brakes, saying they wanted to see how the Supreme Court ultimately rules before calling special legislative sessions.  But it’s clear that as soon as the Supreme Court hands down its final decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case over a Mississippi abortion law challenging Roe, that anti-abortion state legislators will be ready. Conservative-led states had already introduced more than 500 abortion restrictions from Jan. 1 through April 15 of this year. If the Supreme Court does overturn Roe, about half of the states in the U.S. will likely quickly ban abortion. That includes 13 states that have trigger laws, which would make abortion illegal soon after the decision comes down. But some of these laws require different actions to make them take effect, and abortion opponents are using this time before the final decision to get their strategies and paperwork in place. Louisiana lawmakers and advocates who spoke in favor of the bill making abortion a homicide this week appeared emotional at the prospect of successfully implementing their goal. Critics said the bill was unconstitutional and warned about its unintended consequences. The way the bill is written, experts believe in vitro fertilization and emergency contraception pills could also trigger criminal charges. The Louisiana bill differs from other states’ proposed legislation because it appears to allow the prosecution of the pregnant person as well, not just abortion providers. That’s something abortion opponents have avoided in recent years, but last month a Texas woman, Lizelle Herrera, was arrested over an alleged self-induced abortion, and if Roe is overturned, experts predict more states will explore additional types of penalties.  In Arkansas, the state’s trigger ban will make abortion a felony except to save the life of the mother. To take effect, the state’s attorney general must certify that the Supreme Court has in fact overturned Roe. Read More: The Battle Over the Future of the Anti-Abortion Movement if the Supreme Court Overturns Roe v. Wade Arkansas State Sen. Jason Rapert, who introduced the trigger law, took to Facebook Live after the leaked draft this week to outline the plan. “As soon as that decision is released, we’ll end all abortion in Arkansas except to save the life of the mother,” he told his listeners. “What’s required as soon as that decision is, within minutes, the attorney general of the state of Arkansas should certify that the Roe decision is legitimate and that immediately we see that we’ll end abortion.” Rapert told TIME he was initially concerned about whether the state’s leadership would act because Arkansas earlier this year rejected a Texas-style bill that would allow private citizens to file lawsuits to enforce an abortion ban. So he wrote to the attorney general’s office this week to remind them of the responsibility added on the Facebook video that he would personally make sure his state followed through. “If we have anybody within the state of Arkansas, just like they had at the U.S. Supreme Court, that would try to interfere, that would try to disrupt the enforcement of Act 180, I will call for the legislature to convene and to impeach any such official immediately,” he said. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a fellow Republican, indicated she is ready to certify the trigger law too. “It will be my honor and a privilege of my lifetime to do just that,” she told reporters this week.  In Missouri, which also has a trigger ban in place, the state’s attorney general said he would also be prepared “immediately” to issue the opinion to put the state’s law into effect. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem said she would call for a special legislative session, and lawmakers in Nebraska and Indiana have called on their governors to do so too. Oklahoma has a trigger ban and its state also moved ahead with additional legislation this week. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a Texas-style abortion ban on Tuesday that prohibits abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and allows private citizens to sue abortion providers. “I want Oklahoma to be the most pro-life state in the country,” Stitt tweeted upon signing the legislation. The ban took effect immediately, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court denied an emergency request to stop the bill. Read More: Democrats Vow to Protect Reproductive Rights But Can’t Actually Do Much In Ohio, where the state legislature remains in session, state legislators are still considering two trigger ban bills that they could move before the Supreme Court rules. In the meantime, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said on Tuesday he would have the state’s attorney general seek to revive a 2019 state law that bans abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which happens as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many people know they are pregnant. The law has been blocked by courts since soon after DeWine signed it. “I’m asking him to immediately go into court and ask the federal court to lift the stay that is on the bill that I have already signed,” DeWine said Tuesday after he won his primary race.  Idaho, which has a trigger law set to take effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues its ruling, is also still pursuing a new law the state recently passed that allows Texas-style civil lawsuits against abortion providers. The state Supreme Court had blocked the law while a legal challenge against it proceeds, but last week the Idaho attorney asked the court to lift the stay and let the law take effect. Some states already have abortion bans on the books that were passed before the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision established the constitutional right to abortion. In those cases, some states may be able to simply begin enforcing those laws again immediately. If a judge has ruled them unconstitutional, officials would need to ask a court to allow them to go into effect. That’s the case in West Virginia, where the state’s trigger law dates back to the mid-1800s and makes abortion a felony punishable with three to 10 years in prison. That old law was never formally repealed; a 1975 court ruling merely blocked the law on the grounds that it was unconstitutional under the precedent established by Roe v. Wade. So if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, state officials would just have to request that the state supreme court lift the injunction. Read More: Republican States Crack Down on Access to Abortion Pills as Supreme Court Decision Looms That could happen extremely quickly, says Anne Lofaso, a law professor at West Virginia University’s Supreme Court Clinic. “The attorney general would immediately go to court and ask them to lift the injunction junction,” she says. “They could do it in days. It could be a day.” Abortion rights supporters could challenge that move in court, Lofaso adds. But even in that case, West Virginia’s Republican-led legislature could pass new legislation fairly quickly.  Other states have passed abortion restrictions more recently that have been blocked by courts but which they will try to bring back in the absence of Roe. Georgia does not have a trigger law, but in 2019 it passed a law that would ban nearly all abortions after about six weeks. That law was challenged and is on hold at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals pending the Supreme Court decision. State Rep. Ed Setzler, who sponsored the law, told TIME he is confident the law is “exactly where it needs to be” to go into effect. “As soon as Dobbs comes out, I think one can expect that the 11th will issue their opinion on the Life Act in Georgia, based on the Dobbs holding,” he says. The law also provides “full legal recognition” to fetuses after cardiac activity by allowing parents to claim the fetus as a dependent on their state taxes and saying fetuses will be included in “population based determinations” for the state. Setzler would ideally like to prohibit abortions beginning at conception, but sees putting his law into effect as a good next step. “As people become more aware and come face to face with the value of life in utero, perhaps we can get where we need to be, which is that we protect all life in the womb,” he says.  This is where many abortion opponents would like to go, and where experts say states are likely to eventually head if there is no federal protection for the right to abortion.

"Trump Declines to Endorse a Nationwide Abortion Ban, Says It Should Be Up to States",Nik Popli,Politics;abortion,"April 8, 2024 12:10 PM EDT","Former President Donald Trump has opted not to endorse a nationwide abortion ban, instead asserting that the decision should be left to individual states—a stance that diverges from the desires of many religious conservatives. “My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” Trump said in a campaign video on Monday. “Many states will be different… At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people.” Trump’s position is likely to disappoint members of his Republican base who have been urging him to advocate for stricter abortion regulations. He campaigned on the issue in 2016 and has since become a champion of the anti-abortion movement, but has waffled on the issue as Democrats have made abortion a central fight in the 2024 presidential election. Democrats continue to hold Trump accountable for the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that overturned the constitutional right to abortion. “Donald Trump made it clear once again today that he is—more than anyone in America— the person responsible for ending Roe v. Wade,” President Joe Biden said in a campaign statement responding to Trump’s abortion comments. In the video, Trump took credit for the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, saying that he was “proudly the person responsible” for overturning the constitutional right to abortion and commending the three conservative justices he appointed to the Supreme Court for having the “courage to allow this long term hard fought battle to finally end.” While the presumptive Republican presidential nominee previously hinted he might support an abortion ban after a certain number of weeks of pregnancy, possibly 15 or 16, his new position is that the abortion debate belongs in the states. Critics swiftly responded to Trump’s stance. The president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America argued Monday that by relinquishing a national stance on abortion, Trump was effectively conceding the debate to Democrats and jeopardizing states’ rights. “Unborn children and their mothers deserve national protections and national advocacy from the brutality of the abortion industry,” the group’s president Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. In nearly two years since the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, several Republican-led states have moved to enact stringent restrictions on abortion, including a six-week ban in Florida that Trump has said was a “terrible mistake.” Other states have implemented regulations limiting the procedure after a certain gestational period, while some Democratic-leaning states have also passed laws or ballot measures to safeguard broader access to abortion. Trump began his video by affirming his support for in-vitro fertilization (IVF), a process that involves fertilizing eggs outside the womb to induce a pregnancy. IVF became a flashpoint in the national debate on reproductive rights after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos are considered children, raising questions about the legality of the widely-used treatment and whether Alabama doctors who dispose of fertilized eggs could be held liable. “We want to make it easier for mothers and families to have babies, not harder,” Trump said, praising Alabama Republicans for passing a law to protect IVF in the state after the controversial ruling. Abortion remains a focal point in the 2024 presidential election, with Biden championing nationwide abortion access, including through medication abortion options like mifepristone. Democrats have utilized abortion rights to mobilize their base and drive voter turnout in various candidate and referendum elections across the country. “I am determined to restore the federal protections of Roe v. Wade,” Biden said in his Monday statement. “So it won't matter where you live in America: The fundamental right to choose for women will once again be the law of the land.” After Republicans underperformed in the 2022 midterm elections, Trump blamed the losses on the party’s abortion stance and has repeatedly highlighted Republicans’ political vulnerability of the issue. “It was the ‘abortion issue,’ poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on No Exceptions,” he posted on social media after that election. Trump has declined to comment on whether he would sign a federal abortion ban into law if Congress passes one, though as President he backed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks.

Texas’ Abortion Law Could Worsen the State’s Maternal Mortality Rate,Abigail Abrams;The U.S. faces a crisis of maternal mortality ,Politics,"September 22, 2021 7:00 AM EDT","Texas’ controversial six-week abortion ban has been in effect just 21 days, and physicians and researchers are already warning that the impact could be dire: if the law remains in effect, Texas could see a significant increase in maternal mortality. A new analysis from Dr. David Eisenberg, a board certified obstetrician-gynecologist who provides abortions in Missouri and Illinois, estimates that with the new law in effect, the state could see increases in maternal mortality of up to 15% overall, and up to 33% for Black women next year. The estimate is based on previous research that has established a clear link between abortion restrictions and maternal mortality. Black patients are often disproportionately impacted by abortion restrictions, and they are far more likely to die in to pregnancy-related deaths than white or Hispanic women.  “When you eliminate the ability for people who become pregnant to decide what’s best for them and their health and their family, it has a negative impact on the health of themselves, as well as their families and the communities they come from,” says Eisenberg, the former medical director of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri. The Texas law, known as Senate Bill 8, prohibits abortion once an ultrasound detects cardiac activity. In practice, that means that no one in the state can provide an abortion after roughly six weeks into a pregnancy, which is before many people discover they are pregnant. In addition to the law’s impact on patients, its extreme limit could also cause many abortion clinics to close their doors, which would further reduce access to care for state residents. While the Texas law is unprecedented in its private enforcement mechanism, many other states have passed limits on abortion in recent years, and researchers have shown that these are associated with negative health outcomes. In a study published in March in the journal Contraception, Eisenberg and his co-authors found that from 1995 to 2017, the maternal mortality rate increased most significantly in states that enacted the most restrictive abortion laws. In 2017, states that restricted abortion had a maternal death rate (28.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) that was nearly double (15.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) those that had passed laws protecting access to abortion. In another study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in 2019, researchers looked at maternal mortality data from 38 states and Washington, D.C. and found that gestational limits on abortion and Planned Parenthood clinic closures each significantly increased maternal mortality. They found that laws restricting abortion based on gestational age ​​increased maternal mortality by 38% and that a 20% reduction in Planned Parenthood clinics increased a state’s maternal mortality rate by 8%.  Since the study was based on statistical analyses of state-level data, researchers could not look at complicating factors for each individual patient. But Summer Sherburne Hawkins, the study’s lead author and an associate professor at Boston College’s School of Social Work, says the analysis shows the direct impact of abortion restrictions like the one in Texas. “Based on our research, restricting abortion based on gestational age, as has been done in Texas, will likely have detrimental effects on women’s health,” she says. “It could have increases in maternal mortality.” Eisenberg’s new analysis builds on this idea and pulls from his previous research published in Contraception. He found the Global Health Data Exchange showed a 6% increase in maternal mortality in states that restricted abortion access relative to neutral states. The CDC WONDER database showed a 24% increase in states that restricted abortion access relative to neutral states. The median increase, 15%, is what he predicts could take place in Texas if its current abortion law remains in place. Abortion providers in the state are already seeing patients who they fear could end up in dangerous circumstances. Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a staff physician at Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston, says the law has forced him to turn away patients who will likely not be in a place to have a healthy pregnancy. Planned Parenthood has become a “traffic control” center with care coordinators helping people find resources to travel out of state for care or explore other options, he says. But not all patients can travel long distances to receive care. Kumar says he saw a patient last week who is navigating a meth addiction and is homeless, who he doubts will be able to travel out of state to get an abortion. Another of his patients already has seven children, one of whom is in the hospital with a terminal illness. She likely will not be able to leave the state—and her children—to get an abortion either, but she also knows she will struggle to take care of another child, Kumar says. The Texas law means these patients must make incredibly difficult choices as they seek care. If they cannot obtain abortions, they may be forced to deal with the mental and physical stress of carrying unwanted pregnancies to term. “There’s also consequences with morbidity, meaning people having more complicated pregnancies that take a toll on their health, having more complications, and having a lower quality of life,” Kumar says. “And that’s not just for them. It’s also for their families and the children that they are forced to have.” The new Texas law is the latest in a wave of restrictions on abortion nationwide. For more than a decade, largely conservative states like Texas that have steadily implemented a series of laws and regulations making it more logistically and financially difficult for women to access all kinds of reproductive health care. Even amid this trend, Texas stands out as one of the most challenging places to obtain an abortion and to give birth to a child. The U.S. has faced a crisis of maternal mortality for years. It has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and the country’s numbers have worsened significantly over the last 30 years, according to a new report the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released Sept. 15. This is in large part due to growing disparities in access to quality care for women of color. “As an individual, as a Texan, I’m appalled that, at a time where we need stronger hospitals and a higher quality of hospital care for Texans, we’re going in the wrong direction,” Norma Cantú, chair of the Commission on Civil Rights, said in response to a question from TIME last week. The maternal mortality rate in Texas is already higher than the U.S. average, and Black women bear the brunt of this tragedy: they account for just 11% of live births, but make up 31% of maternal deaths in the state. In 2013, Texas created an expert committee to examine this issue. It found that many of the maternal deaths in Texas are preventable and recommended that the state extend health insurance coverage for poor mothers to one year after they have a baby. But lawmakers have not done that. Instead, in May the state passed a law extending Medicaid coverage for six months after childbirth. Texas has the highest rate of uninsured residents in the country, the highest rate of uninsured women of childbearing age, and its leaders have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which would have allowed more low-income Texans to access the public health insurance program. Texas also has the strictest income limit for Medicaid eligibility in the country: a single Texan parent with three children must earn $277 or less a month to be eligible. During pregnancy, that cap increases to $4,373. The new Texas abortion law is being challenged in court. The Department of Justice has asked a federal judge in the Western District of Texas to block the law while it sues Texas, and the next hearing is set for Oct. 1. But even if the law is temporarily blocked, it is written in a way that could make it difficult for abortion providers to resume their regular work until they have a final verdict. The effects of even a temporary ban are likely to reverberate. When Texas enacted a law in 2013 that required abortion clinics to obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals and imposed other restrictions, half the clinics in the state closed. Even after the Supreme Court ruled that law unconstitutional in 2016, few clinics returned. As a result, huge swaths of the state became abortion deserts. Under the new law, the average Texan must drive 14 times farther than they had to previously to access an abortion. In recent weeks, lawmakers from other conservative states have said they see Texas as a model and hope to pass similar legislation, and in December, the conservative Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a case about an abortion restriction in Mississippi. While those who oppose abortion are celebrating what they see as a win for their movement, physicians and researchers like Eisenberg—as well as residents in conservative states—say they are bracing for a coming wave of maternal deaths.

Michigan Is Fighting One of the Most Significant Abortion Battles in the Country,"Abigail Abrams/Wyoming, Mich.;‘Wait a second, which way am I supposed to vote?’;Testing a strategy",Politics;abortion,"November 18, 2022 3:50 PM EST","Laura Kruger looked skeptical as she opened her door in Wyoming, Mich. on a cold October afternoon. When the canvasser who had knocked asked her how she identified “when it comes to the issue of abortion,” she answered, “pro-life.” But when he asked about Proposal 3, the ballot measure that would enshrine the right to abortion in the state’s constitution, her eyes narrowed and her answer was more nuanced. “Rape, incest, health, are issues that are so important for each individual,” Kruger said. “It’s not a yes or no choice always.” Kruger is the kind of voter that both anti-abortion advocates and those that support abortion rights in Michigan are hoping to win over this fall in one of the most heated votes on abortion access in the country. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in June turned abortion policies back to the states for the first time in 50 years and made this year’s elections a test of abortion as a motivating issue. Voters around the country are now tasked with deciding on governors, state legislators, and ballot measures that will determine the legality of the procedure where they live. Michigan is at the epicenter of that fight.  A 1931 law in Michigan prohibits abortions with no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the pregnant patient (it only allows abortions that “preserve the life” of a patient). The ballot measure would explicitly establish a right to abortion—as well as contraception, miscarriage management and other decisions about pregnancy—in the state constitution. While the 1931 law is currently blocked by two state courts, the Michigan Supreme Court could lift those injunctions and put it back into effect if voters reject the ballot measure. Polling in the state showed that 61% of Michiganders supported the measure in late September, and both sides are expecting a tense fight. Republicans in the swing state are trying to avoid talking about abortion in favor of issues such as the economy and crime, while Democrats are linking their own races to the future of reproductive freedom in Michigan. Both sides are spending heavily on the effort and deploying volunteers ahead of the midterm elections on Nov. 8. (Kruger near Grand Rapids told canvassers she would vote against the amendment despite her reservations because she wants to stop abortions later in pregnancy.) The immediate stakes extend beyond Michigan. After the Supreme Court’s decision, the state became a point of access in the Midwest as states around it, including Wisconsin, Ohio, and Indiana, banned abortion this summer. While Ohio and Indiana’s abortion laws are now blocked by the courts, access there remains precarious and some patients uncertain of their states’ laws are still seeking care in Michigan. Planned Parenthood of Michigan has increased abortion appointments by 30% since the Dobbs decision, with two to three times the number of out-of-state patients from before Roe was overturned. On a recent Tuesday, two patients from Indiana sought abortions in Kalamazoo, Mich. because that was where they could find appointments, and Dr. Sarah Wallett, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, told TIME she had also recently seen patients from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, and Oklahoma. Even for those born and raised in Michigan, the debate is affecting the way they see their state. Grace, a 21-year-old from southwest Michigan, had a friend drop her off at the Kalamazoo clinic because she knew her parents wouldn’t support her decision to get an abortion. She works two jobs to pay her college tuition on her own and says she couldn’t afford a child right now. “I’ve always wanted to be a parent,” she says. But her home state’s law is making her reconsider where—and if—she will start a family, and she plans to vote ‘yes’ on the ballot measure. “Wherever I end up, it will be a state that allows abortion,” she says, ”because it’s a form of health care.” In the final weeks of the campaign, advocates on both sides of the issue are out talking to voters around the state. Volunteers say a large part of their job is educating voters on the details of the proposal. Even in Ann Arbor, where many voters are liberal and highly educated, volunteers found multiple voters on a recent canvassing trip who had heard about the measure but weren’t confident that a ‘yes’ vote would support abortion rights or didn’t know what the amendment would actually do. “My daughter who is voting absentee was like, ‘Wait a second, which way am I supposed to vote?’” Chuck Marchand, 54, told canvassers as he stepped out onto his porch. Volunteers told Marchand and other voters that the amendment would prevent the state’s 1931 law from criminalizing doctors for decisions they made while treating pregnancy complications and “restore Roe” in the state of Michigan. Opponents claim the proposal would wipe out other abortion restrictions. The anti-abortion groups have been increasing their advertising to get their message out: As of last week, opponents of Proposal 3 had spent $22.7 million compared with $15.9 million from the proposal’s supporters, according to media tracking company AdImpact. In Wyoming, Mich., Linda Rusticas, a 75-year-old voter, invited volunteers from Students for Life, a national anti-abortion group opposing the amendment, inside her home. She indicated that she would vote ‘no,’ declaring, “this proposal is so radical.” But others in town turned the canvassers away. The Catholic Church, which has a large presence in the state, has thrown its weight behind opposing the initiative, raising money, organizing volunteers, and holding prayer rallies and weekly sermons to encourage people to vote no on Proposal 3. The fervor has reached even some who weren’t previously involved in politics, like Father Alex Kratz, a Franciscan friar who is holding weekly “Holy Hours for Life” where hundreds of parishioners gather in a chapel outside Detroit to pray for the measure to fail every Wednesday until the election. He says he hadn’t been focused on abortion before Roe was overturned, but once his state had the power to change its policies, he tuned in. “Michigan, not only in politics, but spiritually is like a swing state. People are watching us,” he says. Even if the proposed amendment—which he describes as “evil to the core”—passes, Kratz claims he’s proof that Dobbs has motivated anti-abortion voters. “We’ll regroup and do even better at getting the moderates on board to not have a total abortion culture in Michigan,” he says. The other side has also seen new people motivated to vote because of abortion. Jessica Leach, 37, a lifelong Republican in Mount Pleasant, considered herself “pro-life” until the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision. Leach had her oldest son at 19, and once she started reading about other states’ abortion bans taking effect, she says she felt devastated by people not having the same choice she did, and especially by stories of child rape victims being forced to travel to obtain abortions. “I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat. I mean, it consumed me,” Leach says. Now she, her friend, and their partners—all traditionally Republicans—are voting for the ballot measure and plan to vote for Democrats this year because of abortion. Abortion rights campaigners collected a record number of signatures to put the amendment on the ballot this summer, and there are signs that the issue could again galvanize voters on the side of abortion rights in November. Newly registered voters across the country, and in Michigan, have skewed more Democratic, more female, and younger, since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, according to Democratic data firm TargetSmart. Ballot measures also often bring in more votes than normal political races, says Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which works to support ballot initiatives and has advised the abortion- rights campaigners in Michigan. That happened in an unexpected victory for abortion rights in a Kansas ballot initiative vote in August. “In swing states and red states alike,” Hall says, “we have to assume that voters are coming to a ballot measure with a different frame of mind than any candidate choice, and keep open minds ourselves about who is on the table for a ballot measure.” Four other states, including California, Vermont, Kentucky, and Montana, will also have ballot measures on abortion in November. Advocates are still waging court battles over a number of state abortion laws, arguing that state constitutions in places like Florida, Ohio, and Indiana currently protect the right to abortion, and they are also focusing on state supreme court races, which are playing an increasingly important role in determining abortion policy around the country. Michigan’s outcome will have implications for future ballot measures. In addition to referencing abortion, the amendment includes protections for contraception and broader reproductive care. “What happens in November will help set the stage for what is possible,” says Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. “I think there’s an opportunity to look forward. Roe was the floor, it was never the ceiling of what reproductive justice truly means in the United States.” But even as Figueredo and others hope to push more ballot measures in the future, they are also worried about a growing backlash to progressive wins at the ballot box that would make this strategy harder to pursue. Conservative state lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills that would restrict or change the ballot initiative process over the last few years. In 2017, the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center tracked 33 such bills, and by 2021, it counted 146 bills, more than a 300% increase. This fall, Arizona and Arkansas both have measures on the ballot that would increase the threshold that future initiatives have to meet. Some anti-abortion advocates like Dan Devine, an attorney who helped organize a prayer rally against the Michigan amendment on Oct. 15, argue the issue would be better handled by the state legislature so that they can “bring the stakeholders together” rather than fighting at the ballot box. For now, abortion in Michigan is legal, but its future remains uncertain. Voters will have their say in less than three weeks. Proposal 3, says Wallett, the chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood of Michigan, means “making sure Michiganders have futures that they want, that they can control.” Write to Abigail Abrams/Wyoming, Mich. at abigail.abrams@time.com",https://time.com/6223955/michigan-abortion-ballot-initiative/
Existing Federal Laws Could Protect Abortion Rights Even if Roe Is Overturned,Ideas;Greer Donley;Rachel Rebouché;David S. Cohen,Ideas;politics,"January 24, 2022 3:21 PM EST","On this year’s anniversary of Roe v. Wade, many wondered if it would be the last. Ever since the Supreme Court heard arguments in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in December, legal scholars have been predicting the end of Roe. The Supreme Court’s most recent decision to not intervene in Texas’ so-called “heartbeat” law (S.B. 8), which bans almost all abortions after around six weeks, did nothing to alleviate that fear. If we are correct about the Court’s signals and it does in fact overturn Roe later this spring, roughly half of U.S. states are expected to ban abortion, meaning that large swaths of the population could soon live in a state that criminalizes almost all abortion services. Our federal structure, however, provides the building blocks for one of the most promising strategies to invalidate some aspects of those bans: federal preemption. The Constitution’s Supremacy Clause states that federal laws trump state laws. Preemption applies when federal and state laws conflict or when state regulations frustrate Congressional purpose in enacting federal law. The supremacy of federal law is why the proposed Women’s Health Protection Act, to the extent Congress could pass it, would ensure that every person had access to abortion even though state laws said otherwise. But even without legislation creating a federal abortion right, there are federal regulations that could call into question the laws of the 20-plus states that would outlaw or greatly restrict abortion if Roe is overturned. Read More: What History Teaches Us About Women Forced to Carry Unwanted Pregnancies to Term Federal law created the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and outlined its mission to create a national system of drug review. This system is extensive and onerous—requiring years or even decades of expensive medical research to prove that a drug is safe and effective before it can be sold in interstate commerce. It was through that national drug review system that mifepristone, which is the only drug the FDA has approved to terminate a pregnancy, was approved for use. Moreover, the FDA has long imposed extra limits on mifepristone’s distribution: requiring people to pick up the drug at a health care facility, limiting who can prescribe it, and mandating extra counseling. (The drug is one of the 5% of drugs over which the FDA has exercised strict control despite mifepristone’s decades-long, excellent safety record.) The FDA removed the in-person dispensing requirement in December 2021 after concluding it was unnecessary for patent safety; the agency now allows providers to mail their patients mifepristone and certified pharmacies to dispense it. Nonetheless, numerous state laws control mifepristone’s prescription and dispensation much more strictly than the FDA. These laws directly conflict with the FDA’s safety decisions. Nineteen states, for instance, require in-person abortion care even though the FDA found it unnecessary. And 32 allow only doctors to prescribe medication abortion even though the FDA decided that non-physician providers can safely and effectively prescribe the drug. There are others too, like another recent Texas law, S.B. 4, that bans medication abortion after seven weeks of pregnancy even though the FDA has approved it through the first 10 weeks. These state statutes may be preempted, and a legal challenge on that theory could therefore invalidate them. Read More: Inside Mississippi’s Last Abortion Clinic—and the Biggest Fight for Abortion Rights in a Generation Congress created the FDA’s national drug review system with a purpose of establishing national uniformity. The Supreme Court has previously said that a drug manufacturer should not have to stop selling its product in a state to comply with both federal and state laws. In a post-Roe world, this argument could extend even further to poke holes in bans on all abortion or extreme laws like S.B. 8 by forcing states to allow medication abortions. The blueprint for this preemption challenge has already been successful against a state’s attempt to ban, and then regulate, a new opioid more stringently than the FDA. In a 2014 case, a court invalidated the state’s regulation as preempted even though the state was acting with an established, evidenced-based safety interest. The different trajectories of opioid and abortion regulation—the former entering the market with less stringent control and the latter subject to the most restrictive measures—makes the preemption argument stronger for abortion, as do the decades of research providing mifepristone’s safety. But preemption goes even further when considering other federal laws. In response to Texas’s S.B. 8, Health & Human Services (HHS) Secretary Becerra announced that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires emergency departments to treat pregnant patients and those experiencing pregnancy loss and that any contrary state law would be preempted. Thus, if doctors or hospitals refuse to provide medically necessary abortions—those to save the life or health of the mother—because of state abortion bans, those people can sue the hospitals and providers that refused them. Read More: What We Fear in the Wake of the Texas Abortion Law EMTALA preemption might also have more interesting and complex implications. As legal abortion becomes even less available, more women will terminate their pregnancies with abortion medication on their own, without professional oversight or permission, sometimes illegally. Complications from self-managed medication abortion, which occur very rarely, are indistinguishable from incomplete miscarriage. Thus, women needing additional care after self-management in places where abortion is illegal will present at emergency rooms. In these cases, EMTALA would require doctors to treat these patients, even if they suspect abortion and even if treatment requires finishing an abortion. These examples show potential at chipping away at state restrictions—repurposing the decades-long anti-abortion strategy of chipping away at abortion rights. It may seem pointless to wager that our federal courts, especially a majority of the Supreme Court, would agree that state abortion laws are preempted in the way we argue here. But courts’ composition change, and not all judges in the United States would be hostile to these arguments. With the end of Roe looming, the abortion-rights movement must take creative and bold actions to secure abortion access in hostile states. If opioid manufacturers can convince a court to invalidate a state ban on a potentially addictive drug, surely there is reason to think a court might invalidate a similar ban on a drug with mifepristone’s outstanding safety record. The FDA and HHS can help usher in that protection by making clear that not all the power to regulate abortion lies with state legislatures.

Voters Rejected Montana’s Anti-Abortion Referendum. Here’s What it Means,Katie Reilly,Politics;2022 Midterm Elections,"November 10, 2022 6:06 PM EST","Voters in Montana rejected a ballot measure that would have declared an embryo or fetus a legal person entitled to medical care if they are “born alive” at any stage of development, including after attempted abortions. Montana was one of five states with abortion-related ballot measures on Tuesday, and was the only one left unresolved. In all five cases, voters moved to protect abortion access—a victory for abortion-rights advocates, even in the conservative states of Kentucky and Montana.  The Montana referendum, which about 53% of voters opposed, would have imposed “criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of such infants, including infants born during an attempted abortion.” Health care providers who violated the law would have faced a fine of up to $50,000 and 20 years in prison.  Proponents of the referendum argued it would protect infants. But critics said it would limit the kind of care doctors can provide and was unnecessary, given that infanticide is already illegal under state law. They also warned it would “elevate a false anti-abortion narrative.” Experts note that abortions after fetal viability are very rare. Just 1% of abortions in the U.S. occur at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy, according to analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. And CDC data show that rare cases of a fetus surviving an abortion and then dying often involve severe fetal health conditions or pregnancy complications. “I think voters may also have kind of thought this was a solution in search of a problem,” says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis and an expert on abortion politics.  “It’s yet another signal that voters in conservative states, who are certainly not necessarily open to voting for Democratic candidates, are open to voting for access to abortion when the question is presented to them directly.” Montana has a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled state legislature, but other states have stronger abortion restrictions. The state bans abortion at fetal viability, which is about 24 to 26 weeks into pregnancy. By comparison, the neighboring states of Idaho and South Dakota have some of the country’s most restrictive abortion laws, banning abortion entirely with limited exceptions.  The ballot measure was opposed by several medical groups, including the Montana chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which said it would have “criminalized doctors, nurses and health care workers for providing compassionate care for infants,” interfered with parents’ challenging decisions, and hindered care for newborns with fatal health conditions..  “Born alive” arguments have been a focus of anti-abortion advocates for decades. (A 2002 federal law, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, already classifies every infant as a person.) And Ziegler sees the Montana referendum as more of a “rhetorical tool” aimed at stigmatizing abortion than as an effort to directly restrict abortion access.  But the results of the referendum could be a signal to anti-abortion advocates that pursuing ballot measures might not be an effective strategy moving forward.  Voters in more conservative states might not be willing to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution yet—as voters in Vermont, Michigan and California did this week. But this outcome suggests they’re also not willing to support as many restrictions as anti-abortion advocates had hoped.  “I think it does tell you that most voters—even in red states, and certainly in purple and blue states—are unhappy with what’s going on with abortion rights,” Ziegler says. “To some degree, Republicans overplayed their hand.” Write to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com",https://time.com/6232659/montana-abortion-referendum-fails-midterms-2022/
Women in Northern Ireland Still Struggle to Access Abortion More Than 2 Years After Decriminalization,"Kristen Chick/Belfast, Northern Ireland",World;abortion,"June 30, 2022 12:58 PM EDT","When Katie Boyd decided to have an abortion in November, she thought the process would be smooth. She had celebrated when abortion was decriminalized in Northern Ireland two years earlier, in October 2019, and two years on, it seemed logical that abortion care would now be readily available.  Boyd, 40, called a hotline intended to connect those seeking abortion with care, and was told she’d receive a call within five days from a clinic that could provide an early medication abortion. But five days went by with no call. Her follow-up calls begging for direct contact information for the clinic got her nowhere. As the days turned into weeks, Boyd began to panic. Medication abortion, which involves taking two sets of pills, is offered in Northern Ireland until the 10th week of pregnancy, a cutoff that was swiftly approaching. After that, she would have no choice but to travel to England, where abortion is more widely available. In desperation, Boyd contacted the international organization that mailed her abortion pills a few years earlier, when it was still criminalized. But instead of helping, the group directed her to call the same hotline because abortion was now legal in Northern Ireland. Legal—but not accessible. “I was just hitting brick wall after brick wall after brick wall,” says Boyd. “And I got really upset.” She says she told her partner, “I feel like I’m in the 19th century. Something is happening to my body, and I’m not ok with it, and I feel like nobody’s listening to me.”  With little time to spare, Boyd emailed Alliance for Choice, an abortion-rights activist group in Belfast. Co-convener Naomi Connor replied within an hour, and soon helped Boyd access abortion pills through a different activist group, which she took at home to end her pregnancy. The entire process was “brutal,” she says—and far more difficult than the abortion she had several years earlier, when it was still criminalized. “It was more compassionate, and more empathetic, and I had more autonomy over my body when the service was illegal.” While many in the U.K. are outraged at the rollback of abortion rights in the U.S. with the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, there are still significant barriers to abortion access in Northern Ireland, a part of the U.K. that is home to nearly 2 million people. Many are frustrated that there has been little progress more than two years after decriminalization. That’s because the Department of Health has not commissioned abortion services, leaving already-stretched health care workers to provide care on an ad-hoc basis without funding or training. The result is that those seeking abortion must navigate a maze criss-crossed with barriers. In the absence of government action, activists like Connor, who had hoped there would be less demand for their work after decriminalization, are busier than ever helping people access abortion. Read More: The Failure of the Feminist Industrial Complex The U.K. government has delegated many powers to Northern Ireland to allow local representatives to make decisions about how it is governed, including on abortion policy. But now, the U.K. government is poised to bypass Northern Ireland’s officials to set up abortion services directly because of frustration over the delay. In May, the U.K.’s Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, directed the Northern Ireland Department of Health to establish fully-funded abortion services “within days to weeks.” If it does not, “I will intervene further,” he said in a written statement to parliament. It wouldn’t be the first time Westminster intervened in Northern Ireland to secure abortion rights. Though abortion was legalized in the rest of the U.K. in 1967, that legislation did not extend to Northern Ireland, where it was prohibited in almost all circumstances. For decades, most people needing abortion were forced to travel to England or obtain illegal pills—or continue their pregnancies. In 2018 an inquiry by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women found that the U.K. was breaching the rights of women by restricting their access to abortion. The same year the U.K.’s Supreme Court said the restrictions in Northern Ireland were incompatible with human rights legislation. And after years of campaigning by Northern Ireland activists and civic groups, Westminster finally acted in 2019. There was no referendum, as with the 2018 vote in the Republic of Ireland that led to the limited legalization of abortion, nor did it come through a court ruling. Instead, with Northern Ireland’s legislative assembly suspended due to political deadlock, the U.K. parliament passed a bill to maintain public services in Northern Ireland, and Labour MP Stella Creasy proposed an amendment decriminalizing abortion in Northern Ireland. When the bill came into effect in October, abortion was no longer criminalized, despite the protests of some Northern Ireland politicians. On paper, abortion law in Northern Ireland is now more permissive than the rest of the U.K., where a law criminalizing abortion is still on the books, though it was legalized in certain circumstances by the 1967 law. On the ground, as Boyd discovered, is a different matter. Read More: How One of Ireland’s Leading Abortion Rights Activists Sees the Future of Roe The U.K. government issued regulations outlining the new legal framework for abortion services in Northern Ireland in March 2020: It is available until 12 weeks for any reason, and until 24 weeks if two medical professionals certify that continuing the pregnancy would be a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the pregnant person than termination. After 24 weeks, abortion is permitted in cases of severe fetal defects and when the pregnancy risks death or serious permanent physical or mental harm to the pregnant person.  But Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party, declined to set up and fund abortion care. (Northern Ireland has a publicly-funded universal health care system.) Swann maintains he needs approval from the Northern Ireland executive committee, which is not functioning due to an unrelated political dispute. In May, Lewis introduced regulations eliminating the need for executive approval to commission abortion services. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said the Minister is “currently awaiting legal advice on the implications” of the regulations “before considering the next steps regarding the commissioning of services.” With no government action, clinicians are offering what care they can on top of their regular duties, without resources or direction. Four of Northern Ireland’s five local health care authorities are now offering medication abortions. Unlike the rest of the U.K., where telemedicine can be used to dispense the pills to people at home, those accessing a medication abortion in Northern Ireland must travel to a clinic to take the first pill. Though doctors have performed some surgical abortions since 2020, Connor says doctors recently stopped offering them because of the lack of support from the Health Department, so those who cannot or do not want to take the pills, or who cannot access them by the 10-week limit, must travel to England. That was particularly difficult during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, when most modes of transportation and hotels were shut down, and people were told to stay at home. According to figures released by the government on June 21, 161 women from Northern Ireland traveled to England and Wales for abortions in 2021, down from 371 in 2020.  In some areas abortion services have been suspended, leaving people without local access. The Western Health and Social Care Trust, which covers a large, mostly rural area, stopped offering medication abortion in April 2021 due to “staff resourcing issues,” said a Trust spokesperson. For a year, until neighboring trusts began to accepting referrals for Western Trust patients, they had no options but to to travel to England or order abortion pills online. The Trust is working to restart services “within the next number of months” and has recruited additional staff to “support the service going forward,” said the spokesperson. Activists say clinicians are doing the best they can in the face of tremendous challenges. “The doctors and the healthcare professionals are operating in a vacuum,” says Connor. “There’s no governance for them, there’s no resources for them, there’s no funding for them. And the circumstances under which they were having to provide that abortion healthcare service was precarious for them. So we can’t blame them” when they are not able to provide the care.  In the information void left by the health department’s inaction, many people don’t know where to go to access abortion or even whether it is legal. Even the phone number people from across Northern Ireland call to access an abortion referral—the number Boyd called—is run not by the health department but by a non-profit abortion provider in England, which stepped in back in October after Northern Ireland sexual health charity Informing Choices NI was forced to end the service for lack of funding. Some women and pregnant people who turn to Google for information end up at anti-abortion pregnancy centers, which sometimes use delaying tactics until people are past the 10-week limit for medication abortion, says Connor. To find the care they need, many are turning to activists. Connor receives daily requests for help. On a recent afternoon in Belfast, she stopped twice mid-conversation to take calls or messages from women seeking help accessing abortion. She got involved in the work after she was forced to travel to England to access abortion a decade ago. It took years to “unpack the stigma,” she says. Now, she tries to help others avoid the same experience.  When Connor initially spoke to Boyd and assured her she could help, “I felt like I exhaled for the first time in weeks,” says Boyd. Like 57% of women who had an abortion in the U.K. last year, Boyd is already a mother. (In the U.S., about 60% of women who have an abortion already have at least one child.) She and her partner of seven years are careful about using contraception, so she was shocked when she realized she was pregnant in November. Her partner, who is on a waiting list for a vasectomy, supported her decision to seek an abortion. (Waiting times for access to long-acting contraception is a connected issue—the Western Trust, where there are no abortion services, has a 16-week waiting list for patients seeking contraceptive coils and implants.) About a month after she first called the referral hotline, Boyd finally received a call from the clinic in Belfast. By that point, she says, she had already completed her self-managed abortion. But she did need to seek medical help because of continued bleeding. At the hospital, doctors removed tissue that hadn’t been expelled in the abortion.  Like Boyd, many struggle to access abortion within the 10-week limit for abortion pills. The earliest a pregnancy can be detected is at four weeks, and many learn they are pregnant later, putting them close to the limit. Waiting even a week for a referral to a clinic can put people over the cutoff. And that’s if they can get to a clinic in the first place. For some in abusive or coercive relationships, it is impossible. Some people are unable to take off work, find childcare, or arrange transportation, a particular concern in rural areas like much of the Western Trust. Traveling to England is even more difficult. Read More: The State of Abortion Rights Around the World One of the women Connor helped recently was a refugee who had endured female genital cutting, rape, and trafficking. She spoke little English, was diabetic, and was afraid to talk to her doctor. When Connor helped her access a clinic, a translator refused to participate after learning the woman needed abortion care. Clinicians determined she was over 10 weeks pregnant, which meant she would have to travel to England. Connor was furious. “This woman had encountered all that, she got to a place of safety here in Northern Ireland. And we were going to tell her she had to travel?”  Connor asked the doctor to call a local hospital, where doctors agree to perform a surgical abortion. The woman spent three days in the maternity unit’s labor and delivery suites, and eventually had a surgical abortion after multiple failed attempts at medication abortion. She was put in a room designed for miscarriages and stillbirths, and because of protocol she had to sign forms, and doctors had to give her pamphlets, meant for miscarriage. The setting and protocol, a result of the lack of commissioning of abortion care, were described by the clinicians as grossly inappropriate, says Connor, and they apologized to her and to the woman repeatedly, though she says they did the best they could. She recently had to tell another woman that she would have to travel for an abortion, though the woman already told her she cannot, because local doctors declined to perform a surgical abortion because of the lack of commissioning. “Those women who should be traveling the least, they’re the people who are being forced to travel,” she says. “And it’s inhumane.” The need for assistance is so great that in 2020 Alliance for Choice organized an “abortion doula” training, where participants learned about abortion and how to support people through the process. Connor stresses that they are not healthcare professionals or counselors, and they do not interfere with people’s decisions. But once someone makes a decision, “we are there to support people throughout their abortion journey, whether that be practical, emotional, logistical, or any other type of support that we can realistically provide.” For Bethany Moore, who participated in the training and now serves as an abortion doula with Alliance for Choice Derry, a separate organization, that can look like helping with childcare, dropping off a meal, helping navigate the care, or even just providing a listening ear. “It’s a radical act of community care, a radical act of love, helping someone get the care they need,” she says.  Often, activists are the only people those seeking help feel safe confiding in. Claire Hackett, an abortion doula with Alliance for Choice who lives in a rural area, says many of the women who come to her for help accessing abortion don’t feel comfortable sharing their situation with anyone else because of the stigma. When she talks with them, “they’re just so relieved to be able to unburden,” she says. When she tells them “look, we will get you sorted, you’re not on your own—you can really hear the relief and the relaxation in them.”  About one in three women in the U.K. will have an abortion by the time they are 45, but the stigma isolates people and hampers access. Protesters often gather outside clinics. Northern Ireland is a small, tightly knit society, and many fear being recognized when going to a clinic, or even talking to their doctor. “Your doctor might be a family friend,” says Moore. “There is that worry of who’s going to see me, what is my doctor going to say.” Attitudes toward abortion are changing in Northern Ireland. Public opinion surveys show that the majority support decriminalization and access to abortion. But stigma is still “prevalent and multi-layered,” says Fiona Bloomer, a senior lecturer at Ulster University who studies abortion. “We’re not a society that is used to talking about sex, relationships, and sexual health. So abortion is on the far end of that scale,” she says. That silence allows the stigma to persist. “As a society we’re on a pathway of feeling more relaxed about talking about abortion, but there’s a long way to go.” Activists know the stigma means that there will be work to do even if abortion services are commissioned tomorrow. But that’s the first step, and they say it must happen now. ”It’s beyond a joke that we still have no abortion services,” says Moore. “And that really comes from a lack of political will from the Health Minister to put his personal feelings aside and do his job.” Correction, June 30 The original version of this story misstated the political party Health Minister Robin Swann belongs to.

How a Crop of New Movies Is Changing the Narrative About Abortion,Suyin Haynes,Entertainment;movies,"March 13, 2020 5:13 PM EDT","Bridget sits at home on the couch and pops four pills into her mouth, two inside each cheek. “I have to keep them here for 20 minutes,” she says smiling, her cheeks slightly bulging. She’s starting the process of a medical abortion. “Do I look cute?” she asks Jace, who she’s dating casually. “I feel cute.” It’s a low-key moment, and one of several scenes in Saint Frances, a recently released dramedy that treats abortion, and the complexities of motherhood and womanhood more broadly, with compassion and without stigma. As several U.S. states undergo their own battles over abortion laws in the courts, a number of new independent films are taking a more quotidian, and decidedly human, approach to depicting the procedure and the decisions that lead up to it. Saint Frances isn’t just a story about abortion, it’s about Bridget’s bond with a six-year-old girl she starts nannying at around the same time that she terminates her pregnancy. Writer Kelly O’Sullivan, who plays Bridget, based the story partly on her own experience of having an abortion in her early 30s. “As I was going through that process, which was very simple and not very scary, I realized I had been miseducated about abortion through TV and film growing up and in my young adulthood,” she tells TIME. “I wanted to write a story where it’s a non-traumatic depiction of abortion. It’s ordinary and light and sometimes funny, and very realistic in its portrayal.” Eliza Hittmann’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, out March 13, also upends old narratives about abortion. Hittmann, who directed the 2017 Sundance hit Beach Rats, was struck by the story of Savita Halappanavar, a woman living in Ireland who died after she was denied a life-saving abortion in 2012. Halappanavar’s case was often cited by advocates as an example of why the country’s abortion laws needed to change, and a May 2018 referendum resulted in a lifting of the near-total ban on abortion there. “I started reading about the journey that women would take from Ireland across the Irish Sea to London and back in one day, and I thought to myself, that’s an untold story,” Hittmann tells TIME. Never Rarely Sometimes Always transplants that journey to the U.S., where access in rural areas is more limited than in urban centers, and laws vary from state to state. Faced with several barriers to abortion access in Pennsylvania because she is a minor, teenager Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) decides to travel to New York to obtain a surgical abortion at a Planned Parenthood center. Initially, Autumn visits an unnamed crisis pregnancy center in her hometown, where the ultrasound technician, upon finding the fetal heartbeat, tells her “this is the most magical sound you will ever hear.” She is sent home with pamphlets about adoption, but the center’s staff don’t explain that abortion is an option for her, and she later learns that they misled her about how far along her pregnancy was. “For me, it was important for audiences to know that centers like this exist. They’re controversial because they’re federally financed, but they’re not medically licensed by any regard,” says Hittmann. This new crop of films arrive as part of a broader shift over the last decade away from classic tropes about abortion. As sociologist Gretchen Sisson, principal investigator at the Abortion Onscreen program at the University of California, San Francisco, points out, early stories on film that dealt with abortion were cautionary tales that provided a kind of moral commentary on the pregnancy itself. Sisson compiled a census of all fictional American television shows and films to identify these representations, starting with the earliest depiction of abortion in the 1916 silent film Where Are My Children?, directed by Lois Weber. The Hays Code (or the Motion Picture Production Code), which was originally published in 1930, enforced in films dating from 1934 and amended later in the 1950s, set strict limits on storylines involving abortion. The parameters of the code, which also regulated depictions of murder, adultery, miscegenation and the appearance of alcohol in films, led to characters who had abortions having unhappy endings, whereas characters who considered getting abortions and then decided against them had more positive outcomes.  The proliferation of television programming in the 1960s brought legal dramas and soap operas with abortion storylines, while the 1970s and 1980s saw more of a professional perspective on abortion. “You see a lot of stories about doctors making a decision about whether or not to provide an abortion, or stories about lawyers who are discussing access from a legal and policy perspective,” says Sisson. “The story of the woman actually getting the abortion is a subplot.” The 1990s and early 2000s often saw last-minute changes of heart, as with Miranda Hobbes’ (Cynthia Nixon) route to motherhood in Sex and the City.  “What we’re seeing now is much more focused on the woman’s experience, and much more of a focus on telling different types of stories for different types of women, so there’s much greater range of characters getting abortions across a greater range of genres,” says Sisson, pointing to the 2014 indie film Obvious Child, the 2015 road-trip film Grandma with Lily Tomlin and last year’s Hulu series Shrill as examples of comedies with abortion storylines. She also says showrunner Shonda Rhimes, who included abortion storylines in her shows Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy, has changed the script on the topic. Whereas an abortion might have singularly defined a female character in the past, she says, “It’s become part of a broader story arc for a character, it’s one small part of who that character is and what they do.” Abortion is also a part of the coming-of-age story in the Harlem-set Premature, released last month. Played by Zora Howard, who co-wrote the script with director Rashaad Ernesto Green, Ayanna is a 17-year-old falling in love for the first time during her last summer before college. As with Saint Frances, Ayanna has an abortion, and though it’s difficult to watch, it’s treated as part of her character’s journey, rather than the whole focus of it. Similarly, the psychological thriller Swallow, released earlier in March, portrays a medical abortion, as protagonist Hunter (Haley Bennett) places the pills in her mouth while eating fast food in a shopping mall. Producers worked with Planned Parenthood consultants to ensure the depiction was accurate. Still, while these films represent a move away from stigma toward many women’s reality, there is still a way to go before the representation reflects reality. Although around 60% of people who have abortions are people of color, according to data from 2014 compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, Abortion Onscreen’s 2019 analysis of abortion on television indicated that 65% of characters who obtained abortions were white. There are other missing stories to be told too. “Some of the most frequent reasons women get abortions is because they’re already raising children and don’t have the money to raise another child,” says Sisson. “That is a fairly compelling and sympathetic reason, but we don’t see those stories.” There are also misunderstandings about the process itself on screen. A 2014 study by Sisson noted that 9% of fictional women who had abortions in American film and television from 1916 to 2013 died directly as a result of the abortion. In 2015, the year with the latest available statistics, 638,169 abortions and three abortion-related deaths were reported to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning the fatality rate for abortion-related deaths was close to 0%. The research points to a number of representations of abortion elevating the process to a major medical procedure in ambulatory surgical centers and hospitals; notably, none of the four new independent films show this, and only Never Rarely Sometimes Always shows a surgical abortion. According to the Guttmacher Institute, medication abortions increased from 5% of all abortions in 2001 to 39% in 2017. Real legal battles on abortion have revolved around whether abortions should be required to take place in hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers, rather than freestanding clinics. “A lot of the patterns we see on TV are often cropping up as justifications or common misunderstandings in the broader public and political discourse,” says Sisson. For Saint Frances writer and actor O’Sullivan, it was important to show Bridget as having complicated feelings about abortion — but also that guilt and regret were not among them. “She struggles with this idea of ‘I shouldn’t have to feel anything about having an abortion,’ which I totally agree with,” says O’Sullivan. “Whatever your experience is with it, that’s right. For some women it’s going to be a big deal and that’s right. For other women it will be a blip on the radar, and that’s right. I’m excited to continue to see stories where maybe abortion isn’t the main plot point — where it’s an event, not the event.” Correction, March 13 The original version of this story misstated the fatality rate for abortion-related deaths. It is almost 0%, not 0.5%. Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/5799385/abortion-onscreen-representation/
Biden Targets Republicans on IVF and Abortion Access in State of the Union,Brian Bennett,Politics;abortion,"March 8, 2024 12:06 AM EST","Convinced that the ongoing Republican threats to abortion access will provide his party political jet fuel in November, President Biden spoke forcefully about reproductive rights in his State of the Union address Thursday night, calling on Congress to protect both access to abortion and in vitro fertilization (IVF). “Guarantee the right to IVF. Guarantee it nationwide,” Biden said, tapping into an issue that emerged just weeks ago after an Alabama court decision determined an embryo has the same rights as a child, upending IVF treatments for those in the state hoping to use the procedure to conceive. Responding to the uproar, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed a law Thursday designed to give immunity to the state's IVF providers.  As a sign of what a political liability the IVF issue has become for Republicans, Senator Katie Britt of Alabama was selected to provide the party's rebuttal to Biden's address. ""We support continued nationwide access to in vitro fertilization,"" she said during her rebuttal. Last month, Senate Republicans blocked a bill to protect IVF nationwide. Biden’s defense of IVF treatments was a shift in the messaging he had been delivering on reproductive rights for nearly two years, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision. He also lambasted former President Donald Trump and other Republicans for boasting about having nominated three of the Supreme Court justices that helped overturn the nearly 50-year constitutional right of access to abortions.  Biden highlighted two guests of First Lady Jill Biden to hammer home the issue, including Kate Cox, a mother from Texas who had to travel out of state for a medically necessary abortion. Cox was seated with First Lady Jill Biden. “Her own life and ability to have children in the future were at risk,” Biden said. “It’s happening to too many others.” He warned that many Republicans in the room were promising voters that they would pass a national abortion ban. “My God what freedom else will you take away?” Biden said, fumbling his words slightly. Biden also introduced Latorya Beasley, a woman from Alabama, who had to stop her IVF treatment after the court decision. “Let’s stand up for families like her,” Biden said. Biden said that he believed Roe V. Wade “got it right” in securing access to abortion in the country, and emphasized that if voters elect Democratic majorities in the House and Senate in November, he would push for a law enshrining nationwide the same protections to abortion access that Roe had guaranteed. “Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America,” Biden said. “Women are not without electoral power—excuse me—electoral or political power,” he added, referring to a line from Justice Samuel Alito’s 2022 opinion that overturned Roe. “You are about to realize just how much you were right about that.""

Thailand’s New Abortion Access Law Is Part of a Bigger Trend,Sanya Mansoor,World;abortion,"October 27, 2022 5:56 PM EDT","Thailand’s Public Health Ministry legalized abortions up to the 20th week of pregnancy on Thursday—an extension of a previous law which allowed termination of pregnancy within the first 12 weeks. That 12-week allowance came as a result of a law expanding abortion rights enacted last year. These laws are a massive step for a country that criminalized abortion as recently as February 2020, when The Constitutional Court of Thailand ruled that anti-abortion laws are unconstitutional. Between 2015-2019, there were more than 1.3 million pregnancies in Thailand annually, of which 679,000 were unintended and 437,000 ended in abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research firm that tracks abortion policy and supports reproductive rights. Pro-choice advocates in Thailand and around the world celebrated the new rules as a positive development, but noted that more needed to be done to ensure doctors were trained and the public was made aware of their rights to an abortion. “Nothing about this is going to change overnight,” says Dr. Angel Foster, a professor at the University of Ottawa and global abortion researcher who has worked on abortion care in Thailand. Foster points out that it is necessary to ensure incoming and current doctors receive adequate abortion procedure training and the public has clear mechanisms to obtain this care. Experts note that Thailand’s move to expand abortion access comes amid a wave of expansion of abortion rights in recent years, globally. A court order in South Korea led to the decriminalization of abortion in 2021. The same year, Mexico’s Supreme Court voted to decriminalize abortion. And in 2020, Argentina legalized abortion following the passage of a law. “There is a definite global trend,” says Dr. Susheela Singh, vice president for Global Science and Policy Integration at the Guttmacher Institute. “Thailand is a part of this global trend and is in good company.” She notes that over roughly the last two decades, more than 50 countries have changed their laws to expand abortion access and only three–including the U.S.–have gone in the other direction. In the U.S., the elimination of the constitutional right to an abortion—triggered by fall of Roe v. Wade in June—has led to a drastic decrease in access across the country. In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro’s government introduced requirements that medical professionals collect evidence and report to police those who seek a legal abortion after rape. And in 2021, Poland enacted a near-total ban on abortion, barring cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life is at risk. Some Asian countries have strict abortion rules in place as well; the procedure is completely banned in the Philippines and Laos. Read More: The State of Abortion Rights Around the World Thailand’s extension in abortion access to 20 weeks is significant, even though it’s less common to have a second trimester abortion, Singh says. “This small group is responsible for the majority of the most serious complications and even death in settings where you can’t access an abortion.” Younger people are more likely to seek later term-abortions, according to Anu Kumar, president and CEO of Ipas, an organization that aims to expand access to safe abortion and contraception around the world. “Expanding to 20 weeks allows more time to gather information, support, money, and care needed,” Kumar says. The Bangkok Post wrote in an editorial column that while the new rules “puts the pendulum swinging in the right direction,” it is “far from providing sufficient safe and legal abortion services to those who need them.” They argue there aren’t enough resources to manage abortions and that societal attitudes—even among medical professionals—still need to change. “As of August, Thailand had 110 healthcare units capable of providing abortion services, and most of them were only familiar with performing abortions on women less than 12 weeks pregnant,” it stated. Moreover, many hospitals may still hesitate to provide these services; The Post noted that last week deputy director-general of the Department of Public Health Dr. Ekachai Piensriwatchara said some state officials refuse to work in this area because of the stigma around abortion. “This is an important step in the right direction to expand access to facility-based abortion care,” says Foster, “but there will be many more steps for access to truly be realized.” Write to Sanya Mansoor at sanya.mansoor@time.com",https://time.com/6225758/thailand-abortion-access/
"With Roe Gone, Here’s How to Save Abortion Rights",Ideas;Julie F. Kay,Ideas;abortion,"June 26, 2022 11:24 AM EDT","The Supreme Court confirmed what was long suspected: Roe v. Wade is dead. No time for mourning, let’s get to work on what we must do to save our fundamental reproductive rights. First, let’s take a moment to unpack the Court’s ruling. An ultra-conservative Supreme Court majority has abolished the federal constitutional protections for abortion rights. There is no longer a floor for abortion rights. There are no longer any limitations on how far a state can go to restrict or prohibit abortion. Justice Alito’s majority opinion claims to be simply returning the decision about whether to criminalize abortion into the hands of state legislators to make law for women and girls within their borders. Justice Kavanaugh adds that the constitution is “neutral” on the abortion issue. But this blatantly ignores the Court’s historic and central role as protector of our fundamental rights. Policy analysts predict that as many as 26 states will now outlaw abortion, half of which may be effective immediately. Vast abortion deserts will exist nationwide. We can expect to see a disproportionate number of women of color subjected to criminal charges related to pregnancy. Justice Alito’s opinion shamelessly reverses direction on decades of Supreme Court precedent that had moved to curtail sex and gender discrimination and recognize greater rights for women and LGBTQ+ individuals. In doing so it puts at risk a whole family of privacy rights cases, including Roe’s jurisprudential cousins that protect the right to contraception and marriage equality. As the dissenting opinion by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan notes, the majority telling us “not to worry” about the eradication of abortion rights, is like someone “telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse.” Indeed. The Court shows its true colors when it ruminates that it is “hard for anyone —and in particular, for a court — to assess…the effect of the abortion right on society and in particular on the lives of women.” Really? Stop any woman on Main Street, USA or in any college dining hall and I’m pretty sure she could easily tell you the importance of legal abortion to her well-being and her ability to control her own destiny. The right to access abortion is at its core about controlling whether, when and with whom to have a child or not. It is a human right that is essential to a person’s dignity, bodily autonomy and freedom from sex discrimination. As the dissent aptly notes, the majority’s opinion “reveals how little it knows or cares about women’s lives or about the suffering its decision will cause.” Fortunately, the Court majority opinion is a minority viewpoint in our country. The most recent polling data show that 66% of Americans do not want Roe to be overturned. And that number has grown since the Dobbs draft was leaked last month. Let’s pull ourselves up by our pantsuits and get to work. First, this election season we all need to vote to elect bold and inspired federal, state and local officials who will act with urgency to facilitate access to abortion. Protecting abortion rights does not require every red state to turn blue and we can’t be party purists. In every debate or candidate meet-and-greet, ask the candidate to say what they will do now, proactively, to protect reproductive health and well-being. Read More: The Future of Abortion After Roe The midterm elections for Congress are an obvious first step: gaining an abortion rights majority in the Senate would allow passage of the Women’s Reproductive Health Act. Yet there is no exclusively federal solution, state and local elections matter, too. Governor races nationwide will be key to expanding abortion rights. We have the opportunity to elect a six-pack of women with demonstrated leadership in expanding reproductive freedom: in Michigan (Governor Gretchen Whitmer), Georgia (Stacey Abrams), Massachusetts (Attorney General Maura Healey), Maine (Governor Janet Mills), Kansas (Governor Laura Kelly) and New York (Governor Kathy Hochul). Let’s add Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers as honorary members of this necessary-governors club. Regardless of where you live, support candidates in key elections nationwide and at all levels. In Texas’ Attorney General contest, Rochelle Garza has a good chance to beat Ken Paxton if we grace her with our dollars, postcards and phone calls. On the local level, in Hennepin County Minnesota, candidate for County Attorney Saraswati Singh speaks passionately about prioritizing police accountability and prosecution of violent crime rather than locking up women who take their health care into their own hands. Praise-worthy prosecutors from Virginia, Michigan and Austin, Texas likewise have stood up to declare that they will not enforce unjust laws criminalizing pregnant people and those who help them end a pregnancy. These candidates if elected, will have a ripple effect of preserving reproductive freedom for many. Next we need to help women from states whose legislators are banning abortion: send lawyers, pills, and money. We need lawyers to defend the women, girls, pregnant people, and those who help them when they are faced with criminal charges. Medication abortion pills are needed to safely end a pregnancy without resorting to back-alley abortions that were prevalent during the pre-Roe years. The FDA can help by easing medically unnecessary restrictions on these vital medicines. Money is key to support those who are forced to migrate for abortion services. Non-profit abortion funds such as Access Reproductive Healthcare Southeast, Women’s Reproductive Rights Access Project, and Brigid Alliance assist with medical fees, lodging, transportation, childcare, and other travel expenses. They will all need infusions of private philanthropy and public funding now more than ever. Blue states facing the swell of abortion refugees’ arrival must immediately expand their number of available abortion facilities. Allowing urgent care clinics or, as California already has, mandating public university health care services, to make abortion services available, is key. Permitting certified nurse midwives and physician assistants to offer medication and surgical abortion – as a handful of states already permit — will go a long way to easing the shortage of physicians and can reduce costs. State governments including New York and California have provided public funds to assist people traveling for abortions; effective models that should be replicated. In the streets and in the corporate board rooms we must work to remove the stigma of abortion and frame it as the pressing human rights issue it is. The call to acknowledge abortion as a human right is what has worked in Ireland, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, and countries worldwide where the Green Wave of activists has successfully decriminalized abortion. Here in the U.S., the reproductive justice movement, founded by women of color in the 1980s, has decades of experience in advancing abortion as part of a package of rights to have and raise children in safety and with adequate resources. It’s time all of us joined in speaking loudly and proudly about what abortion means to us, our freedom, our lives, and our loved ones. Now is not a time to bemoan what we’ve lost but to get to work to build back better, and fairer, access to true reproductive freedom.

Here’s What Justice Kennedy Thinks About Abortion,Charlotte Alter,Politics;scotus,"March 2, 2016 12:28 PM EST","The future of abortion rights in America will likely be decided by Justice Anthony Kennedy, 79, a conservative whose previous rulings indicate a profound ambivalence about the issue. On March 2nd, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Whole Women’s Health vs. Hellerstedt, which some experts are calling the most important abortion case in a generation. The Court will decide whether to uphold HB2, a Texas law that imposes so many restrictions on abortion-providing clinics that it would likely result in the closure of three-quarters of the clinics in Texas. About half of Texas’s clinics have already been shuttered since HB2 was passed in 2013. That number could be halved again if the law is allowed to go into full effect, leaving fewer than a dozen clinics. There are more than 5 million Texas women of reproductive age. Kennedy will likely be the swing vote on whether these restrictions are allowed to stand. The four liberal Justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen G. Breyer, are likely to side with the clinics, while the three conservative Justices, John G. Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas, are likely to side with Texas. If the court is split 4-4, the Texas law will go into effect. The state’s case to uphold the law is being argued by Texas solicitor general Scott Keller, who clerked for Justice Kennedy early in his career. In roughly 30 years on the Supreme Court, Kennedy has twice ruled on abortion. In Planned Parenthood vs. Casey in 1992, Kennedy initially sided with the conservative justices upholding abortion restrictions before switching his vote to the plurality opinion—a decision with no clear majority—which ruled that restrictions on abortion could stand as long as they don’t create an “undue burden.” That plurality opinion included the following statements: An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability. And: As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion, but may not impose unnecessary health regulations that present a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion. And included an oft-quoted statement, which many scholars have attributed to Kennedy: These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Taken together, some scholars say this suggests that Kennedy might be inclined to strike down the Texas restrictions, especially since major medical groups like the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have filed an amicus brief calling HB2’s restrictions “medically unnecessary.” But Kennedy’s ruling in a 2007 abortion case suggests that he’s more conflicted than it might appear. In Gonzales vs. Carhart, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion upholding Congress’s ban on a form of late-term abortion which the legislation refers to as “partial-birth abortion.” His lengthy opinion makes it clear he’s deeply troubled by the details of this procedure. In upholding the ban, he described the gruesome-sounding details of later-term abortions at length, and repeatedly wrote that the state has at least some responsibility towards unborn children: Where it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn. And he added speculation that some women might regret their decisions, a statement that has been widely slammed as patronizing and towards women who choose to have abortions. While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained.  That statement inspired a series of amicus briefs filed on behalf of clinics that perform abortions in the case at hand, including several briefs filed by prominent women who say they do not regret their abortions, but in fact credit them for allowing them to go on to live their fullest lives. Those briefs seem to be directly aimed at Kennedy, using the same “equal dignity” rhetoric he used in his gay marriage opinion. And the personal nature of the briefs also seems targeted to Justice Kennedy, especially since many scholars say his landmark opinion on gay marriage may have been inspired by the fact that he knew and respected several gay people in his personal life. But Kennedy’s 2007 ruling indicated a deep discomfort with later-term abortions, not necessarily abortion itself–currently the vast majority of states restrict abortions in the third trimester to those that threaten the life or health of the mother. Kennedy’s 1992 ruling on Casey didn’t seem to be as disturbed by the details of early-term abortion procedures. Considering that this case is more about abortion in general than a particular type of later-term abortion, that distinction bodes well for Whole Women’s Health.

France Eases Abortion Restrictions in Sweeping Equality Law,Alexandra Sifferlin,Living;gender equality,"August 6, 2014 2:45 PM EDT","France passed legislation this week allowing women to get abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy with no questions asked, lifting previous restrictions as part of a sweeping and historic law meant to increase gender equality in the country. Previously, a French woman could only get an abortion if her condition put “her in a situation of distress.” The new law, signed Tuesday by French President François Hollande, also ensures women can access information about obtaining abortions, Reuters reports. The legislation provides protections for domestic abuse victims and supports more equal division of childcare and representation in politics. And it strives to creates a more equal job environment by encouraging men to take paternity leaves. “At a time when women in many parts of the world, including in the United States and Spain, are seeing their rights restricted, violated, and disrespected, France has set an important example for the rest of the globe with its progressive stance toward reproductive health care,” Lilian Sepúlveda, director of the Global Legal Program at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. “Ensuring a woman’s right to control her fertility is fundamental to achieving gender equality. But passing today’s law is just the first step—we now look to French policymakers to ensure women see the benefits of this historic law implemented this year.” When the law was initially introduced, France’s minister for women’s rights Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told the Guardian: “I don’t believe that history is going to spontaneously take us forward, so going towards more equality needs us to be politically proactive.” [Reuters] Contact us at letters@time.com",https://time.com/3086892/france-abortion-law-gender-equality/

Trump Made False Claims About ‘Late-Term Abortion.’ Here Are the Facts,Katie Reilly,Politics;Donald Trump,"February 12, 2019 2:35 PM EST","Amid concerns over the future of abortion rights, state lawmakers in New York and Virginia have debated legislation that would make it easier for women facing serious health risks or fetal complications to get an abortion in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. At a campaign rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday, President Donald Trump criticized those bills, making false claims about how they work. Enacted in January, the New York law allows a woman to get an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy if her health or life is threatened or if the fetus would be unable to survive outside the womb. Under previous state law, a woman could only get an abortion after 24 weeks if her life was at risk. Anti-abortion advocates have condemned the law as an “extreme” expansion of abortion rights. On Monday, Trump echoed critics who have falsely claimed that the bill would allow a woman going into labor to have an abortion. “Democrats are also pushing extreme late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother’s womb right up until the moment of birth,” Trump said in his speech Monday night. But medical experts say that’s not accurate. Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an obstetrician-gynecologist and a board member from Physicians for Reproductive Health, told TIME last week that arguments about women getting abortions while in labor are a “gross mischaracterization” of abortion care. “It’s not something that any person would come seeking, and it’s not something that any doctor would provide,” she said. The proposed Virginia bill, which has been tabled, would have reduced existing restrictions on later abortions if a woman’s health is threatened. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist, defended the bill with a confusing explanation about how a doctor would handle a woman going into labor if her pregnancy involved “severe deformities” or a “fetus that’s nonviable.” “The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired,” Northam told the radio station WTOP. “And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” Critics have falsely claimed that Northam’s comments indicated support for infanticide, an argument he called “shameful and disgusting.” At the El Paso rally, Trump echoed that language as well. “The governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable and then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby,” Trump said. Abortion rights advocates have defended the New York law as necessary for patients who previously had limited options for care if their pregnancies became complicated by health risks or serious fetal problems. Women who have had abortions later in pregnancy have also spoken out about their experience. “While these cases are incredibly rare and specific to each patient’s unique circumstances, they are being broadly misrepresented and are playing an outsized role on the national stage,” dozens of patients said in an open letter published last week. “We are not monsters. We are your family, your neighbors, someone you love. We are you, just in different circumstances.” In his State of the Union address last week, Trump called for a federal ban on “the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.” That standard has been used in some states to ban abortion around 20 weeks into pregnancy, but scientific research has found that “fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester,” which begins around the 28th week. Late-pregnancy abortions remain rare. Just 9% of abortions take place after the first trimester of pregnancy, and only 1% of abortions take place at 21 weeks or later, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that advocates for reproductive rights.

That Texas Abortion Case Is Even Worse Than You Think,Philip Elliott;More From TIME,Politics;The D.C. Brief,"December 15, 2023 7:00 AM EST","This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. So much of the national conversation this week has been about Kate Cox, the 31-year-old mom who had to flee Texas to have an abortion to end a doomed pregnancy as the state's Supreme Court slowly decided to substitute its judgment for her doctor’s advice. But what’s been missing from most of the talk about this case is this reality: Texas has at least three separate laws on the books designed to make getting an abortion nearly impossible. Those overlapping, vague statutes not only create one of the most restrictive environments in the country for reproductive rights, but shaped Cox’s case in ways that many following her ordeal likely missed. It also shows how even minor details can matter, especially when judges have political bents and time is an urgent component. To understand the lay of the land that Cox, her family, and her doctor were facing, we need to look at what Texas lawmakers put in place before Dobbs, the 2022 case that invalidated a half-century of protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade. A year earlier, Texas passed a so-called “trigger ban” that would outlaw abortions should the Supreme Court overturn Roe. We’ll call this Ban A. It serves up a felony life sentence for health care providers who perform abortions and a $100,000 fine. A second 2021 law—let’s call it Ban B—was a novel attempt at effectively banning most abortions in Texas without waiting for the Supreme Court to give permission, and it largely succeeded. That law runs along civil lines by deputizing neighbors and strangers to enforce it through lawsuits. Under Ban B (also known as S.B. 8), even an Uber driver who ferries a customer to a place where abortions are performed can be civilly charged. Critics have labeled it a Bounty Law. Yet unlike Ban A, Ban B isn’t a complete ban, though it functions as one in practice. It blocks most pregnant individuals from seeking an abortion after about six weeks, or when lawmakers decided there exists a beating “fetal heart”—a term doctors do not use, because a fetus at that point does not yet have a heart. (What abortion opponents describe as a heartbeat at that stage is actually the electrical impulses developing cells start to emit.) Finally, there is Ban C, which are the pre-Roe laws in Texas, dating back to the state’s first criminal code of 1857. At that time, the state had a ban on abortion—including the funding of it—except in cases when the pregnant person’s life was at risk. The penalty? Five years in prison for those providing the care. Texas officials have asserted that those laws snapped back into effect when Roe fell. All three abortion bans include language that provides exceptions when the health of the pregnant person is in question, although the specific definitions and conditions are different and vague. (None, it also should be noted, holds the pregnant party criminally liable.) This all created a legal and medical minefield for Kate Cox, the Dallas-area mother of two who has been public about wanting, in her words, “a large family.” When Cox and her family learned the fetus she was carrying had tested positive for a genetic condition that almost always results in a miscarriage or stillbirth, she took action. She had already been to the hospital four times in two weeks seeking emergency attention and worried what this troubled pregnancy would mean for her future potential; her doctor agreed that an abortion would leave her with the greatest potential for a pregnancy at a future date. But Cox’s situation ran afoul of Ban B, the law that bans most pregnancies after about six weeks in the name of the “fetal heartbeat” threshold. And remember, under Ban B, anyone who helps Cox get an abortion could be liable for a civil lawsuit by a complete stranger. It also, of course, might have been considered an illegal abortion under Ban A, the trigger ban, meaning her doctor could be jailed for life and fined at least $100,000. Or maybe just Ban C, meaning only five years in jail. All of this explains why not only Cox, but her husband, and her doctor wanted to have her standing resolved and some protections put in place for her future, and theirs. A district judge agreed with those concerns last week, allowing Cox to move forward with receiving an abortion. Then Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton lept to action. He asked the Texas Supreme Court to step in and enforce the state’s anti-abortion bans—all of them. For good measure, he gave notice to area hospitals and doctors that they would face felony prosecutions and civil penalties if they helped Cox.  The state Supreme Court—all nine elected Republicans, mind you—heard the case and sided on Monday with Paxton, who said Cox’s case didn’t meet the medical exception. They said the proper standard for allowing the termination of a pregnancy, then at 20 weeks, was enshrined in law as a “reasonable medical judgment.” Cox’s doctor, by contrast, said she held a “good-faith belief” that Cox met the exception. The court, however, said the “good-faith belief” was incompatible with the law’s standard of “reasonable medical judgment” that Cox faced a life-threatening condition. (Of course, neither are defined in any of the state’s bans, giving hair-splitting Paxton a win because the doctor didn’t use the magic words.) The justices then entered Kafkaesque territory—implying that if an abortion was actually needed, it would have already been done, and asking the state medical board for guidance—advice, of course, that doesn’t change the law’s text.  Given the GOP’s partisan monopoly in Texas, the outcome was largely expected. So much so that Cox had already fled Texas to receive an abortion in another state while awaiting the ruling. Stories like Cox’s are just the tip of the iceberg in a post-Dobbs world. Twenty one states have banned abortion or restrict the procedure earlier in pregnancy than Roe allowed. Texas went from reporting more than 50,000 abortions in 2020 to 34 recorded through September of this year, according to state health statistics. Polling shows Texans don’t love the new limits, but Republicans dominate the political and judicial landscape. And a conservative U.S. Supreme Court seems completely fine with such restrictions. Even before Dobbs, they had blessed Texas’ legally thorny efforts with Ban B, creating a model that other red states have followed. But the developments this week speak to the problems when laws lack definition and are left in the hands of partisan interpreters. Talk to anyone who reads—or writes—laws for a living, and there are two clear camps in state capitol buildings or here in Washington: the detail-obsessed nitpickers who want the legislation on their desk to define all of its terms or at least point to previously passed definitions; and the ambivalent regulationists who are happy to let bureaucrats frame the scope through rulemaking. Lacking definitions can give wide wiggle room to folks like Cabinet secretaries, agency administrators, and, yes, even judges. Incomplete legislative text yields imprecise readings and incomplete legal recourse for situations like the one facing Cox. And, in that gray area, abortion foes can have tremendous power in leaving things vague, especially in a state when there are at least three anti-abortion laws in play. It provides for loopholes that can be exploited by anyone with enough imagination, nitpickery, and endurance. And it’s exactly the thing that specific-minded folks wandering legislative hallways spend their nights obsessing over. Because if there had been some specificity in Texas’ law, and had any of the bans grappled with the other ones still on the books, Cox would not have been forced to flee in a high-profile case that, in most states, would have been handled in the privacy of the doctor’s office. So the next time either party complains about the size of legislation—so many pages!—understand that a good chunk of those pages are probably defining terms that really, really matter.
