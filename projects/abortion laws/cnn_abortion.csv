      Alabama grants Muslim death row inmate’s wish to forgo autopsy after execution

            Alabama will forgo an autopsy on a Muslim death row inmate who sued the state, saying the procedure following his execution by lethal injection next week would violate his religious beliefs.
    
            Keith Gavin, who is set to be executed next Thursday or Friday, said in the lawsuit an “invasive autopsy” violated his “sincerely held religious beliefs,” as well as Alabama state law, according to the complaint filed by his attorneys last month.
    
            Gavin is a devout Muslim, the complaint said, and his religion “teaches that the human body is a sacred temple, which must be kept whole.” An autopsy, he argued, would desecrate his body and “violate the sanctity of keeping his human body intact” along with his right to the free exercise of his religion.
    
            On Friday, Alabama Department of Corrections spokesperson Kelly Windham Betts told CNN: “No autopsy will be performed on Keith Edmund Gavin. His remains will be picked up by the attending funeral home.”
    
            CNN has reached out to Gavin’s attorneys for comment.
    
            Among those named in the lawsuit were Escambia County District Attorney Steve Billy, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm and Terry Raybon, warden of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility where Gavin is on death row.
    
            “We are working on a resolution,” the office of Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall told CNN this week. 
    
            The complaint had sought a judicial order preventing the defendants from performing the autopsy and requiring them “to respect Mr. Gavin’s constitutional rights and sincerely held religious beliefs.”
    
            The lawsuit claimed Gavin’s attorneys had repeatedly attempted to reach state officials in charge of the autopsy process regarding his request for his “earthly remains to be handled consistent with his faith,” but had received no response.
    
            Immediately after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed Gavin’s April 25 letter setting his execution date, the lawsuit said the defendants failed to respond to phone calls, emails and in-person visits or have declined to speak with Gavin’s attorneys.
    
            Under Alabama law, a medical examiner is required to investigate any death that takes place in any penal institution in the state, and the law gives discretion to state officials to order a postmortem autopsy if the death is “unlawful, suspicious or unnatural.”
    
            “This law is intended to establish with certainty the cause of death in any such event. After Mr. Gavin’s execution, there will be no question as to who or what caused Mr. Gavin’s death. The State will execute him by lethal injection,” the lawsuit argued.
    
            On Thursday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations – the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization in the country – called on Alabama officials to accept Gavin’s request.
    
            “In Islamic beliefs, autopsies are generally viewed as impermissible mutilation of the deceased but are permissible in cases of necessity and only to the extent required,” CAIR said in a statement.
    
            “The religious freedom guaranteed to every American in our founding documents does not cease to apply behind bars,” CAIR Research and Advocacy Director Corey Saylor said. “We urge Alabama state officials to accept Mr. Gavin’s request that his body not be autopsied after execution.”
    
            Alabama has faced scrutiny over its executions after multiple failed lethal injections prompted an internal review of the state’s capital punishment system in 2022.
    
            Ivey asked the state Department of Corrections to conduct a “top-to-bottom review of the state’s execution process” after the problems came into the national spotlight, CNN previously reported. The state resumed executions last spring after the review was completed.

      Trump says Burgum’s signing of near-total abortion ban in North Dakota is ‘an issue’
    ","

    ","
            Former President Donald Trump, nearing an announcement of his running mate, said Wednesday that “it’s an issue” that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed a near-total abortion ban in his state.
    
            The comments from the presumptive GOP nominee mark the latest insight he’s shared about some of the top names thought to be under consideration for his vice presidential pick ahead of next week’s Republican National Convention. He also weighed in Wednesday on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s residency, saying it “makes it more complicated” since they both live in the Sunshine State.
    
            Asked about Burgum as a potential pick, Trump told Fox News Radio, “It’s a little bit of an issue. It’s a pretty strong ban.”
    
            Trump, who wants abortion to be left to the states to legislate, has said he thinks Republicans who support hardline bans on the procedure have suffered at the ballot box in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, though he regularly champions his role in building the conservative court majority that made that decision.
    
            “You know, I think Doug is great. But it is a strong, he’s taken a very strong stance, or the state has, I don’t know if it’s Doug, but the state has, so it’s an issue.” Burgum signed the law, which only allows exceptions for rape or incest within the first six weeks of pregnancy, last year.
    
            Trump and Rubio both live in Florida, and while there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state, the Constitution dictates that state electors must vote for a president and vice president “one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.”
    
            Trump said Rubio’s residency wouldn’t preclude the senator from being the pick, but said, “It makes it more complicated. There are people that don’t have that complication. Now, it’s fairly easily fixed, but you have to do something with delegates, or there has to be a resignation, you know, etc., etc.”
    
            “So it’s not like picking some people where it’s very easy, where there is none of that,” Trump continued.
    
            Rubio said Wednesday that getting around the residency issue to serve as vice president is “not without precedent” and suggested he’d be willing to serve in the role. “At this time in our history, given everything that we’ve gone through, if someone has an opportunity to serve this country at that capacity, unless there’s some reason why you can’t do it, you almost have to say yes, especially if you care about public service as much as I do,” Rubio told Fox Business.
    
            Rubio spoke at Trump’s rally Tuesday at his golf course in Doral, Florida, where the former president continued to build suspense around his selection. “I think they probably think I’m going to be announcing that Marco’s gonna be vice president,” Trump said as he alluded to the media presence at his rally.
    
            Trump was also asked Wednesday whether Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance wouldn’t be his pick because of his beard after a report from The Bulwark about Trump not liking facial hair.
    
            “No, I’ve never heard that one,” Trump said, adding that he thought the Ohio Republican “looks good” and “looks like a young Abraham Lincoln.”
    
            Trump has said in recent interviews that he wants to announce his running mate at the GOP convention, which is taking place next week in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but said it could also happen right before the convention.
    
            The presumptive GOP nominee, who has said he doesn’t think President Joe Biden would exit the presidential race, said Wednesday during the radio interview that he hoped Biden would be the Democratic nominee because, “We planned for him.”
    
            Trump suggested in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Monday that uncertainty around Biden’s status as the Democratic nominee was a factor in his running mate selection.
    
            “I haven’t made final decisions, but I have some ideas as to where we’re going. And a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they’re doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference. I don’t know, I’m not sure that it would,” Trump said.

      Opinion: Trump’s move to the center is stunningly transparent
    ","
			Opinion by Jill Filipovic

        9:49 PM EDT, Tue July 9, 2024
    ","
            Former President Donald Trump wants to win the White House back. And that means softening the Republican Party’s stated position on abortion rights — even if he and the GOP have no intention of actually following through. Trump’s obvious posturing toward the center was evident on Monday, when the Republican National Committee’s platform committee approved a draft that included language apparently moderating the GOP stance on abortion and same-sex marriage
    
            Trump seems to realize that the issue of abortion and other reproductive rights remains his and his party’s weakest, thanks only to their own incredible overreach. Trump appointed three conservative justices to the US Supreme Court, all of whom helped to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the national right to abortion in the US. That decision has proven disastrous on many levels— especially for women in Republican-run states who continue to suffer the consequences.
    
            A strong majority of Americans support abortion rights and many voters are livid and motivated.
    
            This is a big problem for Republicans, although much of the anti-abortion movement remains in denial and has been pushing for more bans and tighter restrictions. The result is that now America finds itself with abortions banned in more than a dozen states, and many of these  states have fought court battles to maintain strict laws or enact new ones; two were even decided (or really punted) by the Supreme Court this year. The GOP seems to want it both ways: strict and wildly unpopular abortion bans that they get credit for from the base, but no political price for unpopular policies that much of the rest of the country rejects.
    
            The 2024 Republican platform has not yet been published, and accounts suggest it is largely shaping up to be a document that does little more than pledge allegiance to Trump and his MAGA politics. That means a lot of vague hand-waving: Trump has never been a politician who is heavy on the policy specifics, or who even mentions more than a few issues (crime, the economy and immigration are his go-tos). He boasts about his role in overturning Roe, but doesn’t want to take responsibility for the blowback. And so, his strategy seems to be to pen a platform that backs off of abortion extremism.
    
            The draft platform suggests that abortion should be an issue left to the states, does not make mention of a national abortion ban as previous platforms have and, according to the New York Times, claims that the party backs “access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).” This is indeed a more moderate stance than the GOP has taken in the past.
    
            It also seems like a lie.
    
            The truth is that Republicans have had the chance to do all of these things already, and they haven’t. If leaving abortion to the states was the plan, why have Republicans pushed for national bans in Congress? Why has Trump suggested he would support a national 15-week ban? Why have Republicans supported laws that would ban not just abortion from day one, but could extend to IVF and many forms of contraception as well?
    
            Why, when given the opportunity to vote to protect contraception access, did Senate Republicans refuse? Why, when given the opportunity to vote to protect IVF, did Senate Republicans block the legislation from coming to a vote at all? Why have anti-abortion groups tried to ban the abortion pill, and why have many Republicans not only backed them, but taken it upon themselves to warn pharmacies that sell these pills? Why don’t Republicans seem to want to repeal a Victorian-era law that could criminalize abortion pills, and potentially contraception as well?
    
            The answer is presumably that Republicans don’t actually plan on moderating when it comes to abortion. They simply increasingly understand that they need to say the right things to get into office.
    
            Trump has given little indication that he cares about abortion rights one way or another, and he has flip-flopped on the issue throughout his life in the public eye. In 1999 he said he was “pro-choice in every respect,” even though he personally hated abortion.
    
            Since his 2016 campaign, it seems he has said whatever he thinks Republican voters want to hear. He backed a national 20-week ban and promised to appoint pro-life judges who he thought would overturn Roe. Earlier this year, he said a 15-week national ban sounded very reasonable; now he doesn’t seem to want to discuss it.
    
            Trump also seems to want to distance himself from Project 2025, a plan devised by the conservative group the Heritage Foundation, which aims to drastically reshape the federal government to better support a conservative agenda if Trump should regain the White House.
    
            “I have no idea who is behind it,” Trump said of Project 2025 on Truth Social. “I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.”
    
            Trump seems to have discovered that you have to say the right things if you want to be put in power, whether or not you actually plan on following through. He has proved he is not an honest or trustworthy man. So, we should assume that what Trump says in order to get elected gives us very little information on what he will actually do in office.
    
            The anti-abortion movement seems to understand this better than anyone. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told the New York Times that “The mission of the pro-life movement, for the next six months, must be to defeat the Biden-Harris extreme abortion agenda.” After that point, she presumably understands, Trump can do whatever he wants — including the extreme anti-abortion movement’s bidding.
    
            The anti-abortion strategy is clear: claim moderation, while in practice continuing to push radically unpopular and extreme policies. Voters have a choice: We can believe that Donald Trump and his GOP are saying. Or we can judge them on what they’re actually doing.

      The case of an abandoned newborn who died ran cold for 23 years. Texas authorities just charged her mother with manslaughter

    ","
            A newborn baby girl who was abandoned in a Texas ditch and left to die went unidentified for 23 years until authorities say they recently identified and charged her mother.
    
            The infant has been referred to as “Angel Baby Doe” by the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office since her body was discovered on November 18, 2001.
    
            The child was found wrapped in a jacket with her umbilical cord still attached off the side of a road between the towns of Alvarado and Burleson, Texas, south of Fort Worth, the Texas Attorney General’s Office said in a news release Monday.
    
            Authorities say she was born alive and likely outside of a medical facility.
    
            A person living in the area found the baby as they picked up cans along the side of the road, according to the release.
    
            The child died after authorities say the mother, later identified in September 2023 through DNA samples as Shelby Stotts, failed to receive prompt medical care after giving birth and failing to clamp the child’s umbilical cord, which “caused the child to bleed to death,” the attorney general’s office stated.
    
            Stotts was indicted on a second-degree manslaughter charge in relation to Angel Baby Doe’s death, the release stated.
    
            CNN was unable to locate contact information for an attorney representing Stotts.
    
            Prior to identifying Stotts, investigators had looked into several persons of interest over the past two decades in an attempt to identify the abandoned deceased child.
    
            “Various leads and tips have come in during those years, yet none have revealed her identity,” the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office shared in a 2021 Facebook post about the case.
    
            The previously cold case was revived in June 2021 after the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office submitted evidence to forensic genetic genealogy company Othram, according to the release.
    
            The company’s team developed a DNA profile for the baby and conducted extensive genetic genealogy research that provided law enforcement with new leads in the case, according to Othram.
    
            “Using this new information, a follow-up investigation was conducted leading investigators to potential relatives of the infant,” the company said in a news release.
    
            The investigation led to Stotts being identified as the baby’s mother.
    
            “After more than twenty years, we are closer to securing justice for Angel Baby Doe and ensuring that the person responsible for this tragedy is held accountable,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a release.
    
            Stotts will be prosecuted under laws that were in effect at the time of the child’s abandonment and death, according to the attorney general’s office.
    
            In 1999, Texas was the first US state to enact Baby Moses Laws, or safe haven laws, which allow mothers in crisis to safely give up their babies in safe, designated locations where the child can receive medical care until a permanent home is found, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.
    
            An arraignment hearing for Stotts is scheduled for July 23, court records show.

      ‘Summer House’ star Lindsay Hubbard announces pregnancy

            “Summer House” castmember Lindsay Hubbard is pregnant.
    
            The reality star announced the happy news via Instagram on July 4.
    
            “Trigger Warning: This post contains more fireworks than the 4th of July! WE’RE PREGNANT!!!!!” Hubbard captioned a picture of her holding a positive pregnancy test.
    
            “I truly believe the universe has a bigger plan and this is it!”
    
            Hubbard did not reveal who the father is, but said in the caption that she and her “boyfriend” are “are beyond excited to welcome our little #HubbCub this Holiday season 2024!”
    
            Last August, Hubbard was blindsided when her ex-fiancé, Carl Radke, ended their engagement on camera on the Bravo reality series. Even though the show followed the fallout of the relationship, the two will continue to film “Summer House” together this summer.
    
            After the breakup, Hubbard’s “Summer House” costar Paige DeSorbo advised her to “let him go,” and predicted that she would be pregnant and in a new relationship within a year. DeSorbo took to the comments section in Hubbard’s post to write, “My manifestation even scared me….congratulations.”
    
            During her time on “Summer House,” Hubbard has shown viewers her journey to becoming a mother. In 2022 she froze her eggs and she also documented a miscarriage she suffered.

      These are the states where abortion rights will – or could – be on the ballot in November
    ","

            This November, many voters across the country could take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, with organizers working to secure a wave of measures on the 2024 ballot aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion – and a few aimed at restricting it.
    
            Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion.
    
            Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions. They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision. Some are up against a handful of counter measures aimed at restricting abortion access, though similar restrictive measures have failed in the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years.
    
            Six states — Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York and South Dakota — have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming an abortion care desert. A six-week abortion ban replaced the state’s 15-week ban on May 1.
    
            After organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June.
    
            Organizers in other states across the country are working to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot.
    
            In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline this summer, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which are fundraising to secure the money to support the campaigns.
    
            Arizona and Montana have seen proposed measures protecting abortion access up to the point of viability, which doctors say is around 24 weeks into pregnancy. A potential measure in Arkansas would allow abortion up to 20 weeks into pregnancy or in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies.
    
            A potential measure in Missouri that seeks to broadly protect reproductive care could still make the ballot in November. An opposing measure to permanently ban abortion, however, never made it out of the state’s legislative session.
    
            A number of potential measures, like those in Arkansas and Montana, allow for abortion past the point of viability when deemed necessary by a doctor to protect a pregnant person’s life or health — though doctors and lawmakers have struggled to define exactly what type of medical emergencies would be allowed under the exception.
    
            A proposed measure to restrict abortion access in Pennsylvania seeks to establish that public funding can’t be used for the procedure, though it is unlikely to pass the state legislature.
    
            Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed.
    
            While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers – and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.

      Biden administration sends sharp reminder to doctors about obligation to provide emergency abortions
    ","
			By Jen Christensen, CNN

        5:18 PM EDT, Tue July 2, 2024
    ","
            In letters to health-care providers Tuesday, the Biden administration reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that pregnant people have access to emergency treatment, even if that treatment necessitates an abortion and the person lives in a state with an abortion ban.
    
            In the letters, US Department of Health And Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure reminded hospitals and provider associations of their legal duty to provide stabilizing medical care – or transfers, if appropriate – to all patients.
    
            The letters come soon after the US Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho’s strict abortion ban that had prompted at least one large hospital system to send some pregnant patients out of state via air transport to protect their health.
    
            Idaho’s ban criminalizes most abortions and does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion even if the patient’s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself, in most circumstances.
    
            The Biden administration argued that the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also known as EMTALA.
    
            The 1986 law requires all US hospitals that have received Medicare money — nearly all of them — to screen everyone who comes into their emergency rooms to determine whether the person has an emergency medical condition, without regard for their ability to pay for those services.
    
            The law also requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or transfer them to a facility that has that capacity. Hospitals must treat patients “until the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.”
    
            Pregnant people were singled out in the law in 1989, after reports that some hospitals were refusing to care for uninsured women in labor. Congress expanded EMTALA to specify how it included people who were pregnant and having contractions.
    
            In 2021, the Biden administration released the Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor’s duty to provide stabilizing treatment “preempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,” although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided.
    
            In July 2022, the Biden administration’s guidance clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition.
    
            Experts have said that the law around emergency treatment has been murky ever since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to make their own laws restricting abortions. Forty-one states now have abortion bans with only limited exceptions, and 14 states have total bans.
    
            Texas also sued the US government over its EMTALA guidance, and in 2022, a federal judge allowed the law to be blocked. The federal government has asked the US Supreme Court to review the law, and that case could go before the court next term.
    
            Although last week’s Supreme Court decision did not resolve the entire EMTALA matter, Tuesday’s letter to providers spells out that “EMTALA’s protections remain in place.” The letter reminds providers that state law is pre-empted if it prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life and health of the pregnant individual and if they seek medical help that necessitates an abortion.
    
            “No pregnant woman or her family should have to even begin to worry that she could be denied the treatment she needs to stabilize her emergency medical condition in the emergency room,” the letter says. “As health care providers, you know better than anyone how crucial it is for anyone experiencing a medical emergency to receive appropriate care and to receive it quickly. And yet, we have heard story after story describing the experiences of pregnant women presenting to hospital emergency departments with emergency medical conditions and being turned away because medical providers were uncertain about what treatment they were permitted to provide.”
    
            CMS says it will investigate all EMTALA complaints to make sure providers are following federal law. The agency also announced Tuesday that it had created an EMTALA complaint form in Spanish and had made it easier for people to file complaints directly at CMS.gov.
    
            CMS has created a website to help people understand exactly what protections are offered under EMTALA.
    
            If a provider is found to be in violation of EMTALA, CMS will offer one opportunity to come into compliance. Failure to do so may mean a fine or the loss of a Medicare provider agreement.
    
            The federal agencies said they will continue to educate the public about their rights to emergency medical care and will help support hospitals and health care professionals in their efforts to meet EMTALA obligations.
    
            “We will continue to do everything in our power to give you the clarity you need regarding the federal laws that protect you and your patients in emergency medical situations,” the letter says.

      Top leader of RNC Platform Committee entertained idea of imprisoning women who get abortions, opposes exceptions

            One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention’s platform committee, which shapes the party’s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them.
    
            Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention’s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party’s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party’s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump’s agenda for a second term.
    
            Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control.
    
            “The true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,” Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 – several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down.
    
            Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagles – a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, “The Conservative Case for Trump.”
    
            CNN’s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin’s radio show, “The Pro America Report,” from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin’s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade.
    
            “If the conversation is, ‘Well, should there be a federal ban?’ And the consensus is that there shouldn’t – I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, ‘Let’s ban abortion,’” he said in April 2024.
    
            Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states—drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday’s debate.
    
            “You have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,” Trump said during the debate.
    
            Trump also said that he “will not block” abortion medication if elected president.
    
            In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, “The Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.” Martin did not respond to requests for comment.
    
            Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions.
    
            Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother.
    
            “Don’t tell me to stop talking about abortion,” Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. “Don’t tell me that because you don’t think it’s a winner politically, I’m supposed to stop talking about abortion.”
    
            During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone’s podcast, Martin said he’s heavily involved in “every aspect” of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump’s campaign was attempting to soften the platform’s position on abortion.
    
            “The platform will respect life in every moment,” Martin told Stone.
    
            In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates’ framing – that it was about a woman’s right – women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open.
    
            “The late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, ‘If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.’ In other words, if you take their framing, it’s a woman’s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It’s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,” he said.
    
            Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana’s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down.
    
            “If you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes – I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,” he said.
    
            Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment.
    
            “What do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don’t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn’t be held liable in any way,” he said. “Some people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,” he said. “I certainly think that you’re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it’s a baby – I do – then you have to do something to protect the baby.”
    
            “You don’t just turn your back and say, ‘Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don’t care what they do to their family, that’s their family,’” he continued. “’I don’t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let ‘em starve to death.’ No, you don’t do that. You say, ‘We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it’…But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, ‘Hey, what are we gonna do here?’”
    
            Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl.
    
            “This 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,” Martin said. “I have said over and over again the examples that shouldn’t be the rule, right? You can’t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.”
    
            “I’ll just tell you, I think abortion’s wrong. I think it’s wrong because of morality. I think it’s wrong because of science,” he added.
    
            Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, “It’s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.”
    
            The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions.
    
            Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and “damaging,” repeatedly  criticizing the “loosey goosey regulation around pill abortion” and that it could be ordered via mail.
    
            Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe – even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra – and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth.
    
            The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor’s visit.
    
            Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform – along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration.
    
            The RNC’s platform typically details the party’s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention.
    
            The party’s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes.
    
            In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.

      Iowa Supreme Court upholds state’s 6-week abortion ban

    ","
            The Iowa Supreme Court ruled Friday to uphold the state’s abortion ban, which prohibits most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy.
    
            The ruling will dramatically restrict abortions in Iowa, where women were able to seek the procedure for up to 22 weeks as legal challenges played out against the six-week ban.
    
            The ban will prohibit physicians from providing most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. It includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant’s death. Exceptions will also be made for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days.
    
            The case is part of the larger political fallout around the issue of abortion since the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights in June 2022. The high court ruling allowed abortion rights to be determined by state governments. Several bans were quickly met with challenges from abortion rights groups, and many are still being litigated, including in Utah, Ohio and Wyoming. And on Thursday, the Supreme Court blocked the enforcement of Idaho’s strict abortion law.
    
            Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds celebrated the ruling Friday, saying she is glad the state’s high court “upheld the will of the people.”
    
            “As the heartbeat bill finally becomes law, we are deeply committed to supporting women in planning for motherhood, and promoting fatherhood and its importance in parenting,” Reynolds said in a statement, vowing to protect in vitro fertilization, which has become another flashpoint in the post-Roe abortion landscape.
    
            Reproductive rights group mourned Friday’s ruling, including the regional chapter of Planned Parenthood — one of the petitioners in the case — which called the decision “manufactured chaos and confusion” with health impacts that “are going to be around for generations to come.”
    
            “Iowans’ freedom to control their body and their futures has been destroyed,” Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central, said during a Facebook Live session following the ruling. “Politicians and the courts have successfully flexed their newfound power with the overturning of Roe to take away bodily autonomy.”
    
            The Emma Goldman Clinic, another petitioner in the case, warned that the ruling will have wide-ranging impacts.
    
            “This law will have a ripple effect beyond Iowa, as abortion clients throughout the Midwest will be displaced and forced to travel greater distances and wait longer in order to obtain abortion care,” the clinic said in a Facebook post.
    
            The Iowa ban was passed in July 2023 during a special legislative session called solely to pass abortion restrictions, after the state Supreme Court declined to lift a block on a similar 2018 bill. The 2023 ban immediately faced challenges from the local Planned Parenthood and American Civil Liberties Union chapters, along with other reproductive rights advocates. A state district court temporarily blocked the measure three days after it went into effect.
    
            Attorneys for the state argued in a brief that Iowa’s constitution “does not recognize a fundamental right to an abortion” and as a result, the abortion ban doesn’t “implicate a fundamental right.” Thus, they claimed that the court must only establish whether the legislation has a “rational basis.”
    
            Reproductive rights advocates said that a law that restricts abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy will prevent most Iowans from accessing an abortion as many people do not know they are pregnant at that point.
    
            Even if some women determine they are pregnant before six weeks, they will face “substantial logistical and financial obstacles in arranging to have an abortion in Iowa before their time runs out,” attorneys for Planned Parenthood and the ACLU local chapter argued in a brief.
    
            With the ruling, Iowa joins nearly two dozen states that have banned or limited access to abortion. Florida, Georgia and South Carolina have similar six-week restrictions in place.

            Following the US Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, nearly two dozen US states have banned or limited access to the procedure. States where abortion is most limited report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity.
    
            The fight over abortion is well underway in state legislatures and courts. Most recently, the Iowa Supreme Court upheld a six-week abortion ban passed by the state legislature last year
    
            The Supreme Court ruled to allow emergency abortions in Idaho for now and unanimously rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s approach to regulating mifepristone, the first of two drugs used in medication abortion. The abortion pill will continue to be available to patients via mail, without an in-person doctor’s visit.
    
            CNN is tracking these legal challenges as they make their way through the courts. Here’s where abortion access currently stands in the United States.

      Opinion: I was denied a life-saving abortion at two hospitals. Here’s what I think of the Supreme Court decision

    ","
            My daughter was a promise for the future. I named her Maeve, after an Irish warrior queen, because I believed she was going to change the world.
    
            I’d wanted her desperately. When I found out I was pregnant, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. That first night, my now-husband and I sat together on our back porch in the dark, just taking it all in and thinking about how dramatically our lives would change.
    
            Little did we know.
    
            I had gotten pregnant in my 40s, so I knew my pregnancy was higher risk. And I did everything I could to make sure my pregnancy was healthy.
    
            I worked closely with my doctor, went to every ultrasound appointment, changed my diet and held my breath through those critical early weeks. When everything looked good at my appointment around 18 weeks, I felt like I could finally exhale.
    
            At 6:30 the next morning, I woke up to a large gush of fluid and bleeding, pain and cramping. I realized my water had broken — and far too early. My doctor told me to go straight to the emergency room where they confirmed the worst: There was no chance my daughter would survive, and I was in danger myself. Without emergency intervention to end my pregnancy, I was at risk for infection that could lead to sepsis, infertility or even death.
    
            But the hospital said they couldn’t provide the care I needed to save my life and health.
    
            Ignoring my doctors’ medical advice, the hospital refused to treat me, claiming its hands were tied because of Missouri’s abortion ban. They said there was nothing they could do unless my condition got even worse.
    
            In pain, terror and disbelief, I got back in the car with my husband. Frantic, we called hospitals in neighboring states, desperate to find somewhere that would take me.
    
            We drove nearly three hours to Kansas, where a doctor initially gave us the option to induce labor to lower my risk of infection and give us a few final minutes with Maeve, so we could hold her and say goodbye. The doctor left us to make our decision. In that moment, there was nothing I wanted more than the opportunity to say a loving farewell.
    
            Then, the doctor came back with a different story. These doctors’ hands, too, were tied because the situation was too politically heated.
    
            My life was in danger. My daughter’s death was inevitable. But the hospitals insisted that emergency intervention was impossible because the care I needed was an abortion.
    
            The cruelty still boggles my mind.
    
            Eventually, we found a clinic in Illinois that was willing to treat me. I’ll always be grateful for the kindness and compassion of the doctors who helped save my life.
    
            That was four days after my water broke. And those four days changed me forever.
    
            I’ve since moved out of Missouri to get away from the harrowing, traumatic memories — and away from the judgment of neighbors who heard I had an abortion and decided that I’d done something wrong. I’ve lost savings and struggled to pay my bills, first because of the work I missed while I was in crisis, then because of the aftermath — coping with medical complications and feeling so low that it was often impossible to get out of bed. My marriage has been tested; my dream of bearing a child has been shattered.
    
            After this ordeal, I learned about a federal law that should have prevented the hospitals from denying me the abortion care I needed. That law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, mandates that Medicare-funded hospitals must provide stabilizing care to all patients who come to the ER with an emergency condition. The care EMTALA requires has always included abortion. The law puts patients first and lets doctors decide what kind of care their patients need, no matter their circumstances, their zip code or their financial means.
    
            But after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, some hospitals began turning away people like me out of fear of political backlash or claims that the abortion care EMTALA requires is prohibited by state law.
    
            For its part, the Biden administration has made clear that the law requires hospitals to treat pregnant people who need emergency abortion care. Nonetheless, hospitals have continued to deny care, and some health care professionals have fled states with restrictive abortion laws, worsening maternal health care deserts and undoubtedly contributing to our country’s maternal mortality crisis.
    
            Today, the Supreme Court could have provided clarity that EMTALA protects pregnant patients in emergency situations, regardless of state law. Instead, the court dismissed the appeal, only temporarily allowing emergency abortions to take place in Idaho while the underlying lawsuit at the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals continues.
    
            Writing separately, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that she would not have dismissed the case. “Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,” she wrote. “It is delay.” The court left room for the possibility that in the future, others will be subjected to nightmares like mine.
    
            When I heard the justices debate during oral arguments just how much danger a woman has to be in before doctors can provide an abortion to save her — how many of her organs must fail, or how serious her infection must be — it made me sick. I cannot believe this court couldn’t even give women the bare minimum protection for our health and lives by permanently putting the chaos and confusion around EMTALA’s requirements to rest.
    
            No one should have to go through what I went through.
    
            Politicians and judges don’t belong in emergency rooms. It’s not their place to control my life or anyone else’s.
    
            If our courts won’t protect us, we have to protect ourselves. We must use our voices and our collective power to support a federal right to abortion that ensures all of us who need abortion care are able to get it from their compassionate providers. I look to our communities to undo the abortion stigma that pushes people like me into the shadows when what they need is love, compassion, and care. And I look to Maeve.
    
            My daughter was a promise I didn’t get to keep, but all of that love has to go somewhere. So now it’s going here. Into a story I wish I never had to tell, in hopes that someday we can ensure that no one ever endures suffering like mine again.

      Supreme Court decision allows pregnant people in Idaho to access emergency abortion care — for now
    ","

    ","
            Pregnant people in Idaho should be able to access abortion in a medical emergency in Idaho, at least for now.
    
            The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho’s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state’s law where it conflicts with federal law. With Thursday’s decision, the state would not be allowed to deny an emergency abortion to a pregnant person whose health is in danger, at least while the case makes its way through the courts.
    
            On Wednesday, the decision was mistakenly posted on the US Supreme Court website, and was first reported by Bloomberg News. The final opinion on Thursday was a sigh of relief, but doctors and legal experts acknowledged it’s a temporary reprieve.
    
            “Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a separate opinion. “It is a delay.”
    
            “Storm clouds loom ahead,” she wrote.
    
            Idaho’s strict ban criminalizes performing most abortions and does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion if the patient’s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself in most circumstances. The Biden administration argued that the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also known as EMTALA.
    
            EMTALA requires all US hospitals that have received Medicare money — essentially nearly all of them — to screen everyone who comes into their emergency rooms to determine whether the person has an emergency medical condition without regard for their ability to pay for those services.
    
            The 1986 law requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or to transfer them to another facility that has that capacity. The hospitals must also treat these patients “until the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.”
    
            Pregnant people were singled out in the law in 1989, after reports that some hospitals were refusing to care for uninsured women in labor. Congress expanded EMTALA to specify how it included people who were pregnant and having contractions.
    
            In 2021, the Biden administration released the Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor’s duty to provide stabilizing treatment “preempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,” although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided.
    
            In July 2022, the Biden administration’s guidance clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition.
    
            The Supreme Court’s decision means a hospital must provide an abortion if it’s medically indicated in an emergency situation, even in states that have abortion bans or restrictions that don’t provide an exception to protect the health of the mother – at least as the case makes it way through the courts.
    
            But the move would only delay the issue, says Molly Meegan, chief legal officer for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a professional organization that represents the majority of practitioners in the United States.
    
            “It doesn’t solve the problem at all. In fact, pregnant patients are still trying to obtain care and unable to get it, and physicians are trying to provide care without clear parameters and with draconian criminal penalties hanging over their heads if they get the question wrong,” she said.
    
            Dr. Stella Dantas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said that the Supreme Court’s decision shows exactly why clinicians need to be protected from outside interference in their relationship with patients, particularly when they need emergency care. Dantas said a law created by politicians that restricts a doctor’s ability to provide care in an emergency is like having someone who has never flown a plane create restrictions on what a pilot could do during a flight emergency.
    
            “If that person couldn’t do x, y, or z, when they were trained, in a split-second, if something flew into the engine, you wouldn’t feel safe, and it wouldn’t be the best for any of those people flying on a plane,” Dantas said at a news conference on Thursday.
    
            “This case has illustrated for many how critical abortion care is for all of us. For clinicians who care about their patients, for patients who may someday need an abortion and for the people that love them.
    
            “Depriving patients of evidence-based care is unacceptable.”
    
            Idaho’s abortion law had an immediate effect on hospitals in the state. On January 5, the Supreme Court lifted an injunction so Idaho no longer had EMTALA protections for pregnancy complications. St. Luke’s, the state’s largest provider of emergency services, said in April it had to send six pregnant patients from its emergency department out of state via air transport to protect their health.
    
            The year before, when the injunction was in effect, the hospital had to do this only once.
    
            Meegan said the law hasn’t just hurt patient care. Physicians have told the group that they are leaving the state because they don’t feel that they can practice medicine in a way that’s consistent with their ethical obligations, training and judgment.
    
            “It’s an untenable situation,” Meegan said.
    
            Dr. Kara Cadwallader, a doctor who works in Idaho and is a member of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, said that even last week, her hospital had to send a pregnant person out of state for care even though they typically could have treated her. She said Wednesday she was “very excited” about the ruling, even if it is a “small step.”
    
            “Beyond all the political reasons, it’s incredibly important for pregnant patients here in Idaho, who now will be able to access emergency care appropriately,” Cadwallader said.
    
            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said that with this decision, the Biden administration will continue to uphold the law and the right to emergency care. The administration also plans to make it easier for someone who is denied care to be able to file a complaint.
    
            “When the Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it unleashed an unprecedented assault on reproductive rights, and every day we see the consequences,” Becerra said in a statement. “Under President Biden’s leadership, we have worked directly with providers, hospitals, and community leaders across the country to navigate the chaos that the decision introduced.”
    
            Still, abortion regulations around the country are murky. Professor Elizabeth Sepper, of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that “in every other state with an abortion ban, confusion will continue to reign.”
    
            “Even where states have ‘health’ exceptions in their laws, they typically are narrower than what EMTALA requires,” Sepper wrote in an email.
    
            Forty-one states have abortion bans in effect with only limited exceptions, and 14 states have total bans. Around the country, doctors are confused about what they are allowed to do, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, a privately owned health care company that provides abortion care.
    
            “So this isn’t only about Idaho. This is really something that all eyes and ears are watching from multiple states across the country to try to figure out what we’re able to do to provide basic health care, even if abortion has been restricted,” Hagstrom Miller said.
    
            “Abortion saves lives. Abortion is absolutely necessary, oftentimes in emergency room settings to protect the health of the pregnant person. I think providers really understand that their hands have been tied post-Roe here, since the Dobbs decision, in numerous states and numerous parts of the country.
    
            Standard care for a woman who needs an emergency abortion does not vary from state to state, said Dr. Nisha Verma, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Emory University in Georgia. However, she said, the kind of care a patient will receive is totally dependent on where she lives.
    
            The Supreme Court’s decision in this case did not address the medical complexities this kind of care requires, and it will lead to confusion, fear and delays in what can be life-saving care, she said.
    
            “What we had really hoped for is the Supreme Court to come down very firmly that doctors should be able to provide care for patients, including in emergency situations where abortion care can often be needed to stabilize patients. I think that working here in Georgia, we are constantly in a state of confusion trying to navigate incredibly confusing laws with exceptions that just don’t make sense on the ground, that don’t take into consideration all of the complexity that we deal with every day,” Verma said.
    
            The ruling does not change the situation in Texas, reproductive legal advocates say. Texas sued the US government over EMTALA guidance, and in 2022 a federal judge allowed the EMTALA to be blocked. The federal government has asked the Supreme Court to review the law. That case could potentially go before the Supreme Court next term.
    
            “We should have never been in a place where states like Idaho, Texas, and others across the country could have state bans that seek to ignore federal law, forcing providers to forfeit their best medical judgment and second guess the care they can provide out of fear of criminalization and other penalties,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood said at a news conference Thursday. She called Thursday’s decision “supreme gaslighting” that will allow the court to come back to the decisions down the road, “perhaps leaving it for when it’s more politically convenient.”
    
            “Our bodies, lives and futures are still under deliberation,” McGill said.
    
            Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director of the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, said she sees Idaho as a “very cruel case study” of what happens when the law strips pregnant people of their right to emergency abortion care. She said Wednesday that she was disappointed in the ruling because the court had the opportunity to uphold a law that gives everyone access to care — but failed to do so.
    
            “The right to emergency care is perhaps one of the most basic rights there is,” Kolbi-Molinas said. “We were fighting for scraps in this case, and even with that, a majority of the Supreme Court was not willing to recognize the humanity of pregnant people, that they would be entitled to this basic right to emergency care.”

      Opinion: Don’t underestimate moms ahead of the 2024 election
    ","
			Opinion by Reshma Saujani
		","
  Published
        12:02 PM EDT, Thu June 27, 2024
    ","
            Kellyanne Conway was right.
    
            The Biden campaign got some bad news last week: His support among women, who helped deliver him the presidency in 2020, is shrinking. Despite Democrats betting big on abortion to turn out women, more women are focusing on inflation — and saying they were better off financially under former President Donald Trump.
    
            “Women are not single-issue thinkers,” Conway told The New York Times. “Therefore, they are not single-issue voters.” As  a lifelong Democrat and the founder of Moms First, a movement fighting for parents to get the support we need, I agree with Conway.
    
            Put another way, this isn’t going to be an “abortion” election or an “economy” election: 2024 is going to be the mom election.
    
            For months, parents have been citing inflation and personal finances as key factors in the upcoming election. And in the Federal Reserve’s annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, released last month, parents reported a sizeable downturn in their financial wellbeing since 2021.
    
            That decline is largely attributed to one key cost: child care. During the pandemic, parents had support, from the expanded child tax credit, which provided extra money for families and helped lift millions of children out of poverty, to subsidized care centers. Both have since lapsed, leaving many families to teeter on (or fall off) a “child care cliff.”
    
            In 2024, the cost of child care — the cost of motherhood — has become untenable.
    
            In every state, the average cost of child care is now higher than the average cost of rent, reaching obscene price tags that leave more than a third of parents with children under 18 resorting to credit cards or acquiring other debt. Nearly the same number are leaving the workforce or have left already due to the cost of care.
    
            Many politicians are, once again, missing the forest for the trees. They don’t see “motherhood issues,” such as child care and paid leave, as substantive, economic issues worth fighting for. And they don’t see abortion as a motherhood issue, even though 60% of people who’ve had abortions are mothers.
    
            Some politicians love to grandstand over family values while making it harder to plan a family: from failing to protect IVF, to forcing women to carry dangerous pregnancies (which could put the mother’s health at risk or impede their ability to have children in the future).
    
            But for many moms, the through line is obvious. At every stage of our lives, we’re losing agency over if, when, and how we choose to become a mom.
    
            These political maneuvers are about controlling the “life of the mother” — a phrase we used to hear a lot as an exception in abortion bans — which, in recent years, have been proven difficult to administer (although abortion bans generally don’t respect the mother’s life or autonomy anyway). The same goes for threats to restrict birth control that would likely lead to unplanned pregnancies, or paid leave deserts that force women back to work two weeks after birth, still bleeding.
    
            At each phase of a woman’s life — whether we’re 15, 35 or 55 — many are left distressed and distracted by these attempts to control us.
    
            But this also poses an opportunity for moms to build some political power.
    
            Motherhood can be the foundation for a powerful new political identity. If we organize as one bloc, we can fight for interconnected issues: abortion and inflation, minimum wage and universal pre-K, and every policy that affects the life of the mother. And maybe, finally, we can win them all.
    
            Many moms understand that “the life of the mother” isn’t just about abortion — though it remains, always, at the forefront of our advocacy. It’s about a whole slew of lifelong issues that affect our finances, our families and our freedoms.
    
            And we know that we can’t progress in one of these issues without championing all of them.
    
            It won’t be easy. For decades, moms have been divided — working moms versus stay-at-home-moms, single moms versus coupled moms, Moms for Liberty versus Moms Demand Action.
    
            But I have reason to hope that this bipartisan coalition is possible. Just this week, a Pivotal Ventures poll found that a majority of both Democrats and Republicans said they’re more likely to vote for a candidate if they know their position on caregiving.
    
            And mothers have long been on the front lines for the most important causes of our time — from racial justice and gun safety to criminal justice reform and climate change. We’ve proven that, when it comes to issues that matter to us, moms will find a way.
    
            So when Biden and Trump face off in Thursday’s debate, moms will be listening closely. Are they making empty promises? Are they dismissing us as “soccer moms”? Are they talking to us, as Conway put it bluntly, “from the waist down”?
    
            If moms come together as a united coalition, we can change the way politicians value us. Maybe, finally, they will see us as whole people, vie for our vote and treat us as the true, powerful constituency we are.

      Yet again, the Supreme Court’s controlled release of rulings is upended in a major abortion case
    ","
			By Tierney Sneed, CNN
		;Tierney Sneed","

        11:38 AM EDT, Thu June 27, 2024
    ","
            For the second time in two years, the public learned of where the Supreme Court was headed in a major abortion case before the justices had formally handed down their ruling, spoiling the court’s highly controlled protocols.
    
            The circumstances around Wednesday’s mistaken publishing of an apparent ruling in an Idaho abortion case are very different from the norm-busting leak of the 2022 draft opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade. But both disclosures showed the limits on justices’ ability to roll out controversial opinions on their deliberate and custom-oriented timetable.
    
            Typically, rulings are released on pre-scheduled opinion days with no forecast ahead of time of which cases are coming down. Those mornings, the justices gather in the court to read summaries of their opinions, which are posted online shortly as hard copies are distributed to the court’s dedicated press corps.
    
            Every day, agencies, businesses and organizations deal with the premature disclosure of internal information. But for the Supreme Court, it is viewed as a major departure from its culture of confidentiality if even the smallest nugget about what’s going on behind the scenes makes it into public view.
    
            The leak of the 2022 opinion overturning Roe – obtained and published by Politico nearly two months before the ruling was formally handed down – was a shocking breach of the storied cone of silence around the Supreme Court’s internal deliberations. It prompted endless speculation about the culprit and their political motives, with an investigation by the court’s marshal unable to identify the source of the leak. The internal probe did reveal that the court had surprisingly lax systems that allowed draft opinions to circulate among a wide group of people, with gaps in the technical security that was supposed to protect the court from such exposures.
    
            While much is still not known about how a version of the Idaho case ruling was accidentally posted online, it nonetheless comes as tensions at the court are running high, as the justices scramble to catch up with a backlog of undecided cases.
    
            The case in dispute is over whether Idaho can enforce its abortion ban in situations of serious emergency pregnancy complications that do not threaten the pregnant person’s life. The Supreme Court officially handed down the ruling on Thursday, after the court accidentally posted to its website a version of the opinion on Wednesday that was obtained and reported by Bloomberg.
    
            The majority opted to dismiss the case as “improvidently granted” – a move that allows the justices to duck the case’s legal questions while more proceedings play out at lower courts. The ruling, if and when formally handed down, means that an order from a trial judge that had blocked enforcement of Idaho’s abortion ban in medical emergencies will now go back into effect.
    
            After the mistaken posting of the opinion Wednesday, Supreme Court’s public affairs office acknowledged that a “document” was “inadvertently and briefly uploaded” by the court’s “publication unit.”
    
            “The Court’s opinion in Moyle v. United States and Idaho v. United States will be issued in due course,” court spokesperson Patricia McCabe said Wednesday, referring to the names of the consolidated case.
    
            It appears that the posting of the opinion Wednesday to the court’s website was the result of a technological mess-up that was easily traced back to the court and one that made the opinion public only a day before its official release.
    
            That sets it apart from the leak of the draft opinion reversing Roe, in a case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The disclosure seemed to be a purposeful move to get the opinion into the public domain. It happened several weeks before the final ruling came down, while the draft was still being polished and – perhaps – votes were not finalized.
    
            Still, both instances highlighted how things can fall through the cracks even at the country’s most opaque government institution and how 21st century technology can outpace the court’s practices.
    
            While the investigation into the Dobbs leak did not determine how the opinion got out, it revealed stunning lapses in the court’s informational security. At least 90 people had access to the draft, according to the marshal’s report. The probe found no indications of a hack, but the report said that there were issues with the court’s IT system that hindered the investigation.
    
            Follow-up reporting by CNN revealed that justices were known to use personal emails to send sensitive communications and that so-called “burn bags” to dispose sensitive physical documents went unused. Court employees we also able to print court documents on devices that did not create the “logs” meant to track the printing of documents.
    
            Earlier this term, an IT hiccup gave the public another unintended glimpse into how a separate blockbuster case came together. The case, a unanimous ruling in favor of former President Donald Trump’s challenge to Colorado’s removal of him from its ballot, featured a concurrence authored jointly by the three liberals.
    
            But metadata from the opinion showed that the concurrence started out as a partial dissent, authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, suggesting that it was a last-minute shift in the votes that got all nine justices signed on to the unanimous opinion.
    
            This story has been updated following the official release of the abortion ruling Thursday.

      Supreme Court allows emergency abortions in Idaho

            The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho’s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state’s law a day after the opinion was inadvertently posted on the court’s website in an astonishing departure from its highly controlled protocols.
    
            At issue in the case was a state law that banned abortions except for the life of the pregnant woman. The Biden administration argued that a federal law required hospitals to also provide abortions in cases where the health of a pregnant woman is at stake.
    
            The unsigned opinion drew a flurry of concurrences from conservative and liberal justices, who formed an unusual alliance to dismiss the case and temporarily block enforcement of Idaho’s strict ban. Though the decision was technically a loss for Idaho, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stressed in a partial dissent that the potential impact is likely to be short-lived.
    
            “Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,” Jackson wrote. “It is delay.”
    
            The decision sweeps abortion off the Supreme Court’s docket in the middle of a highly contested presidential election, even though the issue is almost certain to return to the justices. Earlier this month, the court dispensed with another abortion case, an appeal challenging expanded access to the abortion pill mifepristone. There, a unanimous court held that the anti-abortion doctors and groups who sued did not have standing.
    
            Almost as notable as the Idaho decision itself was the fact that the public received an early glimpse of the outcome when a version of the opinion was inadvertently posted online briefly. Bloomberg spotted the opinion and posted it online Wednesday before the court removed it.

            Our live coverage has ended for the day. Read up on the Supreme Court decision here or scroll through the posts below. 
    
            The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho’s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state’s law. The decision temporarily allows abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho.
    
            It comes a day after the opinion was inadvertently posted on the court’s website in an astonishing breach of protocol, marking the second time a major SCOTUS abortion ruling has been made public prematurely.
    
            Here’s what happened on Thursday:
    
            6-3 decision: The unsigned opinion released Thursday drew a flurry of concurrences from conservative and liberal justices. Though the decision was technically a loss for Idaho, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stressed in a partial dissent that the potential impact is likely to be short-lived. “Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,” Jackson wrote. “It is delay.” 
    
            If the Supreme Court wants to revisit the issues raised in the Idaho abortion case, it won’t have to wait very long — there is already an appeal pending on its docket from Texas.
    
            The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Texas this year in its challenge to the same federal hospital law at issue in the Idaho case. The Biden administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court but asked the justices to hold the petition until the court resolved the dispute in Idaho.
    
            The case will be fully briefed this summer and could be granted this fall, which would allow the court to consider a similar question after the November election.
    
            The Texas case has received considerable attention in recent days because abortion rights groups have noted that by not resolving the underlying questions raised in Idaho, the court has left those same issues pending in Texas, where lower courts have ruled against the Biden’s administration’s effort to require abortions in cases where the health of the pregnant woman is at stake.
    
            Idaho’s Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea warned that even with the Supreme Court ruling ensuring emergency abortion care in the state, Idaho still struggles to retain medical talent in maternal care.
    
            Dr. Caitlin Gustafson, president of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, said the “state’s health care system is in crisis,” given that over 20% of the obstetricians in the state have stopped practicing.
    
            She’s a family physician who has practiced medicine in rural Idaho for more than 20 years.
    
            Despite a ruling that would ensure emergency abortion care in Idaho, Democrats are continuing to criticize the broader lack of abortion access nationwide and the ambiguity that many health care providers experience.
    
            Democratic members issued a variety of reactions to the ruling, which involves a federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA):
    
            CNN’s Morgan Rimmer and Ted Barrett contributed to this story.
    
            This post has been updated with additional information.
    
            In its ruling on Thursday, the Supreme Court decided that it should not have taken up the case and dismissed the appeal over Idaho’s abortion ban. Abortion rights opponents are viewing this as a roadblock, not a final decision on the ban.
    
            “The outcome here is simply procedural in nature,” said Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. She also praised Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent and his interpretation that “Medicare-funded hospitals (must) protect the health of both a pregnant woman and her ‘unborn child.’”
    
            These groups have set their sights on the upcoming lower court arguments, maintaining their position that a federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act — or EMTALA — does not safeguard abortion access.
    
            Legal scholars have also highlighted a case in Texas that challenges the state’s abortion ban in cases of medical emergencies as another abortion dispute that the Supreme Court may intervene in.
    
            Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said reproductive health care remains “under attack” in the US, with the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade still impacting women. 
    
            Becerra said when the court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, “it unleashed an unprecedented assault on reproductive rights, and every day we see the consequences.”
    
            “We will continue to uphold the law and the right to emergency care, to inform people of their rights under EMTALA, and to make it easier for someone denied care to file a complaint,” he added. 
    
            The Biden campaign is planning to air an abortion-focused ad during one of the commercials breaks in CNN’s presidential debate tonight, a campaign official told CNN.
    
            The push comes as President Joe Biden is looking to use the debate to draw a contrast with former President Donald Trump on the issue of reproductive rights. 
    
            Democrats believe abortion rights can prove galvanizing for voters in November and have worked relentlessly to tie new restrictions on the procedure to Trump, accusing him of fomenting “cruelty and chaos” following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
    
            Biden’s campaign ads have often included personal testimonials from women impacted by state abortions bans. Following the Supreme Court’s dismissal of an appeal over Idaho’s strict abortion ban on Thursday, the campaign released a new TV spot featuring an Idaho obstetrician who left her state out of fear of potential criminal charges for treating patients with the restriction in place.
    
            “These laws are truly barbaric. They are putting us back decades, if not centuries,” Dr. Lauren Miller says in the ad. “Donald Trump did this. He put women’s lives in danger.”                   
    
            The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed emergency abortions in Idaho – for now – by blocking enforcement of the state’s law that bans abortions except for the life of the pregnant woman.
    
            Here are some key quotes from today’s ruling:
    
            Concurrence by Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and in part by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson
    
            Concurrence by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh
    
            Today’s Supreme Court order restores federally guaranteed access to emergency care to women in Idaho while the Justice Department continues to litigate the case, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Thursday.
    
            “The Justice Department will continue to use every available tool to ensure that women in every state have access to that care,” he said. 
    
            The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho’s abortion ban Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state’s law.
    
            The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTLA) guarantees essential emergency care to all Americans, regardless of the state they live in, Garland said in a statement released by the Department of Justice.
    
            While the Supreme Court ruling does temporarily protect the right to emergency abortions in Idaho, abortion rights proponents have been quick to point out that this decision does not guarantee universal access to the procedure.
    
            Groups have noted because the justices declined to resolve the underlying questions raised by the case, the question will almost certainly return — potentially as early as this fall.
    
            “The Court kicked the can down the road,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement to CNN. “The Supreme Court created this health care crisis by overturning Roe v. Wade and should have decided the issue.”
    
            Reproductive Freedom for All CEO Mini Timmaraju said that the court was “punting so that they didn’t need to weigh in before an election.” She also highlighted the contrast between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on the issue, encouraging abortion-rights voters to cast their ballots for the incumbent president.
    
            The American Civil Liberties Union also decried the decision, with deputy director of the Reproductive Freedom Project Alexa Kolbi-Molinas calling it “a dangerous preview for what could come.” 
    
            “This is not a time for applause,” Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said on a call with reporters. “This is the bare minimum that pregnant people and providers in Idaho deserve.”
    
            The court’s decision blocks Idaho from enforcing its strict on ban on abortions in emergency rooms, but the groups have noted because the justices declined to resolve the underlying questions raised by the case, the question will almost certainly return – potentially as early as this fall.
    
            Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, accused the court of treating “women’s lives like hot potato.”
    
            “It is clear that the court is seeking to avoid accountability in a critical year and is leaving the door wide open” to overturn further rights in the future, she said.
    
            For context: With ballot initiatives being put to voters across battleground states this November, these groups will likely use this ruling to rally support for reproductive healthcare. Similar ballot initiatives have been successful in guaranteeing abortion access in traditionally conservative states such as Kansas and Ohio.
    
            This post has been updated to include additional statements. 
    
            Dr. Stella Dantas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, expressed relief at the Supreme Court’s decision allowing pregnant people in Idaho to access emergency abortion care. However, she also noted that more needs to be done to overturn the state’s abortion ban and highlighted that doctors were still experiencing “interference” and confusion.
    
            “The entire ACOG community is breathing a little easier today, especially our colleagues from Idaho who’ve been suffering alongside their patients for the last two years,” Dantas said at a news conference on Thursday. 
    
            Dr. Nisha Verma, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Georgia, said the decision fell short of addressing the medical complexities and led to confusion, fear and delays in care.
    
            “What we had really hoped for is the Supreme Court to come down very firmly that doctors should be able to provide care for patients, including in emergency situations where abortion care can often be needed to stabilize patients. I think that working here in Georgia, we are constantly in a state of confusion trying to navigate incredibly confusing laws with exceptions that just don’t make sense on the ground, that don’t take into consideration all of the complexity that we deal with every day,” Verma said.
    
            The Supreme Court has announced it will issue opinions on Monday.
    
            This means the high court plans to release opinions Friday and Monday (at 10 a.m. ET both days) — and could still add another day next week.
    
            While the Supreme Court’s decision to dismiss an appeal over Idaho’s strict abortion ban Thursday is a “technical win,” it is not a win for health equity, the director of the NAACP Center for Health Equity said Thursday.
    
            The court’s ruling in favor of the Biden administration will ensure people in Idaho can access emergency abortion care.
    
            Pernell called the Supreme Court ruling a “kick-the-can kind of moment” that still leaves women’s health in the US in peril.
    
            “The Supreme Court missed an opportunity,” Pernell said, to make a decision that was “clearly and compellingly in the favor of the universal rights of all people, especially women – and that didn’t happen.”
    
            Despite the fact that the Idaho Supreme Court ruling ensures Idaho women can access emergency abortion care, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been using the opportunity to blast Donald Trump and nationalize the issue of abortion.
    
            Harris criticized Trump in a statement Thursday blaming him for “abortion bans” enacted when he was president. 
    
            The decision was 6-3. Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented, while Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh sided with liberal justices in the majority. 
    
            President Joe Biden’s campaign instantly seized upon a Supreme Court decision on emergency abortion care Thursday, releasing a new television ad featuring a personal testimonial from a high-risk obstetrician from Idaho.
    
            The doctor left her state out of fear of facing potential criminal charges for treating patients amid a strict abortion ban the state.
    
            The campaign is also planning to air an abortion-focused ad during one of the commercial breaks in the debate, a campaign official told CNN.
    
            The push comes as the campaign is eager to draw a sharp contrast with Trump over reproductive rights on the debate stage.
    
            “In a medical emergency, seconds matter. When you’re the only person in the emergency room at 2 a.m. in the morning, and someone comes in hemorrhaging, and they are pregnant, you’re responsible,” Miller says in the ad. “Two years ago, Trump overturned Roe v. Wade. Because of the abortion bans across the country, women’s lives are at risk. Physicians could be tried with a felony for saving that woman’s life too early. The penalties are so severe; felony, imprisonment, loss of license, those are terrifying things.”
    
            She adds, “This election is the most important election of my generation and my daughter’s generation. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will protect our fundamental rights, putting health care decisions back in the hands of women and their doctors.”
    
            President Joe Biden said in a statement Thursday that the Supreme Court decision in Idaho’s abortion case “ensures that women in Idaho can access the emergency medical care they need” – but he also placed blame squarely on Republicans for their “extreme and dangerous” anti-abortion agenda.
    
            Abortion remains a key issue in the presidential race – and one that is likely to come up in Thursday’s CNN presidential debate between Biden and his rival, former President Donald Trump, that will happen just hours after the Supreme Court released its decision.
    
            The Supreme Court’s decision comes hours before President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are set to face off at CNN’s presidential debate in Atlanta. Biden’s advisers have signaled abortion rights will be a key contrast point for Biden heading into the showdown.
    
            Earlier this month, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the abortion pill mifepristone. While it allowed a key abortion medication on the market for women, the Biden campaign also used the moment to warn voters that reproductive rights remain under threat from “MAGA attacks” in the country.
    
            Democrats believe abortion rights can prove galvanizing for voters in November, and they have worked relentlessly to tie new restrictions on the procedure to Trump, accusing him of fomenting “cruelty and chaos” following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
    
            Trump has taken credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, pointing to the three conservative justices he appointed to the court who voted to strip away the nationwide right to abortion.
    
            That has opened the door for Biden to warn voters of what type of justices Trump could potentially appoint if he were to regain the White House in November.
    
            “The next president is likely to have two new Supreme Court nominees,” Biden told donors earlier this month at a fundraiser in Los Angeles, calling the potential of additional Trump appointees “one of the scariest parts” of a second Trump term.
    
            Polling has shown that abortion is still a politically potent issue for Democrats and that most Americans prefer at least some access to the procedure.
    
            The Supreme Court’s decision comes days after the Biden-Harris campaign marked the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision and further elevates an issue Democrats have been wanting to put front and center in the 2024 campaign.
    
            A series of elections in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s Dobb’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade — including the 2022 midterms — have consistently resulted in high turnout and success for Democrats.
    
            The campaign has relied, in part, on first-person testimony from women who have been denied abortions or have otherwise been impacted by state abortion bans that took effect after the court ruling in 2022.
    
            The Biden campaign has stuck to a consistent playbook when talking about Trump and abortion policy. It has pointed to the times the former president took credit for appointing three of the judges who overturned Roe, linked every state-level policy shift to Trump and argued that national Republicans ultimately want to push a federal ban.
    
            The White House had been bracing for a ruling on whether federal law to provide emergency care can overrides state abortion bans. The Biden administration sees the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act – known colloquially as EMTALA – as “the last tool” to provide abortion care in states where bans have been put in place, a senior administration official told CNN ahead of the ruling.
    
            “It would be devastating,” the official tells CNN of a potential move to undercut EMTALA.
    
            Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council, has led the White House’s effort to coordinate policy, outreach, and messaging with the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services. In advance of the ruling, HHS launched a website to make it easier for patients to file complaints of EMTALA violations and investigated hospitals that received complaints.
    
            The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho’s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state’s law a day after the opinion was inadvertently posted on the court’s website in an astonishing departure from its highly controlled protocols. At issue in the case was a state law that banned abortions except for the life of the pregnant woman.
    
            Read the decision:
    
            As it juggles a bevy of high-profile decisions this term, the Supreme Court won’t make its unofficial deadline to finish it work by the end of June. 
    
            By tradition, Chief Justice John Roberts announces the last day of the term one day in advance. Because he didn’t do that on Thursday, it means Friday won’t be the last day of the court’s work and opinions will continue to be issued next week.  
    
            The court will next issue opinions on Friday at 10 a.m. ET.  
    
            The court last went into the first full week of July during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.   
    
            The decision formally released Thursday sweeps abortion off the Supreme Court’s docket in the middle of a highly contested presidential election, even though the issue was almost certain to return to the justices. 
    
            Earlier this month, the court dispensed with another abortion case, an appeal challenging expanded access to the abortion pill mifepristone. There, a unanimous court held that the anti-abortion doctors and groups who sued did not have standing.  
    
            President Joe Biden has highlighted how the Supreme Court — with three of former President Donald Trump’s nominees — overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, eliminating a constitutional right to obtain an abortion.
    
            The unsigned opinion released Thursday drew a flurry of concurrences from conservative and liberal justices, forming an unusual alliance to dismiss the case and temporarily block enforcement of Idaho’s strict ban. Though the decision was technically a loss for Idaho, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stressed in a partial dissent that the potential impact is likely to be short-lived.  
    
            The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho’s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state’s law a day after the opinion was inadvertently posted on the court’s website in an astonishing departure from the court’s highly controlled protocols. 
    
            At issue in the case was a state law that banned abortions except for the life of the pregnant woman. The Biden administration argued that a federal law required hospitals to also provide abortions in cases where the health of a pregnant woman is at stake.   
    
            The Supreme Court has issued a decision on whether Idaho’s abortion ban can be enforced in medical emergencies. 
    
            CNN reporters are going through the opinion now and will provide the latest updates.
    
            This comes after the Supreme Court appeared poised to allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho, according to reporting from Bloomberg News, citing a document that was briefly inadvertently posted on the court’s website in an astonishing breach of protocol. 
    
            The copy of the document inadvertently posted on the Supreme Court court’s website and reviewed by Bloomberg showed the justices voting 6-3 to allow the emergency abortions to take place in Idaho on a temporary basis while the case continues.
    
            Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote separately to say that she wouldn’t have dismissed the case, according to the document Bloomberg reviewed. “Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,” Jackson wrote. “It is delay.”
    
            The Supreme Court on Wednesday officially announced two opinions and had not planned to issue or post any others. 
    
            The court will next release opinions Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.
    
            Idaho’s abortion law had an immediate effect on hospitals in the state. On January 5, the Supreme Court lifted an injunction so Idaho no longer had EMTALA protections for pregnancy complications.
    
            Physicians leaving Idaho: The law hasn’t just hurt patient care, said Molly Meegan, chief legal officer for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a professional organization that represents the majority of practitioners in the United States.
    
            Sending patients out of state: In April, St. Luke’s, the state’s largest provider of emergency services, said it had had to send six pregnant patients from its emergency department out of state via air transport to protect their health. The year before, when the injunction was in effect, the hospital had to do this only once, according to details in Wednesday’s Supreme Court document.
    
            Dr. Kara Cadwallader, a doctor who works in Idaho and is a member of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, said her hospital had to send a pregnant person out of state for care last week even though they typically could have treated her. She is “very excited” about Wednesday’s ruling, even if it is a “small step.”
    
            “Beyond all the political reasons, it’s incredibly important for pregnant patients here in Idaho, who now will be able to access emergency care appropriately,” Cadwallader said.
    
            Different approach to prenatal conversations: Dr. Julie Lyons, a family medicine physician at St. Luke’s, told CNN earlier this year that the Idaho abortion law is so restrictive that she makes sure to talk to patients – even at their first prenatal appointment – about what they will need to do if they have an emergency.
    
            “We, more than ever, are having that discussion – like, if you need to go out of state, you need to check with your insurance, you need to make sure you buy life flight insurance,” Lyons said in February.
    
            Because Idaho’s strict ban does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion if the patient’s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself in most circumstances, the Biden administration argues the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, also known as EMTALA.
    
            The 1986 law requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or to transfer them to another facility that has that capacity. The hospitals must also treat these patients “until the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.”
    
            In 2021, the Biden administration released the Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor’s duty to provide stabilizing treatment “preempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,” although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided.
    
            In July 2022, the Biden administration’s guidance clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition.
    
            A Supreme Court document like the one accidentally posted Wednesday means a hospital must provide an abortion if it’s medically indicated in an emergency situation even in states that have abortion bans or restrictions that don’t provide an exception to protect the health of the mother – at least as the case makes it way through the courts.
    
            Anti-abortion groups were skeptical about the finality of the document briefly published on the Supreme Court’s website Thursday and criticized the Biden administration’s argument that the Emergency Medical Treatment Labor Act (EMTALA) should be used to protect abortion access in emergency situations.
    
            Danie criticized the Biden administration’s EMTALA argument pointing out that state laws that restrict abortion care still allow the procedure in life-or-death cases.
    
            She also emphasized that “the final opinion has not been released.”
    
            Six Supreme Court justices aligned to temporarily allow emergency room abortions in Idaho, according to the inadvertently posted opinion – a majority that included both conservatives and liberals.
    
            But they did so for slightly different reasons.
    
            The court’s three liberals argued in a concurrence written by Justice Elena Kagan that the court erred when it allowed the state to enforce the law temporarily while the Supreme Court considered the case. The state ban, Kagan wrote, “prevents hospitals from doing” what the federal law commands. The decision “will again give Idaho women access to all the needed medical treatments that EMTALA guarantees.”
    
            Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a separate concurrence joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, made a slightly different point. Barrett argued that Idaho appears to be able to enforce its ban “in the vast majority of circumstances.” 
    
            Barrett’s point is that she doesn’t believe there’s a significant conflict between the Biden administration and Idaho because of changes that were made to the Idaho law as the litigation unfolded.
    
            Pro-choice groups have been careful not to celebrate the Supreme Court decision, instead saying that the justices’ ruling would merely delay a future decision that may restrict abortion access in emergency situations.
    
            While these pro-choice groups were relieved that abortion access may be restored in Idaho, each pointed out the possibility that the court may rule differently in the future.
    
            Reproductive Freedom for All CEO Mini Timmaraju echoed this warning saying “This is not a victory but a delay.”
    
            “The abortion bans that are putting people’s lives on the line in the first place will continue to remain on the books,” Timmaraju said.
    
            “The U.S. Supreme Court had the opportunity to be clear that the federal EMTALA law protects the right to abortion in an emergency in every state … and they chose not to,” said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson in a statement to CNN.
    
            Although she did not publicly dissent to the per curiam opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was nevertheless highly critical of the court’s order avoiding a final decision in the abortion case.
    
            It was particularly wrong, Jackson said, because the court had for months allowed Idaho’s strict abortion law to remain in effect.  
    
            “It is too little, too late for the Court to take a mulligan and just tell the lower courts to carry on as if none of this has happened,” Jackson wrote. 
    
            When the Supreme Court said earlier this year that it would hear the case, it paused a lower-court order that had permitted the federal regulations to remain in effect while legal challenges played out. 
    
            “Despite the clarity of the legal issue and the dire need for an answer from this Court, today six Justices refuse to recognize the rights that EMTALA protects. The majority opts, instead, to dismiss these cases,” Jackson wrote. “But storm clouds loom ahead.”
    
            The liberal justice said she wanted the court to decide the case in full this term.   
    
            Jackson’s concurrence also stressed the real-world impact of Idaho’s abortion law and what the court’s earlier order meant for women in the state, with the justice saying that for the past several months, “Idaho physicians were forced to step back and watch as their patients suffered, or arrange for their patients to be airlifted out of ldaho.”  
    
            “As a legal matter, this Court’s stay meant that unless a doctor could actually say that the abortion was necessary to prevent a patient’s death, that doctor could no longer provide abortion care that she viewed as reasonably necessary to keep a patient from losing her uterus, going into organ failure, or avoiding any number of other serious health risks,” she wrote. 
    
            The significance of references to the “unborn child” in the federal emergency medical care statute at the center of the Idaho abortion ban case was the subject of heated debate between liberal and far-right wings, according to the version of the ruling obtained by Bloomberg Wednesday. 
    
            This could be a major issue if the case ever returns to the Supreme Court.
    
            What the conservatives say: A dissent written by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, embraced an argument put forward by Idaho and its supporters in their efforts to defend the state’s strict ban on abortion. Alito described the Emergency Medical Treatment Labor Act (EMTALA), the key federal law in the dispute, as having an “express protection of the unborn child. “  
    
            “Far from requiring hospitals to perform abortions, EMTALA’s text unambiguously demands that Medicare-funded hospitals protect the health of both a pregnant woman and her ‘unborn child,’” Alito wrote.  
    
            He later added that “EMTALA obligates Medicare-funded hospitals to treat, not abort, an ‘unborn child.’”  
    
            What the liberals say:  Justice Elena Kagan, in parts of her concurrence that were joined by both Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, sought to rebut Alito’s claims. She said three of the statute’s four references to an “unborn child” have to do with how hospitals handle transfers of women in labor, and thus were not related to the types of emergency pregnancy complications at issue in this case.  
    
            Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate were watching closely for how the court treated the “unborn child” language in the case. Anti-abortion activists argued that it showed that Congress, when it added the provisions making the reference, saw an interest in protecting unborn life. Abortion rights advocates countered that that was not Congress’ intent, and worried that the conservative Supreme Court would read fetal personhood into a federal statute for the first time ever.  
    
            For now, it is unclear whether either interpretation is accepted by a majority of the high court.  
    
            On opinion days, the Supreme Court traditionally begins at 10 a.m. ET and reads any opinions it will release in order in terms of seniority — from most-junior to most-senior. 
    
            Any per curiam opinions — majority decisions that are unsigned — would be at the end. 
    
            They are announced from the bench and simultaneously handed out to reporters in the press room in print and posted online. The difference today was that the opinion was mistakenly posted online and it wasn’t announced from the bench and printed copies were not present.
    
            Here’s the full comment from the court’s spokesperson:
    
            The Supreme Court on Wednesday officially announced two opinions and had not planned to issue or post any others. 
    
            The court will next release opinions Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.
    
            In some ways the court’s decision would reflect the trouble some justices had with the case during oral arguments in April. An intervening decision from Idaho state’s Supreme Court had left some of the justices seeking additional clarity on when, precisely, the state’s ban might be in conflict with the federal law.
    
            Since the court granted the case, Barrett added, “the parties’ litigating positions have rendered the scope of the dispute unclear, at best.”
    
            Barrett wrote that state officials represented that its exceptions to the ban “is broader than the United States fears” and the federal government, she said, argued that the exception “narrower than Idaho fears.”
    
            Barrett noted that the Biden administration, during oral arguments, made clear that it would not argue that mental health concerns should be considered an exception to Idaho’s ban. Barrett described that as a “dramatic narrowing of the dispute.”
    
            Given that, she wrote, Idaho’s ability to enforce its law “remains almost entirely intact.”
    
            There are several circumstances in which an abortion may be the only option to protect the health and life of the pregnant person, according to doctors, who add this is true “without question.”
    
            The question of when an abortion is medically indicated is “really broad and extends across medical specialties,” according to the American Medical Association.
    
            Dangerous conditions can include when the amniotic sac ruptures early, presenting a major risk for infection, sepsis or placental abruption when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus, which can result in uncontrollable bleeding and may lead to cardiac arrest, kidney failure or miscarriage.
    
            Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the ruling would be a major, but not permanent, win for the Biden White House, which challenged the Idaho law. 
    
            That’s because the underlying lawsuit at the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals would be allowed to continue and perhaps wind up back at the Supreme Court.
    
            “When the justices took this case, they leapfrogged over the federal court of appeals, and froze the district court injunction against Idaho’s near-total abortion ban. This reporting suggests that the Court is going to say that it shouldn’t have acted so rashly, and will let the litigation proceed in the normal course,” he added.
    
            “For now, that means the injunction allowing emergency abortions in Idaho goes back into effect, while Idaho’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit continues.”
    
            More Idahoans are relying on abortion providers in neighboring states since the state’s ban went into effect.
    
            Five of the six states bordering Idaho saw increases in the share of patients traveling from out of state to receive abortions from 2020 to 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights.
    
            Here’s a snapshot:
    
            Many states surrounding those with full abortion bans experienced a similar trend. For example, nearly three-fourths of abortion patients in New Mexico — neighbor to Texas and Oklahoma, which both have bans in place — traveled in from other states in 2023.
    
            More than 171,000 people crossed state lines to get an abortion in 2023, according to Guttmacher. That’s more than twice the number of out-of-state patients recorded three years prior. South Carolina and New Mexico saw the biggest spikes in the share of out-of-state patients, with 37 and 33 percentage point jumps, respectively.
    
            The release of the opinion marks the second time in two years that a major decision dealing with an abortion case has been prematurely released by the court. 
    
            Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the high court’s opinion overturning Roe v. Wade – a document that was substantially the same as the final opinion the court released weeks later.
    
            The copy of the document inadvertently posted on the Supreme Court court’s website and reviewed by Bloomberg showed the justices voting 6-3 to allow the emergency abortions to take place in Idaho on a temporary basis while the case continues.
    
            Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote separately to say that she wouldn’t have dismissed the case, according to the document Bloomberg reviewed. “Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,” Jackson wrote. “It is delay.”
    
            The Supreme Court appears poised to allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho, according to a document that was erroneously posted on the court’s website briefly Wednesday according to Bloomberg News. 
    
            “When the justices took this case, they leapfrogged over the federal court of appeals, and froze the district court injunction against Idaho’s near-total abortion ban. This reporting suggests that the court is going to say that it shouldn’t have acted so rashly and will let the litigation proceed in the normal course. For now, that means the injunction allowing emergency abortions in Idaho goes back into effect, while Idaho’s appeal to the 9th Circuit continues,” Vladeck explained.  
    
            Why this matters: The court’s move, as reported by Bloomberg, also has the effect of defusing what could have been a major political bomb – on an issue Democrats are eager to have front and center – in an election year. As the Supreme Court approached the end of its term, abortion rights advocates were making preparations to use a ruling in Idaho’s favor to mobilize voters. The White House was also bracing for a ruling that rejected the Justice Department lawsuit, CNN previously reported. 
    
            The Supreme Court appears poised to allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho, according to a document that was erroneously posted on the court’s website briefly Wednesday according to Bloomberg News. 
    
            The opinion posted on the court’s website showed that a majority of the court agreed to dismiss the appeal, according to Bloomberg, which reported that it reviewed a copy of the opinion.
    
            CNN has not independently reviewed the opinion.   
    
            A Supreme Court spokesperson confirmed that a “document” was “inadvertently and briefly uploaded” to the court’s website. Supreme Court spokesperson Patricia McCabe stressed that the “opinion” in the case “has not been released” and would be “issued in due course.”
    
            Remember: At issue is Idaho’s strict abortion ban, which provides an exception for the life of the pregnant woman. The Biden administration argued that a federal law also required hospitals to perform abortions in cases where the health of the pregnant woman is at stake. 
    
            Both the Department of Justice and the White House are declining to comment on Bloomberg’s story and the mistakenly posted document until the Supreme Court’s official opinion is released.

      Wisconsin Supreme Court seeks investigation after abortion draft order leaks
    ","
			By Associated Press
		;Associated Press","
  Published
        7:18 PM EDT, Wed June 26, 2024
    ","
            The chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court called for an investigation Wednesday after the leak of a draft order that showed the court would take a case brought by Planned Parenthood that seeks to declare that access to abortion is a right protected by the state constitution.
    
            Chief Justice Annette Ziegler called for the investigation after Wisconsin Watch reported on the draft order that it obtained. The order as reported by Wisconsin Watch said the court would hear the court challenge, but it was not a ruling on the case itself.
    
            “Today the entire court was shocked to learn that a confidential draft document was ostensibly leaked to the press,” Zielger said in a statement. “I have contacted law enforcement to request that a full investigation be conducted.”
    
            She said all seven justices were “united behind this investigation to identify the source of the apparent leak. The seven of us condemn this breach.”
    
            Ziegler is part of a three-justice conservative minority on the court. The draft order did not indicate which justices were in favor of accepting the abortion case, and there were no dissents indicated, according to Wisconsin Watch.
    
            Planned Parenthood brought the lawsuit in February. It asks the Wisconsin Supreme Court to overturn a 175-year-old state law that conservatives have interpreted as an abortion ban.
    
            That is the second abortion-related lawsuit before the court.
    
            The Wisconsin Supreme Court has not said whether it will accept the appeal of a lower court ruling won by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul. He challenged the 1849 law as too old to enforce and trumped by a 1985 law that allows abortions up to the point when a fetus could survive outside the womb.
    
            Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the law only prohibits attacking a woman with the intent to kill her unborn child. The decision emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after stopping procedures in response to the US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, has appealed and asked the state Supreme Court to take the case directly without waiting for a lower appellate ruling.
    
            The draft order in the Planned Parenthood case did not address the other lawsuit, according to Wisconsin Watch.
    
            The abortion cases are among the highest profile before the court that flipped to liberal control in 2023.
    
            The court in December threw out Republican-drawn legislative maps, handing Democrats a huge win that resulted in the Legislature adopting new boundaries drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.
    
            The court has also heard a lawsuit that would restore the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, a closely watched case in battleground Wisconsin. A ruling on that case is expected soon given that the court’s term ends next week.

      Days after Alabama’s Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children, a third  clinic pauses IVF treatment

    ","
            A third fertility clinic in Alabama has halted part of its IVF treatment programs following the state Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children.
    
            The Center for Reproductive Medicine at Mobile Infirmary said it will stop treatments on Saturday “to prepare embryos for transfer,” according to a statement from the clinic.
    
            Mark Nix, the CEO of Infirmary Health, said in the statement that the Alabama Supreme Court decision “has sadly left us with no choice but to pause IVF treatments for patients. We understand the burden this places on deserving families who want to bring babies into this world and who have no alternative options for conceiving.”
    
            Earlier Thursday, Alabama Fertility’s clinic in Birmingham “paused transfers of embryos for at least a day or two,” according to Penny Monella, the chief operating officer at Alabama Fertility Specialists.
    
            The University of Alabama at Birmingham health system on Wednesday became the first organization in the state to confirm that it is pausing IVF treatment out of legal concerns in the wake of the court’s ruling.
    
            Its announcement could be the start of what reproductive rights advocates and medical experts have been warning about for days: The high court’s decision could have devastating consequences for Alabamians seeking infertility treatments each year to build their families – and it could soon have profound impacts far beyond the state’s borders. 
    
            Dr. Andrew Harper, an Alabama fertility doctor, said the ruling disrespected “women’s reproductive autonomy, their reproductive rights,” and will cause him to change how he does business.
    
            Harper, who has been operating his Huntsville clinic for some 20 years, said the ruling provided “motivation to move embryos from in-house to outside, off-site storage facility.” He said he would move more embryos to a facility in Minnesota.
    
            If the embryos are out of state, Harper said, it’s up to the patient to decide what happens to them. “The embryos are ultimately the patient’s … Ultimately, it should be her right to make the disposition, however she chooses,” he said.
    
            His primary concern is advocating for his patients, he said, adding: “If some DA or Attorney General wants to come after me, bring it on.”
    
            State legislators, meanwhile, worked to find a solution.
    
            Democrats in the State House introduced a bill on Thursday that would declare “any fertilized human egg or human embryo that exists outside of a human uterus is not considered an unborn child or human being for any purposes under state law.”
    
            House Bill 225, filed by House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, would become effective if approved by both chambers and signed into law.
    
            State legislative sources told CNN that Republicans and Democrats in both chambers are working to come up with “clarifying” legislation to “protect” IVF and allow treatments to resume at clinics that have paused the procedure.
    
            One source said Republicans in the state Senate are soon expected to file legislation with language “similar” to what has already been filed in the House, but they were unsure of the timing.
    
            In its unprecedented ruling, the state’s Supreme Court said embryos are children – no matter if they’re within or out of a uterus – and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. That decision will likely not only make the already high costs of infertility treatments substantially higher, but will likely also discourage many providers from offering them at all in the state in fear of being held liable for wrongful death, reproductive rights advocates warned.
    
            The Alabama Attorney General’s Office, meanwhile, said it hasn’t issued any guidance on the matter.
    
            “It’s not our case,” Amanda Priest, spokesperson for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, told CNN Thursday. “We have not been involved at all.”
    
            Priest said she couldn’t share whether the office had received inquiries from clinics seeking legal guidance. She didn’t immediately respond to specific questions about whether the state would charge people who destroy embryos with a crime.
    
            Alabama Fertility has two satellite offices in Huntsville and Montgomery that do not perform embryo transfers and are unaffected, according to Monella.
    
            Alabama Fertility said it made the “impossibly difficult decision to hold new IVF treatments due to the legal risk to our clinic and our embryologists.”
    
            In a post on its Facebook page Thursday, the clinic said it’s contacting patients who will be affected “to find solutions for them.” It also said it’s “working as hard as we can to alert our legislators as to the far reaching negative impact of this ruling on the women of Alabama.”
    
            “At a time when we feel so powerless, advocacy and awareness is [sic] our strongest tools. Check back in later today for links to advocacy opportunities,” the clinic wrote.
    
            “AFS will not close,” the statement concluded. “We will continue to fight for our patients and the families of Alabama.”
    
            The Medical Association of the State of Alabama has said that other providers in the state are also likely to stop providing IVF treatments.
    
            CNN has contacted other fertility clinics in the state to inquire about disruptions to their IVF services.
    
            UAB said it was pausing IVF treatments while it evaluates the court’s decision.
    
            “We are saddened that this will impact our patients’ attempt to have a baby through IVF, but we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF treatments,” its statement said.
    
            “We want to reiterate that it is IVF treatment that is paused. Everything through egg retrieval remains in place. Egg fertilization and embryo development is paused.”
    
            Medical Association of the State of Alabama said, “The significance of (the court’s ruling) impacts all Alabamians and will likely lead to fewer babies—children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and cousins—as fertility options become limited for those who want to have a family,” the association said in its statement.
    
            “IVF is oftentimes the only option for couples wanting to conceive,” it added.
    
            Though the state Supreme Court’s decision – which was released Friday – does not prohibit IVF, it’s the first known case in which a US court says frozen embryos are human beings, and that could have profound impacts on how the fertility industry in Alabama operates, critics warned.
    
            They say it could send liability costs skyrocketing, making fertility treatment prices prohibitive for many families; it could discourage medical providers from performing infertility treatments in fear of being held liable each time an embryo does not turn into a successful pregnancy; and it could mean parents will now be forced to pay for lifelong storage fees of embryos they will never be allowed to discard, even if they don’t want any more children.
    
            In the sole full dissenting opinion to the decision, Alabama Supreme Court Justice Greg Cook warned of the potential consequences.
    
            “No rational medical provider would continue to provide services for creating and maintaining frozen embryos knowing that they must continue to maintain such frozen embryos forever or risk the penalty of a Wrongful Death Act claim,” Cook wrote.
    
            The decision will also mean higher costs for people seeking fertility treatments, according to Progyny, a large fertility benefits management company.
    
            “If doctors are now fearful about the penalties associated with offering IVF to their patients, they will instead recommend intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatments, which is a higher risk option that is less likely to result in a pregnancy – so that’s an added cost on the front end for patients,” Progyny Chief Medical Officer Dr. Janet Choi told CNN.
    
            The company also said patients may now have to travel out-of-state to get the care they need as some providers may choose to leave the state – adding a new cost for those seeking fertility treatments.
    
            Reproductive rights advocates said they were “heartbroken” by the UAB announcement.
    
            “The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) health system – the largest healthcare system in the state – has been forced to make an impossible decision: pause IVF procedures for those hoping to build their families, or put their patients and doctors at risk of prosecution,” said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of the patient advocacy organization RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.
    
            And patients who were already amid a physically and emotionally difficult medical process have had “their lives, their hopes and dreams crushed,” Collura said in a statement Wednesday.
    
            Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, told CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” patients in the state might get substandard care.
    
            “There is a lot we don’t know about the impact of this (state Supreme Court) decision. What we do know is that it is already leading to fewer babies and fewer grandbabies that are desperately wanted for their parents and grandparents in Alabama. UAB is the first system to stop. I don’t think it’s going to be the last,” Tipton said.
    
            A fertilized egg in a freezer at a fertility facility is not the same as a born child, he said.
    
            “And I think that legal reality needs to adjust to empirical natural scientific reality,” he said. “If you seek to say that a fertilized egg in a freezer is the same as a born child, you can sign patients to getting suboptimal care,” he added.
    
            Critics have also expressed concerns the ruling creates a road map that groups and legislators across the country who have previously targeted fertility treatments can now follow.
    
            Liberty Counsel –- a nonprofit that says it works to advance “religious freedom, the sanctity of human life and the family” -– said it is using the Alabama ruling as a precedent to argue a proposed amendment in Florida aiming to protect abortion rights will take away “a protected right to life for the unborn.”
    
            Collura told CNN she worries about how other groups and legislators who have previously targeted fertility treatments could use the recent ruling as a precedent.
    
            “This cruel ruling, and the subsequent decision by UAB’s health system, are horrifying signals of what’s to come across the country,” she said in her Wednesday statement.
    
            While the US Supreme Court does have the power to review state top court rulings, the justices in Washington, DC, do not typically take up appeals of state court rulings that don’t include an interpretation of the US Constitution or federal law.
    
            The majority ruling in this case rested solely on the justices’ interpretation of state law and an amendment to Alabama’s constitution.
    
            Most likely, there’s no route to the US Supreme Court for this case, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
    
            “The US Supreme Court’s ability to review state supreme court decisions is limited to decisions that turn on a question of federal law,” Vladeck said. “Here, the issue is how Alabama is interpreting its own state constitution.”
    
            “There could be a case claiming that Alabama’s constitution as so interpreted violates the federal Constitution, but unless I’m missing something, that’s not this case,” Vladeck added.

      About 2% of babies born in the US are from IVF. Here’s what you need to know about it
    ","
			By Madeline Holcombe, CNN
		;Madeline Holcombe","

        1:01 PM EST, Wed February 21, 2024
    ","
            Talk to a group of 100 people born in the United States, and chances are two of them were born as the result of in vitro fertilization, said Dr. Zev Williams, director of the Columbia University Fertility Center.
    
            “In many ways, IVF is actually one of the great triumphs of modern medicine,” he said. “One thing that’s helpful to know is just how common it is. About 2% of births in the US results from IVF. Over 8 million babies have been born using this technology.”
    
            Another technology important to the IVF process is cryopreservation of embryos — or freezing after the egg is fertilized.
    
            The Alabama Supreme Court ruled Friday that frozen embryos are children and would be protected under the state’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act.
    
            As infertility experts warned about the impact on assisted reproduction, experts spoke to CNN to share what people should know about IVF and freezing eggs.
    
            In vitro fertilization, or IVF, is when an egg is removed from a woman’s body and combined with sperm inside a laboratory before being implanted, said Dr. Eve Feinberg, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.
    
            To accomplish that, patients undergo eight to 10 days of fertility injections with hormones that help their eggs mature, said Dr. Mamie McLean, an infertility specialist at Alabama Fertility in Birmingham. Egg retrieval procedures are done either in an outpatient or hospital setting and sometimes under conscious sedation, she added.
    
            After fertilization, doctors watch the embryos as they develop, and what Feinberg often sees is that human reproduction is really inefficient, she said.
    
            If 10 eggs are exposed to sperm, about seven will fertilize, she said. Of those seven, only 25% to 50% will grow in the laboratory long enough to be considered a more mature embryo called a blastocyst, Feinberg said.
    
            From there, depending on the age of the patient, the blastocyst has between a 10% and 60% likelihood of becoming a baby, she said.
    
            IVF was first developed in the 1970s to help women with blocked fallopian tubes — the part of the reproductive system where sperm and egg meet, McLean said.
    
            Since then, it has expanded to help conception in many other contexts, such as for people with recurrent miscarriages, male factor infertility, those utilizing surrogacy, and those for whom other fertility treatments have failed, she added.
    
            “It’s our most successful treatment,” McLean said.
    
            The technology has also allowed couples who carry genetic diseases to test their embryos and only transfer those that won’t be affected by those diseases, Williams said.
    
            Freezing embryos is helpful for genetic testing, Feinberg said.
    
            Clinicians take cell samples from the embryos to test them for genetic diseases or abnormalities, but it can take anywhere from two to four weeks for those tests to take place, she said. Freezing the eggs in the meantime keeps the eggs viable while health care providers look into genetic factors.
    
            Patients can also choose to freeze embryos when they don’t intend to get pregnant right away, Feinberg said. Typically, there are higher success rates when fertilized embryos are frozen, not just the egg, she added.
    
            Patients may choose to freeze embryos for medical reasons, such as before chemotherapy for cancer that may damage the ovaries. Or they can do it because they are not at the right stage of life to conceive but want to have a better chance at a pregnancy in the future, Feinberg said.
    
            If one cycle of IVF can result in multiple embryos, freezing the embryos can keep those that were not implanted viable for future use, McLean said.
    
            And whereas in the past, it was common to implant multiple embryos, freezing the embryos allows doctors to preserve the others for future use so one embryo can be implanted at a time — which is much safer for the patient and the future baby, Williams said.
    
            “It’s very much a numbers game,” said Dr. Serena Chen, advocacy director at CCRM Fertility in New Jersey and founder of Doctors for Fertility. “We are basically getting an entire year’s worth of eggs in one retrieval.”
    
            The number of eggs is a large part of how IVF overcomes infertility, she added. Even in a young, healthy patient, about 30% to 50% of the eggs won’t develop into a pregnancy, Chen said.
    
            “Just getting one egg at a time actually does not help improve the pregnancy rate, especially in somebody who’s infertile,” she said.
    
            “The science behind IVF really shows that one single fertilized egg is not enough,” Feinberg said.
    
            If her patients say they want two or three children, Feinberg encourages them to have between two to four embryos frozen for each, she said.
    
            When a frozen embryo is warmed for implantation, there is about a 95% survival rate — meaning 5% won’t make it, Feinberg said.
    
            Most patients will need at least two or three transfers before they become pregnant, McLean added.
    
            Physicians now try to limit how many times they do egg retrieval and ovarian stimulation on a patient, because it does carry both health risks and a hefty cost, she said.
    
            But families can choose to limit how many eggs are fertilized to create embryos, and before undergoing IVF, they talk with their doctor about their personal moral and ethical considerations, McLean said.
    
            “All couples will make choices prior to going through IVF that relate to the disposition and use of their embryos,” she said. “These are patient-driven decisions that are the right choice for them.”

      Opinion: The twisted irony in Alabama’s court decision on embryos
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler
		","
  Updated
        8:52 AM EST, Wed February 21, 2024
    ","
            The Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday will transform infertility care across the state, potentially setting the stage for a ruling that a fetus or even an embryo outside the womb holds constitutional rights.
    
            The ruling is a reminder of how important fetal personhood is becoming for both the antiabortion movement and the Republican Party — and of its potentially drastic consequences. In the United States today, recognizing the value of an embryo or fetus sets a precedent that no state can permit access to abortion — and that anyone who chooses abortion may be committing a crime.
    
            The irony in the Alabama court’s decision is that more Americans who want to be parents will be unable to achieve that dream. The ruling is extraordinary not only in declaring personhood before birth but also in applying the idea to embryos that haven’t been implanted in the uterus. But the ruling is not just bizarre; its consequences may be profound.
    
            If an embryo is a person, it can no longer be destroyed, donated for research or potentially even stored. Some abortion opponents argue that if embryos are persons, each one that is created must be implanted — and that would make even storing embryos for future use impermissible. If any of that comes to pass — and in Alabama, it likely will — that will transform how in vitro fertilization (IVF) works, and will mean a lower rate of success for Americans who already struggle to start a family.
    
            The court’s ruling could set a precedent for other conservative states that embrace the idea of personhood before birth, making it harder to pursue IVF across large swaths of the country. The decision will also bolster a broader antiabortion effort to recognize a fetus in the womb or even a frozen embryo as a person under federal constitutional law, helping abortion opponents make the case that if states already sometimes treat an embryo or fetus as a rights-holder, constitutional law should do the same.
    
            The Alabama case began when three couples visited a fertility clinic in Mobile to pursue IVF: a treatment in which multiple eggs are harvested, fertilized and implanted to create a pregnancy. Across the US annually, about 2% of births involve IVF. The success rate of each IVF cycle can be low given the age and previous medical condition of the patient.
    
            Since many patients who turn to fertility clinics experience trouble getting pregnant, physicians routinely create and store excess embryos so that patients can try again if a first attempt fails. IVF is also expensive — an average cycle can cost anywhere between $12,000 and $30,000, even when patients can use embryos they’ve already created. This means that patients have more embryos than they implant in a given cycle, which they can choose to store, give to other patients or donate for research.
    
            The three Alabama couples elected to store their excess embryos at the Mobile clinic from 2013 to 2016. In December 2020, however, a patient from an attached hospital entered the clinic, handled some of the embryos and injured their hand, given the subzero temperatures at which the embryos are stored. As a result, they dropped the embryos and accidentally destroyed them.
    
            The plaintiffs sued, first alleging that the clinic was negligent in how it monitored the embryos, contending that the clinic breached the contract it signed with the couples. The couples also had a much more controversial claim: that their embryos counted as “children” or “persons” under the state’s wrongful death of a minor law.
    
            The Alabama Supreme Court agreed that the embryos were persons. The court pointed to a 2018 ballot measure that recognized fetuses as persons under state law. “The People of this State,” the court explained, “have adopted a Constitutional amendment directly aimed at stopping courts from excluding ‘unborn life’ from legal protection.” It did not matter to the court that the embryos were frozen and not yet implanted in the uterus.
    
            In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Tom Parker suggested that divine law — which, he claimed, had been embraced by the people of Alabama — supported the court’s conclusion. “Human life,” he stressed, “cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God.”
    
            The Alabama ruling is a reminder of the importance of personhood politics on the American right — and a warning about how punitive they have become. Since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the fight to establish that the word “person” in the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution applies to fetuses has escalated. At the one-year anniversary of the reversal of Roe, leading groups from the Alliance Defending Freedom to Students for Life called for personhood for “preborn children.”
    
            States are considering bills recognizing the personhood of fetuses in contexts from wrongful death to tax deductions. The goal is to slowly build the case that a fetus or even an embryo is a person for every purpose and circumstance. For the antiabortion movement, that would mean that no state could allow legal abortion. For some self-proclaimed antiabortion abolitionists, fetal personhood would mean that the criminal law would have to punish women who terminate their pregnancies.
    
            In theory, there should be a way for Americans like the couples in the Alabama case to protect themselves against medical negligence — or even to express their belief that frozen embryos or life in the womb have value — without setting a precedent for criminalizing abortion across the US. There are plenty of examples of people asserting that fetal life matters who are not angling to criminalize reproduction. A pregnant woman tried to drive in the HOV lane, arguing that her unborn child is a person. A prison employee in Texas sued on similar grounds when her child was stillborn after she was not allowed to leave her post.
    
            In the context of reproduction and the law, there are gaps in protections for Americans who experience stillbirth or miscarriage as a result of medical negligence, or who are otherwise denied wanted parenthood. Polls suggest that many Americans believe life in the womb has value while opposing criminal abortion bans: A 2022 Pew Forum poll found that even about a third of Americans who think abortion should be legal believe that “human life begins at conception, so a fetus is a person with rights.”
    
            That would not seem so strange if there was a way to recognize the value of embryonic or fetal life that does not inexorably lead to the punishment of physicians who perform abortions, others who aid abortion seekers and even abortion seekers themselves. It is not impossible to imagine how that would look — the Constitutional Court of South Korea took a position like this in recognizing constitutional protection for abortion rights in 2019.
    
            If embryonic or fetal life has value, the state shouldn’t start with criminalization. Instead, the government may have a constitutional obligation to advance its interest in protecting that life in ways that don’t limit reproductive liberty, by protecting pregnant workers, delivering better prenatal care or safe housing and reducing the rate of maternal mortality.
    
            There is nothing inevitable about equating criminalization with valuing fetal or embryonic life, or providing a remedy for people who want to become parents and are unfairly denied the chance to do it.
    
            The Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling is just the start of the push for fetal personhood. And unless something changes, the more fetal personhood is recognized, the more kinds of reproductive decision-making will be a crime.

      In unprecedented decision, Alabama’s Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos are children. It could have chilling effects on IVF, critics say
    ","

    ","
            In a first-of-its-kind ruling, Alabama’s Supreme Court said frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death – a decision that puts back into national focus the question of when life begins and one that reproductive rights advocates say could have a chilling effect on infertility treatments and the hundreds of Alabamians who seek them each year.
    
            And, critics say, the ruling could soon have consequences nationally as other states could attempt to define embryos as people. Already, one religious group is using the Alabama ruling as precedent in a Florida abortion rights case.
    
            “This is part of a long and strategic march towards entrenching this ideology of fetal personhood, that is at the heart of controlling pregnant people, their decisions and their birth outcomes,” Dana Sussman, the deputy executive director of legal advocacy group Pregnancy Justice, told CNN.
    
            The Alabama ruling, which was released Friday, stems from two lawsuits filed by three sets of parents who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures to have babies and then opted to have the remaining embryos frozen.
    
            The parents allege in December 2020, a patient at the Mobile hospital where the frozen embryos were being stored walked into the fertility clinic through an “unsecured doorway,” and removed several embryos from the cryogenic nursery, the state’s Supreme Court ruling said. The patient’s hand was “freeze-burned” by the extremely low temperatures the embryos were stored in and the patient dropped them on the floor, killing them, according to the ruling.
    
            The parents sued for wrongful death but a trial court dismissed their claims, finding the “cryopreserved, in vitro embryos involved in this case do not fit within the definition of a ‘person’ or ‘child,’” according to the ruling.
    
            But in a stunning reversal last week, the state Supreme Court disagreed, noting “extrauterine children” – or, unborn children “located outside of a biological uterus at the time they are killed” – are children, and they are covered under the state’s Wrongful Death of a Minor law.
    
            An attorney for one of the couples told CNN the case is solely about accountability for the parents whose embryos weren’t kept safe by the clinic, and the state Supreme Court’s ruling offers them a way forward for justice.
    
            Though the court’s decision does not prohibit IVF, it’s the first known case in which a US court says frozen embryos are human beings, and that could have profound impacts on how the fertility industry in Alabama operates, critics warned.
    
            They say it could send liability costs skyrocketing, making fertility treatment prices prohibitive for many families; it could discourage medical providers from performing infertility treatments in fear of being held liable each time an embryo does not turn into a successful pregnancy; and it could mean parents will now be forced to pay for lifelong storage fees of embryos they will never be allowed to discard, even if they don’t want any more children.
    
            “No rational medical provider would continue to provide services for creating and maintaining frozen embryos knowing that they must continue to maintain such frozen embryos forever or risk the penalty of a Wrongful Death Act claim,” Alabama Supreme Court Justice Greg Cook wrote in the sole full dissenting opinion. 
    
            “There is no doubt that there are many Alabama citizens praying to be parents who will no longer have that opportunity,” he added.
    
            The state Supreme Court’s decision centers on whether frozen embryos are covered under the Alabama Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, which allows parents to sue for punitive damages when their child dies.
    
            At the heart of that question is whether those embryos should be considered children.
    
            In its majority opinion, the court ruled they should, noting Alabama residents voted in 2018 to amend the Constitution to include protections for unborn life. Whether that unborn life is physically in or out of a uterus shouldn’t matter, it said.
    
            “The People of Alabama have declared the public policy of this State to be that unborn human life is sacred,” Chief Justice Tom Parker wrote in his concurring opinion. “We believe that each human being, from the moment of conception, is made in the image of God, created by Him to reflect His likeness.”
    
            The defendants in the case – the fertility clinic, the hospital and its owner – argued creating wrongful-death liability for frozen embryos would substantially increase the costs of the treatment and could make the preservation of the embryos “onerous” for Alabama families. CNN reached out to representatives of the defendants but has not heard back.
    
            The Alabama Medical Association, which also weighed in prior to the court’s decision, warned such a ruling would create an “enormous potential for civil liability” for fertility specialists, because embryos can be damaged or become unsuitable for pregnancy at any time during an IVF process, including when they are being thawed.
    
            And the ruling could mean parents cannot opt to discard embryos, which happens for a number of reasons, including divorce or the death of one of the two, the association said.
    
            That would cause “embryos to remain in cryogenic storage even after the couple who underwent the IVF treatment have died and potentially even after the couple’s children, grandchildren, and even great grandchildren have died,” the state’s medical association wrote in an amicus brief.
    
            “This absurd result would be the outcome if this Court extends the wrongful death liability to the destruction of cryopreserved embryos,” the association added.
    
            Alabama’s Supreme Court ruled those questions belong with lawmakers and that the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act is clear in that it includes “all children, born and unborn, without limitation.”
    
            Trip Smalley, an attorney representing one of the couples, told CNN Tuesday the parents were “devastated” by the destruction of their embryo and simply sought a way to be able to hold the fertility clinic accountable. Any policy issues that may arise from the ruling should be taken up by lawmakers, he said.
    
            “Our goal is simply to provide a measure of relief to my clients for the facts of this particular case and the wider-ranging policy fallout, I think it’s just too early to know what that will be,” he said.
    
            “What we can’t have is a situation where these clinics are not subject to civil justice,” Smalley added. “How that justice is imposed does present difficult decisions.”
    
            The case will be sent back to the lower court and the parties will prepare for trial, Smalley said.
    
            IVF is a method of assisted reproduction that involves removing eggs from the ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm outside the body. The resulting embryos are then typically placed in a person’s uterus in hopes they spur a successful pregnancy.
    
            “The goal is to actually create as many embryos as possible because that gives you the greatest chance at a pregnancy,” said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of the patient advocacy organization RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.
    
            That often means there are remaining embryos that are frozen and stored in fertility clinics or cryopreservation centers for several hundred dollars annually.
    
            Once families decide they don’t want any more children, they have several options for those embryos, including to discard them or donate them to research or another family, Collura said. Last week’s ruling could take some of those options off the table, she told CNN.
    
            “We have a lot more questions than we do answers,” Collura said. “Will people be able to have rights over their embryos?”
    
            “People who are already in the midst of (infertility treatments) or who’ve already done IVF in this state and have frozen embryos, what’s the status of those embryos? What can they do with them?” she added. “We just don’t know.”
    
            Dr. Mamie McLean, with Alabama Fertility Specialists, which offers reproductive care in the state, told CNN she’s already heard from more than 30 patients since the ruling who are worried they won’t have control over what happens to their frozen embryos.
    
            “We worry that if this ruling and its worst case becomes true, that we will be limited in the ability to keep frozen embryos in the state of Alabama, which will make fertility care riskier and more expensive for patients, and ultimately limit the access to care that women in Alabama have.”
    
            “Patients are worried,” she added. “This is adding anxiety and stress to patients who are already going through a lot to build their families.”
    
            Doctors are worried too, McLean said: “We’re worried that if this ruling stands, that fewer babies will be born in Alabama.”
    
            About 1 in 4 married women in the United States ages 15 to 49 without prior births has difficulty getting pregnant, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. And roughly 1 in 6 adults globally experience infertility, according to the World Health Organization.
    
            The Alabama Supreme Court’s decision will make modern fertility care inaccessible for the state’s families, reproductive medicine advocates say.
    
            “No healthcare provider will be willing to provide treatments if those treatments may lead to civil or criminal charges,” American Society for Reproductive Medicine President Dr. Paula Amato said in a statement.
    
            “Young physicians will choose not to come to the state for training or to begin their practice,” Amato said. “Existing clinics will be forced to choose between providing sub-optimal patient car or shutting their doors.”
    
            Others say they worry the ruling creates a road map that groups and legislators across the country who have previously targeted fertility treatments can now follow.
    
            Liberty Counsel – a nonprofit that says it works to advance “religious freedom, the sanctity of human life and the family” – said it is using the Alabama ruling as a precedent to argue a proposed amendment in Florida aiming to protect abortion rights will take away “a protected right to life for the unborn.”
    
            “Every human life begins as an embryo, and now the Alabama Supreme Court has upheld the decision of its citizenry that every unborn life should be protected, no matter their stage or location,” Liberty Counsel founder and chairman Mat Staver said in a statement.
    
            “This important ruling has far-reaching implications. Liberty Counsel is using this precedent to argue that Florida’s proposed deceptive and misleading abortion amendment violates Florida’s own laws that routinely recognize that an ‘unborn child’ has the legally protected rights of a person. Unborn life must be protected at every stage,” Staver said.
    
            Collura, with RESOLVE, told CNN she worries about how similar groups may use the ruling.
    
            “You now have a Supreme Court very emphatically say that a frozen embryo is a person and we’re going to see now other states trying to codify that,” Collura said.
    
            “Mark my words: I am absolutely sure that this is what is going to be our future for IVF in the United States.”

      Opinion: I witnessed an execution and regretted it. Now I’m not so sure
    ","
			Opinion by Jonathan Eig

        8:55 AM EST, Tue February 20, 2024
    ","
            The coroner wore a tuxedo. The condemned man wore blue jeans and a white short-sleeve shirt. Though his ankles were no longer shackled, he still took baby steps as he approached the electric chair. The yellow cinderblock walls of the execution chamber looked and smelled as if they’d been freshly painted.
    
            In May of 1990, I watched through a window of a building at Angola State Penitentiary as Dalton Prejean became one of the last criminals put to death by electrocution in the state of Louisiana. I saw his chest heave, his fists clench and his right wrist twist outward. A spark and a puff of smoke shot from the electrode attached to his left leg.
    
            Over the years, I came to regret my decision to witness an execution. It made me feel complicit, ashamed, a cog in a machine that dehumanized the process of death. But recent events have forced me to reconsider.
    
            Last month, Alabama became the first state to use nitrogen gas to execute a prisoner. A small group of people, including five journalists, witnessed the execution of convicted murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith. They were not allowed to wear watches, to carry phones or even to use pen and paper to make notes.
    
            Some of the witnesses said Mr. Smith tried to hold his breath. One said he struggled for four minutes against the straps that held him to his gurney and appeared to remain conscious for another two to three minutes. The commissioner of Alabama’s prison system said the prisoner “struggled against his restraints a little bit” but “nothing was out of the ordinary of what we were expecting.”
    
            Witness statements matter. The witness of Sister Helen Prejean (no relation to Dalton) helped move public opinion when she used her experiences at Angola to write “Dead Man Walking,” a book that became a movie.
    
            In 1990, when I reported in The New Orleans Times-Picayune that I had seen that spark and a puff of smoke from the area where electrodes had been attached to Dalton Prejean’s leg, lawyers and prison journalists seized on the detail and investigated further. Attorneys for one man on death row claimed that the electric chair caused burning, mutilation and torture. The Angolite, the Louisiana State Penitentiary’s inmate-run news magazine, published photos revealing the seared flesh of a man who’d died in the chair. Soon after Prejean’s execution, the Louisiana legislature passed laws mandating lethal injections for executions.
    
            Louisiana hasn’t executed anyone since 2010, in part because state officials have been unable to acquire the chemicals needed for lethal injections. Now, Gov. Jeff Landry, who campaigned on a promise to bring back the death penalty, is calling for a special legislative session beginning February 19 to enact a bill making lethal injection, nitrogen asphyxiation and electrocution legal methods of execution. The governor’s proposed legislation would also seal records related to the drugs and materials used in executions, which could be perceived as an attempt to limit scrutiny of the process.
    
            Around the time I witnessed Prejean’s execution, roughly 80% of Americans said they approved of the death penalty, according to a Gallup poll. Now, only 53% say they support it, and about half of those surveyed say they believe it is applied unfairly.
    
            Since the 1990s, Americans have grown more skeptical of capital punishment, coming into alignment with much of the rest of the world. Their views seem to be rooted in morality, in the belief that its legality depends on its respect for human dignity. Public opinion has no doubt been shaped by reports from witnesses like me who have provided accounts indicating that despite all our advances in technology we have not yet found a humane method for killing.
    
            That Landry would seek to reinstitute the electric chair despite this trend should come as no surprise. Politicians often play to fear and anger. But fear and anger are not the only emotions at play. Americans live now with the greater awareness that innocent people have been convicted and executed for their crimes. Private cell phones and body cameras on police have shown us that official accounts of incidents can’t always be trusted. We also live with the awareness that legal standards and community standards change over time while executions remain final in their judgment.
    
            Prejean, who was convicted and executed for the murder of Donald Cleveland, a Louisiana state trooper, was 17 at the time of the murder. In 2005, the Supreme Court made it unconstitutional to execute people who commit crimes before the age of 18. The court held that executing young criminals violates “the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,” and noted that American society had come to regard juveniles as less culpable than adult criminals. Today, Prejean would not have been executed.
    
            As our society matures, we should resist the temptation to return to crude forms of punishment. If we can’t, we should demand accountability from the officials carrying out executions. We should permit witnesses to carry pens, paper and cameras. As long as the death penalty remains a part of our system of justice, we shouldn’t shrink from looking at it.

      Ukrainian soldiers will soon be able to have children from beyond the grave

    ","
            When Natalia Kyrkach-Antonenko’s husband Vitalii was killed on the frontlines fighting Russia, she was 13 weeks pregnant with their daughter, Vitalina.
    
            Despite his death, Kyrkach-Antonenko found some new meaning, hope and purpose with the birth of their child.
    
            “My child is my whole life now. By taking care of my daughter, in a sense, I continue to take care of my husband. This is his continuation. Our continuation.”
    
            The couple had always planned to have a large family, even after Vitalii joined the army in the run-up to Putin’s 2022 invasion.
    
            After having a pregnancy that failed to develop in the opening days of the war – which she attributes to the stress of the invasion – Kyrkach-Antonenko and her husband decided to freeze his sperm. In his brief interludes away from the frontline, she ended up falling pregnant with Vitalina before they eventually managed the cryofreezing.
    
            After his death in November 2022, Kyrkach-Antonenko didn’t hesitate to pursue using her husband’s frozen sperm for a further child.
    
            She was shocked to discover that legally she wasn’t allowed to use the sperm after her husband’s death, despite having his written permission.
    
            That should soon change.
    
            The Ukrainian parliament passed legislation in February to allow and fund the use of soldiers’ frozen sperm in case of their death. Once President Volodymyr Zelensky signs the bill into law, it will for the first time allow the widows of Ukrainian soldiers to use their dead partners’ reproductive cells – both sperm and eggs - to have children.
    
            It will also enable wounded soldiers to use their preserved reproductive cells to have children where their injuries would normally make that impossible.
    
            Additionally, the state will pay to store these frozen cells for three years after a male or female soldier’s death, with clauses specifically recognizing the deceased biological parent on the child’s birth certificate. Currently, the government will pay for the initial freezing of reproductive cells.
    
            Cryopreservation has been an “urgent but difficult issue” MP Olena Shulyak, co-author of the bill, said in a post on Telegram.
    
            “The reality is that the military, whose normal life and plans were interrupted by the war, often did not have time to leave behind their progeny,” she said.
    
            It’s a law that will likely benefit many.
    
            Ukraine’s battlefield losses are a closely guarded secret but US officials estimates some 70,000 soldiers have been killed and nearly twice that number wounded.
    
            This legislation may go some way to providing a lifeline for families beyond the grave.
    
            Kyrkach-Antonenko plans to use her husband’s sperm to have at least one more child: a playmate for Vitalina. It’s what her husband wanted, she said.
    
            “He was fighting for the hope that we would have a family,” Kyrkach-Antonenko said of Vitalii.
    
            Protection of soldiers’ chance to have families has long been on the minds of some Ukrainians.
    
            Iryna Feskova, a fertility doctor at a Kharkiv reproductive center “SANA MED”, has offered free freezing and storage of reproduction cells for soldiers since the very first months of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022.
    
            “This is our contribution to the victory and to the reproductive future of Ukraine,” Feskova told CNN.
    
            The possible injury to soldiers’ reproductive organs and trauma affecting the quality of sperm make cryopreservation of reproductive cells worthwhile, she told CNN, mentioning allegations of castration.
    
            Feskova said interest in cryopreservation among soldiers has boomed since 2022, from a handful before to dozens of people a year. She said her clinic currently stores sperm from dozens of servicemen, while other clinics hold hundreds of samples.
    
            While cryopreservation may not be a taboo subject in Ukraine, it’s certainly a novel one, given newfound prominence by the war.
    
            Fertility doctor Feskova said that her clinics works to spread awareness of cryopreservation – which is working – but the numbers that have taken it up suggest it’s still far from universal.
    
            Support for cryopreservation should come from society, one soldier with the call sign “Iron” told CNN.
    
            “There should be an encouraging message from society that it is necessary to do this, that it is normal,” he said.
    
            “You are a good soldier, you have shown that you are a worthy son or daughter of Ukraine, so leave your descendants behind,” he added.
    
            “Iron” put his and his wife’s plans to have a family on hold when he joined up following the 2022 invasion. While he likes the idea of cryopreservation, he has asked his wife to find happiness and a family with another man if the worst happens.
    
            “We are at the front not for ourselves, but for the future, for our descendants,” he said.
    
            Currently, most of the clients the fertility doctor Feskova sees are men, but she expects more and more women to opt for cryopreservation as the war drags on.
    
            There’s been a 20% increase in the number of women in the Ukrainian armed forces in both military and civilian roles since war with Russia began in the eastern Donbas region in 2014, according to Ukraine’s Armed Forces Personnel Center.
    
            As the  Ukrainian army has lifted any restrictions on the appointment and service of women soldiers in all positions (including combat), women are at a greater risk than ever of death and injury on the frontlines.
    
            Mariia, 25, a Ukrainian soldier, is considering cryopreservation of her eggs now that the law is being passed.
    
            She is currently on maternity leave and her husband is serving in the armed forces too.
    
            “We live in a very uncertain time and my husband and I are thinking about having a second child later. We want to have this option if something happens,” she said of cryopreservation.
    
            “It is a memory, a tribute to those fallen heroes who defend the country. They have the right and dignity to be reborn in their children,” she said.
    
            With civilian and military losses and refugees abroad, Ukraine has, she said, a “demographic problem.”
    
            Kyrkach-Antonenko’s husband Vitalii, a volunteer in a local defense unit before the 2022 invasion, who signed up to the army the week before Putin invaded, told her he somehow knew that he wouldn’t survive the war.
    
            “I knew his character, that he would save people, not hide, he was very positive, heroic,” she said of her husband.
    
            With his daughter Vitalina – and perhaps more children in the future – she said, “In a sense, it’s as if he’s still alive, his life goes on, he has children, something exists after his death. It’s not like a person just disappeared, was buried and forgotten.”
    
            As Ukrainians fights for the life of their country, the births made possible by this new law herald a new future:, though one tinged with sadness.
    
            “It is joy,” Kyrkach-Antonenko said, “joy through the prism of grief.”

      Biden and Democrats attack Trump over abortion after report that he supports a 16-week ban
    ","

    ","
            President Joe Biden and his allies attacked Donald Trump over abortion after the New York Times reported Friday that the former president has privately expressed support for a 16-week federal ban, as Democrats center the politically potent issue ahead of November’s election.
    
            Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CNN the former president has not committed to backing a national abortion ban. In a statement in response to the Times report, she said Trump would “sit down with both sides and negotiate a deal that everyone will be happy with.”
    
            But Biden and other Democrats have seized on the report, which says Trump has privately said he likes the idea of a 16-week ban with exceptions for rape, incest and if the life of the mother is in danger. Biden argued in a statement Friday that Trump was trying to “rip away your rights,” while Biden was “running to protect them.”
    
            “Now, after being the one responsible for taking away women’s freedom, after being the one to put women’s lives in danger, after being the one who has unleashed all this cruelty and chaos all across America, Trump is running scared,” the president said.
    
            He continued, “He’s afraid the women of America are going to hold him responsible for taking away their rights and endangering their rights at the ballot box in November. Which is exactly what’s going to happen.”
    
            After the publication of the Times report, the Biden campaign held a call with reporters to blast Trump on the issue, and the Democratic National Committee put out a statement asserting that “Trump is making it clear that access to abortion for all women is on the ballot this November.”
    
            Trump, who is marching toward the 2024 Republican nomination for president, frequently touts his role in overturning Roe v. Wade with his appointment of three Supreme Court justices who voted with the conservative majority in 2022 to eliminate federal abortion protections. He has noted the restrictive abortion laws that have since been enacted across the country were only possible because Roe was overturned, and points to the reversal of the landmark abortion law as a key achievement of his administration.
    
            But Trump has not made abortion a key part of his campaign speeches and has steered clear on the trail from outlining any specific abortion legislation he would push for if reelected. At his recent campaign rallies, Trump has not mentioned the fall of Roe, and has made only a quick mention of his promise to “protect innocent life” in a potential second term.
    
            Trump’s reluctance to stake out a clear position on the issue comes as he has publicly acknowledged the abortion debate has plagued Republicans at the ballot box since Roe was overturned and as he has criticized members of his own party over their messaging on the issue. He has denounced six-week abortion bans like the one championed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, his former GOP presidential rival, as “too harsh,” to the dismay of anti-abortion activists.
    
            When Trump was asked about his criticism of a six-week ban by a voter at a Fox News town hall in January, he responded by saying Republicans “still have to win elections.” Trump noted that many Republican candidates who took hard-line stances on abortion were “decimated” in elections.
    
            This comes in sharp contrast with Biden’s campaign, which has put abortion rights front and center in the 2024 race, with TV ads and a “reproductive freedoms tour” led by Vice President Kamala Harris.
    
            Nearly two-thirds of Americans disapproved of the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in the decision’s aftermath. And a CNN poll conducted in November found that Americans align more with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on the issue of abortion.

      Journal publisher retracts studies used by Texas judge who ruled to suspend use of abortion pill
    ","

    ","
            The academic publisher Sage Publications has retracted studies used by a Texas judge in a ruling that would suspend federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. The retractions, Sage said, were based on unreliable data and conflicts of interest around the authors’ ties to the anti-abortion movement.
    
            The studies were published in the Sage journal Health Services Research and Managerial Epidemiology. They are “A Longitudinal Cohort Study of Emergency Room Utilization Following Mifepristone Chemical and Surgical Abortions, 1999–2015” from 2021, “A Post Hoc Exploratory Analysis: Induced Abortion Complications Mistaken for Miscarriage in the Emergency Room are a Risk Factor for Hospitalization” from 2022 and “Doctors Who Perform Abortions: Their Characteristics and Patterns of Holding and Using Hospital Privileges” from 2019.
    
            The 2021 study concluded that ER visits were more likely after a medication abortion rather than a surgical abortion. The Texas judge whose ruling in April 2023 would suspend federal approval of mifepristone, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, cited this study to suggest that the groups that brought the mifepristone lawsuit had the legal right — known as standing — to bring their challenge because adverse events from medication abortion can “overwhelm the medical system and place ‘enormous pressure and stress’ on doctors during emergencies and complications.’ ”
    
            The 2022 study determined that medication abortion was more likely to send people to the ER for the surgical removal of “retained products of conception” and that those who concealed the fact that they had a medication abortion were more likely to be admitted than those whose cases were misclassified as miscarriages. It also warned that patients and personnel should be made aware of the risk. Kacsmaryk cited this study to suggest that the number of adverse events from medication abortion drugs is probably under-reported.
    
            The judge did not cite the 2019 study, which looked at the characteristics of doctors who performed abortion in Florida and whether they had hospital admitting privileges.
    
            The US Supreme Court will hear arguments in March about mifepristone, one of two drugs commonly used in the US for a medication abortion. For now, mifepristone remains available and not subject to restrictions that Kacsmaryk and a federal appeals court have said should be imposed on its use. The high court determined in April 2023 that access to the drug would remain unchanged until the appeals process finishes.
    
            Medication abortion is the most common form of abortion in the US, and multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown that it is highly safe and effective.
    
            In a note from the publisher, the academic editors said Monday that “we made this decision with the journal’s editor because of undeclared conflicts of interest and after expert reviewers found that the studies demonstrate a lack of scientific rigor that invalidates or renders unreliable the authors’ conclusions.”
    
            Sage said that “Upon submission, the lead author declared no conflicts of interest and all authors declared the same within each article; however, all but one of the article’s authors had an affiliation with one or more of Charlotte Lozier Institute, Elliot Institute, and American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists – all pro-life advocacy organizations that explicitly support judicial action to restrict access to mifepristone.”
    
            Sage said it was made aware of the potential problems when a reader reached out after the 2021 study was published, it said. The reader said they had concerns that some of the data used to draw the study’s conclusions was misleading and pointed out the authors’ affiliation with the anti-abortion movement.
    
            Sage asked outside experts to review the research that was the foundation for these studies. The independent experts concluded that the 2021 study and a 2022 paper that relied on the same data had invalid conclusions based on the way the study was designed, “unjustified or incorrect” assumptions about its facts, errors in the authors’ analysis of the data and “misleading presentations of the data.”
    
            The experts concluded that the 2019 study, which used a different dataset, also contained misleading presentations of the findings that “demonstrate a lack of scientific rigor and render the authors’ conclusions unreliable.”
    
            Sage, an independent publisher of more than 1,000 journals, said it prioritizes “academic integrity free from the pressures of shareholders, and, while upholding editorial independence, work with our journal editors to achieve high standards of scientific rigor and integrity. When we become aware that those standards have not been met, we take seriously our responsibility to investigate and correct the academic record when necessary.”
    
            In a statement emailed to CNN, Jim Studnicki, the lead author of the studies and vice president at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, said authors “fully complied with Sage’s conflict disclosure requirements,” and that funding and organizational affiliations were reported.
    
            In an email to CNN, Sage said that the way the conflict of interest disclosure works when an author submits a manuscript for consideration, is that the authors fill out a submission form that includes a question that explicitly asks about “potential or perceived conflicts of interest.” 
    
            “For each of the three retracted articles, in response to this question, the lead author declared there were ‘no’ potential or perceived conflicts of interest,” a spokesperson for Sage said and added that a decision to retract the studies was made only after expert reviewers found that the studies’ conclusions were “unreliable.”
    
            Sage said another reason that the studies were retracted is because of a conflict of interest with one of the peer reviewers. When journals publish research, the work is supposed to be reviewed by experts with no conflict of interest, but these articles were reviewed by a researcher who, at the time, also had an affiliation with the Charlotte Lozier Institute, according to Sage. CLI told CNN that it was Sage that picked the reviewers. “It is entirely the responsibility of the journal, not CLI,” Studnicki’s statement said.
    
            Sage said in an email to CNN that its discovery of the original peer reviewers’ conflict of interest led to a new review by independent subject matter experts. “Our process followed guidelines set forth by the Committee of Publication Ethics (COPE).”
    
            Studnicki also disagreed with the publisher’s claims about the data. “To date, Sage has advanced no valid objection to their findings and shown no evidence of any major errors, miscalculations, or falsehoods,” the email said. CLI posted a rebuttal online.

      A pregnant woman found dead 32 years ago has been identified through her father’s DNA

    ","
            A pregnant woman whose partially decayed body was found in a flooded basement 32 years ago has been identified through forensic genetic genealogy and DNA provided by her father, according to authorities.
    
            Tabetha Ann Murlin was found dead by a construction worker in a Fort Wayne, Indiana, home in 1992, according to Christopher A. Meihls, chief investigator for the Allen County Coroner’s Office.
    
            A construction worker who was doing some renovations in a house on Reynolds Street, in the basement discovered a dead individual wrapped in a blanket and in 8 to 12 inches of water and very badly decomposed at that time, Allen County Coroner John Brandenberger said at a news conference Thursday.
    
            Based on the extent of decomposition of the 23-year-old’s body, Brandenberger said investigators initially believed that Murlin had died in 1991 or early 1992.
    
            The Allen County coroner conducted a partial autopsy on Murlin’s body at the time and was unable to determine the cause of death.
    
            Murlin, who at the time was identified as ‘Mary Jane Doe,’ was subsequently buried at Lindenwood Cemetery on May 21, 1992, Brandenberger said.
    
            The Fort Wayne Police Department developed leads and investigated the case, but it eventually grew cold. Over two decades later with technological advancements in forensic analysis, the investigation was reopened in 2016, the coroner explained.
    
            A year later, investigators decided to exhume Murlin’s body to conduct a complete autopsy by doing x-rays of her teeth for forensic odontology and “to complete an anthropology study” to submit DNA of the remains to appropriate facilities, Brandenberger said.
    
            University of Indianapolis Forensic Anthropologist Krista Latham collected DNA samples from Murlin’s left femur and sent it to the University of North Texas’ Center for Human Identification for DNA testing.
    
            “Seven months later, the University of Texas announced that they had developed a DNA profile, which was uploaded into DNA databases,” which Brandenberger said unfortunately did not result in any DNA matches.
    
            The coroner shelved degraded samples of Murlin’s extracted DNA until newer technology became available.
    
            In 2023, forensic genealogy companies Intermountain Forensics and Ignite DNA began sequencing the DNA and from there was able to find a match between Murlin and her father, her mother, who died in 2013, as well as her two aunts, Bradenberger said.
    
            DNA obtained by a swab of the cheek confirmed Robert Bowers to be Murlin’s father, according to case documents.
    
            Angelina Privitt, Murlin’s aunt, identified Murlin with her maiden name Tabetha Slain and said she had been adopted by her other aunt, Norma Slain, according to the coroner’s office.
    
            Privitt claimed that the victim married her husband, Jerry Murlin, in 1987, according to case documents.
    
            The couple separated 1988 but Murlin never filed for divorce and never reported his wife as missing, according to authorities.
    
            While details on the woman’s death are still unclear to authorities, Bowers confirmed that he last saw his daughter in 1988, and Jerry Murlin last saw his wife in 1989, according to Meihls.
    
            CNN has reached out to Murlin and Bowers for comment.
    
            CNN has also reached out to the Fort Wayne Police Department for further comment.

      Medication abortion via telehealth is just as safe and effective as with a clinic visit, study shows
    ","

    ","
            Research has long found that medication abortion is safe and effective, but a new study shows that to be true even when the patient gets the medicine through a telehealth appointment.
    
            Medication abortion, also known as medical abortion, is the method by which someone ends their pregnancy using pills rather than a surgical procedure. It’s the most common form of abortion in the United States.
    
            It’s also come under fire recently. In April, a Texas judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, one of the drugs used in the practice in the United States. The medication is still available while the ruling is under review by the US Supreme Court.
    
            US providers have offered telehealth services for medication abortion at some level since around 2008, but it became a much more widely used option during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, the FDA said it would no longer require an in-person appointment for a provider to dispense the drugs, making way for more virtual appointments in states where abortion and telehealth for abortion aren’t banned.
    
            The latest study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Medicine, shows that with very rare exceptions, telehealth for medication abortion is effective and safe, whether the person uses a secure form of texting or a video call. Most of the participants in the study worked with a provider through text, although they could also have a followup call or videoconference.
    
            The study looked at records from 6,034 medication abortions provided via telehealth between April 2021 and January 2022 at three virtual clinics that operate in 20 states and the District of Columbia. The effectiveness and safety of medication abortion provided through video and text appointments was found to be similar to numbers in other studies involving in-person medication abortion care.
    
            As with in-person appointments, the patients who chose the telehealth option weren’t required to undergo any testing or physical examination; rather, a provider made the decision to provide abortion medication based on their medical history.
    
            Medication abortion is intended to be used up until 10 weeks after the start of the pregnant person’s last menstrual period. It is not recommended for people with certain health conditions and those who have had an ectopic pregnancy, a rare event in which a fertilized egg implants itself outside of the uterus.
    
            In the new study, patients who had any risk factors or symptoms for an ectopic pregnancy or those who were potentially beyond the required gestational age were referred for an ultrasound.
    
            Of the 6,034 abortions in the study, 99.8% were not followed by a serious adverse event.
    
            ”In total, 0.25% of patients experienced a serious abortion-related adverse event, 0.16% were treated for an ectopic pregnancy and 1.3% abortions were followed by emergency department visits,” the study says.
    
            The study also showed that medication abortion was highly effective, as 97.7% of participants had a complete abortion after taking the pills, with no need for any subsequent intervention. Among those whose abortion was not initially complete, 0.56% took more medication to complete the procedure, 1.4% needed a surgical procedure, and 0.94% had a confirmed or suspected continued pregnancy.
    
            The results were similar for patients no matter their race, ethnicity or age.
    
            “Telehealth medication abortion is effective, safe, and comparable to published rates of in-person medication abortion care,” concluded the researchers, from the University of California, San Francisco.
    
            The new study is helpful to reinforce that the practice is safe and effective, said Dr. Pratima Gupta, an abortion provider in San Diego who was not involved in the new research.
    
            “It’s great to have research data to support what we already knew regarding the safety of medication abortion,” she said.
    
            Medication abortion is one of the most common procedures performed in the United States, Gupta said. Telehealth options meet patients’ needs, she said, and that may be more important than ever with more states restricting access to abortion since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
    
            “I think it’s really wonderful that we’re able to meet patients where they’re at. So whatever their preferred method of communication is, whether it’s texting, whether it’s telephone, whether it’s video, so we are able to meet their needs with accessibility,” Gupta said. “And it provides them the necessary privacy to control their lives.”

      ‘I slept with my half-sibling’: Woman’s horror story reflects loosely regulated nature of US fertility industry

    ","
            Victoria Hill never quite understood how she could be so different from her father – in looks and in temperament. The 39-year-old licensed clinical social worker from suburban Connecticut used to joke that perhaps she was the mailman’s child.
    
            Her joke eventually became no laughing matter. Worried about a health issue, and puzzled because neither of her parents had suffered any of the symptoms, Hill purchased a DNA testing kit from 23andMe a few years ago and sent her DNA to the genomics company.
    
            What should have been a routine quest to learn more about herself turned into a shocking revelation that she had many more siblings than just the brother she grew up with – the count now stands at 22. Some of them reached out to her and dropped more bombshells: Hill’s biological father was not the man she grew up with but a fertility doctor who had been helping her mother conceive using donated sperm. That doctor, Burton Caldwell, a sibling told her, had used his own sperm to inseminate her mother, allegedly without her consent.
    
            But the most devastating revelation came this summer, when Hill found out that one of her newly discovered siblings had been her high school boyfriend – one she says she easily could have married.
    
            “I was traumatized by this,” Hill told CNN in an exclusive interview. “Now I’m looking at pictures of people thinking, well, if he could be my sibling, anybody could be my sibling.”
    
            Hill’s story appears to represent one of the most extreme cases to date of fertility fraud in which fertility doctors have misled their female patients and their families by secretly using their own sperm instead of that of a donor. It also illustrates how the huge groups of siblings made possible in part by a lack of regulation can lead to a worst-case scenario coming to pass: accidental incest.
    
            In this sense, say advocates of new laws criminalizing fertility fraud, Hill’s story is historic.
    
            “This was the first time where we’ve had a confirmed case of someone actually dating, someone being intimate with someone who was their half-sibling,” said Jody Madeira, a law professor at Indiana University and an expert on fertility fraud.
    
            A CNN investigation into fertility fraud nationwide found that most states, including Connecticut, have no laws against it. Victims of this form of deception face long odds in getting any kind of recourse, and doctors who are accused of it have an enormous advantage in court, meaning they rarely face consequences and, in some cases, have continued practicing, according to documents and interviews with fertility experts, lawmakers and several people fathered by sperm donors.
    
            CNN also found that Hill’s romantic relationship with her half-brother wasn’t the only case in which she or other people in her newly discovered sibling group interacted with someone in their community who turned out to be a sibling.
    
            At a time when do-it-yourself DNA kits are turning donor-conceived children into online sleuths about their own origins – and when this subset of the American population has reached an estimated one million people – Hill’s situation is a sign of the times. She is part of a larger groundswell of donor-conceived people who in recent years have sought to expose practices in the fertility industry they say have caused them distress: huge sibling pods, unethical doctors, unreachable biological fathers, a lack of information about their biological family’s medical history.
    
            The movement has been the main driver in getting about a dozen new state laws passed over the past four years. Still, the legal landscape is patchy, and the US fertility industry is often referred to by critics as the “Wild West” for its dearth of regulation relative to other western countries.
    
            “Nail salons are more regulated than the fertility industry,” said Eve Wiley, who traced her origins to fertility fraud and is a prominent advocate for new laws.
    
            More than 30 doctors around the country have been caught or accused of covertly using their own sperm to impregnate their patients, CNN has confirmed; advocates say they know of at least 80.
    
            Accountability for the deception has been in short supply. The near-absence of laws criminalizing the practice of fertility fraud until recently means no doctors have yet been criminally charged for the behavior. In 2019, Indiana became the second state, more than 20 years after California, to pass a statute making fertility fraud a felony.
    
            Even in civil cases that have been settled out of court, the affected families have typically signed non-disclosure agreements, effectively shielding the doctors from public scrutiny.
    
            Meanwhile, some doctors who have been found out were allowed to keep their medical licenses.
    
            In Kentucky, retired fertility doctor Marvin Yussman admitted using his own sperm to inseminate about half a dozen patients who at the time were unaware that he was the donor. One of them filed a complaint to the state’s board of medical licensure when her daughter – who was born in 1976 – learned Yussman was the likely father after submitting her DNA to Ancestry.com.
    
            “I feel betrayed that Dr. Yussman knowingly deceived me and my husband about the origin of the sperm he injected into my body,” the woman wrote in a letter to the board in 2019. “Although I realize Dr. Yussman did not break any laws as such, I certainly feel his actions were unconscionable and depraved.”
    
            In his response to the medical board, Yussman said that during that era, fresh sperm was prioritized over frozen sperm, meaning donors had to arrive on a schedule.
    
            “On very rare occasions when the donor did not show and no frozen specimen was available, I used my own sperm if I otherwise would have been an appropriate donor: appropriate blood type, race, physical characteristics,” Yussman wrote.
    
            He added some of his biological children have “expressed gratitude for their existence” to him and even sent him photos of their own children. Yussman, who noted in his defense that he didn’t remember the woman who made the complaint, said his policy decades ago was to inform patients that physicians could be among the possible donors, though neither he nor the complainant could provide records that clarified the protocol.
    
            The board declined to discipline him, citing insufficient evidence, according to case documents. Reached on the phone by CNN, Yussman declined to comment.
    
            The story that really put fertility fraud on the national radar was that of Dr. Donald Cline, who fathered at least 90 children in Indiana. Cline’s case spurred lawmakers to pass legislation that outlawed fertility fraud but wasn’t retroactive, meaning he was never prosecuted for it. But he was convicted of obstruction of justice after lying to investigators in the state attorney general’s office who briefly looked into the case. Following that conviction in 2018, Cline surrendered his license. Cline’s lawyer did not respond to an email seeking comment.
    
            Netflix followed up with a documentary about Cline in 2022 that inspired two members of Congress – Reps. Stephanie Bice, an Oklahoma Republican, and Mikie Sherrill, a New Jersey Democrat – to coauthor the first federal bill outlawing fertility fraud. If passed, the Protecting Families from Fertility Fraud Act would establish a new federal sexual-assault crime for knowingly misrepresenting the nature or source of DNA used in assisted reproductive procedures and other fertility treatments. The bill has found dozens of backers – 28 Republicans and 20 Democrats – amid a renewed effort to push it on Capitol Hill.
    
            A group of advocates including Hill plans to go to DC to champion the bill on Wednesday.
    
            To be sure, passage wouldn’t mean that any of the dozens of doctors who have already been accused of fertility fraud would go to prison, as the crime would have occurred before the law existed. But the measure would provide more pathways for civil litigation in such cases.
    
            The push to better regulate the fertility industry isn’t without critics. It inspires unease – if not outright opposition – from some who fear any industry crackdown could have the unintended effect of making the formation of families less accessible to the LGBTQ community, which comprises an outsized share of the donor-recipient clientele.
    
            “I think we should pause before creating additional criminal liability for people practicing reproductive medicine,” said Katherine L. Kraschel, assistant professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University. “It gives me great pause … to say we want the government to try to step in and regulate what amounts to a reproductive choice.”
    
            Some experts also point out that the advent of take-at-home DNA tests by companies such as 23andMe and Ancestry has pretty much stamped out fertility fraud in the modern era.
    
            “To my knowledge, the majority of fertility fraud cases took place before 2000,” said Julia T. Woodward, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor in psychiatry and OBGYN in the Duke University Health System, in an email to CNN. “I think it is highly unlikely any person would engage in such practices today (it would be too easy to be exposed). So this part of the landscape has improved significantly.”
    
            But activists in the donor-conceived community still want laws, in part to provide pathways for civil litigation, and also to send a message to any medical professional who might feel emboldened by the lack of accountability.
    
            “Let’s say arguably that it doesn’t happen anymore,” said Laura High, a donor-conceived person and comedian who, with more than 600,000 followers on TikTok, has carved out something of a niche as a fertility-industry watchdog on social media. “Pass the f**king legislation just in case.
    
            “Why not just out of the optics – just out of a, ‘Hey we’re going to stand by the victims.’ Let’s just do this. We know it’s never going to happen anymore, but let’s just make this illegal.”
    
            The lack of a law in Connecticut appears to have been a stumbling block for a pair of siblings seeking recourse for what they allege is a case of fertility fraud.
    
            The half-siblings – a sister and brother – sued OBGYN Narendra Tohan of New Britain in 2021, saying he deceived their mothers when using his own sperm in the fertility treatments.
    
            He has derailed the suit with a novel defense, arguing successfully that it amounts to a “wrongful life” case, which typically pertains to people born with severe life-limiting conditions and isn’t recognized in Connecticut. Tohan, who is still practicing, did not return an email or call to his office seeking comment. The siblings are appealing the ruling.
    
            Madeira, the expert in fertility fraud from Indiana University, called the “wrongful life” decision absurd.
    
            “In fertility fraud, no parent is saying that – no parent is saying I would have gotten an abortion,” she said. “Every parent is saying, ‘I love my child. I just wish that my wishes would have been respected and my doctor wouldn’t have used his sperm.’”
    
            And then there is Dr. Burton Caldwell, who declined CNN’s request for an interview. One of his apparent biological children decided to sue him last year, even though she knows it will be an uphill battle without a fertility fraud law on the books. Janine Pierson and her mother, Doreen Pierson, accuse Caldwell – who stopped practicing in the early 2000s – of impregnating Doreen with his own sperm after having falsely told her that the donor would be a Yale medical student.
    
            Janine Pierson, a social worker, thought she was an only child until she took a 23andMe test in the summer of 2022 and was floored to learn she had 19 siblings. (That number has since grown to 22.)
    
            “It was like my entire life just came to this screeching halt,” she told CNN.
    
            When she learned through one of her siblings that Caldwell was the likely father, Pierson said she immediately phoned her mom, who was stunned.
    
            “We both just cried for a few minutes because it just felt like such a violation,” Pierson said.
    
            Pierson said she decided to pursue the lawsuit even though she knows the lack of a fertility-fraud law in Connecticut could pose a challenge.
    
            “It shouldn’t just be, you know, the Wild West where these doctors can just do whatever it is that they want,” she said.
    
            Hill is watching her newly discovered half-sister’s case closely.
    
            For her, the first surprise was learning the dad she grew up with wasn’t her biological father.  Although her mom had told her when Hill was younger that she’d sought help conceiving at a fertility clinic, she also said – falsely – that the doctor had used her dad’s sperm.
    
            When Hill learned that the biological father appeared to be Caldwell a few years ago, she contacted lawyers to inquire about filing a suit, but was told she doesn’t have much of a case, so she didn’t pursue it. Now, she said, her statute of limitations is about to expire.
    
            Last year, Hill was hit with another shattering revelation.
    
            In May, she and her three closest friends were celebrating their 20-year high school reunion over dinner.
    
            She was sharing the tale with them of how she learned about her biological father. Everyone was captivated, except one person – her former boyfriend. He looked like he was turning something over in his head. Then he noted that his parents, too, had sought help conceiving from a fertility clinic.
    
            A couple months later, in July, as Hill was leaving for a summer vacation with her husband and two young children, the ex-boyfriend texted her a screenshot showing their 23andMe connection.
    
            “You are my sister,” he said.
    
            Hill’s high school boyfriend isn’t the only person she knew in the community who turned out to be a sibling.
    
            “I have slept with my half-sibling,” Hill said. “I went to elementary school with another.”
    
            What’s more, Hill said, back in the early 2000s, she lived across the street from a deli in Norwalk she often went to that was owned by twins who she later learned are her siblings.
    
            Pierson, too, discovered recently that she’d crossed paths with a sibling long ago. She said she has a group photo from when she was a kid at summer camp that shows her on a stage and a boy in the audience. In 2022, she learned that he is her older half-brother.
    
            “Within 20 feet of one another, and we have no idea,” she said.
    
            In general, the bigger the sibling pool, the greater the risk of accidental incest – regardless of whether fertility fraud came into play.
    
            “I don’t date people my age. I can’t do it,” said Jamie LeRose, a 23-year-old singer from New Jersey who has at least 150 siblings from a regular sperm donor, not a doctor. “I look at people my age and I’m automatically unattracted to them because I just, I go, that could be my sibling.”
    
            With this in mind, activists also often advocate for laws that cap the number of siblings per donor – and that do away with donor anonymity. (Neither of these restrictions are included in the proposed federal bill.)
    
            Other countries have instituted such regulations. Norway for instance limits the number of children to eight; Germany, to 15. Germany and the UK have banished anonymity at sperm banks.
    
            The United States government has no such requirements – and the professional association that represents the fertility industry wants to keep it that way.
    
            “What we have not done very much in this country is pass regulations about who gets to have children,” said Sean Tipton, the chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. “If you’re going to say you should only be able to have 50 children, that’s fine. But that should apply to everybody. It shouldn’t apply just to sperm donors.”
    
            Regarding the concern among donor-conceived people about accidental incest, Tipton added, “if you want to be sure that before you have children with somebody, you can run DNA tests to make sure you’re not related.”
    
            The ASRM, which often clashes with donor-conceived activists, has not taken a stance on the federal bill, Tipton told CNN.
    
            The organization does offer nonbinding guidelines that address concerns about incest, recommending for instance no more than 25 births per donor in a population of 800,000.
    
            Although most of the donor-conceived people who spoke with CNN for this story said they wanted to see legislative change, they also described an emotional aspect of the topic that no new law or regulation could begin to quell: a yearning to better understand one’s origins and identity. For Pierson, it was this desire, coupled with a mix of anger and curiosity, that compelled her to pay Caldwell an unannounced visit one day in 2022 – weeks after she’d learned he was most likely her biological father.
    
            “I woke up that day and I had decided I didn’t want to call him,” Pierson said. “I didn’t want to give him the opportunity to say no. So I just drove directly to his house from work.”
    
            Pierson, who lived in Cheshire at the time, describes an experience that was equal parts surreal and awkward.
    
            After an hourlong trip, she pulled up to a large, stately house with a long driveway not far from the Connecticut coast. When she knocked on the door, nobody answered. But when a neighbor stopped by to drop something off, Caldwell opened the door. Seizing the moment, Pierson introduced herself. He let her in.
    
            Laying eyes for the first time on her biological father, Pierson, 36, saw a man in his 80s with a slight tremor due to Parkinson’s, sporting a blue golf shirt.
    
            He invited her inside and they sat at his dining room table.
    
            Caldwell, she said, didn’t seem surprised – likely because Hill had made a similar visit a couple of years earlier.
    
            “He was not in any way apologetic,” Pierson said, but she added that he did not deny using his own sperm when working in the 1980s at a New Haven clinic. She said Caldwell confessed that he “never gave it the thought that he should have … that there would be so many (children), and that it would have any kind of an impact on us.”
    
            Pierson said Caldwell asked her questions that gave her pause.
    
            “One thing that really has always bothered me is that he asked me how many grandchildren he had,” she said. “And he was very curious about my scholastic achievements and what I made of myself. … Like how intelligent I was, basically.”
    
            She said their conversation ended abruptly when, looking uncomfortable, Caldwell stood up, which she took as a signal that the visit was over. Before parting ways, she asked if he would pose for a photo with her. He consented.
    
            “I knew it would be the only time that I actually ever had that opportunity to take a picture,” she said. “Not that I wanted like a relationship with him in any way because – it was just like mixed of emotions of, you know, like, I despise you, but at the same time, I’m grateful to be here.”

      ‘Fleeing under the cover of darkness’: How Idaho’s abortion ban is changing pregnancy in the state
    ","
			By Meg Tirrell and John Bonifield, CNN

    ","
            Jen and John Adkins never expected to have to send a package like this.
    
            Unsteady on her feet after a medical procedure last spring, Jen emerged from a clinic with a box she needed to ship urgently. The clock was ticking; if they missed the FedEx cutoff, she and John recalled to CNN, they wouldn’t be able to get crucial test results that would affect the future of their family.
    
            They were far from their home in Caldwell, Idaho, a suburb of Boise, after a surreal six-hour drive up Interstate 84 to Portland, Oregon.
    
            Idaho’s abortion laws meant they had to seek care across state lines after receiving devastating news about a much-wanted pregnancy.
    
            Stories like theirs have become increasingly common, as Jen and several other plaintiffs laid out in a lawsuit filed against the state of Idaho in September.
    
            Dr. Julie Lyons, a family medicine physician across the state in Hailey, near Sun Valley, who’s also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said she now discusses “life flight insurance” with pregnant patients in their first prenatal visits, in case they have a pregnancy complication that doctors can’t treat in Idaho.
    
            “It’s a little bit terrifying to know that we can’t practice our full scope, that we are now needing to manage and triage patients, often outside of the state, to get the reproductive health care that they need,” Lyons said.
    
            The Adkinses had hoped for better from the state they loved. John’s family goes back six generations in Idaho, and they’re raising their 2-year-old son here.
    
            Last year, they were overjoyed to learn that he was going to be a big brother; they’d always wanted a big family. But 12 weeks into the pregnancy, their plans were shattered during a routine ultrasound.
    
            “As soon as that ultrasound technician put that wand on my stomach and I saw the baby on the screen, I knew something was wrong,” Jen told CNN. “I could just tell, ‘that’s a lot of fluid that’s not supposed to be there.’”
    
            A genetic counselor and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist told Jen that it was very likely the fetus had Turner syndrome, a disorder in which a baby assigned female at birth is born with one missing or partial X chromosome.
    
            Research shows that it results in miscarriage in more than 90% of cases and can cause abnormalities in the heart and kidneys, restricted growth and — most clear to Jen — excess fluid around the neck, called cystic hygroma, and severe swelling or edema, called hydrops.
    
            “Essentially, they were surprised I was still pregnant, based on the severity of what they were seeing on the ultrasound,” Jen recalled.
    
            The doctors told her they expected her to have a miscarriage, Jen said, but they didn’t know when. And, she says they told her, “The longer you stay pregnant, the more at risk you are of developing complications of your own.”
    
            She said they were worried about something called mirror syndrome, meaning she could also experience edema, high blood pressure and preeclampsia, which she says she was told could all be life-threatening.
    
            “So, I asked the question: ‘You know, then, what’s our option here?’” Jen said. “And they said, ‘well, because you’re in the state of Idaho, we cannot provide a termination for you. We cannot provide an abortion.’”
    
            It had been less than a year since Idaho’s trigger abortion ban took effect, a law put into place in 2020 that would outlaw abortion in almost all circumstances if Roe v. Wade was overturned, as the US Supreme Court did in 2022. The law contains an exception for the life of the pregnant person but not for circumstances like Jen’s, where her health was at risk but her life wasn’t immediately threatened.
    
            “I was sent home to grieve and mourn and call around to see if we could get an appointment out of state,” Jen said.
    
            That’s how she and John ended up making the drive to a clinic in Portland, a trip they said ultimately cost more than $1,500 for travel and the procedure itself, which they could afford only with the help of two abortion access funds as well as family.
    
            “For folks like us — you know, we’re regular Americans,” said John. “We don’t have those kinds of readily available liquid funds.”
    
            The cost took him by surprise, he said. But that’s not all.
    
            “We were really afraid that we were breaking the law by seeking this help,” John said. “We honestly felt like we were fleeing and had to do so under the cover of darkness. It was a really, really bizarre feeling … like we’re criminals that have to hide from the state.”
    
            It’s legal in Idaho for adults to travel to another state for an abortion.
    
            Jen said she and John also wanted to have testing on the fetus done to try to ensure that what had happened with this pregnancy wasn’t likely to happen again.
    
            “We wanted absolute certainty that this was a fluke thing … that this wasn’t some genetic condition that we created by our two genes mixing together,” Jen said. “We felt it would be irresponsible of us to try again without trying to get as much information as we could.”
    
            That’s how she ended up rushing out of the clinic in Portland, still feeling the effects of the anesthesia, carrying that package.
    
            “They didn’t know exactly what they could and couldn’t do for us,” John said. “They gave us basically a kit.”
    
            It contained the “product of conception,” he explained — the remains of “this child that we wanted.”
    
            They had to ship it that afternoon, they were told, “or they won’t be able to test it.”
    
            “So my memory is of walking into that first Walgreens and holding a brown paper bag that had our child in it and all the hopes and dreams and everything we wanted,” John said. “It was just such an ugly, dehumanizing experience that we didn’t need to have. It didn’t need to be that way.”
    
            Jen said they asked her doctors what the experience would have been like if it had happened before Roe v. Wade was overturned and Idaho’s trigger law took effect.
    
            “They said, ‘we would have referred you to a private clinic in downtown Boise,’” she recalled. “They would have done all the testing themselves, and it would have been a much more humane and dignified experience, and we would have been able to be around friends and family.”
    
            Still, the Adkinses were able to get the testing done in time. The results confirmed “what our doctors had already diagnosed,” that “this is Turner syndrome; it just happens at conception.”
    
            They weren’t at any higher risk than anyone else of having it happen again, they discovered.
    
            “Another maternal-fetal medicine specialist said, you know, ‘lightning struck your pregnancy,’” Jen said. “It certainly felt that way.”
    
            It’s not just patients who are feeling the effects of Idaho’s abortion law. Lyons, the family medicine doctor in Hailey, said many of her colleagues who treat higher-risk pregnant patients have left the state.
    
            “We had 10 perinatologists taking care of women in Idaho,” she told CNN. “That’s down to five, and two of those are working part-time.
    
            “Many of my colleagues felt like they could not practice the standard of care in Idaho anymore and that they were put into an ethical and moral dilemma as to how to help a woman who is in crisis,” she said.
    
            States with abortion bans tend to have about a third fewer ob/gyns per capita than states where abortion remains legal, a CNN analysis of federal data found.
    
            As of May 2022, there was one ob/gyn for about every 3,100 women of reproductive age in states where abortion is legal, compared with one for about every 4,500 in states where it is banned. Estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics capture employment data for obstetricians and gynecologists from 40 states; Idaho is among the 10 states that do not have data. Of those 10, abortion is banned in five states, it remains legal in four, and one has a gestational limit.
    
            The lawsuit from Jen Adkins, Lyons and other patients and their doctors, which was filed by the advocacy organization the Center for Reproductive Rights, seeks clarity on the medical exceptions in Idaho’s abortion bans. Lyons’ employer, St. Luke’s health system, is not a party to the suit.
    
            A spokesman for Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador said in a statement to CNN, “consistent with Idaho’s high regard for human life, the Defense of Life Act safeguards the life of pregnant women.”
    
            The statement disputed claims that doctors are leaving the state because of the law.
    
            “There is no evidence that there are fewer doctors in Idaho today than before these laws were put in place,” the statement said. “Our healthcare system is stronger and better serves women and children when our doctors prioritize saving two lives rather than prioritizing abortion on demand.”
    
            Dr. Thomas Lee, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, recently moved to St. Luke’s in Boise from Portland. The move, he said, was for personal reasons: “Boise is a wonderful place in general,” he told CNN via email. “Sunshine, city size, outdoor activities.”
    
            There are no legal restrictions on abortion in Oregon. Before the move, Lee said, he had “some very targeted conversations regarding the potential legal exposures given the abortion ban. … I did have some serious concerns about the impact upon patient care and the potential conflict between providing appropriate medical care to my patients … and violating Idaho law.”
    
            He said he’d “strongly disagree” with any assertion that doctors and other health-care providers in his field aren’t leaving the state.
    
            “This is absolutely not my impression during my brief time in practice in Idaho,” he said.
    
            He said two of the maternal-fetal medicine specialists, referred to as MFMs, in the practice he joined six months ago had left before he arrived, “reportedly due to the abortion ban,” and that “the other established MFM practice in town only has minimal staffing currently due to the departure of several of their MFMs prior to my arrival.”
    
            “I think the math is clear that MFM subspecialists have been leaving Idaho,” he said, and that “has significantly impacted access to care for high-risk pregnancy services – in a state/region in which access to these services had been already limited.”
    
            Jen has experienced that impact herself, she said, as she and John are now expecting again.
    
            “We are already experiencing canceled appointments and rescheduled appointments and going to different clinics because of availability,” Jen said. “The availability of just regular routine appointments has become scarce.”
    
            Fortunately, John added, “everything looks good now.”
    
            But anxiety remains.
    
            “I have friends that are pregnant at the same time as me here in the state, and we all kind of share the same sentiment,” Jen said. “We all just hope that we get through this pregnancy unscathed.”

      Parents seek justice for baby who was decapitated during delivery at a Georgia hospital
    ","

    ","
            A Georgia couple is seeking justice for the death last year of their baby during delivery at a Georgia hospital.
    
            The baby, Treveon Isaiah Taylor Jr., died from a broken neck and his head was detached, according to the Clayton County, Georgia, Medical Examiner’s Office, which determined the manner of death a homicide. That means the death was caused by another person, but it does not imply criminal activity. It’s up to local authorities to determine whether criminal charges should be filed in this case.
    
            The parents, Jessica Ross and Treveon Isaiah Taylor Sr., say that the doctor applied “excessive traction” to the baby’s head and neck during the delivery last July and that the hospital tried to cover up the details of death in the aftermath, including the fact that the baby was decapitated, according to a lawsuit filed in August.
    
            It was the funeral home that informed the parents about the decapitation, a discovery that the home’s general manager called “very disturbing.”
    
            After the medical examiner’s announcement, a spokesperson for the hospital, Southern Regional Medical Center, told CNN: “Due to current litigation, we are unable to comment.”
    
            “I just want justice for my baby boy,” the 21-year-old mother said Wednesday. “I’m hurt. I’m hurt bad. She (Dr. Tracey St. Julian) hurt me. She hurt my baby. She didn’t show no remorse.”
    
            Ross urged the nurses who were present during her delivery to come forward and give their account of what happened.
    
            “We just want justice for our son. They lied to us,” Taylor said Wednesday.
    
            When asked what justice for their son would look like, Taylor said he wants the hospital shut down.
    
            Ross and Taylor’s lawsuit alleges the Southern Regional Medical Center attempted to conceal the manner of death of the baby from her and her family, which the hospital has denied.
    
            When asked Wednesday whether she believes criminal charges are deserved in this case, Ross said, “Yes.”
    
            The case is under investigation by the Clayton County Police Department and could be referred to the District Attorney’s office, the medical examiner’s office said.
    
            The medical examiner’s office said Ross’s baby died from “fracture-dislocation with complete transection, upper cervical (C1-C2) spine and spinal cord,” due to “shoulder dystocia, arrest of labor, and fetal entrapment in the birth canal,” according to the news release.
    
            The medical examiner said pregnancy-induced diabetes and premature rupture of membranes were also significant conditions contributing to Taylor’s death.
    
            “I have never witnessed anything like this before. No one in our office has seen anything like this. Everyone we have consulted has never seen a situation like this before,” Clayton County Medical Examiner’s Director Brian Byars told CNN on Tuesday. “I find it very unusual that the hospital didn’t contact our office due to the amount of trauma that was involved in this incident.”
    
            Shoulder dystocia occurs when one or both of a baby’s shoulders get stuck behind the mother’s pubic bones during delivery.
    
            The doctor who delivered the baby, Dr. Tracey St. Julian, applied “excessive traction on the baby’s neck, in the face of the shoulder dystocia,” Dr. Roderick Edmond, an attorney for the parents, told reporters Wednesday.
    
            “We reject the assertion that the injury suffered during this tragic event happened before the demise of the baby. The official autopsy performed by the GBI did not classify a manner of death and stated that there was no sign of life upon delivery,” an attorney for St. Julian said in a statement.
    
            “Dr. St. Julian was faced with a dire obstetrical emergency where the mother’s life was in peril as well as the baby’s. Once it became clear that the baby did not survive the underlying severe shoulder dystocia (an unpreventable and unpredictable complication of delivery), the priority shifted to saving the mother’s life, which was thankfully accomplished.
    
            “The separation of the head from the fetal body occurred post-mortem and any assertion to the contrary is false. Although tragic, that rare outcome has been reported in the medical literature and can happen in the absence of any wrongdoing by the physician which is the case here.”
    
            St. Julian still holds a medical license and has privileges at two hospitals, including Southern Regional Medical Center, according to the Georgia Composite Medical Board. The medical board licenses doctors and other health care professionals in the state and enforces state regulations for practice. CNN has reached out to the board for comment.
    
            The family first learned the baby was decapitated from the Willie A. Watkins Funeral Home in Atlanta, where they wanted the baby’s services to be held. The baby was wrapped in sheets and was not visible during transportation from the hospital to the funeral home, general manager Sylvania Watkins told CNN on Wednesday.
    
            Once the baby arrived at the funeral home, Watkins said he noticed the baby’s head “was separated from the body,” adding: “Something was not right … this baby should have come from the medical center’s office.”
    
            “It was very disturbing,” Watkins said upon his discovery.
    
            The family was on their way to the funeral home to see the baby’s body when Watkins informed them the baby was decapitated, Watkins told CNN.
    
            The parent’s attorney said the alleged excessive traction was captured on video. He described the hospital’s actions in the aftermath of the death as “bizarre” and “diabolical.”
    
            Edmond said the hospital was not candid with the parents about the fact that the baby had been decapitated, urged the parents to have the baby cremated and told them they could not get a free autopsy.
    
            Ross went into labor on July 9 at full term. At the hospital, some 13 miles south of downtown Atlanta, her doctor attempted to deliver the baby using various methods, including “negligently” applying traction to the baby’s head, the lawsuit says.
    
            The doctor is accused of failing to do a Cesarean section “in a timely and proper manner,” which resulted in the baby’s decapitation and death, according to the lawsuit. The C-section was completed at about 3 a.m. on July 10, the filing said.
    
            When Ross and Taylor demanded to see and hold their baby, the hospital staff said they were not allowed but could view the body through a glass window, Edmond said.
    
            “During this viewing, their baby was wrapped tightly in a blanket with his head propped on top of his body in a manner such that those viewing him could not identify that he had been decapitated,” a statement from a family spokesperson said.
    
            “Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the family and all those impacted by this tragic event,” the medical center’s statement reads. “Our prayers also remain with the dedicated team of physicians, nurses and staff at Southern Regional Medical Center who cared for this patient. Our commitment is to provide compassionate, quality care to every single patient, and this loss is heartbreaking.”

      Opinion: The Jennifer Crumbley verdict is a powerful warning to parents
    ","
			Opinion by Jennifer Tucker

        6:05 PM EST, Wed February 7, 2024
    ","
            Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of a teenager who shot and killed four students and injured seven others at an Oxford, Michigan school in 2021, was found guilty Tuesday of all four counts of involuntary manslaughter. For this novel legal case, the jury of 12 deliberated for over 10 hours. Her son, Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 at the time of the shooting, pled guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the shooting and was sentenced last year to life in prison without parole. She’ll be sentenced on April 9.
    
            Her defense attorney, Shannon Smith, said Ethan’s crime was so horrendous that “it was unforeseeable.” But prosecutors disagreed, saying that the teen’s parents were aware that he was in crisis and had access to a gun and willfully disregarded the warning signs anyway. They alleged the parents bought their 15-year-old a 9mm Sig Sauer SP 2022 pistol as an early Christmas gift, a purchase that violated Michigan law. In the judge’s instructions to the jury, the key concept in determining guilt was that of “gross negligence.”
    
            Although parents of mass shooters have been prosecuted in civil court before, the trial of Jennifer Crumbley (and that of the father, James Crumbley, set to begin in March) marks the first time in US history that parents have been charged in criminal court for a mass school shooting committed by their child –and now one has been convicted.
    
            Prosecutors alleged that the Crumbley parents willfully disregarded warning signs that their son was in crisis, did not heed concerns of school administrators, bought him a gun days before the shooting and failed to lock it up. On the morning of the shooting, a teacher found a drawing on Ethan’s desk of a gun, bullet and shooting victim with the words “blood everywhere” and “the thoughts won’t stop, help me.” The teacher notified school authorities, who warned both Crumbley parents and said their son would require counseling.
    
            According to one prosecutor, both parents “resisted the idea” of their son leaving school at that time and “failed to ask if their son had his gun with them or where his gun was located and failed to inspect his backpack for the presence of the gun, which he had with him.”
    
            The question of who may bear responsibility when a minor carries out a shooting has gained fresh scrutiny in recent years, and it’s not just parents under the microscope. Others who could potentially bear liability but remain as yet undetermined range from gun manufacturers that advertise to children to weapons makers that create locks that allow customers to circumvent state bans on assault weapons. Attention has also fallen on Hollywood directors, who perpetuate false and misleading ideas about how guns are used in the real world.
    
            Another trial currently underway in Buffalo, New York explores the role of social media platforms that are accused of emboldening another shooter, Payton Gendron, who was 18 when he killed 10 people and injured three others in a racist attack at a supermarket in May 2022. Most of the social media companies have generally been hesitant to comment publicly.
    
            This case also involves novel legal theories, with plaintiffs arguing that social media and body armor companies enabled the killer. A representative for RMA Armament, the company that sold body armor to the accused Buffalo shooter, said in an email to the Buffalo News, “RMA Armament is saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred in Buffalo … Our products are intended for the protection of law-abiding private citizens, police departments and government partners.” The armor Gendron was wearing prevented a retired police officer at the scene from stopping the shooting.
    
            Plaintiffs’ attorneys contend that, like opioid drug products, these social media platforms, which include White supremacist content, are designed to create addiction. Yet last week, the social media companies asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing they cannot be held responsible for actions of third-party users. Like gun manufacturers, weapons dealers and others, they lay blame at the feet of only one person: the teen shooter.
    
            As gun laws are relaxed and guns and ammunition become increasingly lethal, it’s clear that simply pathologizing individual “bad actors” isn’t sufficient to stem the tide of gun violence in this country. The US has by far the highest rate of child and teen firearm mortality among peer nations, and in 2020, firearm injuries became the leading cause of death among US children and adolescents. In contrast, firearms do not make the top four causes of death for young people in any other similarly large, wealthy country.
    
            Often, the risk to children resides right at home. According to the Giffords Law Center, “Studies show that between 70% and 90% of guns used in youth suicides, unintentional shootings among children and school shootings perpetrated by shooters under the age of 18 are acquired from the home or the homes of relatives or friends.”
    
            In the Crumbley trial, there was a focus on how, and whether, guns were secured in the home. Currently, gun owners face criminal charges for the negligent storage of firearms where a child can gain access in 26 states and the District of Columbia. However, there are no federal laws requiring the safe storage of guns.
    
            Yet, research shows that even parents who think their guns are inaccessible to minors are mistaken. For example, a 2021 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed even in homes where parents believed their guns were locked away, children said they could find and unlock them in under five minutes. And while many parents believe keeping guns stored “locked and loaded” will protect their families against potential home invaders, the greater risk actually is that the gun will be used by a member of the family.
    
            Although the Crumbley case is unusual as a case in criminal law, it’s not the first time that parents have been brought to court when their minor children or teens have harmed or killed others with a firearm. In these circumstances, parents have been sued under civil law for reckless conduct, neglect or negligent entrustment as a result of their actions, such as inadequate supervision or carelessness. Such cases are treated similarly in certain states (including Michigan) to car accidents caused by teen drivers, in which parents can be held liable.
    
            For example, the father of a mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, on July 4, 2022 was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior.
    
            The father, Robert Crimo, Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail. The mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year also faced charges; she pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm.
    
            Most parents want their children to be safe, yet many continue to enable household access to loaded guns.
    
            The American legal system is structured to focus on the individual — getting to the truth via the adversarial system. Meanwhile, the American public typically wants a single, individual villain to be held accountable. Placing blame solely on the individual shooter is a stance staunchly promoted by the National Rifle Association and other powerful gun rights groups. In fact, a recent study shows that states often loosened gun laws after mass shootings, especially states with Republican legislatures.
    
            Yet the Crumbley trial and other similar cases shine a light on how a shooter rarely acts “alone.” It’s a wake-up call, alerting us to the need for a cultural shift around this complex issue if we ever hope to change our country’s shameful standing when it comes to gun violence affecting children.
    
            This case opens the door for parents to be held legally accountable, and reminds all parents of their responsibilities when it comes to gun safety. It also presents an opportunity to take a broader view of the multiple factors that contribute to the scourge of gun violence in this country. Everyone wants to find a single villain, but the reality is that everybody is at risk and many people are responsible.

      As guns rise to leading cause of death among US children, research funding to help prevent and protect victims lags
    ","
			By Deidre McPhillips, CNN

    ","
            More children die from guns than anything else in the United States, but relatively little funding is available to study how to prevent these tragedies.
    
            From 2008 to 2017, about $12 million in federal research awards were granted to study pediatric firearm mortality each year – about $600 per life lost, according to a study published in Health Affairs. Motor vehicle crashes, the leading cause of death among children at the time, received about $26,000 of research funding per death, while funding to study pediatric cancer, the third leading cause of death, topped $195,000 per death.
    
            By 2020, firearm deaths in the US had reached record levels and guns had surpassed car crashes to become the leading cause of death among children. More than 4,300 children and teens died from guns in 2020, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – a 27% jump from 2017, and a number that has only continued to rise. But federal dollars haven’t followed proportionately.
    
            Congress has earmarked about $25 million for firearm injury prevention research each year since 2020, split evenly between the CDC and the National Institutes of Health. Even if all of those dollars were spent on studies focused on pediatric deaths from firearm injury, it’d still be less than $6,000 per death.
    
            When the Parkland school shooting happened in 2018, more than two decades had passed since Congress had dedicated federal funding to research firearm injury prevention. A legislative provision enacted in 1996, known as the Dickey Amendment, specifically prohibits the use of federal funds to advocate or promote gun control, but it had a chilling effect on firearm injury research overall.
    
            In March 2018, a month after Parkland, Congress included a report on the Dickey Amendment in a spending bill, clarifying that it does not prohibit research on the root causes of gun violence. But it wasn’t until 2020 that the budget actually included money specifically for this purpose.
    
            In the nearly quarter century that it took to unwind uncertainties in the interpretation of the provision – a period of time that included Columbine, Sandy Hook and many more deadly shootings – guns killed 789,000 people in the US, including 75,000 children and teens.
    
            After decades of stalled progress, new research shows that the recent bump in federal funding – incommensurate, as it may be – aligns with a rise in all kinds of related work.
    
            From 2020 to 2022, there were about 90% more registered clinical trials and publications related to firearm injury prevention research than there were from 2017 to 2019, according to a research letter published Wednesday in JAMA Surgery. About half were funded and half were unfunded.
    
            For Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, progress in the field of firearm injury research is a “dance between hope and frustration.” Ranney, who is also an emergency physician, was involved in both the new research and the earlier study analyzing the federal dollars invested into the leading causes of death among children.
    
            “We know that the $25 million that has been appropriated to NIH and CDC is a drop in the bucket compared to the magnitude of the problem, and compared to the funds that are put into other similar diseases and injuries,” she said. “But nonetheless, it was worth saying, ‘Did this investment make a difference?’ And I was actually quite heartened in the analysis to see this huge correlation between federal funding and the number of publications and studies being initiated.”
    
            Federal funding helps destigmatize work on a topic, experts say.
    
            Many researchers who focus their work on firearm injury said they were consistently advised by mentors, colleagues and others to pick a different field of study – as recently as a few years ago.
    
            “As I was just starting out as a researcher, I was advised to steer my research towards areas that will have consistent funding in order to be able to launch a career that is sustainable. The risk is that there will be so many stops and starts to this kind of work until there can be a consistent funding stream,” said Dr. Jennifer Hoffmann, an emergency physician at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and an assistant professor at Northwestern University.
    
            “It’s a really hard area to start investing a research career, and we’ve lost a whole generation of researchers. We need to start from scratch and entirely rebuild the research workforce.”
    
            Backing from the CDC and NIH also helps validate the strength of the research, thanks to the rigorous project selection process and peer-review system for findings. The extra dollar amounts also allow for researchers to be more ambitious with their work.
    
            In 2019, a group of researchers published a special report in JAMA Pediatrics outlining dozens of urgent research questions to guide a research agenda to better understand firearm injury prevention as a “critical step for reducing pediatric mortality.”
    
            Without federal funding, researchers have done their best to cobble together the public data that is available to start to answer these questions – many without dedicated time or pay for the work.
    
            The CDC’s National Violent Death Reporting System has been an important source, for example. The agency has a separate stream of funding for the dataset, which tracks some specific details about gun deaths, but significant gaps remain.
    
            “The questions that we’re asking and answering are important but they’re just kind of the tip of the iceberg,” Ranney said. “I wish we could go faster and farther.”
    
            In 2020, the CDC was able to fund 16 awards to study firearm injuries with the $12.5 million allocation from Congress.
    
            “Everybody has realized that firearms are a leading mechanism for violent deaths, that has never been questioned. I think what has been harder to say is what can we do about it,” said Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s chief medical officer.
    
            People haven’t always viewed firearm violence or suicides as preventable, she said. The same perceptions were true for motor vehicle crashes, until research built the scientific evidence to show otherwise – and the hope is that the investments in research offer solutions and help shift perceptions around gun deaths, too.
    
            Political views around firearms have also affected research funding, but preventing firearm injuries and deaths doesn’t have to infringe upon legal firearm ownership, experts say.
    
            “We talk to a lot of people about how to keep their kids safe around pools. We don’t tell them they can’t own a pool,” said Dr. Patrick Carter, an associate professor at the University of Michigan and co-director of the university’s Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention. “Same thing is true of cars. Same thing is true of medications.”
    
            But reducing deaths from car crashes, for example, required looking at the problem from lots of different angles – including seatbelts, airbags, changing driver behavior around drinking and driving, building safer roads – and the same approach will be needed for firearm deaths, he said. But the field is far from that point right now.
    
            “Building that capacity is really critical to moving the needle and reversing the trends that we’re seeing,” Carter said. “It can’t be 12 people around the country doing (full time) research, it really has to be many more than that.”
    
            Good research also takes time. Some of the researchers that the CDC funded in 2020 are just starting to release findings, including a new study from January with early data showing that systems that let schoolchildren report anonymous tips help prevent school shootings and suicides.
    
            Consistent investment is critical to consistent progress, experts say.
    
            “If there isn’t continued funding (from Congress), that research would stop midway. Continued funding will continue to support this work. Increased funding would allow us to find even more competitive applications because there’s been such interest in this,” CDC’s Houry said. “So we will do the best with whatever budget we have. But certainly, if there aren’t dollars for this, we will not be able to continue this work and some of it will stop immediately.”

      Making pregnancy safer for Black women
    ","
			By Martha Shade, CNN

    ","
            Kira Johnson was so excited to be a mother that she began planning her first son’s birthday party while still pregnant. The carnival-themed party she threw was epic: cake, cupcakes and a movie poster she had printed up for the occasion.
    
            Kira didn’t get to celebrate any birthday parties with her second son, Langston. She died hours after giving birth to him, suffering massive internal bleeding while her husband, Charles Johnson, pleaded for doctors to do something.
    
            It’s a case so troubling it’s now taught as a cautionary tale in medical schools. And she’s just one of many.
    
            Black women are three times more likely to die due to pregnancy than White women.
    
            Poverty, lack of healthcare access and obesity all play a part in the grim statistic, but that’s not the whole story; even rich, healthy, well-educated Black women face elevated risks giving birth.
    
            Kira Johnson was a successful businesswoman, an athlete in good health, and she walked into the hospital with a supportive husband by her side.
    
            Her life ended in the hospital, her husband says, after their pleas for help were ignored by doctors for almost 10 hours. And her husband walked out of the hospital a widow, with a newborn son in his arms.
    
            Here’s what’s being done to prevent more Black mothers from dying.
    
            Natalie Hernandez-Green, the founder and Executive Director of the Center for Maternal Health Equity at Morehouse School of Medicine, says she hears the same birthing stories over and over: Women who felt they were disrespected, whose concerns were dismissed and had birthing experiences that felt transactional and not relational.
    
            “You want to be heard when you’re giving life. This should be the most amazing day of your life,” says Hernandez-Green.
    
            The Center for Maternal Health Equity has partnered with local Atlanta hospitals to gather data about “Maternal Near-Misses” and see where the problems are.
    
            Key to everything is listening to the patient, Hernandez-Green tells CNN.
    
            “We want to respect that Black women’s voices are legitimate sources of data,” she says.
    
            Beyond Morehouse School of Medicine’s commitment to training more Black doctors, one of the center’s approaches is to educate “Patient Navigators” to assist Black women, especially those who live in “maternal care deserts,” or areas without a lot of health care providers.
    
            The Patient Navigators act as a bridge to doctors and other medical professionals.They can connect women to providers – and Morehouse School of Medicine even vets those providers to make sure they provide good care to Black women.
    
            The Patient Navigators then work alongside the pregnant woman from her first pre-natal visits to one year postpartum.
    
            “The majority of pregnancy-related deaths happen in the postpartum period,” explains Hernandez-Green.
    
            “More than 80% of these deaths are preventable. I always see opportunities. It’s not all gloom and doom, because there’s hope.”
    
            Heather Dobbs is a recent graduate of the Patient Navigator program.
    
            She had her own traumatic birth experience. Shortly after a scheduled c-section for her second child, she began to feel terrible. The anesthesiologist told her everything was fine and she just needed fluids. Dobbs recovered briefly, then she says she began feeling “really awful” again. She said to herself: “I can’t die on this table without holding my daughter. Then I blacked out.”
    
            When she woke up her husband, Michael, was by her side, crying. She had a port in her neck, where she had received an emergency transfusion. Doctors had performed a hysterectomy to save her life.
    
            She was grateful to be alive but “later on, it sinks in that I was planning a larger family and now that’s not gonna happen.”
    
            The experience made her want to help other women.
    
            She thought about getting her nursing certification and becoming a midwife, but in the rural Georgia areas where she saw so much need, she would have had to work under an ob/gyn. And most of those areas didn’t even have doctors, so she decided to work both as a Patient Navigator and doula.
    
            Although the roles can overlap, in general, a Patient Navigator helps patients find good care and advocates for them, while a doula actually helps a woman give birth. Many alumni of the Morehouse School of Medicine program, like Dobbs, choose to do both jobs. A midwife, in contrast, is usually a certified nurse.
    
            As both a Patient Navigator and a doula, Dobbs follows women throughout their first year after childbirth, helping them handle the physical and mental health issues that can arise after childbirth.
    
            April Witzel says she spent years as a labor and delivery nurse before becoming a midwife.
    
            She has also catered to some of the most under-served parts of the state. She regularly sees women show up at the hospital right as they are about to give birth, without having had any pre-natal care, usually because they didn’t have insurance.
    
            “I grew up poor. I’ve always thought everyone should be treated the same,” she says, explaining that her own life experience now informs much of what she does.
    
            Witzel says she also wants to help address systemic issues that often keep Black women from accessing good care.
    
            “When I got into healthcare, me being a Caucasian female working in a primarily African American community, I’d walk in and I’d see the look on their faces, and know they thought: ‘I don’t want her to look after me.’ “
    
            But after her patients got to know her and realized she was taking their concerns seriously, things changed.
    
            “At the end of the day, women want to be heard, they want to trust their provider in the most vulnerable time of their lives.”
    
            Many doctors are supportive of the additional help provided by midwives and doulas – as long as medical help is nearby when needed.
    
            “I think there’s a place for birthing centers, midwives, doulas,” says Dr. Jocelyn Slaughter, an obstetrician and gynecologist.
    
            “I love a good doula. I love a good midwife. Birthing centers are getting more safe; it’s good for patients that are low-risk” says Dr. Slaughter.
    
            CNN Anchor Abby Phillip recently opened up about why she opted for the combination of doula and a midwife when she gave birth during the pandemic. As she explained in a CNN editorial, she is a “a huge believer in modern medicine and someone who takes no unnecessary risks with my health” but she says she joined the growing group of Black women looking for more options.
    
            Many women in the US often work all the way up until they give birth, usually in order to save up vacation days for after their child is born.
    
            But Dr. Slaughter says that practice can be especially dangerous for Black women.
    
            “I always say: ‘You know you’re not about to go on vacation, right?’”
    
            “What if I told you in two weeks you’re going to run a marathon, you’re going to give two pints of blood, and after the marathon we’re gonna wake you up every two hours?”
    
            “Don’t you need a break before you go through this cardiac stress?” asks Dr. Slaughter.
    
            Dr. Slaughter says she encourages her patients to take maternity leave by 37 weeks, to reduce their chances of developing conditions like pre-eclampsia, a condition that can be life-threatening.
    
            “They’re working till the end, stressed out, feet swollen… so now they’re getting pre-eclampsia. I feel like my patients have a little lower rate of pre-eclampsia because I encourage them to start maternity leave by 37 weeks.”
    
            While Dr. Slaughter is realistic that not everyone can afford to take that time off, she says when it’s possible, it can provide better outcomes for the mother and the baby.
    
            Dr. Slaughter says people don’t like to talk about one of the main reasons Black women often receive inadequate care during and after pregnancy.
    
            Slaughter says the lasting legacy of slavery and racism in the United States continues to affect Black women in all settings, including in health care.
    
            “Because of that history, there are so many racial biases, and so many socio-economical problems that women have had to fight through,” she says.
    
            Dr. Slaughter says she believes Black women should be treated as more fragile than other women during pregnancy (and for the first year after they give birth).
    
            “My piano teacher always told me being pregnant is like having one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana peel,” referring to all the potential perils of pregnancy.
    
            “Black women in general have been looked at as these strong women…That’s all doctors; it’s not just White doctors. Black women are not stronger than others. They’re not.”
    
            Dr. Slaughter says because of that misconception, doctors may miss cardiac issues happening in Black women.
    
            The bottom line for Dr. Slaughter: “Black women need to be overly protected during pregnancy.”
    
            Dr. Slaughter also recommends medical providers remember that Black women’s bodies don’t always follow the rules in medicine “because the rules were not based upon their bodies.”
    
            Many of the criteria for different medical diagnoses were based upon White men or White women.
    
            “Blood pressure cut-offs, anemia levels, were not established with Black women in mind,” she says.
    
            “I am not suggesting we get new criteria, but I do urge doctors to listen to Black pregnant women and err on the side of extreme caution when discharging or dismissing symptoms or complaints. Sometimes they know their bodies better than our medical school books.”
    
            After his wife passed away, Charles Johnson pledged her death would not be in vain.
    
            He has testified before Congress twice, helping to pass the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act in 2018 and then advocating for the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021.
    
            He still prints up a movie poster for each of his son’s birthdays. It’s a small nod to Kira, the family tradition she started, and the birthday parties she would have loved to have been planning for them.

      Jurors found a school shooter’s mother guilty of manslaughter. Here’s why the verdict matters - and what it means for parents

            Six men and six women handed down a stunning verdict in Michigan Tuesday, finding Jennifer Crumbley – whose son killed four high school students in 2021 – guilty of four involuntary manslaughter counts in a case experts say sets an important precedent of whether – and how – parents of school shooters can be held accountable.
    
            “Every time we have seen, sadly, a school shooting, a mass shooting in this country, what do we all do? Viscerally, we ask what the parents knew,” CNN anchor and Chief Legal Analyst Laura Coates told CNN’s Brianna Keilar and Boris Sanchez Tuesday afternoon.
    
            “This trial was about red flags, it was answering the question of, ‘What if red flags are waving right before a parent’s eyes and they do not act in a way that we want them to?’”
    
            Prosecutors argued Crumbley was aware of her son Ethan’s deteriorating mental health in the months ahead of the shooting, pointing to several disturbing text exchanges, and accused her of gifting him a gun just days before the shooting and not properly storing it.
    
            They also argued she failed to take any kind of action – including not mentioning the recent gun purchase – when school officials called the Crumbleys in the morning of the shooting after a teacher found Ethan’s violent drawings and urged them to take him out of school and get him immediate mental health assistance.
    
            Ethan, who was then 15, would take a firearm out of his backpack shortly after that meeting and kill four students – Hana St. Juliana, Tate Myre, Madisyn Baldwin and Justin Shilling – at Oxford High School. He wounded seven other people.
    
            Defense attorney Shannon Smith told jurors this case was a “very dangerous one for parents out there,” saying others could find themselves in Crumbley’s shoes, being held responsible for their child’s actions.
    
            But legal experts told CNN while the verdict is unprecedented in that it holds a parent directly accountable in a school shooting, a verdict of this nature remains incredibly rare.
    
            “What’s historic is that parents aren’t generally responsible for unforeseen things that their child could do,” said Janet Johnson, a Florida criminal defense attorney. “But this rose to the level where it was foreseeable.”
    
            Tuesday’s guilty verdict sets an important precedent on who aside from the perpetrator can be held accountable for school or mass shootings – where shooters often also die in the attack and communities are left seeking justice.
    
            “What is sort of historic and groundbreaking about the Crumbley prosecution is, in some respects, the ways in which mass shootings have put pressure to extend criminal liability to places prosecutors hadn’t traditionally gone before,” said Eve Primus, Yale Kamisar Collegiate Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School.
    
            But reaching a guilty verdict in cases like these can be incredibly difficult.
    
            “I think many people have seen the verdict and have thought that this case somehow opens the floodgates to a number of additional prosecutions of parents for the acts of their minor kids,” Primus said. “And I actually don’t necessarily agree.”
    
            There are high requirements prosecutors must meet to prove involuntary manslaughter cases, including that the defendants were grossly negligent and that the deadly outcome could have been foreseen, she said.
    
            “There were circumstances around Ethan Crumbley’s case that gave the prosecutor a lot of evidence that probably doesn’t exist in a lot of other cases,” Primus said.
    
            Prosecutors alleged Crumbley knew or should have known about Ethan’s deteriorating mental health issues, pointing to a series of texts he sent her in the spring of 2021 saying there was a ghost or devil in the house and pleading for her response. Ethan also texted a friend saying he had told his parents about the hallucinations and asked for help, but his mother laughed at him.
    
            During her testimony, Crumbley said her son’s texts about a ghost were part of an ongoing joke about their house being haunted and said the text to his friend was false.
    
            Crumbley testified her son never asked to get help for mental health issues – a claim contradicting what Ethan wrote in his private journals.
    
            In journal entries jurors saw, Ethan wrote he wanted help “or a therapist” but his parents wouldn’t listen.
    
            Crumbley also testified she was aware her son was “acting depressed” in the months before the school shooting.
    
            “The defense tried their best to instill fear in those jurors by saying, ‘This could be you, you can be Jennifer Crumbley, you can have a child that takes these heinous acts … and somehow you’ll be found culpable,’” said legal analyst and trial attorney Mercedes Colwin.
    
            “(Smith) did all she could to instill that fear. But it couldn’t overcome the mountain of evidence against Jennifer Crumbley about the many times she could have interceded, could have assisted her child and could have certainly made sure that gun would not be in his possession on that fateful day,” Colwin added.
    
            Ethan pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage. He was sentenced last year to life in prison without parole. He did not testify in this trial.
    
            Many legal experts saw the meeting between Ethan’s parents and school officials on the morning of the attack as key evidence that led to the verdict.
    
            The Crumbleys were called into the school for a meeting after a teacher found violent drawings from Ethan that included a gun, a person bleeding, and the phrases “the thoughts won’t stop help me,” and “blood everywhere.”
    
            A school counselor testified the Crumbleys declined to take their son out of school because they didn’t want to miss work. The parents did agree to take their son to a mental health professional within 48 hours, but did not mention they had recently purchased Ethan a new gun or his texts about hallucinations.
    
            “The school administrators were handicapped by not having the knowledge that he had a gun,” Coates, the CNN legal analyst, said. “They didn’t check the school bookbag. The parents were aware that he had a gun at least in the home, did not check, did not follow up.”
    
            Involuntary manslaughter is based not on intent, Coates explained, but on careless disregard, extreme recklessness and negligence, “where you could have prevented something and did not do so.”
    
            The case tested a “core legal principle that you can’t be responsible for someone else’s acts,” University of Michigan professor Ekow Yankah said in a statement.
    
            “But the facts are so damning – the parents did not tell the school that they had bought him a gun and he might be armed – that it almost felt like the case was meant to push that legal principle to its limit,” he said.
    
            “I think what the jury thought was that, when faced with this many facts, (Jennifer Crumbley) had every opportunity to stop this awful day from occurring and that ultimately she eventually bears some of the responsibility.”
    
            Ethan’s father, James, is scheduled to stand trial next month on the same charges. The outcome of his case will depend on a new set of facts and what prosecutors are able to prove he was aware of.
    
            In her trial, Jennifer Crumbley testified her husband was responsible for safely storing the gun. But whether Ethan’s father was aware – to the same extent as Jennifer Crumbley – of his son’s mental struggles will come out at trial.
    
            “I don’t know that we can infer that just because Jennifer Crumbley was convicted that it is more or less likely that her husband will be convicted,” Primus said.
    
            “I do think we’ve learned from Jennifer Crumbley’s case that it is possible for the prosecutor to convince 12 people beyond a reasonable doubt that a parent can be held liable.”

      Foods we eat are covered in plastics that may be causing a rise in premature births, study says
    ","

    ","
            Premature births are on the rise, yet experts aren’t sure why. Now, researchers have found synthetic chemicals called phthalates used in clear food packaging and personal care products could be a culprit, according to a new study.
    
            Past research has demonstrated that phathalates — known as “everywhere chemicals” because they are so common — are hormone disruptors that can impact how the life-giving placenta functions. This organ is the source of oxygen and nutrients for a developing fetus in the womb.
    
            “Phthalates can also contribute to inflammation that can disrupt the placenta even more and set the steps of preterm labor in motion,” said lead author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health.
    
            “Studies show the largest association with preterm labor is due to a phthalate found in food packaging called Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, or DEHP,” Trasande said. “In our new study, we found DEHP and three similar chemicals could be responsible for 5% to 10% of all the preterm births in 2018. This could be one of the reasons why preterm births are on the rise.”
    
            The 5% to 10% percentage translated into nearly 57,000 preterm births in the United States during 2018, at a cost to society of nearly $4 billion in that year alone, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Lancet Planetary Health.
    
            “This paper focused on the relationship between exposure to individual phthalates and preterm birth. But that’s not how people are exposed to chemicals,” said Alexa Friedman, a senior scientist of toxicology at the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, in an email.
    
            “Every day, they’re often exposed to more than one phthalate from the products they use, so the risk of preterm birth may actually be greater,” said Friedman, who was not involved in the study.
    
            The American Chemistry Council, an industry trade association for US chemical companies, told CNN the report did not establish causation.
    
            “Not all phthalates are the same, and it is not appropriate to group them as a class. The term ‘phthalates’ simply refers to a family of chemicals that happen to be structurally similar, but which are functionally and toxicologically distinct from each other,” a spokesperson for the council’s ’s High Phthalates Panel wrote in an email.
    
            Globally, approximately 8.4 million metric tons of phthalates and other plasticizers are consumed every year, according to European Plasticisers, an industry trade association.
    
            Manufacturers add phthalates to consumer products to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break, primarily in polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, products such as children’s toys.
    
            Phthalates are also found in detergents; vinyl flooring, furniture and shower curtains; automotive plastics; lubricating oils and adhesives; rain and stain-resistant products; clothing and shoes; and scores of personal care products including shampoo, soap, hair spray and nail polish, in which they make fragrances last longer.
    
            Studies have connected phthalates to childhood obesity, asthma, cardiovascular issues, cancer and reproductive problems such as genital malformations and undescended testes in baby boys and low sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult males.
    
            “The Consumer Product Safety Commission no longer allows eight dif­ferent phthalates to be used at levels higher than 0.1% in the manufacture of children’s toys and child care products,” Trasande said. “However, not all of the eight have been limited in food packaging by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration).”
    
            In response to governmental and consumer concerns, manufacturers may create new versions of chemicals that no longer fall under any restrictions. Take DEHP, for example, which has been replaced by newer phthalates called di-isodecylphthalate (DiDP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP).
    
            Are those safer than the original? That’s not what scientists say they typically discover as they spend years and thousands of dollars to test the newcomers.
    
            “Why would we think that you can make a very minor change in a molecule you are manufacturing and the body wouldn’t react in the same way?” asked toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, as well as the National Toxicology Program. She, too, was not involved in the paper.
    
            “Phthalates should be regulated as a class (of chemicals). Many of us have been trying to get something done on this for years,” Birnbaum said in an email.
    
            The new research used data from the National Institutes of Health’s Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes, or ECHO, study, which investigates the impact of early environmental influences on children’s health and development. In 69 sites around the country, expectant mothers and their newborns are evaluated and provide blood, urine and other biological samples to be analyzed.
    
            The team identified 5,006 pregnant mothers with urine samples that tested positive for different types of phthalates and compared those with the baby’s gestational age at birth, birthweight and birth length.
    
            Data was also pulled from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a government program that assesses the health and nutritional status of Americans using a combination of interviews, physical examinations and laboratory analysis of biological specimens.
    
            After analyzing the information, Trasande and his coauthors were able to confirm past research showing a significant association of DEHP with shorter pregnancies and preterm birth.
    
            Interestingly, however, the research team found the three phthalates created by manufacturers to replace DEHP were actually more dangerous than DEHP when it came to preterm birth.
    
            “When we looked further into these replacements, we found even stronger effects of DiDP, DnOP and DiNP,” Trasande said. “It took less of a dose in order to create the same outcome of prematurity.”
    
            A birth is considered preterm if it occurs before 37 weeks of gestation — a full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks or more. Because vital organs and part of the nervous system may not be fully developed, a premature birth may place the baby at risk. Babies born extremely early are often immediately hospitalized to help the infant breathe and address any heart, digestive and brain issues or an inability to fight off infections.
    
            As they grow up, children born prematurely may have vision, hearing and dental issues, as well as intellectual and developmental delays, according to the Mayo Clinic. Prematurity can contribute to cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and mental health disorders such as anxiety, bipolar disorder and depression.
    
            As adults, people born prematurely may also have higher blood pressure and cholesterol, asthma and other respiratory infections and develop type 1 and type 2 diabetes, heart disease, heart failure or stroke.
    
            All of these medical expenses add up, allowing Trasande and his coauthors to estimate the cost to the US in medical care and lost economic productivity from preterm births to be “a staggering $3.8 billion,” said EWG’s Alexa Friedman.
    
            “But the real cost lies in the impact on infants’ health,” Friedman said.
    
            There are additional steps one can take to reduce exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in food and food packaging products, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics’ policy statement on food additives and children’s health.
    
            “One is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,” said Trasande, who was lead author for the AAP statement.
    
            “Avoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don’t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,” he added. “Look at the recycling code on the bottom of products to find the plastic type, and avoid plastics with recycling codes 3, which typically contain phthalates.”

      Moms for Liberty faces new challenges and growing pushback over its conservative education agenda
    ","
			By Denise Royal, Carlos Suarez and Ray Sanchez, CNN

  Published
        9:48 AM EST, Sat February 3, 2024
    ","
            In Florida, where the right-wing Moms for Liberty group was born in response to Covid-19 school closures and mask mandates, the first Brevard County School Board meeting of the new year considered whether two bestselling novels – “The Kite Runner” and “Slaughterhouse-Five” – should be banned from schools.
    
            A lone Moms for Liberty supporter sat by herself at the January 23 meeting, where opponents of the book ban outnumbered her.
    
            Nearly 20 speakers voiced opposition to removing the novels from school libraries. One compared the book-banning effort to Nazi Germany. Another accused Moms for Liberty of waging war on teachers. No one spoke in favor of the ban. About three hours into the meeting, the board voted quickly to keep the two books on the shelves of high schools.
    
            “Why are we banning books?” asked Mindy McKenzie, a mom and nurse who is a member of Stop Moms for Liberty, which was formed to counter what it calls a far-right extremist group “pushing for book banning and destroying public education.”
    
            “Why are we letting Moms for Liberty infiltrate our school system?”
    
            Moms for Liberty, founded in 2021, expanded its mission to include efforts to ban certain books from schools, outlaw the teaching and discussion of gender and sexuality by teachers and halt the teaching of critical race theory.
    
            Now the group is at a crossroads.
    
            “One of their major challenges is the fact that most Americans are actually pretty positive about their own children’s schools,” Jack Schneider, a professor of education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said via email. “Although their message may have appeal in the abstract, at least to conservative voters, families aren’t clamoring for disruption in their own children’s schools.”
    
            After effectively channeling conservative anger over cultural issues into action on the ground, from supporting candidates in school board races to spearheading campaigns against teachers, administrators and other political foes, Moms for Liberty’s burgeoning influence in Republican national politics may be faltering, observers say.
    
            A sex scandal involving the husband of Moms for Liberty co-founder Bridget Ziegler, a Sarasota County school board member, has not helped the group’s cause.
    
            Ziegler has been on the forefront of the cultural battles GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has waged in the public schools. DeSantis named her to the board now overseeing the Walt Disney Company’s special tax district in central Florida amid his clash with the entertainment giant over a state law that restricted how sexual orientation and gender identity could be taught in the classroom. Ziegler remains on the school board despite calls for her to step down.
    
            “It seems to me a bit premature, or more than a bit premature, to write it off entirely,” Glenn Altschuler, an American studies professor at Cornell University, told CNN, referring to Moms for Liberty. “Will it have national prominence that resembles the prominence that it had early on in its founding? I think that’s unlikely.”
    
            Moms for Liberty first garnered national attention in 2021 in the same vast room where the Brevard County School Board met recently.
    
            One of its founding members, Tina Descovich, a former Brevard County School Board member, became an outspoken critic of mask mandates during the pandemic. The group’s popularity exploded as it accused public schools of indoctrinating children with a liberal learning agenda. Soon, the number of chapters and membership across the country began to take off.
    
            “To say it’s waning, I think that’s ridiculous,” Descovich told CNN, referring to the organization’s influence. “We are just doing the work that we’re doing.”
    
            Moms for Liberty bills itself as a protector of parental rights at all levels of government, an opponent of government overreach and intimidation and a non-political grassroots organization.
    
            The Moms for Liberty summit in Philadelphia last June was headlined by former President Donald Trump and other Republican White House hopefuls in a sign of the group’s growing influence in GOP politics.
    
            “In school board races, PTA meetings and town halls across the nation, you have taught the radical left Marxists and communists a lesson they will never forget: Don’t mess with America’s moms,” Trump told the summit. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to America.”
    
            The summit also heard from DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
    
            “It’s because they know that moms are passionate about these issues,” Descovich said of the conservative politicians making the summit a mandatory stop on the GOP presidential primary campaign trail.
    
            Moms for Liberty has grown dramatically. It claims to have 130,000 members in 300 chapters across 48 states, according to the organization. In late 2021, months after it was founded, the group said it had 70,000 members in 167 chapters across more than 30 states.
    
            But its track record of supporting winning candidates in school board elections took a hit last year.
    
            In 2023, Moms for Liberty said 43% of the 202 candidates they endorsed won their school board election, the organization said. In 2022, the group endorsed 500 candidates, with 55% winning their elections.
    
            “This will be our third election cycle getting involved in school board races,” Descovich said. “I’d say the first year was kind of happenstance.”
    
            Still, the organization’s pledge to shake up school boards across the nation has widely not materialized.
    
            “If you go to their claims about wins, they are in districts that tilt very heavily toward a friendly constituency,” Altschuler said. “The mark of a movement, its success is when it begins to spread beyond that rather predictable constituency. And right now, they haven’t done that.”
    
            The group’s unrelenting attacks against books that take on difficult issues, the rights of LGBTQ students and diversity initiatives have not translated into electoral success, according to observers.
    
            “Sowing chaos is a lot easier than governing,” Schneider said. “It’s one thing to smear teachers or to level outrageous claims about the curriculum. It’s another thing entirely to convince local voters – people who have a stake in the schools actually functioning – that you have the good sense and the practical skills to oversee school district operations.”
    
            The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights watchdog group, has labeled Moms for Liberty “far-right organization that engages in anti-student inclusion activities and self-identifies as part of the modern parental rights movement.”
    
            Among the public comments flagged by the SPLC was a tweet that year from the group’s account that called gender dysphoria “a mental health disorder that is being normalized by predators across the USA.”
    
            Meanwhile, a movement that says it seeks to protect children against the dissemination of material deemed to be sexualized has been rocked by a sex scandal.
    
            The scandal sent shockwaves through GOP circles in Florida, where Ziegler and her husband, Christian Ziegler, the former chairman of the state’s Republican Party, were considered political stalwarts. The couple rose from their base of power in Sarasota County into significant statewide figures under the Florida governor.
    
            Christian Ziegler had been under investigation since October, after a woman accused him of raping her at her apartment after she canceled a three-way sexual encounter with him and his wife, according to a search warrant affidavit, which CNN obtained from the Florida Center for Government Accountability.
    
            The Sarasota Police Department said last month Christian Ziegler will not be charged with sexually assaulting the woman, but authorities will seek to charge him with video voyeurism over an alleged recording of the encounter.
    
            An investigation concluded the sexual encounter between Christian Ziegler and the woman was “likely consensual,” the police department said.
    
            Ziegler was ousted from his role as Florida GOP chairman last month amid the investigation.
    
            Police said the woman told investigators she did not consent to the recording of the sexual encounter. Investigators said they prepared a probable cause affidavit against Ziegler for the felony crime of video voyeurism. In Florida, videotaping a sexual encounter without consent is a third-degree felony.
    
            The case was turned over to the state attorney’s office for review, according to police.
    
            Ziegler’s attorney Derek Byrd said in a statement to CNN his client’s reputation and professional life have suffered “irreparable harm.”
    
            “At the beginning of the investigation we asked and warned the public to withhold judgment of criminal wrongdoing until a thorough investigation of the facts was complete,” Byrd said in the statement.
    
            “Sadly, many people and media outlets refused to give Mr. Ziegler that courtesy. That was unfair and unfortunate and has caused irreparable harm to Mr. Ziegler’s reputation, his personal life, professional life, and his family.”
    
            Byrd said he was “disappointed” police “punted” the remaining part of the case to prosecutors but “we strongly believe that the State Attorney will not prosecute Mr. Ziegler for any crime.”
    
            The attorney said Ziegler will fully cooperate with the investigation and declined further comment until it’s completed.
    
            Ziegler told investigators the sexual encounter was consensual. According to an affidavit, Bridget Ziegler told detectives about an alleged previous three-way rendezvous with the woman who accused her husband of rape.
    
            CNN has reached out to Bridget Ziegler for comment.
    
            The allegations were followed with calls for the Zieglers to resign from their high-profile positions. Christian Ziegler refused and was voted out of his leadership role. Bridget Ziegler, who was never accused of criminal wrongdoing, has faced calls to step down from the Sarasota County School Board.
    
            A Moms for Liberty chapter in Pennsylvania split from the national organization over the scandal, according to chair Clarissa Paige, who said the group is now called the Northumberland County Academic Alliance.
    
            “I think that … was a very sensational headline that went around the world very quickly. That’s not, you know, who Moms for Liberty is. We stay focused on defending parental rights,” Descovich said of the scandal.
    
            Moms for Liberty is still trying to grow in liberal states. The group held a town hall in New York City in early January. The event drew protests from parents, teachers, and members of the LGBTQ community.
    
            “We’ve learned a lot the last two years,” Descovich said. “You’ve got to remember we’ve never done this before. Other than my school board campaign, I have never run a campaign. We’ve learned a ton, and I’m really excited to see what 2024 looks like.”
    
            Jennifer Jenkins, who defeated Descovich to win her seat on the Brevard County School Board in 2020, said the influence of Moms for Liberty is fading as more parents begin to question the group’s positions.
    
            “I think that things have gone too far and people are finally standing up to say, you know, ‘This is my choice. These are my kids as well too. You don’t get to make these decisions for us,’” Jenkins said.
    
            “People are seeing, you know, news cycle after news cycle, the hypocrisy of the things that they advocate for and they say they stand,” she said.
    
            At the first Brevard County School Board meeting of 2024, not one speaker defended a proposal to ban Kurt Vonnegut’s classic “Slaughterhouse-Five” or Afghan American author Khaled Hosseini’s “The Kite Runner.”
    
            The lone Moms for Liberty supporter at the meeting declined to speak with CNN, referring all questions to the national organization.
    
            “I’m thrilled that there was one there, and that’s all it takes,” Descovich said. “She can report back everything that needs to be reported back. If she feels like she needs to sign up to speak, then she can sign up to speak and represent the whole chapter.”
    
            One of the first speakers, Risë Walter, a member of Brevard Democrats, praised “The Kite Runner” as a “powerful, gut-wrenching, thought-provoking book.”
    
            “I also remember the backstory and the growth of the Taliban and its repressive autocracy in the name of religious nationalism,” she said. “It struck terror in my heart then, and it does again today, with the rise of parental rights groups that want to limit what students learn.”
    
            Krissy Goss, another speaker, said: “Ironically, Moms for Liberty are doing exactly what they say they are against as they are pushing their ideology on all children in public schools. It’s clear Moms for Liberty are not for liberty at all.”
    
            “Do we want to go back to Nazi Germany?” said Beverly Marker, a grandmother in the district. “That’s pretty much what a lot of you seem to want to do. Florida right now has an ugly, ugly image in many parts of the country. And that’s because the issues like this.”
    
            Ava WolfenKoehler, a high school student, told board members “It’s really sad” that students are “begging” them not to ban certain books. She said she had just turned 18 and “can’t wait” to vote for the first time against a board member who wants books removed from the schools.
    
            About half a dozen people at the meeting wore red T-shirts with the word ‘STOP!’ on the front, signaling they support Stop Moms for Liberty.
    
            Jenkins believes the challenges are mounting for Moms for Liberty. “More and more people are voting against them,” she said. “Perception is power, and right now, they look weak.”
    
            Before next Tuesday’s Brevard school board meeting, students, parents and teachers plan what organizers are calling “a rally against academic censorship.”
    
            Students will speak out against removing books from schools, some banned titles will be distributed, and new voters will be registered to send a message to “Brevard’s rogue school board,” according to organizers.
    
            “The longer that Moms for Liberty has been on the scene, the more we’ve seen local communities organize against them,” Schneider said. “Organized opponents often include coalitions of families, educators, and even students themselves – folks who are well positioned to counter baseless accusations, and who are themselves often quite compelling as voices for less politicized school governance.”

      Mother of Michigan school shooter admits she and husband gifted their son the gun as precedent-setting trial nears end
    ","
			By Eric Levenson and Lauren del Valle, CNN

    ","
            Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four people at a Michigan high school in 2021, admitted under cross-examination at her manslaughter trial that she and her husband gifted their son the firearm later used in the attack.
    
            “We didn’t just hand him a gun as ‘here you go son,’” she testified. “It was something he could use when we went to the (gun) range as a family.”
    
            She testified a day earlier that she entrusted her husband with securing the firearm. However, she admitted under cross-examination that she did not trust her husband to get out of bed in the morning, mow the lawn to her liking or update her on his whereabouts.
    
            “But this is the person you entrusted with a deadly weapon?” Oakland County assistant prosecutor Marc Keast asked.
    
            “I did,” she said.
    
            The cross-examination came toward the end of Jennifer Crumbley’s trial on four counts of involuntary manslaughter for her role in the November 30, 2021, mass shooting at Oxford High School, which left four students dead and seven others wounded.
    
            After she completed her cross-examination Friday, the defense rested its case, and the prosecution and defense then followed with closing arguments. The jury was dismissed for the day and will return on Monday for instructions and deliberations.
    
            Jennifer Crumbley’s husband, James, is scheduled to go on trial on the same charges in early March.
    
            The case represents an unusual and novel legal strategy to try to hold the parents of a school shooter personally accountable and stem the scourge of mass shootings in America.
    
            The prosecution has argued she is responsible for the deaths because she was “grossly negligent” in giving her then 15-year-old son a gun as a gift and failing to get him proper mental health treatment despite warning signs. The prosecution rested its case Thursday after about a week of testimony from shooting victims, law enforcement officials, school officials and those who knew Jennifer Crumbley.
    
            However, the defense has argued that the blame lay elsewhere: On her husband for improperly securing the firearm; on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s behavioral issues; and on Ethan himself, who actually pulled the trigger. Jennifer Crumbley, the only witness called, expressed no regret.
    
            “I’ve asked myself if I would have done anything differently, and I wouldn’t have,” she testified Thursday.
    
            In closing arguments Friday, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald contrasted Jennifer Crumbley’s comments about firearms on the stand with her previous statements at a police substation.
    
            “At the substation, it’s all ‘we’ – it’s ‘We take him to the range, it’s our hobby, we go to the gun range, that’s what we do. We just got him this gun,’” McDonald said. “Sitting here today, it’s all James’ fault.”
    
            She said Jennifer Crumbley could have done any number of minor things the morning of the shooting that would have prevented the attack.
    
            “She could’ve taken him home. She could have taken him to work,” McDonald said. “She could’ve told the school that they just gifted him a gun.”
    
            “Just the smallest thing could’ve saved Hana and Tate and Justin and Madisyn. The smallest of things.”
    
            McDonald said the shooter’s mother was trying to get the jury to “believe she’s somebody she’s not.”
    
            “You know what she’s not? She’s not somebody that used ordinary care to prevent what was foreseeable, reasonably foreseeable, that could have happened – injury or death – and it did,” she said.
    
            “It’s a rare case that takes some really egregious facts,” she added. “It takes the unthinkable, and she has done the unthinkable, and because of that, four kids have died.”
    
            In her closing arguments, defense attorney Shannon Smith spoke to the jury on a personal level as a mother of four, saying this case was “a very dangerous one for parents.” She said she, like Jennifer Crumbley, had sent and received texts with her kids that would look bad if taken out of context.
    
            “Can every parent really be responsible for everything their children do, especially when it’s not foreseeable?” she asked.
    
            “I am asking that you find Jennifer Crumbley not guilty, not just for Jennifer Crumbley, but for every mother who’s out there doing the best they can and could easily be in her shoes. For every parent doing the best they can who could easily be in their shoes,” Smith added.
    
            Finally, in the prosecution’s rebuttal, McDonald asked the jury to put aside the defense’s personal statements.
    
            “Your job is not to consider what lawyers say about their own life and their own circumstances in their opinion,” she said. “Your job is to consider the facts and evidence in this case.”
    
            On cross-examination Friday, the prosecution sought to portray Jennifer Crumbley as an inattentive mother, focused more on her horses and her extramarital affair than on her son’s well-being.
    
            She acknowledged that in a meeting on the morning of the shooting, she did not tell school employees who were concerned about her son’s well-being that she and her husband had recently gifted him a gun. “I didn’t think it was relevant, no,” she testified.
    
            Over several hours Thursday, Jennifer Crumbley testified her husband was responsible for securing the gun he had purchased for their son on Black Friday as a Christmas gift.
    
            “I just didn’t feel comfortable being in charge of that. It was more his thing, so I let him handle that. I didn’t feel comfortable putting the lock thing on it,” she said.
    
            She also testified her son had never asked her to get help for mental health issues, contrary to his private journal writings and texts to a friend. She said he expressed some anxiety about taking tests and what he would do after high school, “but not to a level where I felt he needed to go see a psychiatrist or mental health professional right away.”
    
            She acknowledged her son had sent a number of texts about seeing ghosts and claimed their house was haunted, but she testified he was not being serious.
    
            “It was just him messing around,” she testified.
    
            She also testified she did not know about internal school emails discussing her son’s concerning behavior before the shooting on November 30, 2021. And she said when she was called into the school hours before the shooting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings on a math worksheet, school employees were “nonchalant” about the incident and allowed him to stay in class.
    
            Unbeknownst to those in the meeting, Ethan Crumbley had hidden a firearm in his backpack. Later that day, he took the gun out and opened fire on his classmates.
    
            Overall, her testimony on Thursday focused on portraying her as a regular mother who balanced a full-time marketing job with taking care of the house, playing board games with her son and traveling on family vacations. She trusted her son, she said, and did not go through his text messages.
    
            “As a parent you spend your whole life trying to protect your child from other dangers,” Jennifer Crumbley testified. “You never would think you have to protect your child from harming someone else. That’s what blew my mind. That was the hardest thing I had to stomach was that my child harmed and killed other people.”
    
            Ethan Crumbley pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage. He was sentenced last year to life in prison without parole.

      Preterm birth rate in the US is rising, study finds, but the reasons are a mystery
    ","
			By Jen Christensen, CNN
		;Jen Christensen","
  Updated
        3:29 PM EST, Fri February 2, 2024
    ","
            The rate of preterm births in the United States has been rising, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics, potentially creating more health problems for infants and mothers.
    
            The report, published this week, found that the rate of preterm births — those less than 37 weeks of gestation — rose 12% between 2014 and 2022, from 7.74% to 8.67%.
    
            The increase was relatively consistent across the board, regardless of age or race, although Black and Hispanic mothers were more likely to give birth early than White people. Older mothers are also generally more likely to deliver early than mothers of a younger age.
    
            Babies born prematurely can have short-term health issues like problems fighting off infection or breathing and stomach issues because they haven’t fully developed and will need to stay in the hospital longer. In the long-term, premature babies may develop asthma, dental issues, hearing loss, stomach problems and concerns like intellectual and developmental delays, according to the March of Dimes. Pregnant people can also develop health problems if they deliver early.
    
            The CDC researchers looked at data from birth certificates that recorded single births registered in the United States from 2014 to 2022.
    
            However, they did not speculate about what might be driving this trend. In general, doctors don’t really know why some people give birth earlier than their due date, although some conditions and factors seem to raise the risk.
    
            “I really wish we did know. I think the increase is pretty striking,” said Dr. Kaitlyn Stanhope, an assistant professor at Emory University whose research focuses on the effects of stress on women’s health and pregnancy. “It’s a trend that’s been happening for a long time. The study goes to 2014, but preterm births have been going up in the US for a lot longer than that.”
    
            Stanhope, who wasn’t involved with the new research, said that the trend of people having children later in life could have an impact on the numbers, as could the increase in the number of people having children through IVF, both factors that can be associated with a higher risk of preterm birth. But Stanhope doesn’t think that fully explains what’s going on.
    
            It could be something environmental, she said, since an increase across race and age would involve something that everyone is experiencing. This may include exposure to particle pollution, which other studies have shown can increase preterm births.
    
            Psychosocial stressors such as chronic stress, anxiety, lack of support, unstable housing and poor nutrition can also increase a person’s risk that they will give birth early.
    
            “It’s certainly something that is multifactorial,” said Dr. Ellie Ragsdale, a specialist in ob/gyn-Maternal and Fetal Medicine at University Hospitals in Cleveland, who wasn’t involved with the CDC report. “My initial reaction to the study is that preterm birth rates continue to rise in this country because Americans globally, as a whole, are getting sicker.”
    
            A growing number of people have obesity, Ragsdale noted, and that can lead to health problems that can increase the risk for preterm births. More than 1 in 4 women in the US is overweight, and more than 2 in 5 adults — 42.4% of the US population – have obesity, according to the National Institutes of Health. People with obesity are more likely to have high blood pressure, diabetes and other conditions such as preeclampsia that can prompt early delivery.
    
            Dr. Manisha Gandhi, chair of the Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, does not think the trend is related to doctors inducing early. The medical guidelines strongly discourage the practice and those numbers have been declining over the years, she said. Gandhi also doesn’t think that it is due to some biological change that would shorten the length of time people are pregnant.
    
            Rather, she says, the Covid-19 pandemic may have affected the rate.
    
            People infected with Covid faced a higher risk of an early delivery, studies show. Many also put off medical appointments during the pandemic, and that can affect their overall health.
    
            To lower the odds of early birth, Gandhi said, it is important for people to make their health a priority before they get pregnant.
    
            “Pregnancy is not a time to start losing weight, controlling blood pressure or working on your diabetes,” she said. “Ideally, we will have these things in order before we get pregnant, because there’s not enough time to optimize our health once you’re already pregnant.”
    
            Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly defined preterm birth. Preterm births takes place before 37 weeks of gestation.

      Opinion: French women got a wakeup call on abortion rights from their US sisters
    ","
			Opinion by Jill Filipovic

  Published
        5:13 PM EST, Thu February 1, 2024
    ","
            It’s a strange moment to be an American feminist who cares deeply about women’s rights beyond her own country’s borders.
    
            On one hand, there is so much to be heartened by: expansions of women’s rights in much of the world, feminist protests galvanizing women across continents, abortion rights on the rise, necessary attention paid to the particular price paid by women in conflict. And then there is our own country, one of the very few where abortion rights have been radically scaled back rather than expanded, where anti-feminist movements are quickly racking up (often unpopular) wins and broadening their efforts to wind back women’s progress and where a large chunk of the electorate is eager to put a notoriously sexist man found liable for sexual abuse back into the highest office in the land.
    
            The news that the French National Assembly has passed a bill that would enshrine abortion rights in the country’s constitution evokes mixed emotions. If the French bill is approved by the senate and then adopted, France will be the first country on earth to include the right to abortion in its constitution, a vanguard moment in feminist history and a potential model for other nations that want to protect women’s rights. But this hopefully forthcoming French feminist victory is borne from an American loss: The push to enshrine abortion rights in the French constitution came precisely because the US Supreme Court ruled that abortion is not a right guaranteed by ours.
    
            “It was a wake-up call for everyone,” French Senator Mélanie Vogel told CNN in December. “We don’t want to wake up like American women… with this right being taken from us.”
    
            Conservatives in France sing a very different tune than those in the US, arguing that a constitutional right to abortion is unnecessary because abortion is not a hotly contested issue in France. But French feminists know better: They see rising right-wing movements around the world and understand how quickly circumstances can change.
    
            Just look at the US: Yes, abortion has been a hotly-contested issue ever since the Evangelical right pivoted from focusing on enforcing racial segregation to focusing on outlawing abortion and enforcing gender traditionalism, but abortion rights went before the Supreme Court many times over and Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision recognizing abortion as a fundamental right, was always upheld — until, after nearly 50 years, it wasn’t. And American abortion opponents haven’t stopped at a single Supreme Court victory. They are working hard to put former President Donald Trump back in office in the hope that he can set in motion an expansive plan to curtail abortion access nationwide.
    
            The fact that abortion rights have expanded in many of the same places where human rights norms are being increasingly recognized and democratic governance has taken root is not a coincidence — and neither is the fact that the minority of countries in which abortion rights have been curtailed are also places where authoritarianism tends to be on the rise, human rights on the retreat and democracy in free fall. French feminists fighting for abortion rights are working to secure a necessary right for women’s freedom and bodily autonomy, but they’re also taking an important step to protect their nation’s democratic character and what will hopefully be its free, equal and rights-affirming future.
    
            If only the US would do the same.
    
            Unfortunately, a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights would be all but impossible in America – not because voters wouldn’t support it, but because of the Republican stranglehold on so many state legislatures. The Biden administration has, over the years, made noises about codifying Roe v. Wade, but they currently lack the votes to do so, and still may not have them even if Biden wins in 2024.
    
            The conservative-majority Supreme Court is set to hear another major abortion case this year, and another bad decision could make safe medication abortions even more difficult or impossible for women to get. Voters have consistently cast their ballots in favor of abortion rights when given the option, even in conservative states – and so the anti-abortion movement is now gunning to remove the issue from voters’ hands and simply keep abortion off the ballot.
    
            Hopefully, French women, and so many others whose countries are actually progressing on women’s rights instead of backsliding, see an easy victory. Feminists the world over should be thrilled to see so many of our sisters standing up and so often winning (albeit almost always after excruciatingly long and arduous fights). But it’s not exactly thrilling to be the cautionary tale inspiring some of this advocacy. I’m glad French and other feminists are working overtime so that they don’t end up like American women. I just wish American women hadn’t ended up here, either.

      Elisabeth Moss gets parenting tips from Jimmy Kimmel

            Elisabeth Moss is expecting her first child.
    
            The “Handmaid’s Tale” star revealed the news on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Tuesday.
    
            “Are you pregnant or just an incredibly committed method actor?” Kimmel asked Moss.
    
            She replied, “Little bit of both.”
    
            “Congratulations,” Kimmel said.
    
            “It’s been going really well,” Moss said, adding that she feels “lucky.”
    
            Moss asked Kimmel for advice on parenting, since he has four kids of his own.
    
            “You know, actually, I will tell you. My wife got great advice from Bill Murray when she was pregnant,” he said about his wife, Molly McNearney.
    
            Murray had told them to set the mood in the hospital room with Christmas lights, music and battery-powered candles because the lighting is terrible, Kimmel joked.
    
            “It’s Walmart-style lighting for this blessed event that’s going to happen. And you don’t want that right?” he said.
    
            “I think that’s a really good list, I like that,” Moss said.

      Abortion divides Iowa GOP voters ahead of crucial first primary debate
    ","

            Ask Lisa McGaffey if she has ever voted for a Democrat and there is no pause. 
    
            “Oh, heavens, no,” she says quickly and emphatically. “Oh, no. There’s no – abortion. … They have to have a chance to grow up. They have to have the chance. You never know who that’s going to be.”
    
            McGaffey is a loyal Donald Trump supporter and is grateful for his three appointments to the conservative Supreme Court majority that erased Roe v. Wade last year and returned the question of abortion rights to the states.
    
            Two-hundred miles away, in the fast growing Des Moines suburbs, Betsy Sarcone takes a different view.
    
            Iowa, like Florida, in recent months enacted a law outlawing most abortions at six weeks. Sarcone – a single mother and a Catholic and Republican who told us, “I don’t believe in abortion” – thinks that is too restrictive.
    
            “I agree with a time limit,” Sarcone said in a recent interview in her West Des Moines home. “I’ve had three babies grow inside me. I agree when you feel them kicking and you feel them moving – that’s in my heart, is a time when that (a cutoff to abortion access) would be. Which is around say, like 18 weeks, something like that typically. So in my heart, that’s what I feel. I again, I just I don’t know that much further than that it’s somebody’s place to judge.”
    
            Abortion is among the fault lines in the 2024 Republican campaign, and a likely debate topic in Wednesday’s first primary season showdown between Republican candidates – all of whom support abortion restrictions. It’s also an issue that splits GOP voters, even those who share an opposition to the procedure. Sarcone and McGaffey, for example, are among a group of Iowa Republicans we are tracking as part of a CNN project designed to view the 2024 campaign through the eyes of voters – to see firsthand if their views change over the course of the cycle, and if so, why.
    
            Among that group is also Chris Mudd, a businessman in Cedar Falls and a Trump supporter, who signals a potential warning for GOP hopefuls on abortion. 
    
            “I’m a pro-life guy,” Mudd told us. “But I think it is a losing issue for Republicans.” Of the six-week bans enacted in Florida and later in his home state of Iowa, Mudd said: “I think that was a mistake.”
    
            Among Republican candidates there’s some disagreement over whether a national ban should be a priority, or whether the issue is best left to the states.
    
            Trump, for example, has called the six-week ban signed by DeSantis in Florida “too harsh.” The GOP front-runner is choosing to skip the Milwaukee debate.
    
            Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina favors a federal law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mike Pence, the former vice president and Indiana governor, supports a six-week federal ban. 
    
            GOP rivals Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum describe themselves as staunchly “pro life” but argue the principled conservative position is that each state should make its own law. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has said she would sign a 15-week national ban, but also frequently notes the votes aren’t there in the current congressional balance of power and that the federal conversation is best put aside unless and until there is more consensus.
    
            Democrats see opportunity in almost any Republican conversation about abortion, citing how the issue has consistently helped galvanize voters in elections – from ballot initiatives to last year’s midterms – since the Dobbs decision.
    
            The last public poll on the issue in Iowa was in March, for the Des Moines Register.
    
            A clear majority, 61% of Iowans, said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. But the first competition here is the Republican caucuses, and the poll found that 59% of Republicans and 64% of evangelicals believed abortion should be illegal in most or all cases.
    
            Sarcone, a suburban Des Moines real estate agent, made a point worth remembering as the candidates debate for the first time this week.
    
            “I don’t know that I will have any candidate that I agree with on everything,” she said. “So the character, the leadership, the military is very important to me.”
    
            To that end, she listed DeSantis as her early favorite, despite her opposition to a six-week ban, but said she would consider Haley, Scott and perhaps others, too.
    
            Our first visit with this voter group, before the first debate, was to get a sense of how they rate the candidates and the issues early on.
    
            McGaffey, an administrator at the Jolly Time Pop Corn company, was the only member of the group who brought up the abortion issue in our conversations.
    
            Mudd, the pro-Trump businessman who’s wary of the GOP leaning too heavily into abortion, listed the economy as his lead issue.
    
            Similarly, attorney Priscilla Forsyth from Sioux City said abortion was not an issue on her debate priority list. 
    
            “Issues like abortion are not my issue,” she said. “A lot of the social issues are not. It’s all the economy, really.”

      France on-track to constitutionalize abortion rights
    ","
			By Claudia Colliva and Maya Szaniecki, CNN
		","
  Updated
        6:18 PM EST, Tue January 30, 2024
    ","
            The French National Assembly has passed a historic bill that moves the country one step closer to enshrining the right to abortion in its constitution.
    
            In a vote in the lower house of the French parliament on Tuesday, 493 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill, 30 against. The bill will now move to the Senate for debate and a vote and, if approved, a special body composed of both chambers of the parliament will meet again for its adoption.
    
            The bid for constitutionalization became a priority for the French government following the overturning by the United States Supreme Court of Roe v. Wade in June 2022. The cause had been championed for several years by left-wing lawmakers and women’s rights activists.
    
            When parliamentary discussions began at the lower house over the text of the proposed bill last week, the threat of France following in the footsteps of the US echoed loudly in the chamber. Almost all of the lawmakers that spoke in support of constitutionalization stressed the importance of ensuring that the reversal of reproductive rights witnessed across the Atlantic would never reach France’s shores.
    
            “History is full of examples of… fundamental rights… which everyone… believed to have been definitively acquired, and which were then swept away… as we were recently reminded by the decision of the US Supreme Court,” Justice Minister Éric Dupont-Moretti said in his opening speech. “We now have irrefutable proof that no democracy, not even the largest of them all, is immune.”
    
            If the bill becomes law, France will become the first country in the world to include abortion rights in its constitution, according to a constitutional expert and Guillaume Gouffier Valent, a lawmaker in charge of the law, marking a historic moment for reproductive rights in the country and around the world.
    
            France’s Prime Minister Gabriel Attal hailed the vote as “a great victory for women’s rights,” while Gender Equality Minister Aurore Bergé called it “historic.” “We have a duty to press on. For our mothers who fought. For our daughters, so that they never have to fight again,” Bergé wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
    
            Although the bill has now been approved by the National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament, it is not yet guaranteed to pass into law. A vote will take place in the Senate in February and later in the French Congress, a special body composed of both chambers of parliament. The adoption of the bill relies on a three-fifths majority vote in the latter, which is expected to happen in time for International Women’s Day on March 8, 2024.
    
            Speaking to French media, Gérard Lacher, the president of the French Senate, recently voiced his opposition to the bill, saying he doesn’t think that “abortion is threatened in our country,” and arguing that constitutionalization is therefore unnecessary. Some right-wing lawmakers have expressed similar viewpoints, maintaining that abortion rights in France are in no imminent danger.
    
            Speaking to the National Assembly during parliamentary discussions on the bill, Gender Equality Minister Bergé responded to these arguments, highlighting the rise in anti-abortion movements and the rollbacks on abortion rights occuring in other countries. These developments are raising alarm bells among French campaigners like Bergé, emphasizing the need to permanently safeguard abortion rights before a potential conservative shift in politics - one that’s happening across the world - makes it impossible to do so.
    
            “This law is not just a symbol, because for too many women, this right is still hindered… because insidiously, throughout the world, this right is retreating,” Bergé said in her speech. “There’s no reason to believe that what’s happening around us can’t happen here too, as if we were immune to any form of regression,” she added.
    
            “It’s now that we need to protect the right to abortion as strongly as possible in France,” Gouffier Valent, the lawmaker in charge of the bill, told CNN. “You don’t take out insurance when your house is already on fire,” he added.
    
            France’s decision to constitutionalize abortion was spurred in large part by a global context riddled with roll-backs on reproductive rights. Elsewhere in Europe, right-wing governments have been cracking down on abortion in the past few years.
    
            In eastern Europe, both Hungary and Poland have recently introduced restrictions on abortion access, measures that were frequently mentioned by France’s own lawmakers during the debate in the National Assembly.
    
            At the same time, the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the US left many French women wondering if they would be next. Now, they hope France’s own move to enshrine abortion rights could serve as inspiration abroad.
    
            Barbara Pravi, a French singer-songwriter who herself had an abortion aged 17, said she wants women around the world to know they’re not alone. “I don’t know if the United States will see France as an inspiration, but I hope it could give hope to women there,” she told CNN.
    
            Some, however, argue that the bill would not help with on-the-ground access to abortion, a growing issue particularly in rural parts of the country. Sarah Durocher, president of Planning Familial, the French branch of Planned Parenthood International, told CNN that “women are reporting real difficulties in accessing abortion. Some women have to travel from one region to another to get an abortion. There’s a shortage of doctors, maternity wards and local abortion clinics are being closed.”
    
            Yet, for people like Pravi, and for campaigners who have been fighting for this bill, it represents a symbolic and groundbreaking move, one that will affect attitudes towards abortion for generations to come. Constitutionalization “changes people’s minds,” Pravi told CNN. “It could take…five, six, seven, maybe 10 years. But I know that my children will never think about the question [of] abortion.”
    
            Gouffier Valent shares Pravi’s sentiment. This law “means everything,” he said, “because of the message we’re sending to French women and men for current and future generations… And the universal message we want to send to the whole world in defense of women’s rights.”
    
            This is a developing story. It will be updated with more details.

      Doctor: Why I’m cheering about pharmacists in my state prescribing birth control pills
    ","
			Opinion by Megan L. Ranney
		","
  Updated
        3:56 PM EST, Tue January 30, 2024
    ","
            As of January 1, in the two states where I practice medicine — Rhode Island and Connecticut — it is legal for pharmacists to prescribe oral contraceptive pills (OCPs, more commonly known as birth control pills). Twenty-seven other states, plus the District of Columbia, have similarly permissive laws.
    
            I’m cheering.
    
            That may sound strange: Aren’t most doctors opposed to pharmacists writing prescriptions? And besides, a birth control pill has already been approved to be available over the counter — so why care about prescriptions?
    
            This is where my public health training comes in. It’s about balancing risk and benefit. It is true that many medications should only be prescribed in a doctor’s office, after a thorough physical exam, medical history and even lab tests. But oral contraceptives are not among them. The benefit for the patient is clearly on the side of expanded prescription authority for pharmacists.
    
            OCPs are tremendously safe — so safe, in fact, that in most countries they are available without a prescription. The risk of health harm from an unwanted pregnancy is far higher than the risk of a side effect from an OCP for most women. Moreover, in most US states that permit pharmacist prescribing of OCPs, the laws require a screening questionnaire to identify those few women for whom risk may outweigh benefit (for example, for women with a strong family history of blood clots, high blood pressure, or some cancers).
    
            Yes, the O-pill will soon be available over the counter in the US, but it is progestin-only. The most popular birth control pills, though, are a combination of estrogen and progestin. They are better at decreasing women’s menstrual pain and heavy bleeding, and may be slightly more effective at preventing pregnancy than the progestin-only pill — but also have a few more side effects, so they remain available only with a prescription.
    
            For those who do need a prescription, a highly-trained pharmacist is far easier to find than a medical doctor: According to a study from the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association (JAPHA), nearly 50% of the US population lives within a mile of a pharmacy, and over 95% of us live within 10 miles of a pharmacy. Meanwhile, access to primary care physicians is at an all-time low, with one recent report from the National Association of Community Health Centers noting that nearly one-third of us lack a primary care doctor.
    
            Pharmacist-prescribing capability for this low-risk medication matters, particularly as the women who are at highest risk of unplanned pregnancy are also least likely to be able to get to a doctor, according to research done before the Dobbs decision. The importance of pharmacists prescribing for OCPs goes beyond ease of access, though. It’s also about cost.
    
            Many women will be unable to afford the out-of-pocket cost of a non-prescribed medication. By getting a prescription from a pharmacist, insurance coverage will apply. This detail is particularly important for those women who have the highest risk of maternal and infant mortality, such as those with low incomes.
    
            As we face a crisis of maternal mortality, and knowing that unplanned pregnancies, are associated with higher rates of complications, anything that makes it easier to control one’s reproductive choice matters. As Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency physician and recent director of Region 2 of Health and Human Services explained to me, “This expanded access allows people to be intentional about when and how they get pregnant — which we know contributes to safer and healthier pregnancies.”
    
            And actually — from a public health perspective — OCPs are not the only medication that can and should be prescribed without a doctor’s or other clinician’s exam.
    
            Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (more commonly known as Paxlovid), for example, should be able to be universally prescribed by pharmacists, for any patient with a positive Covid-19 test, after a brief run-down of medical conditions that would support or preclude its use. For this medication, time is of the essence for our highest-risk patients. Pharmacists know better than many physicians about the drug-drug interactions that may make Paxlovid inappropriate for some patients — and are often more up-to-date on how to mitigate this concern. According to Kerry LaPlante PharmD, Dean of the College of Pharmacy at the University of Rhode Island, “Pharmacists are arguably one of the most underutilized member of the health care system.”
    
            One could imagine this model applied to other easily diagnosed diseases (like strep throat) whose treatment has clear indications, high benefit and limited, easily identifiable reasons to not take a medication. It’s true that dispensing pharmacists are not trained in the full spectrum of clinical medicine (as they have not completed a residency). But for a limited group of time-sensitive, low-risk medications, why not expand access to treatment?
    
            My enthusiasm aside, I do have some cautions.
    
            Pharmacists are a great and important part of the health care system, but they can’t fully make up for, say, lack of a local emergency department or lack of access to obstetricians. The list of problems with our “sick care” system is long, but at a minimum, we need to provide adequate trauma and maternity care in rural hospitals, systematically address the crisis in the availability of hospital beds for admitted emergency department patients across the US, and stop dismantling the very systems that keep people healthy.
    
            Pharmacists in the retail environment are also already overwhelmed and burned out (just like everyone else in the health system). And as LaPlante reminded me, adding on more responsibility may create a new set of problems: “High-quality engagement with patients takes time, but pharmacists can’t currently bill for that.” It would be a mistake to expand prescribing capability without also ensuring that pharmacists have time and appropriate reimbursement to counsel about side effects and risk.
    
            Pharmacists’ ability to prescribe OCPs (and other medications) also does not mitigate continued concern about limitations on access to reproductive health care across the country. Allowing pharmacists to prescribe a medication means nothing if the pharmacy isn’t stocking that drug, or if patients don’t know that they can ask for it.
    
            Most of all, pharmacist prescribing does not fix the current travesty of prescription drug pricing and out-of-pocket medication costs for many Americans. (The Inflation Reduction Act is a small but important step in the right direction for older Americans.)
    
            At the end of the day, pharmacist prescribing of OCPs is terrific and much needed. But it’s only part of the solution to reduce unplanned pregnancy, to improve women’s health outcomes, and to improve access to the highest quality health care.

      Trials of Michigan school shooter’s parents set to test limits of who’s responsible for a mass shooting
    ","
			By Eric Levenson, CNN

        5:09 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024
    ","
            The parents of Ethan Crumbley, the teenager who in 2021 opened fire at his high school in Oxford, Michigan, are going on trial for manslaughter in cases that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting.
    
            James and Jennifer Crumbley have pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in their son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. They face up to 15 years in prison.
    
            They are standing trial separately. Opening statements in Jennifer Crumbley’s trial began Thursday, and James Crumbley’s trial is tentatively scheduled to start March 5.
    
            In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory.
    
            “Jennifer Crumbley didn’t pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths,” Oakland County assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said in opening statements.
    
            In particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting.
    
            “Despite her knowledge of his deteriorating mental crisis, despite her knowledge of his growing social isolation, despite the fact that it’s illegal for a 15-year-old to walk into a gun store and walk out with a handgun by himself, this gun was gifted,” Keast said.
    
            “Even with all of that,” on the day of the shooting, “Jennifer Crumbley was still given the opportunity to prevent these murders from ever happening,” Keast said. “Instead, she chose to do nothing.”
    
            The parents’ defense attorneys have argued the charges have no legal justification, but appeals courts have upheld them.
    
            In the defense’s opening statements, attorney Shannon Smith said Jennifer Crumbley did not know about her son’s deteriorating mental state and could not have reasonably foreseen he would use the gun in a mass shooting. Instead, Smith pushed blame on her husband for purchasing the firearm and on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s problematic behavior. Jennifer Crumbley plans to testify to explain her side of the story, Smith said.
    
            “She is going to take the stand and tell you about her life with her son, about the day he became the shooter, and about the day he did something she could have never anticipated or fathomed or predicted,” Smith said. “She will tell you that when she saw the materials in this case, she learned that her son had not been her son for months. That he had been manipulating her, he had been hiding things from her, he had been sending alarming text messages to other people.”
    
            “You will hear that the school never advised Mrs. Crumbley of problematic issues that, if she had heard about, she would have jumped right on top of it,” Smith added.
    
            Parents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case.
    
            “It’s not the first time that a parent has been held liable in some capacity for the acts of a child or a shooter, however, usually those charges relate to child neglect or manifest as a failure to keep a firearm locked up,” Marris said. “This is very different because it’s actually holding them responsible for the killings.”
    
            Ethan Crumbley, speaking at his sentencing hearing in December, said, “They did not know, and I did not tell them what I planned to do, so they are not at fault for what I’ve done.” His testimony about his parents’ knowledge of his mental health struggles could be key, but it’s not clear at this point whether he will testify.
    
            His attorneys have indicated he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence if called to testify, as the appeal of his sentence remains open. In court Tuesday, Jennifer Crumbley asked the judge to compel her son and his two jail psychiatrists to testify, while the shooter’s attorneys indicated they will not waive privilege or confidentiality for his medical records, the testimony of his doctors or his own testimony.
    
            Marris said the trials will particularly focus on what the parents did not do, and whether that makes them responsible. “That’s why this is a tricky case because a lot of it is based on omission, not action,” she said. “A lot of criminal culpability is because you did something, not because you failed to do something. That’s why this legal argument is so novel and new and actually pretty groundbreaking.”
    
            The evidence and arguments may also differ for each parent. Jennifer and James Crumbley had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split.
    
            On November 30, 2021, Ethan Crumbley, 15 at the time, took a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack and took it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates.
    
            He has pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage, and last year was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
    
            In court Thursday, the first two witnesses were educators at Oxford High School, including Molly Darnell, a teacher who was shot in the arm. In addition, Cammy Back, an employee at an Oxford store that sells guns, testified she sold a 9 mm Sig Sauer firearm to James Crumbley on November 26, 2021, with Ethan there as well.
    
            With ATF special agent Brett Brandon on the stand, prosecutors showed a series of videos of Ethan Crumbley shooting at the gun range with his father in the months before the attack. Ethan and Jennifer Crumbley went to the gun range on November 27, and they took turns shooting, surveillance video showed. “Mom & son day testing out his new Xmas present,” she wrote afterward in an Instagram post. “My first time shooting a 9mm I hit the bullseye.”
    
            Further, Ethan texted a video to a friend just after midnight on August 20, 2021, showing him holding and loading a pistol inside his house. “My dad left it out so I thought, ‘Why not’ lol” he wrote.
    
            In pre-trial hearings, prosecutors introduced text messages and other evidence they said showed his parents ignored clear warning signs.
    
            According to phone evidence, Ethan had texted a friend saying he was experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices and had asked his parents to take him to a doctor. In response, his dad gave him pills and told him to “suck it up,” and his mom laughed at him, according to the texts.
    
            Days later, when the school notified them that Ethan had been searching online for ammo on his phone, Jennifer Crumbley texted her son: “LOL I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,” according to prosecutors.
    
            Finally, on the morning of the shooting, a teacher found a drawing from Ethan showing a gun and a person bleeding along with the phrases, “the thoughts won’t stop help me,” “blood everywhere” and “my life is useless.” His parents were called into school for a meeting, but they did not inform the school Ethan had access to a gun and declined to take him out of classes for the day.
    
            Shortly after, Ethan took the gun out of his backpack and opened fire.
    
            His parents have been held in jail since they were arrested on manslaughter charges days after the shooting.
    
            There have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting.
    
            For example, the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail.
    
            In a similar vein, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm.
    
            Frank Vandervort, clinical professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, said parents can be held responsible for their children’s actions, such as for truancy. But the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different.
    
            “We do impose on parents certain obligations regarding their children, to say you have a heightened degree of responsibility for what happens when your kids do things. That’s generally in the law,” he said. “The severity of the charges, I think, are what’s unique here.”
    
            Could these cases set a new precedent for parents?
    
            In a written opinion filed last March, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual.
    
            “We share defendants’ concern about the potential for this decision to be applied in the future to parents whose situation viz-a-viz their child’s intentional conduct is not as closely tied together, and/or the warning signs and evidence were not as substantial as they are here,” wrote the panel.
    
            The opinion said those concerns are “significantly diminished” by the fact that Ethan Crumbley’s actions “were reasonably foreseeable, and that is the ultimate test that must be applied.”
    
            Vandervort similarly said he believed these cases were so unusual and uncommon that the impact would be limited.
    
            “I don’t anticipate there’s going to be a lot of this kind of thing filed. I think this is a pretty unique case,” he said. “It’s hard to talk about shootings by teenagers as being run of the mill. Unless you’ve got really unusual factual situations, I don’t anticipate a lot of parents getting charged.”
    
            Even so, Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents.
    
            “They want to deter other parents from being negligent,” he said. “They want to make sure we have diligent parents who don’t put their kids in a position where they can gain access to firearms easily.”

      Nearly 65,000 pregnancies from rape have occurred in states with abortion bans, study estimates

    ","
            Tens of thousands of pregnancies have resulted from rape in states where abortion is not a legal option, researchers estimate in a new study.
    
            In the study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers from Planned Parenthood, Resound Research for Reproductive Health and academic institutions across the US used a combination of federal surveys on crime and sexual violence to estimate that there were about 520,000 rapes that led to 64,565 pregnancies in the time since abortion bans have been enacted in 14 states – ranging by state from four to 18 months ago.
    
            Other research has found that there have been fewer than 10 abortions each month in states with bans, suggesting that most, if not all, victims were not able to get abortions in the states where they live, even those where the law allows exceptions for rape.
    
            “Restricting abortion access to survivors of rape can have particularly devastating consequences,” the medical journal’s editors wrote in a note about the new research. “Whether these survivors of rape had illegal abortions, received medication abortion through the mail, traveled to other states, or carried the child to birth is unknown.”
    
            About 1 in 5 adults in the US says that abortion should be legal in all cases, according to a 2022 survey from Pew Research Center. And a much larger majority – nearly 70% of adults – say abortion should be legal if pregnancy is the result of rape.
    
            But experts say – and the new research suggests – that the realities of putting those exceptions into practice are challenging.
    
            “Like many exceptions written into abortion bans, an exception for rape victims may appear to be a reasonable solution but in practice can create more trauma and danger for patients who have already experienced a traumatic event,” said Dr. Sami Heywood, an ob/gyn in Illinois and fellow with the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health who was not involved in the new research.
    
            “No other health care is reserved only for people who can prove a crime took place. That’s not an ethical way to practice medicine. It is cruel to force people who have already been victimized to jump through legal and logistical barriers that cause further harm.”
    
            Health care providers may not always ask the question, and victims may not want to disclose this history, but even those who do may face additional challenges, experts say.
    
            “Those who become pregnant after rape may take longer to recognize a pregnancy than other pregnant people, and there may be factors related to the trauma response that accounts for this,” said Dr. Rachel Perry, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Irvine.
    
            This delay may mean medication abortion – which may be used up to 10 weeks gestation – is not an option, and victims may have to travel particularly long distances to a provider, said Perry, who was not involved in the new study.
    
            Also, rape victims often know their assaulter and may live with them.
    
            “It may be especially impossible for them to travel out of state to get abortion care. It may be especially dangerous for them to try to order pills online the way that some people are doing,” said Dr. Samuel Dickman, medical director of Planned Parenthood of Montana and lead author of the new research. “It’s an added burden in so many ways.”
    
            It’s difficult to measure how often sexual assault occurs, and Dickman acknowledges that the study includes many statistical assumptions. But part of the work is to raise awareness of a stigmatized issue and take an honest look at who may be affected by abortion bans and potential exceptions.
    
            “If these numbers feel huge, that’s because they are,” he said. The estimates are “illustrating something that we see every day when working in reproductive health and abortion care but that may be under-appreciated by the broader public – and deliberately so by the kinds of people who implement bans on abortion care.”
    
            Idaho is one of five states that have an exception for rape included in laws that otherwise ban abortion, and the new study estimates that there have been 1,436 pregnancies that resulted from rape in the 16 months since that law has been in effect.
    
            “There’s exactly zero abortion access in that state,” Dickman said. “If that estimate is too high, what number would be OK? I don’t think any number would be OK there.”

      Biden’s abortion rights rally in Virginia beset by repeated protests over his handling of Gaza
    ","

    ","
            President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris rallied voters in Virginia during their first joint campaign appearance on Tuesday, seeking to emphasize the stakes for reproductive rights in the 2024 election.
    
            “The Supreme Court did what it had never done before,” Biden said at the Manassas rally, which came one day after what would have been the 51st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which had established a constitutional right to abortion. “They ripped away a fundamental constitutional right that was in place for nearly 50 years.”
    
            “Let there be no mistake: The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden added.
    
            But as Biden sought to reinforce his administration’s biggest selling point against the Republican front-runner, its biggest weakness with young voters was on full display in the crowd, as protesters who oppose his support for Israel in its war against Hamas repeatedly interrupted the president.
    
            The interruptions began as Biden was delivering his first line. A male protester unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted, “Genocide Joe — how many Palestinian children have to die?” The president paused his speech and looked toward the man.
    
            A second and third protester followed shortly after, prompting chants from the crowd of “Four more years!”
    
            After a fourth protester, Biden broke from his prepared remarks to say, “They care deeply.” And at protester five Biden acknowledged, “This is going to go on for a while.”
    
            All told, the president was interrupted about a dozen times. Eventually, the crowd urged Biden to keep speaking, and the president ignored further outbursts from the crowd.
    
            The hectic rally and Biden’s seemingly futile attempts to keep the crowd focused on reproductive rights represent a new normal for the president, who has repeatedly been interrupted by protesters criticizing his administration’s stance on Israel and his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
    
            He was also interrupted by protesters while delivering a speech on democracy near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and while speaking at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, earlier this month.
    
            He’s often appeared conciliatory toward those protesters. “I understand the passion and I’ve been quietly working – been quietly working with the Israeli government to reduce – significantly get out of Gaza,” Biden said as the protesters were led out of his South Carolina remarks.
    
            But still, the protests provide a window into Biden’s potential problems among young voters, Arab Americans and the most progressive flank of the Democratic Party.
    
            At the rally, Harris also delivered a stark warning on abortion access in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe.
    
            “We all know 19 months ago, the highest court in our land – the court of Thurgood (Marshall) and RBG – took a constitutional right from the people of America, from the women of America, and in the 19 months since, in states across our nation, extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and punish women, laws that make no exception even for rape and incest,” she said.
    
            The vice president blasted Trump for his role in gutting abortion rights, warning even more restrictive measures would follow if Republicans have their way.
    
            “Across our nation, women are suffering – and let us be very clear about who was responsible: Former President Trump hand picked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe,” she said.
    
            “He intended for them to take your freedoms, he is the architect of this health care crisis, and he is not done — and the extremists are not done,” she said.
    
            Looking forward, Harris pledged the Biden administration’s support for safeguarding abortion access.
    
            “We have a president who has a vision for our future, a future where reproductive freedom is protected for every woman, every person in America,” she said. “And we have a president who has – and this is so critically important – the compassion, as well as the determination and skill, to make our vision for our country and our future real.”
    
            The Biden campaign is banking on abortion rights being one of the pivotal issues driving voters out against the GOP nominee in November. Nearly two-thirds of Americans polled after the 2022 decision that overturned Roe said they disagreed with the decision, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in the decision’s aftermath.
    
            Biden’s campaign has also been homing in on recent comments made by Trump taking credit for the decision that overturned Roe. The former president faces a crucial night Tuesday in New Hampshire in his two-person race against Nikki Haley for the Republican nomination.
    
            Harris, the administration’s point person on abortion rights, kicked off a “reproductive freedoms tour” this week with a Monday stop in Wisconsin. She is expected to travel “across the country” to hold a number of events bringing together “thousands of people,” her office previously said.
    
            The campaign began hitting the airwaves in battleground states this week with ads featuring emotional testimony from a Texas woman who had to travel out of state to seek an abortion because of a state law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.
    
            “Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager. “In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country.”

      DOJ and Mifepristone maker urge Supreme Court to preserve full access to abortion pill
    ","
			By Devan Cole, CNN

    ","
            The Justice Department and the manufacturer of a widely used abortion pill urged the Supreme Court on Tuesday to preserve full access to the drug, warning that a lower-court ruling restricting its availability “threatens profound harms” nationwide.
    
            “The loss of access to mifepristone would be damaging for women and healthcare providers around the Nation. For many patients, mifepristone is the best method to lawfully terminate their early pregnancies,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices in court papers.
    
            “There is no equitable justification for allowing parties whose asserted injuries are at best attenuated – and whose relevant claims assert only that FDA failed adequately to explain its actions – to secure disruptive nationwide relief that threatens profound harms to the government, the healthcare system, patients, and the public,” Prelogar wrote.
    
            The pair of filings from the Justice Department and Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of the drug and an intervenor in the case, lay out their arguments for why the justices should overturn the lower-court ruling that curbed access to mifepristone, including that the pill’s challengers didn’t have the legal right – known as “standing” – to sue the government over its approval of the drug and the regulatory regime that eased access to it.
    
            “The Fifth Circuit ran roughshod over this Court’s precedents,” attorneys for Danco wrote in their filing. “The court’s standing analysis would give medical organizations standing to challenge virtually every government regulation that touches on health or safety.”
    
            The justices agreed last year to review the case, though the court has not yet scheduled oral arguments. More briefs from the parties are expected in the coming weeks.
    
            In its filing Tuesday night, the drugmaker, like the government, defended the US Food and Drug Administration’s 2000 approval of mifepristone and the agency’s subsequent actions concerning the drug. The company argued that the legal analysis employed by the New Orleans-based appeals court to limit access to the drug “threatens to destabilize the pharmaceutical industry, which relies both on FDA’s ability to make predictive judgments and on courts not second-guessing those scientific judgments.”
    
            For now, mifepristone remains available and not subject to restrictions that the lower courts have said should be imposed on its use. The high court determined in April 2023 that access to the drug would remain unchanged until the appeals process finishes.
    
            Central to the dispute is the scope of the FDA’s authority to regulate mifepristone, a drug that the medical community has deemed safe and effective and is used by more than half of women to terminate their pregnancies, according to the government.
    
            Challengers – including doctors and groups who oppose abortion – argue that the FDA did not do enough to study the safety implications of the drug when it approved its use and made it more easily accessible in subsequent years.
    
            A federal judge in Texas agreed last spring, issuing a ruling that would have halted the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals backtracked somewhat, saying in August that while it was too late for the challengers to mount a case against the initial 2000 approval of the drug and left in place the 2019 approval of a generic version of the drug, it would block changes made in 2016 and 2021 that made the drug more easily accessible.

      Opinion: It’s too dangerous to allow this antiquated law to exist any longer
    ","
			Opinion by David S. Cohen, Greer Donley and Rachel Rebouché
		","

        3:24 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024
    ","
            The most significant national threat to reproductive rights is not a looming Supreme Court judgment or a bill being considered by Congress. It’s already here, in the form of an extant but long dormant law from 1873 that could ban abortion nationwide: the Comstock Act. The act is named after Anthony Comstock, an anti-vice crusader from the late 1800s who used his power as a special agent of the US Postal Service to enforce his beliefs about sex and propriety. He was able to persuade Congress to pass laws against “indecent or immoral” materials, including broad definitions of contraception, pornography and abortion.
    
            Some antiabortion advocates are interpreting this law, which remained on the books during the half century that Roe v. Wade was in force, to ban mailing anything that induces an abortion. Because virtually everything used for an abortion — from abortion pills, to the instruments for abortion procedures, to clinic supplies — gets mailed to providers in some form, this interpretation of the Comstock Act could mean a nationwide ban on all abortions, even in states where it remains legal.
    
            The Comstock Act must be repealed, and in our view, that process needs to begin this year. As tempting as it is to ignore this law, allowing it to remain on the books is too dangerous, and the stakes are too high.
    
            The Comstock Act has long been considered a relic of history and a symbol of outdated, discriminatory beliefs. The Act had already fallen into disuse by the late 1930s and was presumed unconstitutional after the Supreme Court found a constitutional right to contraception and abortion. However, in 1971, before Roe v. Wade was decided, Congress deleted the Comstock provisions related to contraception. It left untouched the provisions on abortion, including a ban on mailing through interstate commerce “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” This language applies to the US Postal Service as well as express carriers, such as UPS or FedEx.
    
            The act, however, has not been enforced against abortion provision in almost 100 years. And when it was enforced in the early 1900s, federal appeals courts had read the language of the law very narrowly to apply only to illegal abortions. This interpretation was necessary for many reasons, but one of the most obvious was that the act, by its terms and contrary to pre-Roe standards, doesn’t contain an exception to save a pregnant person’s life. The Department of Justice reinforced that narrow interpretation in 2022.
    
            But antiabortion activists, emboldened after the demise of Roe, have a new interpretation that contradicts this almost-century worth of precedent: The law is as broad and as strict as its plain terms would indicate. And, in effect, interpreting Comstock this way would solve the problem of a divided Congress that won’t pass a nationwide abortion ban. They have set forth this new interpretation in litigation, local ordinances, threatening letters by state legislators and attorneys general, media statements and plans for a Republican administration in 2025.
    
            For now, the current Department of Justice will not enforce the Comstock Act. As long as a Democrat sits in the White House, the law will remain in the dustbin of history. But a future Republican administration could exhume the law and make enforcing Comstock a top priority. Even worse, given that the Act has a five-year statute of limitations, an antiabortion administration could not only prosecute people for violations that occur in the future, but also for any violations occurring right now. Current abortion providers targeted under this interpretation would try to make arguments about due process and entrapment, but they’d have to raise those arguments in court after being prosecuted, a precarious position.
    
            With this potential threat, the Comstock Act is too dangerous to stay on the books and remain unchallenged or in the shadows. We need a repeal bill now.
    
            We concede that the questions of when and how to go about repealing Comstock involve complex strategic considerations. It is reasonable to worry that a repeal bill would draw even more attention to the Comstock Act and inadvertently confer legitimacy on the broad antiabortion interpretation. Moreover, courts might view a failed repeal effort—and given the current Congress, failure is likely—as evidence that Congress believes the Comstock Act is good law and applies to all abortion, not just illegal abortions. It’s true that courts sometimes look to this subsequent legislative history to interpret laws, though doing so is generally disfavored for good reasons.
    
            These concerns are real but should be evaluated alongside other strategic considerations. Most notably, as already described, antiabortion extremists are already hard at work pushing their interpretation of the Act into the mainstream discourse. Ignoring those strategies will not stop them from gaining momentum unless those in power call out the severe (and absurd) consequences of enforcing this law.
    
            And antiabortion judges wouldn’t need a failed repeal attempt to achieve the outcome they want. They can and will rely on Comstock’s current text whether Congress tries to repeal the law or not. Federal courts in Texas and the Fifth Circuit of the US Court of Appeals have already accepted the antiabortion interpretation without a whisper of Congressional action to repeal the Act. And there are ways to mitigate the risks of a failed repeal bill. The bill could include ample language in the preamble or purpose section that explicitly rejects any endorsement of the broad, antiabortion interpretation of Comstock.
    
            The risks of a repeal effort also need to be balanced against the benefits. We are not naive enough to think the repeal law will pass in this Congress given the Republican-controlled House and lack of a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Nonetheless, there is much to be gained in introducing a repeal bill that forces every federal legislator to take a public position on Comstock.
    
            With a repeal bill on the table, representatives would have to state publicly whether they defend a law written at a time when women couldn’t vote, couldn’t say no to their husbands’ sexual advances, were barred from most professions (including the legal profession), and had their legal identity disappear upon marriage. They should be forced to say whether they support banning not only abortion-inducing items but also lingerie and sex toys and any other items that could be put to “indecent or immoral use.” And perhaps most forcefully, they should look their constituents in the eyes when they explain that, with Comstock still on the books for an antiabortion Department of Justice to enforce, there will likely be nowhere for them to go when they need an abortion resulting from pregnancy complications, inevitable miscarriage, fetal anomaly, rape, incest or unwanted pregnancy.
    
            Again, the Comstock Act has no exceptions and applies nationwide. Everyone implicated by the act, even pregnant people, are subject to punishment, and the penalties for violating the act are steep: federal prison time and fines.
    
            It’s time for legislators who support abortion rights to take control of the conversation — to force their colleagues to say the quiet part out loud and to vocalize their support for these draconian laws. And even if a repeal effort fails, making Comstock an issue now might influence voters to choose a president and other politicians in November who do not want Anthony Comstock’s moral judgments, from a bygone era, governing our modern life.

      Biden campaign puts reproductive rights front and center as it plans to tie Trump to abortion bans

    ","
            The Biden campaign will hit the airwaves in battleground states with its first abortion-focused ad of the year, featuring stark, emotional testimony from a woman personally affected by a state abortion ban who lays the blame directly on former President Donald Trump.
    
            It comes as the campaign is launching a full-court press this week to put abortion rights front and center in the 2024 race, including with events headlined by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The push marks the campaign’s first organized effort to emphasize the issue, seeking to further galvanize voters around reproductive rights in the first presidential election after the Supreme Court ended the federal constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            The new TV spot also follows Biden’s ramped-up attacks against Trump in the opening weeks of the year, portraying him as a direct threat to democracy. It’s part of the campaign’s efforts to warn of Trump’s plans and positions ahead of a possible matchup in November.
    
            The minutelong ad, titled “Forced” and shared first with CNN, features an emotional direct-to-camera testimonial from Dr. Austin Dennard, a Texas OB-GYN and mother who traveled out of her state, which has a strict abortion ban, to terminate her pregnancy after learning her fetus had a fatal condition. Dennard calls the situation “every woman’s worst nightmare” and criticizes Trump for the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The former president has taken credit for overturning Roe v. Wade due to the justices he appointed to the Supreme Court, recently saying in a Fox News town hall, “For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it. And I’m proud to have done it.”
    
            “I never thought that I would need an abortion for a planned pregnancy, but I did,” Dennard says in the ad. “Two years ago, I became pregnant with a baby I desperately wanted. At a routine ultrasound, I learned that the fetus would have a fatal condition and that there was absolutely no chance of survival.
    
            “In Texas you are forced to carry that pregnancy, and that is because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,” Dennard says as an image of Trump flashes across the screen. “The choice was completely taken away. I was to continue my pregnancy, putting my life at risk.”
    
            In 2021, Texas banned abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. After the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision in 2022, a trigger law went into effect banning all abortions in the state other than those intended to protect the life of a mother.
    
            Dennard ends the ad saying, “We need leaders that will protect our rights and not take them away and that’s Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.”
    
            Biden campaign officials hope stories like Dennard’s will resonate with voters heading into November’s election as the campaign looks to stress Trump and other Republicans are extreme and have worked to limit reproductive rights. Democrats saw success around the issue of abortion in the 2022 midterms and other recent elections, which the Biden campaign hopes to replicate in 2024.
    
            Biden on Monday will convene the fourth meeting of the Task Force on Reproductive Health Care Access as the administration prepares to announce new actions relating to contraception and patient rights to emergency medical care.
    
            The actions, which are timed to coincide with the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, appear to be limited in scope, expanding on previous executive orders and memorandums signed by the president.
    
            Nearly two-thirds of Americans disapproved of the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in the decision’s aftermath. And a CNN poll conducted in November found that Americans align more with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on the issue of abortion.
    
            It’s this discontent with the Supreme Court’s decision that the Biden campaign hopes to capitalize on in November. The ad will begin running Monday in seven battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – and nationally during the season premiere of ABC’s “The Bachelor.” The ad will air on channels like HGTV, TLC, Bravo, Hallmark, Food Network and Oxygen with the hope of reaching suburban women and young voters, campaign officials said.
    
            It will also air in battleground states during the NFL conference championship games next Sunday, which the official says features a younger and more diverse audience. A 30-second version of the ad will air at the same time on digital platforms, including YouTube. The campaign did not detail how much money was behind the ad, which is set to run for the next week.
    
            The Biden campaign plans to use the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade this week to lean into making reproductive rights arguments a focal point of the campaign.
    
            Harris, who has emerged as the administration’s foremost voice on abortion, will on Monday kick off a reproductive freedoms tour in Wisconsin, a battleground state Democrats are looking to defend.
    
            The push will continue the next day, when Biden and Harris team up for their first campaign event of the year in Virginia. The event, which will also focus on reproductive rights, will come the same day as the New Hampshire primary.
    
            Biden started the year with a renewed emphasis on taking on Trump, trying to portray him as a direct threat to Americans’ personal freedoms. From the start, the campaign has sought to warn that issues such as reproductive rights are under attack, even featuring images of abortion rights activists protesting outside the Supreme Court in its campaign launch video.
    
            The Biden campaign and White House have sought to push back on state abortion bans since the Dobbs decision. Biden has taken some executive actions relating to abortion access, contraception and states passing abortion restrictions, but even those have been quite limited, highlighting the challenges he faces in acting on his own.
    
            In a memo released Friday, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said Biden and Harris are “the only candidates in the race for the presidency who will veto a national abortion ban to become law and are fighting to restore the protections of Roe – the only way to guarantee access to care for people in every state.”
    
            On Monday, the president will receive updates about efforts to “protect access to reproductive health care and the continued threats to emergency care and FDA approved medication abortion,” said Jennifer Klein, chair of the Gender Policy Council.
    
            “In the face of these threats, the administration is committed to ensuring women have the freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions,” she said.
    
            The contraception-focused actions include new guidance from the departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury aimed at strengthening access to all forms of contraception at no cost under the Affordable Care Act. It stems from an executive order Biden signed over the summer ordering the agencies to consider such guidance.
    
            The Office of Personnel Management will announce it is adopting similar policy for health care coverage for federal workers. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra will send a letter to insurance providers receiving federal funding, including private health insurers, state Medicaid programs and Medicare plans, outlining obligations to cover contraception.
    
            Health and Human Services will also take steps relating to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), laying out a plan to educate patients about their right to emergency medical care and information on how to pursue complaints. The agency will also set up a team of experts to help hospitals and providers ensure they meet obligations under federal law.
    
            EMTALA, a federal Medicare law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing care to emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay, is at the center of one of the biggest abortion cases before the nation’s highest court this year. The Supreme Court will decide whether emergency room doctors can perform medically necessary abortions in states that prohibit them.
    
            The Biden administration also is bracing for another high-stakes reproductive care decision from the Supreme Court, which will decide whether to restrict access to a widely used abortion drug known as mifepristone. The cases will be decided in the middle of the 2024 election.
    
            Klein declined to weigh in on the 2024 implications of the upcoming court decisions, but noted, “As we have seen before when Americans have the opportunity to make their voices heard on this issue, they will continue to do that.”
    
            White House officials will be closely watching state ballot initiatives this year after successful efforts by abortion rights advocates to put abortion measures in the hands of voters, most recently in Ohio.
    
            In states “where abortion has been on the ballot, the American people have overwhelmingly voted to protect reproductive freedom,” Klein said. “We’re going to remain focused on supporting state partners who are doing both the defensive as I said, and proactive bites to ensure access, including ballot initiatives.”
    
            Senior Biden campaign officials have said their research shows ads including personal testimony from Americans resonate deeply with voters. In the years since the Dobbs decision, some Democrats crafted ads featuring emotional and personal stories about abortion.
    
            That included a searing ad in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race in which a 21-year-old woman detailed the trauma of being raped by her stepfather as she criticized the Republican attorney general for failing to support exemptions to Kentucky’s abortion ban for cases of rape and incest.
    
            Dennard, a mother of three, has shared her story in detail in a Texas courthouse, in congressional hearings and at the White House, where she met with first lady Jill Biden last summer. Her fetus was diagnosed with anencephaly, a condition in which the brain and skull of a fetus don’t completely form, which also poses a significant threat to pregnant patients.
    
            Last summer, Dennard testified that continuing with the pregnancy would have put her at “significant risk,” but she did not feel confident a medical provider would give her an abortion in Texas over the diagnosis, given what she described as the confusing and vague parameters of the state’s medical emergency exception.
    
            “No woman in America should have to risk their life or flee their home to receive life-saving care, but because of Donald Trump, too many have been forced to do exactly that,” said Chavez Rodriguez. “This ad serves as a sobering reminder to women across the country of the devastating legacy of Donald Trump’s presidency – and a warning of his plans, if elected,  to take this anti-abortion crusade even further by using every agency and tool of the federal government to limit women’s access to reproductive health care.”

      Anti-abortion advocates look to state legislatures at the second post-Roe March for Life
    ","

    ","
            Anti-abortion advocates gathered in Washington, DC, on Friday for the annual March for Life — the second since the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections.
    
            Attendees who convened on the National Mall on a cold, snowy day said with Roe v. Wade overturned, they’re now looking to states to pass abortion bans. At least 14 Republican-majority states have banned the procedure with little to no exceptions, and seven others have limited access.
    
            “What’s next is the state level,” said Blake Miller, member of a pro-life group at North Carolina State University. “We want to take it to the states, have pro-life marches at the states and hopefully get our state legislators to get a ban on abortion up to conception.”
    
            Friday’s national march — the theme of which was “Pro-life: With Every Woman, For Every Child” — precedes marches scheduled in the coming weeks in more than a dozen states, including in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky and North Dakota, where abortion bans are already in effect.
    
            Jim Hogan, who traveled to Washington from Pennsylvania for the march, stressed that “we have to continue to march and to help persuade people.”
    
            “Fifty years of making it okay to abort, I don’t expect in a year everyone’s mind to change,” said Hogan.
    
            This year’s march followed the new route set by the 2023 march, ending at the US Capitol instead of the Supreme Court “to symbolize that the battle post-Roe has shifted to the legislature,” one of the organizers then told CNN.
    
            The march followed a rally where House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed the crowd. In his remarks, Johnson said that he is “a product of unplanned pregnancy” and is “very profoundly grateful” that his parents “chose life.”
    
            “See what we have to do right now, and I believe the reason all of you are here is you understand that we have to build a culture that encourages and assists more and more people to make that same decision,” Johnson added.
    
            Participants in the march were keenly aware that 2024 is a presidential election year, and reproductive rights are expected to be a key factor for many voters. Several attendees said candidates’ stances on abortion will be an important factor in their vote.
    
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have said they support state bans with some exceptions. Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has tried to walk a fine line on the issue while still touting his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices who played a part in overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            Democrats, on the other hand, are hoping that the issue will boost voter turnout and give their party an advantage for President Joe Biden’s reelection bid and states that will have abortion on the ballot in November. Abortion rights groups are looking to expand Ohio’s success in enshrining reproductive rights in its state constitution to several other states, including Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Maryland.
    
            Ethan Abernathy — an 18-year-old undecided voter from St. Louis who intends to vote in November’s election — said pro-life issues are “really important” to him as he considers which candidate to support.
    
            “Everybody has the right to life and that’s one of the things in the Constitution like right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness,” Abernathy said. “If we don’t have the first right to life, we don’t really have anything past that.”
    
            Anna Phillips, who is part of the Student for Life club at St. Louis University, said while she’s leaning toward Trump, his stance on abortion is “the only thing I’m iffy about.”
    
            Trump has indicated that five- or six-week abortion bans are too aggressive and said at a town hall in Iowa earlier this month that he supports exceptions for rape, incest and life endangerment. But he added that the issue isn’t a political winner, saying, “You have to win elections.”
    
            But some attendees said they were confident Trump will enact anti-abortion policies regardless of what he says on the matter.
    
            “I think Mr. Trump is a realist in that there is a segment of our country that doesn’t believe that there should be limits on it and I believe that he believes that it should also be a last resort,” said Dawn Hogan of Pennsylvania, a crisis pregnancy center volunteer who plans to vote for Trump.
    
            Hogan’s husband, Jim, who is also supporting Trump, acknowledged that “the way he messages things aren’t always the most ideal.”
    
            “But like I’ve heard lots of previous Republicans talk, talk, talk, talk, talk — nice, beautiful stuff. They didn’t do anything,” Jim Hogan said. “Trump put three constitutional judges in place and helped overturn Roe vs. Wade. … He’s already walked the walk.”

      First on CNN: Amid post-Roe concerns, Democratic lawmakers introduce bill to protect access to IVF
    ","
			By Jacqueline Howard, CNN

    ","
            Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation aimed at protecting access to infertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization, amid growing concern that anti-abortion bills may threaten access in some states.
    
            On Thursday, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth and Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild introduced the Access to Family Building Act, which would make it a statutory right for patients to access assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization or IVF, continue treatments and retain authority over how sperm or egg cells are used during such treatments.
    
            “It will be in federal code that you have this right,” said Duckworth, who has been outspoken about her own experience using IVF to grow her family.
    
            IVF is a form of assisted reproductive technology in which eggs are fertilized by sperm cells in a lab and the resulting embryos transferred into a person’s uterus in hopes of leading to pregnancy.
    
            The new bill could supersede states’ strict abortion laws when it comes to discarding a patient’s embryos during the IVF process or even terminating a pregnancy when a patient is implanted with multiple embryos while using assisted reproductive technology.
    
            “This is really in part because of what’s happening across the country: You have state legislatures that impose a ban on access to abortion or state legislatures who have decided to, or there are moves to define a human being with personhood rights as a fertilized egg,” Duckworth said. “Well, if that were the case, that would actually prohibit many forms of IVF.”
    
            During Duckworth’s IVF experience, she said, she had five fertilized eggs, but three of them were found to not be viable and were discarded.
    
            Under a strict anti-abortion law, “if a fertilized egg is a human being with rights, then that’s manslaughter,” she said.
    
            To date, there have not been any known legal cases in which a patient’s access to IVF has been overtly threatened or restricted, but there are growing concerns that such incidents may happen in states with strict abortion laws, said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, a nonprofit focused on the advancement of the science and practice of reproductive medicine.
    
            “Since the Dobbs decision, there has been a great deal of anxiety amongst patients and health care providers both of infertility care. They understand that a very strong protection has been taken away from them,” Tipton said of the US Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.
    
            Although there have not been overt attempts to stop access to IVF, Tipton said, such restrictions could occur if elected officials use language in anti-abortion bills that may endanger infertility care. A common example of this is when lawmakers write in anti-abortion bills that human beings are protected from “the moment of conception,” he said, because conception is not a “moment,” it is a process.
    
            “In the in vitro fertilization process, eggs are fertilized outside of the body, and so if you write something that pertains to all fertilized eggs, whether that is in a woman gestating to become an embryo, a fetus and eventually a child, it could also apply to the fertilized egg in the freezer of an infertility clinic,” Tipton said.
    
            “We think that’s pretty dangerous, and we think most people would think those are very different,” he said. “So where the rubber meets the road for fertility medicine is: What’s the legal status of the fertilized egg that has not yet been placed into a woman to establish a pregnancy?”
    
            Just months after the US Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Duckworth and Wild introduced the Right to Build Families Act to prohibit limiting access to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology.
    
            But since then, Duckworth said, the duo has observed how strict abortion laws have been enacted in some states and have received feedback on what type of legislation might be needed to preempt such laws. Based on that, they developed the Access to Family Building Act, which would do something the previous legislation does not: make access to IVF and similar technologies a statutory right.
    
            “This is basically an improvement on the previous bill that was introduced right after the Dobbs decision,” Duckworth said, adding that the language to make access to reproductive health care a statutory right has not been used before.
    
            The Access to Family Building Act “goes hand in hand with my firm belief that a woman’s body is hers and hers alone and that what she chooses to do with it should be her decision alone, and that includes attempting to get pregnant,” Wild said.
    
            It’s estimated that each year, about 2 in every 100 infants born in the US — or 2.3% — are conceived using assisted reproductive technology, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Now that the bill has been introduced in the House and Senate, it will be referred to committee and then the committee decides whether to consider it. Wild said she hopes some of her Republican colleagues will offer their support for the legislation.
    
            “A number of them have indicated a great deal of empathy,” she said. “I am sure there are many people on the other side of the aisle who have had either themselves or a member of their family who have needed assisted reproductive technology.”

      Biden and Harris to make reproductive rights push in first joint 2024 campaign event
    ","

    ","
            President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to make their first joint campaign appearance of 2024 next week as they look to lay out how abortion rights are at stake in November’s election.
    
            Biden and Harris, along with first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, will speak at an event in northern Virginia on Tuesday, the same day as the New Hampshire primaries.
    
            The event, which a campaign official said will focus on reproductive rights, comes one day after the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which enshrined the federal constitutional right to an abortion for decades before the Supreme Court overturned it in 2022.
    
            The campaign said the president and vice president would highlight state efforts to enact abortion bans, including in Virginia. Democrats won control of the state’s legislature in 2023 after abortion featured prominently in the off-year election.
    
            The campaign is hoping to use the Roe v. Wade anniversary on Monday as a chance to mobilize voters around the issue of abortion. They are planning to target women and swing voters with a new advertisement campaign in key battleground states over the weekend. Officials have been eager to highlight the efforts of former President Donald Trump to restrict access to abortion, including circulating his recent comments taking credit for overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            “Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager. “In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country.”
    
            The Biden campaign has long argued abortion rights will be front and center in the 2024 campaign.
    
            In recent years, the issue has been an influential factor in campaigns for elective office up and down the ballot. The GOP’s failure to meet expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats retained control of the US Senate and only narrowly lost the House of Representatives, raised the prospect that the high court’s decision could alter the political landscape for years to come.
    
            Harris specifically has become the administration’s foremost voice on reproductive rights, both in public events and behind the scenes in hours of policy discussions and internal White House deliberations. She led intense efforts to marshal outside allies, many of whom were staggered by the Supreme Court ruling itself – and pressing the Biden administration to do more in response.
    
            The vice president is set to kick off a reproductive rights tour in Wisconsin on Monday. She is expected to highlight the true stories of American women affected by the Supreme Court’s decision.
    
            “I will continue to fight for our fundamental freedoms while bringing together those throughout America who agree that every woman should have the right to make decisions about her own body – not the government,” Harris said in a statement last month.
    
            Nearly two-thirds of Americans disapproved of the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in the decision’s aftermath. And a CNN poll conducted in November found that Americans align more with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on the issue of abortion.
    
            Speaking with ABC’s “The View” on Wednesday, Harris once again excoriated Republicans for pushing abortion bans that include “denying a survivor of rape or incest the act to make a decision about what happens to their body next.”
    
            Asked what the solution is, Harris answered: “Reelect President Joe Biden president of the United States.”
    
            “And a majority of people in the United States Congress who agree that one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs, to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body,” she continued. “If she chooses, she will talk with her priest or pastor, her Rabbi or her Imam. But it should not be the government telling her what to do.”
    
            “In this year of our lord 2024, the government should not be telling women what to do with their bodies,” Harris said. “It’s that basic.”

      GOP front-runner for North Carolina governor supported banning abortions without exceptions. Now he avoids using the ‘a-word’
    ","

        4:00 AM EST, Wed January 17, 2024
    ","
            North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the state’s second highest-ranking elected official and its leading Republican candidate for governor in 2024, once hailed banning abortion as his top priority, advocating for its complete ban without exceptions.
    
            “For me, there is no compromise on abortion. It makes no difference to me why or how that child ended up in that womb,” he said in July 2020 while campaigning for lieutenant governor.
    
            At the time, Robinson was a political newcomer, having built his campaign off his work as a conservative influencer espousing support for gun rights, law enforcement and “protecting the life of the unborn.”
    
            Now, as the 2024 GOP front-runner for governor, Robinson avoids mentioning abortion on the campaign trail, claiming recently that he stopped using what he calls the “a-word,” preferring instead to use the word “life.”
    
            He’s also softened his position. Robinson denies ever supporting abortion bans without exceptions, publicly stating that he has always struggled with the issue and confirming that he once paid for an abortion for his then-girlfriend, now-wife in the 1980s, an experience he says he fully regrets.
    
            But in comments reviewed by CNN’s KFile dating back to 2018, Robinson regularly labeled abortion as “murder” and “genocide,” comparing the anti-abortion movement to the abolitionist movement to end slavery. He also baselessly speculated that the founders of Planned Parenthood were satanists who practiced witchcraft.
    
            Robinson characterized women who undergo abortions, even if they are just “24 hours pregnant,” as murderers.
    
            Robinson’s current position, his office has said, is support for so-called “heartbeat” legislation, which could ban abortion after a “heartbeat” is detected — but with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.
    
            If victorious in this year’s election, Robinson would be the first Black governor in the state’s history.
    
            Robinson’s rhetorical shift has come since the Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 Dobbs decision to overturn the right to an abortion established in Roe v. Wade, and as North Carolina passed its own controversial 12-week abortion ban last May, with Republican lawmakers overriding the Democratic governor’s veto.
    
            The North Carolina law went into effect in July and restricts abortion access from the previous limit of 20 weeks down to 12 weeks, limits medication abortion to 10 weeks, and requires patients to meet in-person with a physician at least 72 hours before the procedure. It does have exceptions for cases of rape and incest through 20 weeks and “life-limiting” fetal anomalies through 24 weeks.
    
            As state Republicans finalized their abortion bill last year, Robinson declined to comment on the legislation at the time. “I’m tired of talking about abortion. I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” he said in May 2023, according to WFAE.
    
            In July, Rolling Stone reported on audio of Robinson saying he tries not to use the word abortion anymore.
    
            “North Carolina needs to become a destination state for life. Now notice what I said: I said ‘life.’ I did not say the a-word. The a-word. Everybody wants us to say the a-word,” he said.
    
            Robinson is no stranger to controversy. As CNN’s KFile previously reported, he mocked and attacked the Parkland school shooting survivors. The Greensboro native also attacked the Civil Rights movement, lamenting that “so many freedoms were lost,” and criticized the historic Woolworth lunch counter sit-in protests in 1960 that originated in his hometown.
    
            As the 2024 election nears, abortion remains a driving factor in the gubernatorial race.
    
            Democrats in the state, and the campaign of the Democratic front-runner for governor, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, have often pointed to comments Robinson made in February in which he talked about the political realities of abortion bans.
    
            “If I had all the power right now, let’s say I was the governor and had a willing legislature, we could pass a bill saying you can’t have an abortion in North Carolina for any reason,” he said in a February 2023 radio interview. “Would that stop abortions? No. People would get in their car, they’d go to Georgia, they’d go to South Carolina. They would go to Virginia, they’d go wherever they could. They’d get pills online. Passing a law is one thing, I’d love to pass a law. I’d love to see a ‘heartbeat bill’ proposed in our legislature.”
    
            At a public event in August, Robinson said he didn’t recall making statements in support of a total ban on abortion and said that he always struggled on the issue. And on a podcast in April, Robinson expressed a commitment to not governing based on his “personal religious belief.” He stressed the importance of reaching a consensus on anti-abortion legislation.
    
            “I would love to see abortion outlawed, make no qualms about that. I don’t believe in abortion under any circumstances,” Robinson said. “Being an elected official, I don’t rule by my opinion, and I don’t rule by just what I think.”
    
            Michael Lonergan, a spokesperson for the Robinson campaign, told CNN, “Lt. Gov Robinson has publicly supported legislation that would limit abortion after a heartbeat is detected, with protections for extreme situations such as rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger.”
    
            Given Robinson’s rhetorical shift on abortion, his previous statements on the topic look particularly harsh.
    
            In January 2019, as New York was passing a law allowing abortion past 24 weeks in cases where a woman’s life was at risk or the fetus was non-viable, Robinson took to Facebook, condemning abortion as “child sacrifice.” Specifically targeting then-Governor Andrew Cuomo, he went as far as to describe Cuomo’s beliefs as being “truly from the pit of hell” and said, “Satan must be his muse.”
    
            That sort of rhetoric was typical for Robinson, who first saw his breakout in politics in 2018 after a speech he gave in support of gun rights went viral following the Parkland school shooting. The video launched a career as a conservative media personality for Robinson, who previously served in the Army Reserve and worked in furniture manufacturing.
    
            In speeches and interviews that followed as his star rose, Robinson was frank about his views on abortion.
    
            “I’m convinced that Margaret Sanger and all of her contemporaries that followed her, they were witches, all of ‘em,” Robinson said of the founder of the American birth control movement on a podcast. “They were witches. I have no doubt. It would not shock me one bit if they were not satanists involved in witchcraft.”
    
            “Who else would come up with the solution, that the only solution to keep people from having unwanted pregnancies is to kill the unborn,” he added. “It’s an idea straight from the devil.”
    
            Running for lieutenant governor in 2020, Robinson did not shy away from his belief. That year, he responded to a survey from American Family Association Action, a socially conservative group, and said abortion should not be allowed under any circumstances.
    
            When asked at a “Life Wins” event in September 2020 if there were any circumstances in which abortion would be OK, Robinson responded, “I do not believe so.”
    
            “When it came to slavery, we had to end slavery for the cause of liberty,” he added. “And we have to end abortion for the cause of life.”
    
            In a speech at an anti-abortion event in January 2021, Robinson called abortion providers the “butchers of humanity,” and condemned abortion as murder.
    
            “A lot of people tell me, ‘Don’t say abortion is murder,’” he said. “Guess what? Abortion is murder.”
    
            In a July 2021 speech to a church, Robinson labeled women who receive abortions murderers as well.
    
            “You know, I ain’t supposed to say this, but I’m going to say it,” he said. “I don’t care whether you just got pregnant. I don’t care if you’re 24 hours pregnant. I don’t care if you’re 24 weeks pregnant. I don’t care. If you kill that young’un. It is murder. You got blood on your hands.”
    
            Despite this rhetoric, in early 2022 CNN affiliate WRAL uncovered a Facebook post from 2012 in which Robinson said he paid for an abortion in 1989. He later confirmed that the abortion was for his then-girlfriend and now-wife, Yolanda Hill Robinson, in a Facebook video in March 2022.
    
            “Before we were married and before we had kids, we had an abortion. It was the hardest decision we have ever made, and sadly, we made the wrong one,” he said, addressing the camera in the Facebook video. “This decision has been with us ever since. It’s because of this experience and our spiritual journey that we are so adamantly pro-life,” he said.
    
            A week after Roe was overturned in June 2022, Robinson expressed his goals to make sure North Carolina had the strictest abortion laws in the country.
    
            “Now abortion, you all know how I feel about abortion,” Robinson said in a speech posted on Facebook.”
    
            “I want North Carolina to be the most pro-life state in the nation. Hands down. Abortion is murder. It’s a scourge on this nation. It needs to go.”

      Ohio woman who suffered miscarriage at home will not be criminally charged, grand jury says

    ","
            An Ohio woman who suffered a miscarriage and left the nonviable fetus at home will not be criminally charged, a grand jury decided Thursday, dismissing a case that highlighted the extent to which women can be prosecuted when their pregnancy ends – whether by abortion or miscarriage.
    
            The felony charge was filed by the Warren Police Department upon advice from the Warren City Prosecutor’s Office, according to a news release from Trumbull County Prosecuting Attorney Dennis Watkins. A municipal court then bound the case over to a Trumbull County grand jury, Watkins said. He noted his office “never assessed the evidence or advised as to charging” Watts.
    
            It was up to the county grand jury to determine whether Watts should be indicted and stand trial, the release said.
    
            Brittany Watts, 34, of Warren, was charged last year with felony abuse of a corpse, Trumbull County court records show. In the days before her September miscarriage, Watts went to a hospital with severe bleeding and was told her fetus was not viable, a coroner’s office report states. The hospital staff notified the Warren Police Department, which responded to Watts’ home, the coroner’s office report says.
    
            On Thursday, that grand jury returned a “no bill” for the charge, concluding insufficient evidence for an indictment against Watts, according to the Trumbull County Prosecutor’s office.
    
            Watkins said his office did not believe Watts violated the law, adding, “We respectfully disagree with the lower court’s application of the law.”
    
            “(This office took) some criticism and vicious personal attacks by the few who didn’t understand that a reasonable amount of time was needed to do our duties and misreported that we were seeking an indictment in this case,” Watkins said.
    
            CNN has reached out to the Warren City Prosecutor’s Office for comment. Assistant prosecutor Lewis Guarnieri said in a November preliminary hearing the issue wasn’t about how or when the child died, it was “the fact that the baby was put into a toilet, large enough to clog up the toilet, left in that toilet and (Watts) went on her day,” according to footage from WKBN.
    
            Watts’ attorney, Traci Timko, told CNN on Thursday the charge was not supported by Ohio law and that Watts was “demonized for something that takes place in the privacy of (women’s) homes regularly.”
    
            “While the last three months have been agonizing, we are incredibly grateful and relieved that Justice was handed down by the grand jury today,” Timko said. “To the countless women who reached out to share their own devastating stories of pregnancy loss- Brittany read every one of them and felt a sisterhood to each of you. The emails, letters, calls, donations and prayers- they all played a part in empowering and getting her through each day.”
    
            After the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and the federal right to an abortion, a host of state trigger laws went into effect across the country that placed new restrictions or bans on abortion.
    
            In turn, some women carrying fetuses with fatal abnormalities have been barred from having an abortion in their home states. Other women with potentially life-threatening pregnancies have also been unable to get an abortion, as medical exemption clauses can be vague and medical providers fear severe legal consequences.
    
            When asked whether the charge against Watts may have been influenced by the repeal of Roe v. Wade, her attorney previously told CNN ignorance is the main factor.
    
            “I believe that this charge stems from the lack of knowledge and/or insight that men have regarding the realities of miscarriage and women’s health in general,” Timko told CNN previously.
    
            Watts went to a hospital three times in four days due to vaginal bleeding, a report from the Trumbull County Coroner’s Office says.
    
            When she was first admitted to the Labor and Delivery Department at St. Joseph’s Hospital on September 19, “She was diagnosed with premature rupture of membranes and severe oligohydramnios,” the report states. In other words, her water had broken prematurely, and she had exceptionally low – if any – amniotic fluid.
    
            “Although a fetal heartbeat was found, it was recommended by medical staff that an induction occur of the nonviable fetus,” the coroner’s office report states.
    
            At the time, Watts’ pregnancy “was 21 weeks, 5 days gestation,” the report says. In Ohio, abortions are legal until fetal viability – which is generally considered to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. After viability, the state can legally restrict abortion access unless the patient’s life or health is at risk.
    
            However, “Brittany Watts signed herself out of the hospital against medical advice on 9/19/2023,” the coroner’s office report states. CNN has previously asked her attorney why Watts left the hospital without having the nonviable fetus induced, as recommended by the medical staff.
    
            The next day, September 20, Watts returned “for the same issue and left against medical advice again,” the coroner’s office report states.
    
            Watts returned on September 20 expecting to be induced to deliver her preterm pregnancy, according to The Washington Post. But for hours doctors and officials mulled the ethics of inducing labor for a woman who had been diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), had no detectable amniotic fluid, was bleeding vaginally and had advanced cervical dilation, the Post reported. Watts eventually left.
    
            Then on September 22, Watts returned to the hospital “for vaginal bleeding with retained placenta after a home delivery,” the coroner’s office report states. “According to medical records, Brittany Watts stated that at approximately 5:58am … she delivered the fetus into the toilet of her residence.”
    
            Warren police responded to Watts’ home, according to the coroner’s office report.
    
            According to that report, “Brittany stated to police that she had taken the fetus out of the toilet and placed it in a black bucket. She then told police that she put the remains near the garage in the back yard.”
    
            A coroner’s investigator checked inside the bowl of a toilet at the home and “felt what appeared to be a small foot with toes,” the investigator’s report says. The toilet was later broken apart by Warren police detectives, “and the fetus was retrieved,” the report states.
    
            An autopsy revealed the fetus’ cause of death was intrauterine fetal demise – meaning the fetus died inside the womb – due to severely low amniotic fluid from the premature rupture of membranes.
    
            Miscarriage is most common early in the first trimester, often before a woman knows she’s pregnant. It’s less common to naturally lose a fetus more than halfway through gestation – often known as stillbirth. About 21,000 stillbirths happen each year in the US – about 1 in 175 pregnancies, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Ohio law defines abuse of a corpse in somewhat subjective terms.
    
            “No person, except as authorized by law, shall treat a human corpse in a way that the person knows would outrage reasonable family sensibilities,” the law states. This kind of “abuse of a corpse” would be a second-degree misdemeanor.
    
            In addition, “No person, except as authorized by law, shall treat a human corpse in a way that would outrage reasonable community sensibilities,” the law says. A violation of these terms constitutes “gross abuse of a corpse” – a fifth-degree felony.
    
            However, “(t)here is no law in Ohio that requires a mother suffering a miscarriage to bury or cremate those remains,” Watts’ attorney said.
    
            “Women miscarry into toilets everyday,” Timko previously told CNN in an email. “In fact, the Ohio Legislature has created broad immunity to women for acts or omissions during pregnancy and has admonished that women should ‘in no case’ be criminalized for the circumstances or outcomes of their pregnancies.”
    
            Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights had also slammed the criminal charge against Watts, saying it would deter other women who suffer miscarriages from seeking medical help.
    
            “As citizens, we are outraged that the criminal justice system is being used to punish Ms. Watts who, like thousands of women each year, spontaneously miscarried a non-viable fetus into a toilet and then flushed,” the group said in an open letter to the Trumbull County prosecutor last month.
    
            “By seeking to indict her, you are clearly implying that anyone who miscarries at any point in pregnancy in our state must retrieve the fetal tissue whether they are at home, at work, at school, at a restaurant or other public place and preserve it until the tissue can be disposed of properly even though Ohio law does not define what a proper disposal method would be,” the letter says. “As physicians we are deeply concerned that your actions will deter women who miscarry from obtaining the medical attention they need and deserve.”

      Supreme Court to decide if emergency room doctors can perform medically necessary abortions in states that prohibit them
    ","

    ","
            The Supreme Court said Friday that it will decide whether emergency room doctors can perform medically necessary abortions in states that prohibit them, bypassing the court of appeals to resolve on an expedited basis a lawsuit brought by the United States against Idaho.
    
            It’s the second major abortion case the court will consider this year amid the fallout from the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. The justices are already set to hear a case about access to the abortion drug mifepristone – even in states where the procedure is legal.
    
            Idaho’s Defense of Life Act is a near total ban on abortion, but there is an exception to prevent the mother’s death. The law imposes penalties on doctors who perform prohibited abortions unless the “physician determined in good faith medical judgement and based on the facts known to the physician at the time, that the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.” Physicians who violate the law could face criminal penalties and risk the suspension of their licenses.
    
            The Biden administration sued, claiming that a provision of a federal Medicare statue – the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) – preempts Idaho’s law in emergency rooms.
    
            The federal law requires hospitals to provide stabilizing care to emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay. It was enacted to ensure that the poor and uninsured receive emergency medical care at hospitals receiving Medicare reimbursement.
    
            A district court in Idaho blocked the law in hospital emergency rooms that receive Medicare funding, holding that the state law interferes with a federal Medicare statute.
    
            In 2022, US District Judge B. Lynn Winmill said that the “broad scope” of Idaho’s near-total ban on abortion meant that he was not convinced that it would be possible for emergency health care workers to “simultaneously comply with obligations” under both state and federal law. “The state law must therefore yield to federal law to the extent of that conflict,” he wrote.
    
            A federal appeals court later agreed to put the district court ruling on hold pending appeal, but a larger panel of judges on the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the pause on November 13. The Idaho law will now be in effect pending the Supreme Court’s decision.
    
            The state, represented by a conservative legal group that opposes abortion, then turned to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to step in on an emergency basis to put the district court ruling on hold while appeals play out.
    
            “After Dobbs,” Erin Hawley a lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom told the justices in court papers, “the United States adopted the novel view that EMTALA creates a federal right to abortion in emergency rooms, even though EMTALA is silent on abortion and actually requires stabilizing for the unborn children of pregnant women.”
    
            The Justice Department warned the justices that the law’s provision could have “devastating harms” for women in the state and urged the court to keep that part of it on pause.
    
            “As the district court recognized, when state law criminalizes essential care required by federal law, ordinary principles of preemption require state law to give way,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said in court papers.
    
            “The narrow preliminary injunction is preserving the status quo and protecting women and doctors in Idaho from the devastating harms that would result if doctors could be subjected to criminal prosecution for providing essential emergency care,” Prelogar wrote.
    
            The ruling will have national implications.
    
            “While the mifepristone case is especially relevant for the availability of abortions in states in which they are still largely legal, this case has enormous ramifications for the availability of abortions in emergency circumstances in states in which they are not,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

      Abortion rights groups reach petition threshold to put abortion on Florida ballot in 2024

    ","
            A coalition of Florida abortion rights supporters announced on Friday they have gathered enough signatures to put a state constitutional amendment protecting the right to an abortion on the ballot in 2024. Election officials have verified 910,946 petitions submitted by Floridians Protecting Freedom, according to the Florida Division of Elections website.
    
            The group said it needed 891,523 verified petitions to make it on the ballot. They said they expect to receive official notification from the Florida Division of Elections in the coming weeks.
    
            If the measure makes it on to the ballot, Florida will join several other states where voters have weighed in directly on reproductive rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The initiative could also boost voter turnout, as it has in states like Ohio, which could give Democrats an advantage as President Joe Biden looks to secure another term.
    
            “The fact that we only launched our campaign eight months ago and we’ve already reached our petition goal speaks to the unprecedented support and momentum there is to get politicians out of our private lives and health care decisions,” said campaign director Lauren Brenzel.
    
            “Most initiative campaigns never make it this far. The ones that do usually spend far more or take much longer to qualify, which is why we’re so confident that voters will approve our amendment once they’re given a chance to vote,” Brenzel added.
    
            The Florida Supreme Court still must approve the language of the ballot measure which is being challenged by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody.
    
            The proposed amendments reads, “No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.’
    
            In a legal brief filed in October, Moody asked the Court to kill the amendment, arguing the language is vague and confusing.
    
            Moody argued that it uses language aimed at tricking voters. The brief specifically takes aim at terms like “health,” “viability” and “healthcare provider” and says they are too ambiguous.
    
            Oral arguments are scheduled on February 7 in front of the Florida Supreme Court.
    
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, appointed five of the seven justices on the current court, giving it a conservative majority.
    
            Should the measure make it on the ballot and be approved by at least 60% voters, the amendment would undo Florida’s current 15-week ban on abortions. In 2023, lawmakers passed a 6-week ban, which will only go into effect if the 15-week ban is upheld by the Florida Supreme Court.

      Mother suspected of killing 2 children was in custody battle with ex-husband and had accused him of violence, attorney says

    ","
            A Colorado Springs woman who is accused of killing her two children and seriously injuring a third had been going through a “contentious divorce and custody dispute” with her former spouse, his attorney detailed in a news release to CNN earlier this week.
    
            During the contentious battle that began in September 2018, Kimberlee Singler made “egregious allegations of child abuse and domestic violence,” against her ex-husband Kevin Wentz, his attorney Jennifer Darby said in a news release.
    
            Last September, Singler alleged Wentz brandished a knife toward her and filed and was granted a request for a Temporary Protection Order in El Paso County, the news release detailed.
    
            Wentz denied brandishing a knife and a hearing on the matter was rescheduled for January 24, according to the release.
    
            In November, the Larimer County Court held a hearing on Singler’s Emergency Motion to Restrict Parenting time related to the same knife allegation.
    
            Once the court found no “imminent” threat, it ordered Wentz to have family time with his children around Thanksgiving and again around Christmas. Exchanges of the kids were set to occur at two police stations, according to the news release.
    
            A hearing was set for January 11 to address a contempt motion against Singler after she failed to follow previous parenting time orders and at another date in January, the court was to address modifying parenting time, the news release detailed.
    
            Singler was scheduled to bring the children to one of the stations on December 16, but she did not, and she did not respond to Wentz or his divorce attorney, Darby said in the news release.
    
            An emergency motion to involve law enforcement in enforcing Wentz’s parent time was filed and granted, and Singler was ordered to appear in court with the children on the matter on December 20, the news release said.
    
            A clerk for the court left a message for Singler about the court order on December 18.
    
            Singler’s 7-year-old son Aden Wentz and her 9-year-old daughter Elianna “Ellie” Wentz were found dead in Singler’s Colorado Springs home on December 19. Her unnamed 11-year-old daughter was also found seriously injured.
    
            CNN has reached out to an attorney who once represented Singler in the divorce proceedings before withdrawing from the case.
    
            Singler was arrested in the United Kingdom on December 30 and faces four counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, CNN previously reported. The charges for each alleged crime were doubled due to the children being under the age of 12.
    
            Singler’s next court appearance abroad is scheduled for January 29, according to a spokesperson for the UK’s National Crime Agency.
    
            The arrest records for Singler will remain sealed as the courts navigate the extradition process from the UK, the Colorado Springs Police Department said earlier this week.
    
            “Kevin was devastated when he learned the news of his children’s death. Mr. Wentz fully cooperated with the police investigation,” Darby said. “Kevin and his family are suffering a tremendous amount of grief and shock.”
    
            A GoFundMe has been set up to help the family with funeral costs and to help care for the surviving child. A private funeral will be held sometime this week, Darby said.

      Uncertainty around US abortion landscape drives surge in requests to stockpile abortion medication, research shows
    ","

    ","
            Amid significant upheaval to the abortion landscape in the United States, thousands of women have preemptively requested medication abortion pills in case they need them in the future, new research shows.
    
            Aid Access, a nonprofit telehealth service, provides medication abortion by mail. The organization has offered “advance provision” of those drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, for more than two years – and demand has surged over the past year and a half since the leak of the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.
    
            In the first eight months that Aid Access offered advance provision of medication abortion – from September 2021 through April 2022 – it received an average of 25 orders a day, according to research published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. But in the two months after the Dobbs decision was leaked, from May 2022 to late June 2022, daily requests spiked nearly tenfold to about 247 orders a day.
    
            Requests slowed for a while after the Dobbs decision was formally released, with an average of 89 orders per day from late June 2022 through early April 2023. But demand spiked again as conflicting legal rulings created uncertainty around approval for mifepristone, with more than 170 requests per day through the end of April.
    
            Dr. Abigail Aiken, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, who led the research, says the study shows that “it’s the potential policy shocks that people are reacting to. … It’s the idea that people are paying attention and getting out ahead of things.”
    
            “What we’re seeing there really is a response to the fear and the uncertainty and feelings of, I guess, helplessness that the Dobbs decision brought for people,” Aiken said. “When the leak happened, I think the writing was on the wall and people thought, ‘I need to get out ahead of this.’”
    
            Overall, Aid Access has received more than 48,000 orders for advance provision of medication abortion, according to the new research. About three-quarters of people who requested it said that they wanted to “ensure personal health and choice” or “prepare for possible abortion restrictions.”
    
            “States considering future abortion bans had the highest rates of requests, and requestors were motivated by a desire to preserve reproductive autonomy,” the researchers wrote.
    
            Compared with those requesting medication abortion to end an existing pregnancy, people requesting advance provision of medication abortion were more likely to be wealthier, White, age 30 or older and not have other children. These differences probably reflect structural barriers, the researchers wrote.
    
            The structural barriers that could have influenced who was more likely to order medication abortion pills in advance include their cost and access to information about them, Aiken said. The service can cost more than $100, although Aid Access offers a sliding scale for those who need it, and people with fewer means are less likely to be able to spend that much to order medication they’re not certain to need.
    
            Medication abortion is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two pills – mifepristone and misoprostol – rather than having a surgical procedure. The drugs can be taken immediately after someone learns that they’re pregnant and up to 10 weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period.
    
            More than half of all abortions in the US are medication abortions, and it’s becoming increasingly common, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Medication abortion remains legal in the US but has been challenged in the courts. The US Supreme Court announced last month that it would consider whether to restrict access to mifepristone, a decision that could upend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval and regulation of the drug that has been considered “safe and effective” for decades.
    
            A number of Democratic-led states – including New York, California and Massachusetts – have said that they were stockpiling the pills that can be used for a medication abortion.
    
            “Anti-choice extremists have shown that they are not stopping at overturning Roe, and they are working to entirely dismantle our country’s reproductive health care system, including medication abortion and contraception,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in April. “New York will always be a safe harbor for abortion care, and I am taking action to protect abortion access in our State and continue to lead the nation in defending the right to reproductive autonomy.”

      Federal appeals court blocks Biden administration from enforcing guidance meant to protect abortion access in Texas
    ","

    ","
            A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Biden administration can’t enforce guidance meant to protect abortion access in life-threatening or health-saving situations even where abortion is banned.
    
            The guidance from the US Department of Health and Human Services says that medical providers who are required to provide emergency care to pregnant patients regardless of their ability to pay for it under a 1986 law must also provide abortion services in life-threatening or health-saving situations and will be protected if those actions violate state law.
    
            It was one of the administration’s preemptive strikes in its response to the US Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade.
    
            Texas challenged the guidance, which cites the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), in federal court. In 2022, a judge blocked HHS from enforcing the guidance in Texas or against members of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists or Christian Medical & Dental Associations.
    
            “The question before the court is whether EMTALA, according to HHS’s Guidance, mandates physicians to provide abortions when that is the necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition. It does not. We therefore decline to expand the scope of EMTALA,” Judge Kurt Engelhardt of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in the unanimous ruling.
    
            “EMTALA does not mandate any specific type of medical treatment, let alone abortion,” the decision said.
    
            Engelhardt, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, was joined in his ruling by Circuit Judges Cory Wilson, also a Trump appointee, and Leslie Southwick, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush.
    
            US District Judge James Wesley Hendrix had ruled in August 2022 that the guidance was “unauthorized.”
    
            In its lawsuit challenging the guidance, Texas argued that EMTALA does not give the federal government the authority to force health care providers to perform abortions. The law sets standards for the treatment emergency patients must receive at certain health care facilities and threatens civil penalties, as well as loss of the Medicare or Medicaid funding, for violations.

      Mother wanted for killing 2 of her children arrested in the United Kingdom, police say

            A Colorado mother suspected of killing two of her children and attempting to kill a third has been arrested in the United Kingdom, according to local police.
    
            Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Kimberlee Singler on murder and attempted murder charges after her 7-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter were found dead in a home and her 11-year-old daughter was sent to the hospital, CNN has reported. 
    
            Singler was arrested “without incident” at an unidentified location in the UK on Saturday, according to the Colorado Springs Police Department.
    
            “Detectives with the Colorado Springs Police Department’s homicide unit continue to work closely with multiple law enforcement agencies in pursuing the ongoing investigation,” the release says.
    
            The department said more information would be released about the arrest at a news conference at a later date.
    
            Police originally responded to Singler’s home on December 19th after receiving a 911 call about a burglary. When they arrived, they found her 7-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter dead, authorities said. They also found Singler and her surviving 11-year-old daughter, who were both taken to a hospital.
    
            Singler was originally considered a victim, based on the initial burglary report, but she became a suspect as the investigation unfolded, Colorado police previously told CNN. She was initially cooperative with police but then stopped cooperating and police were unable to get in contact with her.
    
            “Until we had probable cause we weren’t able to hold her for any reason,” Ira Cronin, public information officer at the Colorado Springs Police Department, previously told CNN.
    
            Her 11-year-old daughter was released from the hospital a few days after the incident. She is recovering from her injuries and is not with her mother, Cronin added.
    
            Singler faces four counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. The charges for each alleged crime were doubled due to the children being under the age of 12, according to a news release.

      Woman pregnant in each of her two uteruses gives birth to twins

            An Alabama woman with the rare condition of two uteruses, and who became pregnant in each uterus earlier this year, gave birth to twins last week a day apart.
    
            After a combined 20 hours of labor, Kelsey Hatcher gave birth to her third and fourth children, a set of rare twins, on Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, according to a news release from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital.
    
            Hatcher was induced at 39 weeks and throughout labor had twice the monitoring and twice the charting and was assigned two labor and delivery nurses, the release says.
    
            Baby A, named Roxi, was born vaginally at 7:45 p.m. on December 19.
    
            “There was a cheer from everyone in the room when the first baby was delivered, but there was another baby left,” Dr. Shweta Patel, Hatcher’s obstetrician, said in the news release. “Kelsey was essentially laboring in the left uterus while simultaneously undergoing the postpartum process in the right.”
    
            While having contractions with Baby B, Hatcher was already breastfeeding Baby A, Patel noted.
    
            And nearly 10 hours later, Baby B, named Rebel, was delivered by Cesarean section at 6:10 a.m. on December 20.
    
            “After such a long and crazy journey, it meant the world to see both of my girls together for the first time,” Hatcher said.
    
            According to doctors, the girls are technically twins despite having two different birthdays and being in two wombs during pregnancy.
    
            “I think it is safe to call the girls fraternal twins,” said Richard O. Davis, professor in the UAB Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and a doctor who co-managed Hatcher’s pregnancy.
    
            “At the end of the day, it was two babies in one belly at the same time. They just had different apartments,” Davis added.
    
            Case studies estimate the chances of pregnancy like this – a woman with two uteruses carrying a baby in each one at the same time – at around 1 in 2 billion in the general population, though it’s impossible to know for sure with something this infrequent.
    
            “Never in our wildest dreams could we have planned a pregnancy and birth like this, but bringing our two healthy baby girls into this world safely was always the goal, and UAB helped us accomplish that,” Hatcher said, “It seems appropriate that they had two birthdays, though. They both had their own ‘houses,’ and now both have their own unique birth stories.”
    
            Hatcher, who spoke to CNN earlier this year, was born with two uteruses, a condition called uterine didelphys.
    
            At her first ultrasound appointment, about eight weeks into pregnancy, things took an unexpected turn. The ultrasound technician quickly found the baby and told Hatcher everything looked perfect. The baby was healthy.
    
            Then Hatcher remembered to tell the tech that her anatomy was a little different.
    
            “So if you’re scanning and maybe catch a glimpse of it or something, don’t think it’s just something random or there’s something wrong. There is a totally separate uterus there,” said Hatcher.
    
            Hatcher said the ultrasound tech thanked her for letting her know and said she would just take a quick peek at the second uterus to make sure everything looked good.
    
            “And as soon as she moved the ultrasound wand over to the other side of my belly, I said, ‘Oh, my gosh! There’s another one.’”
    
            Hatcher didn’t even need to be told there was another baby. She could see it herself.
    
            “The nurse practitioner that I met with that day, she was just blown away. She said, ‘I’m not even sure what the statistics of this are,’ ” Hatcher recalled.
    
            Hatcher says she got lucky, in a way, because some women with uterine didelphys have only one working uterus; the other can’t support a pregnancy. But her medical records show that she has carried babies in both of hers, just never before at the same time.
    
            The unusual anatomy also had a visual difference. In certain positions, she had not just one baby bump but two, she said.
    
            When she lied in her recliner in the evening, “the girls will separate, almost, and you can see vividly the two separate wombs, because there’s a big gap in my stomach where they fall to one side or the other.”
    
            The odds are mind-boggling. About 3.6 million babies were born in the US last year, but only about 114,000 of those births were twins, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            In other words, about three sets of twins are born for every 200 live births, according to the CDC, and two of those sets are likely to be fraternal, which means they come from two separate fertilized eggs.
    
            Hatcher’s condition is rare, too: About 1 in 2,000 women is born with uterine didelphys.
    
            In order for her to become pregnant in both of her uteruses at the same time, two eggs had to be fertilized, one in each uterus.
    
            Like most women, Hatcher has two ovaries, the glands that store and release eggs. Each of her ovaries feeds a single uterus. Typically, ovaries take turns releasing eggs, sending one into the uterus each cycle for a chance at being fertilized. Occasionally, however, an ovary may release more than one egg during each cycle, a phenomenon called hyperovulation.
    
            Hyperovulation hasn’t been extensively researched, but one 2006 study of 500 women found that about 1 in 5 of them was able to hyperovulate. But even for those women, it doesn’t happen each cycle. When it does, sometimes a single ovary may release two eggs. And even more infrequently, both ovaries will release a single egg at the same time, which is what happened in Hatcher’s case.
    
            Hatcher was about seven times more likely to win a Powerball jackpot and about 131,000 times more likely to get hit by lightning at some point in her life.

      Opinion: A husband’s controversial remembrance of his wife left me with profound questions
    ","
			Opinion by Patricia Grisafi

    ","
            Who has the authority to write about the dead? The question is often reserved for celebrity exposes — tawdry digs into famous peoples’ addictions, quirks and proclivities in the bedroom. But with the recent publication of Blake Butler’s genre-defying book “Molly,” the question has shifted to how much should be revealed — especially because the subject is Butler’s wife, the writer and baker Molly Brodak, who died by suicide in 2020.
    
            I read “Molly” in a breathless weekend while entertaining my young children, so I spent a lot of time in the bathroom screaming “PRIVACY PLEASE” which became symbolic of the struggle taking place in the public conversation about the book. As I sat on the tiled floor against the claw-foot tub, I thought about whether anyone can truly be known, even to themselves.
    
            Where some people saw in “Molly” a gross violation of privacy, others saw grace and bravery, a willingness to make a “clean breast of it” as Arthur Schopenhauer famously wrote to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Butler had laid bare Brodak’s complex self, her joys and her transgressions without permission from a beloved no longer here to grant it. Had he violated her memory by doing so?
    
            In what seems almost a willful distortion of the humanity of Butler’s portrayal, social media users excoriated the book, some clearly without reading it. “Watching everyone celebrate what amounts to literary revenge porn against a mentally unwell woman who took her own life has me sick to my stomach,” one writer posted on X.
    
            Then there were the tabloids. They went right for the salacious stuff. The Daily Mail decided that it was important to emphasize that Brodak had sex with other people while she was married: “Famous poet Molly Brodak had a secret life as a ‘serial cheater’ who had affair with a student days after her wedding to author husband—and he only found out while preparing slideshow for her funeral after her suicide,” read the headline.
    
            Writers usually don’t receive the tabloid treatment, so “Molly” had ruffled feathers enough — something Butler told me was unexpected and grotesque. “I was shocked when the first tabloid hit. I was furious,” he said.
    
            But if some people considered “Molly” to be a hatchet job on Brodak, I couldn’t find the hatchet. I couldn’t even find malice, just gaping bewilderment and circles of grief.
    
            In the book, both Molly and Blake come across as flawed — this is not a work that sets the author up as a paragon of virtue and his subject as a she-devil. The real adversary is beyond both Molly and Blake’s grasp: “My enemy is silence,” Butler says, explaining he wanted to help end the generational trauma and abuse that plagued Brodak, not sensationalize her.
    
            He read widely while writing the book, especially the work of Annie Ernaux, trauma memoirs and Holocaust memoirs, as Brodak’s father — who later became a bank robber, as Brodak detailed in her own memoir, “Bandit” — had been conceived in a concentration camp. Brodak later visited the site of the camp while working on a book called “Alone in Poland.”
    
            Brodak was a voracious reader and intellect who revisited Sylvia Plath’s work before she died. I couldn’t help but draw connections between the two women’s posthumous treatment by the literary men in their lives. When Plath died by suicide in February 1963, she left a finished poetry manuscript on her desk. “Ariel” eventually ended up being a posthumous canonical work, a revolutionary expression of female rage and stunning lyricism.
    
            But the collection that was initially published was not Plath’s intended version. Her husband, Ted Hughes, had edited the book’s arrangement and eliminated poems that painted him in a less than flattering light.
    
            When the restored version of “Ariel” was later published in 2004, readers were finally able to see Plath’s full vision — a poetic journey that ended on the line “The bees are flying. They taste the spring,” instead of “While/From the bottom of the pool, fixed stars/Govern a life.” The original version was a narrative of rebirth; Hughes’ version was one that leaned into a bleak vision of suicide, this robbing Plath of literary agency and imposing his own mythology on her. As if that wasn’t egregious enough, Hughes claims that he “destroyed” Plath’s last journal so it could not be read.
    
            Butler didn’t want to do that to Brodak. “I would never want to control her legacy,” he told me. “I don’t want people underestimating her as an artist. I honor her as an artist, it’s been my goal from the beginning to make sure her work has a place in the conversation.”
    
            In a search for authenticity, Butler turns to passages from her journals that allow a spontaneous look into Brodak’s thoughts. He also quotes Brodak at length from her own poetry and her memoir. He includes her suicide note.
    
            Most significantly, he includes the last poem Brodak wrote, a stark meditation called “Camp,” referencing both the Holocaust and a child’s summertime rite of passage. In the book, Blake refuses to comment on the poem except that poetry had always saved her life, was “the only way she’d ever found to speak her truth.”
    
            In the book, Butler reflects on the conundrum of keeping Brodak’s privacy: “I’ve despaired over sharing these darker parts of Molly, the parts she hated herself for, and used against herself like cutting. Even writing it feels like transcribing a secret meant for silence. Should I be allowed to make this said? To bring to light a part of Molly’s story she covered over at any cost?”
    
            The uneasy answer Butler arrived at was yes — and “Molly” transcends because of this. Brodak comes across as alive on the page, a glimmering Gordian knot. She is determined to be heard but unable to find truth. She is multiplicity, fragmentation personified. Butler’s elegiac and philosophical excavation of her life is at times hard to read but it’s also hopeful — a protest against silence and the kinds of stories we tell about the dead.

      A woman who had a miscarriage is now charged with abusing a corpse as stricter abortion laws play out nationwide

            An Ohio woman who had sought treatment at a hospital before suffering a miscarriage and passing her nonviable fetus in her bathroom now faces a criminal charge, her attorney told CNN.
    
            Brittany Watts, 33, of Warren, has been charged with felony abuse of a corpse, Trumbull County court records show.
    
            “Ms. Watts suffered a tragic and dangerous miscarriage that jeopardized her own life. Rather than focusing on healing physically and emotionally, she was arrested and charged with a felony,” her attorney, Traci Timko, told CNN in an email.
    
            “Ms. Watts’ case is pending before the Trumbull County Grand Jury. I have advised her not to speak publicly until the criminal matter has resolved.”
    
            Though a coroner’s office report said the fetus was not viable and had died in the womb, Watts’ case highlights the extent to which prosecutors can charge a woman whose pregnancy has ended – whether by abortion or miscarriage.
    
            After last year’s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and the federal right to an abortion, a host of state trigger laws went into effect across the country that placed new restrictions or bans on abortion.
    
            In turn, some women carrying fetuses with fatal abnormalities have been barred from having an abortion in their home states. Other women with potentially life-threatening pregnancies have also been unable to get an abortion, as medical exemption clauses can be vague and medical providers fear severe legal consequences.
    
            When asked whether the charge against Watts may have been influenced by the repeal of Roe v. Wade, her attorney said ignorance is the main factor.
    
            “I believe that this charge stems from the lack of knowledge and/or insight that men have regarding the realities of miscarriage and women’s health in general,” Timko told CNN.
    
            “I don’t believe the fetal personhood issue was something they considered or found relevant. I believe this case demonstrates the need for education and showcases the sweep that the fetal personhood debate has even outside the context of abortion.”
    
            A prosecutor said Watts’ actions after passing the fetus are at the center of the case.
    
            “The issue isn’t how the child died, when the child died. It’s the fact that the baby was put into a toilet, large enough to clog up the toilet, left in that toilet, and she went on her day,” prosecutor Lewis Guarnieri said at preliminary hearing last month, according to footage from WKBN.
    
            Trumbull County Prosecutor’s Office spokesperson Guy M. Vogrin declined to comment on the case, telling CNN all cases at the grand jury level are secret proceedings under Ohio law. CNN has also reached out to the Warren Police Department for comment.
    
            Watts went to a hospital three times in four days due to vaginal bleeding, a report from the Trumbull County Coroner’s Office says.
    
            When she was first admitted to the Labor and Delivery Department at St. Joseph’s Hospital on September 19, “She was diagnosed with premature rupture of membranes and severe oligohydramnios,” the report states. In other words, her water had broken prematurely, and she had exceptionally low – if any – amniotic fluid.
    
            “Although a fetal heartbeat was found, it was recommended by medical staff that an induction occur of the nonviable fetus,” the coroner’s office report states.
    
            At the time, Watts’ pregnancy “was 21 weeks, 5 days gestation,” the report says. In Ohio, abortions are legal until fetal viability – which is generally considered to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. After viability, the state can legally restrict abortion access unless the patient’s life or health are at risk.
    
            However, “Brittany Watts signed herself out of the hospital against medical advice on 9/19/2013,” the coroner’s office report states. CNN has asked her attorney about why Watts may have left the hospital without having the nonviable fetus induced, as recommended by the medical staff.
    
            The next day, September 20, Watts returned “for the same issue and left against medical advice again,” the coroner’s office report states.
    
            Watts returned on September 20 expecting to be induced to deliver her preterm pregnancy, according to The Washington Post. But for hours doctors and officials mulled the ethics of inducing labor for a woman who had been diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), had no detectable amniotic fluid, was bleeding vaginally and had advanced cervical dilation, the Post reported. Watts eventually left.
    
            Then on September 22, Watts returned to the hospital “for vaginal bleeding with retained placenta after a home delivery,” the coroner’s office report states. “According to medical records, Brittany Watts stated that at approximately 5:58am … she delivered the fetus into the toilet of her residence.”
    
            The hospital staff notified the Warren Police Department, which responded to Watts’ home, the coroner’s office report says.
    
            CNN reached out to the hospital for comment about why staff notified police. Maureen Richmond, vice president of integrated communications at Mercy Health – a Catholic health care system that includes St. Joseph Warren Hospital – sent the following statement to CNN:
    
            “The safety and security of every patient who comes to us for care is our highest priority. Out of respect for patient privacy, we will not discuss individual specifics of care.
    
            According to the coroner’s office report, “Brittany stated to police that she had taken the fetus out of the toilet and placed in it a black bucket. She then told police that she put the remains near the garage in the back yard.”
    
            An investigator from the coroner’s office also responded to the scene. “Near the side of the garage, next to a large trash can, there was a pile of tissue, blood and what appeared to be paper towels in the weeds,” the coroner’s office investigator, Alaina Jamison, wrote in the report.
    
            When Warren police detectives were called out to investigate the scene, they discovered “the downstairs toilet was filled with blood,” the coroner’s office report says. “Looking into the toilet, it was filled to the brim with water, blood, blood clots and tissue.”
    
            The coroner’s investigator checked inside the toilet bowl and “felt what appeared to be a small foot with toes,” the investigator’s report says. The toilet was later broken apart by Warren police detectives, “and the fetus was retrieved,” the report states.
    
            An autopsy revealed the fetus’ cause of death was intrauterine fetal demise – meaning the fetus died inside the womb – due to severely low amniotic fluid from the premature rupture of membranes.
    
            Miscarriage is most common early in the first trimester, often before a woman knows she’s pregnant. It’s less common to naturally lose a fetus more than halfway through gestation – often known as stillbirth. About 21,000 stillbirths happen each year in the US – about 1 in 175 pregnancies, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Ohio law defines abuse of a corpse in somewhat subjective terms.
    
            “No person, except as authorized by law, shall treat a human corpse in a way that the person knows would outrage reasonable family sensibilities,” the law states. This kind of “abuse of a corpse” would be a second-degree misdemeanor.
    
            In addition, “No person, except as authorized by law, shall treat a human corpse in a way that would outrage reasonable community sensibilities,” the law says. A violation of these terms constitutes “gross abuse of a corpse” – a fifth-degree felony.
    
            However, “(t)here is no law in Ohio that requires a mother suffering a miscarriage to bury or cremate those remains,” Watts’ attorney said.
    
            “Women miscarry into toilets everyday,” Timko wrote in an email to CNN. “In fact, the Ohio Legislature has created broad immunity to women for acts or omissions during pregnancy and has admonished that women should ‘in no case’ be criminalized for the circumstances or outcomes of their pregnancies.”
    
            “The prosecution of Ms. Watts is tragic and unjust,” she wrote. “We will continue to fight.”
    
            Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights slammed the criminal charge against Watts, saying it would deter other women who suffer miscarriages from seeking medical help.
    
            “As citizens, we are outraged that the criminal justice system is being used to punish Ms. Watts who, like thousands of women each year, spontaneously miscarried a non-viable fetus into a toilet and then flushed,” the group said in an open letter to the Trumbull County prosecutor.
    
            “By seeking to indict her, you are clearly implying that anyone who miscarries at any point in pregnancy in our state must retrieve the fetal tissue whether they are at home, at work, at school, at a restaurant or other public place and preserve it until the tissue can be disposed of properly even though Ohio law does not define what a proper disposal method would be. … That fact alone renders your prosecution both unjust and ludicrous,” the letter says.
    
            “As physicians we are deeply concerned that your actions will deter women who miscarry from obtaining the medical attention they need and deserve.”

      Opinion: Supreme Court could hold fate of US democracy in its hands
    ","
			Opinion by Nicole Hemmer

  Published
        4:34 PM EST, Tue December 19, 2023
    ","
            The Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases in the coming term that could have a profound effect on the 2024 elections. The first, Fischer v. United States, has the potential to overturn scores of prosecutions related to the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The other, Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, could effectively make medication abortion unavailable throughout the United States, regardless of its legal status in individual states. Should the Court rule against the government in both cases, it would have profound consequences: the government’s efforts to hold insurrectionists accountable could be effectively erased, and FDA approval of pharmaceuticals could be rendered pointless. These would be monumental rulings that would sharply curtail the core functions of the federal government.
    
            Speculation aside about how the high court is likely to rule on these cases, the institution has in recent decades, broadly speaking, been an ally to the efforts to diminish democratic governance in the US. You can trace that to Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 presidential election, or Shelby County v. Holder, which dismantled much of the Voting Rights Act, or Citizens United, which opened the floodgates for unregulated corporate spending in elections. In recent years, those trends have only accelerated.
    
            It’s important to keep in mind how far back this trajectory goes, especially because of a certain kind of liberal wish-casting that has been popular in anti-Trump circles since 2017. From the early days of President Donald Trump’s administration, Americans concerned about his threat to democracy have soothed themselves with some version of “the courts will save us.”
    
            From the injunctions that stopped the first travel ban against people from Muslim-majority countries to the polls showing that a conviction in one of his four trials would cost Trump re-election, many Americans have clung to the belief that the law will work where norms have failed. Politicians might lie on the stump without consequences, but under oath they face the penalty of perjury.
    
            Norms may have withered away, but the law remains firm, with set rules and a commitment to impartiality. And even though plenty of writers have warned that the courts may not act as the magic bastion against illiberalism, as the 2024 election approaches, the impending Trump trials have kept alive the idea of the justice system as the deus ex machina that will save democracy.
    
            There is certainly evidence to back up some of these hopes. Judges and juries laughed the Trump team’s election cases out of court. In the two and a half years between the January 6 insurrection and October 2023, nearly 600 people charged for the Capitol attack pleaded guilty, and more than a hundred others were found guilty at trial. Seditious conspiracy prosecutions demonstrated that domestic terrorism could be successfully prosecuted as more than a series of lone-wolf attacks, and instead as a broader movement that could be dismantled and defanged.
    
            At the same time, the Supreme Court’s taking these particular cases at this specific moment in America’s political history is a stark reminder of what the nation’s highest court has done — and not done — since the turn of the 21st century when it comes to elections and the operations of democracy. These cases aren’t about abortion and January 6 alone; for this body, with its current conservative supermajority, to hear these arguments puts on the table the question of how government operates: how it protects the functions of democracy and secures basic rights. And for all the hopes that the law might succeed where norms have failed, there is no guarantee the courts will save us. In all likelihood, they will make it harder for us to save ourselves.
    
            The stakes of these cases may seem unrelated. After all, efforts to stop the electoral count and potentially overturn the election have little to do with FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. But both cases serve as a reminder that the future of liberal democracy remains precarious, and that the courts, far from being guardians of democratic governance, have been at the forefront of the project to advance illiberalism in the United States.
    
            Take Fischer, the January 6 case, which asks the Supreme Court to throw out convictions based on obstruction of official proceedings, which has been a key charge in the hundreds of prosecutions related to the attack on the Capitol. Even Trump himself faces prosecution under the statute as part of one of his upcoming trials.
    
            These prosecutions have been such a core component of the government response to the insurrection — and a vitally necessary one, that a broad majority of Republican officials refuse to denounce, investigate or even acknowledge the violent assault on Congress. The broad use of the statute, often just one of many charges against January 6 defendants, has provided not only consequences for involvement in the attack but evidence that large-scale prosecutions against domestic terrorism can be successful in court, an approach that prosecutors had avoided for decades after failed seditious conspiracy cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Should the Court overturn those prosecutions based on an unusually narrow and tendentious reading of the statute, it will deliver a blow not only to the January 6 cases but also to prosecutors’ willingness to attempt this type of broad conspiracy prosecution.
    
            The mifepristone case likewise poses a real threat to basic rights in the United States. The logic of the Dobbs decision, reinforced both by the majority opinion and Republican legislators, was that Dobbs did not outlaw abortion, but rather returned the decision about abortion’s legalities to the states, and thus the people. This premise, cloaked as an effort to extend democratic decision-making, has proven laughably false in the year and a half since Dobbs was handed down. While a ruling that effectively ended medication abortion for an extended period of time would almost certainly help Democrats in the 2024 elections, it would endanger the life and health of hundreds of thousands of pregnant Americans.
    
            Whenever abortion access appears on the ballot, voters turn out en masse to protect access to reproductive health care. That, in turn, has led Republican legislators to reach for any possible mechanism to overrule or thwart the will of the people they represent, from efforts to nullify elections that protect abortion rights, bar further ballot initiatives, or make it harder to amend state constitutions. Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator, summed up the party’s antidemocratic position after an Ohio referendum enshrined abortion rights in the state’s constitution: “Thank goodness that most of the states in this country don’t allow you to put everything on the ballot because pure democracies are not the way to run a country.”
    
            And on this, he is partially right. Basic rights shouldn’t be on the ballot; they should be protected by the Constitution and the courts. The only reason they’re on the ballot is because the court withdrew its protection for those basic rights. As it did, it has created space for lower courts to likewise abridge fundamental rights to bodily autonomy. That was the case in Texas, where Kate Cox, a pregnant woman carrying a fetus with fatal anomalies, was denied access to an abortion that could safeguard her ability to have children in the future. The Texas court ruled that she had not met the state’s strict standard for abortion access; the state’s attorney general quickly notified the state’s hospitals that if they provided Cox the necessary procedure, they would face prosecution. So much for courts as the bulwark of democracy.
    
            Courts have played a key role in accountability in the years since Trump’s election. But they are also at the forefront of the transition to illiberalism in the United States — something we cannot lose sight of as we enter 2024. Nor is it only the Supreme Court, with its attacks on voting rights and reproductive autonomy. An entire network of lawyers, attorneys general and judges are working to ease the path away from democratic governance in the United States. And while the courts may deliver some wins in the coming months, it’s important to remember that not only will institutions not save democracy, in many cases, they are actively working against it.

      Vice President Harris to kick off 2024 election year with ‘reproductive freedoms tour’
    ","

    ","
            Vice President Kamala Harris is launching a “reproductive freedoms tour” across the country in battleground Wisconsin next month, kicking off the 2024 election year with a focus on abortion, an issue the Biden campaign believes will be critical to mobilizing voters in November.
    
            Harris’ tour will start in Wisconsin – a general election battleground state – on January 22, the 51st anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision. The landmark ruling had established a federal constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability until the high court overturned it last year.
    
            Biden campaign officials view abortion as a key issue for general election voters heading into 2024 – and one where they have the upper hand, pointing to high turnout and enthusiasm among Democratic voters in recent elections.
    
            Abortion, Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told CNN, will be the “central pillar of the campaign moving forward,” and one that the president and his top surrogates will work to draw strong contrasts with former President Donald Trump. Harris has highlighted the issue since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, and the tour reflects her potency as a surrogate as women across the US grapple with a patchwork of tightening restrictions.
    
            Harris will travel “across the country” to hold a number of events bringing together “thousands of people” that will be announced soon, her office said.
    
            “I will continue to fight for our fundamental freedoms while bringing together those throughout America who agree that every woman should have the right to make decisions about her own body – not the government,” Harris said in a statement.
    
            A CNN poll conducted in November found that Americans align more with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on the issue of abortion.
    
            Harris is expected to highlight the true stories of American women affected by the Supreme Court’s decision.
    
            “She will host events that highlight the harm caused by these abortion bans while sharing stories of those who have been impacted,” her office said, and she will go on the offensive against “extremists” proposing a national abortion ban.
    
            Biden campaign officials have said that those personal stories are resonating with voters.
    
            “It’s critical that we continue to lift up these stories and really remind women what’s at stake in this election, and really the choice that they have before them,” campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said.

      Texas abortion case reveals conundrum facing Republicans in 2024
    ","
			By Eric Bradner, CNN

    ","
            Republican presidential contenders and endangered incumbents this past week were once again forced to answer complicated questions on abortion rights, as a Texas case demonstrated why the issue that dominated the 2022 and 2023 elections is poised to play a central role next year.
    
            The Texas Supreme Court on Monday denied Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, the right to end a pregnancy that she and her doctors said threatened her life and future fertility. The decision laid bare the political reality facing Republicans as they seek to navigate between their conservative anti-abortion base and a general electorate more supportive of abortion rights. As red states implement a patchwork of new restrictions on the procedure with untested exceptions, real-world events continue to muddle their efforts to stick to and sell to voters an effective message on the issue.
    
            The US Supreme Court’s decision last year to reverse Roe v. Wade’s long-standing federal guarantee of abortion rights saw nearly every Republican-controlled statehouse launch debates over whether and when in a pregnancy to outlaw abortion and which exceptions to allow. That’s led to a cascade of legal challenges testing the constitutionality and boundaries of those bans and renewed attacks from Democrats eager to paint Republicans as having undercut women’s health care.
    
            President Joe Biden’s campaign, citing the Texas case, said it plans to make abortion a key focus as it seeks to draw a contrast with the 2024 Republican front-runner.
    
            “We will make sure that the American people know that Donald Trump is to blame,” Biden campaign spokesman Michael Tyler told CNN. “If Trump is reelected, we will face the reality of a nightmare scenario – and that’s a national abortion ban.”
    
            Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear provided a template for his fellow Democrats with his reelection win in a deep-red state last month. His campaign aired an ad featuring a young woman who discussed the trauma of being raped and impregnated by her stepfather at age 12.
    
            “I’m speaking out because women and girls need to have options. Daniel Cameron would give us none,” 21-year-old Hadley Duvall said in the direct-to-camera ad, referring to Beshear’s Republican opponent.
    
            Meanwhile, the US Supreme Court’s decision this past week to take up another abortion-related case could also have political consequences next year. The justices will consider whether to restrict access to a widely used abortion drug – even in states where the procedure is still allowed. The case concerns the drug mifepristone, which – when coupled with another drug – is one of the most common abortion methods in the United States.
    
            That move sparked more concern from some Republicans, vulnerable New York Rep. Mike Lawler, who said the Supreme Court “needs to stand down.”
    
            On the 2024 presidential campaign trail, Republicans vying to become the main GOP alternative to Trump have attempted to carefully navigate a middle ground between the party base and general election voters.
    
            Asked about the Texas case at a CNN town hall Tuesday night, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed a six-week state abortion ban in April, said Republicans must “approach these issues with compassion, because these are very difficult issues.”
    
            Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has sought to sidestep questions about whether she would sign a federal abortion ban into law by pointing out the unlikelihood that such a prohibition could win passage in the Senate. She said Texas needs to revisit its approach to circumstances like what Cox faced.
    
            “This is exactly why I said you have to show compassion and humanize the situation. We don’t want any women to sit there and deal with a rare situation and have to deliver a baby in that sort of circumstance, any more than we want women getting an abortion at 37, 38, 39 weeks,” Haley said Tuesday while campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire.
    
            Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday in Bedford, New Hampshire, mocked the language Haley has used to answer such difficult questions.
    
            “She wouldn’t have answered your question. But she would give me the feeling that she cares. She really cares,” he said at a town hall.
    
            New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, whose recent endorsement of Haley was a major boon for the former South Carolina governor’s campaign, said Friday that the Texas case was “terrible.”
    
            “Lawmakers are going to have to go back in Texas and say we have to tweak this law because this is a problem, and I think we all agree that that shouldn’t happen,” Sununu told CNN
    
            The New Hampshire governor dismissed the possibility of an abortion ban at the federal level, defending Haley’s position.
    
            “Republicans might have 45 pro-life senators today. They will never have 60 pro-life senators ever,” he said, alluding to the votes needed to break a Senate filibuster. “It hasn’t happened in 100 years. So that’s beyond a hypothetical. So that’s not going to happen.”
    
            Christie, meanwhile, sharply criticized Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Trump-alilgned conservative who asked the state Supreme Court to reject Cox’s bid for an emergency abortion.
    
            The former New Jersey governor told the Associated Press that the Texas case demonstrates “why so many people don’t trust certain members of my party with this issue, because either they are completely unmovable on it, no matter what the facts are, or they say nice words but are unwilling to take a position.”
    
            Trump – whose appointment of three Supreme Court justices paved the way for Roe v. Wade’s repeal – has skipped the kind of engagement with voters and rivals that debates and town halls typically trigger. He has nonetheless in recent weeks portrayed many in the GOP as going too far on abortion.
    
            Meanwhile, abortion rights advocates will seek to replicate in 2024 the success of recent ballot measures. In November, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights. A year earlier, in the aftermath of Roe’s fall, the abortion rights side prevailed on ballot measures in states ranging from deep-blue California and Vermont to the swing state of Michigan to ruby-red Kansas, Kentucky and Montana.
    
            Now, abortion rights groups are pursuing similar efforts in a similar cross-section of states, including Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, South Dakota and Nebraska.
    
            Those referenda could shape the 2024 electoral outcomes in those states after a series of elections – including the previous ballot measures, a state Supreme Court election in Wisconsin earlier this year, Beshear’s reelection in Kentucky and state legislative races in Virginia this fall – demonstrated that moderate voters are broadly supportive of abortion rights.
    
            A coalition of Florida abortion rights supporters said Friday it is on track to gather enough signatures to place a constitutional amendment on next year’s ballot.
    
            The Florida Division of Elections reports that the group, Floridians Protecting Freedom, has gathered 753,305 of the 891,523 signatures it needs to qualify for the ballot ahead of a February 1 deadline.
    
            “We don’t want to be overconfident, but we’re feeling as positive as we can feel at this point in the campaign,” said Lauren Brenzel, the group’s campaign director. “We want to make sure that we get as many signatures in as we can.”
    
            The ballot summary of the proposed amendment, which would require 60% of the vote to be approved, says: “No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.”
    
            However, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, has asked the state Supreme Court – where five of the seven members were appointed by DeSantis – to kill the amendment. Moody argued that proponents did not define the word “viability” and are attempting to “hoodwink” voters.
    
            In Florida, the state Supreme Court is separately set to rule on a 15-week abortion ban. If that law is upheld, then a six-week ban – which DeSantis signed into law in April to replace the previous 15-week prohibition – would take effect.
    
            It’s the law DeSantis defended at his CNN town hall, noting the limited exceptions it allows for in cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.
    
            “I have signed legislation that included that. And I understand they’re very difficult. And these things get a lot of press attention, I understand,” he said. “But that’s a very small percentage that those exceptions cover. There’s a lot of other situations where we have an opportunity to realize really good human potential. And we’ve worked to protect as many lives as we could in Florida.”
    
            Brenzel argued that exceptions for situations such as cases of sexual assault and pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother “aren’t sensible. They aren’t based on any kind of best-care guidelines.”
    
            Brenzel pointed to the Texas case in an interview, saying it “continues to highlight what a dangerous situation is being created.”
    
            Florida, she said, has already seen similarly horrifying cases. She pointed to Deborah Dorbert, whose son Milo, who was born with no kidneys, died in her arms after she was unable to get an abortion.
    
            She also pointed to Anya Cook, a Florida woman who was sent home from a hospital with a rare and potentially life-threatening complication. She then delivered her nearly 16-week fetus and, over the course of a day, lost nearly half the blood in her body, The Washington Post reported, citing medical records.
    
            “When you let politicians intervene in private medical decisions,” Brenzel said, “this is what happens.”
    
            CNN’s Arit John, Manu Raju, Alison Main and David Wright contributed to this report.

      Abby Phillip: How I wound up giving birth at home
    ","
			Opinion by Abby Phillip
		;Abby Phillip","
  Updated
        3:30 PM EST, Sat December 16, 2023
    ","
            It was a little after 6 p.m. on Sunday, August 15, 2021, and things were about to get real. The mild discomfort I had been feeling for days was suddenly noticeable enough to stop me in my tracks: I was in labor.
    
            My husband, mother and I jumped into action. I insisted on cooking a meal — I had to keep busy, and I refused to be hungry while giving birth. As I stirred a pot of pasta and chopped up vegetables, I fell into a routine. Every 7 or 8 minutes, I stepped away from the kitchen and found a quiet place to breathe through the contractions.
    
            Within a few hours, I was in my bedroom, lights dimmed. I sat on a birthing ball, swayed through the pain and pressure as each contraction gripped my body and prepared to give birth at home.
    
            If this were a movie, it would be the moment the record scratches, and I look straight to camera, saying, “You’re probably wondering how I ended up here.” Never in a million years would I have thought that I — a huge believer in modern medicine and someone who takes no unnecessary risks with my health — would end up giving birth at home.
    
            So, what happened? Let me explain.
    
            I became pregnant with my first child in late 2020, as a global pandemic was raging. It was a scary time to be pregnant, or anywhere near a hospital. Layered on top of all that was my fear that I would not make it out of childbirth alive. I had somehow come to view childbirth, something as old as humankind, as a life-threatening event.
    
            I can’t tell you exactly when this became such a deep-seated fear for me, but my anxiety would ratchet up dramatically at the thought of being in a hospital, unable to advocate for myself. That fear was compounded early on in my pregnancy, when I was ignored and dismissed by my doctor’s office — so much so that I left that practice and went searching for better care.
    
            Even when I found another doctor, those visits felt perfunctory and isolating. I was repeatedly asked whether I had any questions during the brief 30-minute visits. And I did. But I would realize later, as a first-time mother, I often didn’t know what I didn’t know. I hesitated to bring up my experiences and discomfort, unsure whether they were worth mentioning or indicative of more serious problems.
    
            To allay my fears, I dove deep, spending months researching the quality of hospitals, different birthing practices and studies about the pros and cons of various medical interventions. I studied C-section rates and induction rates, and found that many of the most sought out hospitals where I lived had some of the highest rates of medical interventions. Ultimately, I was trying to find evidence that I would be safe somewhere or that I would be supported in making the choices that were best for me.
    
            Without question, part of my fear about being pregnant stemmed from statistics that I was all too familiar with as a journalist: Black women are 2 to 3 times more likely to die in childbirth than White women in America, regardless of socioeconomic status.
    
            And while modern medicine has decreased maternal mortality around the world, the numbers are moving in the wrong direction here in the United States. I couldn’t understand how, in one of the most developed nations in the world, women like me are dying more frequently.
    
            The situation worsened during the pandemic, when there were many stories about how Covid-19 had adversely impacted the health care system. One horror story stuck in my mind: A 26-year old Bronx woman died during childbirth just days after tweeting about concerns she had with the hospital where she was receiving care.
    
            A toxic mix of Covid-era health care breakdowns and the longstanding disparities in care for Black women apparently combined to create a horror story for her family — and there are countless stories like hers. Stories like April Valentine’s.
    
            April was a 31-year-old, college-educated Black woman in Los Angeles who knew the statistics and thought she had done all she could to keep herself alive. I spent time with her partner Nigha and her daughter Aniya in Los Angeles recently.
    
            Her family told me that when April was admitted to the hospital, she was denied access to her doula and ignored when she complained of pain in her leg throughout labor. That pain ultimately was a sign of deadly blood clots that eventually took her life.
    
            Every woman has a different set of priorities when thinking about the experience of giving birth. Some want an epidural as soon as possible, others want a spa-like environment and still others need C-sections and the benefits of modern medicine. Those choices, no matter what they are, deserve to be respected.
    
            I wanted a childbirth experience as free from unnecessary medical intervention as possible. I believed, and a good deal of medical evidence suggests, that it would be the safest thing for me and my child. But I came to believe that it would be too difficult to achieve that in a hospital.
    
            I quickly reached a conclusion that increasing numbers of Black women are coming to: Finding safety in childbirth in America is not as simple as going to a hospital.
    
            Midwife-attended births in the US have been on the rise, going from about 1% of births in 1980 to around 12% in 2020. Midwives are trained to deliver babies and can provide care both in and outside a hospital setting. But as many of them have told me, their model of care is centered on minimizing intervention for most mothers who have low risk pregnancies and providing more holistic support to women during pregnancy and childbirth.
    
            Something else happened during the pandemic. The number of Black women opting out of hospital births surged. From 2019 to 2020, it increased by 36%. The following year, it went up by another 21%.
    
            It turns out, I was part of that statistic.
    
            What I learned was that my home birth wouldn’t be just about where I gave birth, but about how. It was about a model of care centered around the full picture of my life and health.
    
            My midwife, Aza Nedhari, came to my home for examinations that lasted an hour or more. I sat comfortably on my couch while she asked questions about every facet of my life: from how much water I was drinking to how much stress I was experiencing.
    
            I realized quickly that she wasn’t just checking that my baby’s heartbeat was still present. Her job was to ensure that I stayed on a path to a healthy pregnancy. I felt seen, heard and more empowered. Eventually, my fear began to subside. It was replaced by excitement and joy for the arrival of my daughter — emotions that I had struggled to access earlier because of how worried I had been about surviving pregnancy and childbirth.
    
            My labor, all 12 hours of it, went by quickly. And yes, there was pain. I was free to move around my home, free to use water, nature’s pain relief, to help manage the discomfort. No one told me when to push or how quickly. I could eat and drink freely, small comforts denied to many women in a hospital setting.
    
            There were no beeping monitors or parades of strangers walking in and out of the room. And perhaps best of all, I was in my own home — literally in my own bed — surrounded by a team of people, including my midwife, my mom, my husband and my wonderful doula, all focused intently on helping me and my body do what it knows how to do — on my terms and at my pace.
    
            After my daughter was born, I experienced excessive bleeding, known as a postpartum hemorrhage. Aza and her team, trained in managing these complications, quickly stopped the bleeding. It happened so quickly, I barely noticed it. I felt confident that we had a plan to manage challenges like those. I joke now that those first hours after childbirth were the best I had felt in nine months.
    
            So many moms I know felt left to their own devices after delivering their child. It was the opposite for me. In the days after I gave birth, my midwife returned to our home multiple times to check on our family. She provided breastfeeding support and evaluated me for any post-partum complications, which account for 60% of deaths related to childbirth in the United States. Even when she wasn’t there, she was a phone call or a text away.
    
            By the end of my journey, I was a different person than the woman who had that first, nervous meeting with her midwife just a few weeks earlier. I realized that the core of the midwifery model of care is that I am not a passive actor in my health, but an active participant. I learned how to listen to my body, in part because my midwife asked probing questions and took the time to listen to my pregnancy experience every time she visited. I learned to listen for my baby’s heartbeat and identify her position in my belly. With my doula, I practiced body positions that would help me manage the pain during labor and make the labor process more efficient, without the help of drugs.
    
            I couldn’t help but imagine what it could be like if more women had access to care like this. But even though giving birth at home or at a birth center is less expensive than a three-day hospital stay or a surgery, insurance typically doesn’t cover it – leaving families to cover the cost themselves.
    
            Organizations like Kindred Space LA, a Black-owned birthing center and midwifery practice in Los Angeles, are trying to find more ways to bring holistic, community-centered care to more patients through small group care, grants and subsidies for families that need it.
    
            This model of care is not for everyone, of course. It would not have been possible for me if I had a higher-risk pregnancy. But it was an option that suddenly I wished more people knew was available to them.
    
            Ultimately, what led me to give birth to my daughter at home was my determination to move beyond my fear. I emerged hopeful that there were solutions out there that can save lives. What would happen if women were allowed to truly embrace choice in their care? What would happen if midwives, doulas and doctors worked in concert to keep more women and babies alive without the stigma? What would happen if Black women’s birth stories were not tales of trauma but of joy?
    
            The cause of this deadly racial disparity in maternal health is complicated. Health disparities, racism and lack of access to high quality care all contribute, experts say. The solution must be multi-faceted and centered on care — not just medicine.
    
            The women who I met as I explored this maternal health crisis in America come from all different backgrounds. But they’re fighting to be heard. They’re fighting for their health. They’re fighting to reclaim childbirth as a moment that should be accompanied by the joy of bringing new life into the world, not the fear of what could be if the worst happens.

      Texas abortion law’s wording is causing dangerous confusion over emergency medical exceptions, critics say

            Emergency medical exceptions to the Texas abortion ban are extremely rare, and experts say the law leaves medical providers with their hands tied and puts patients at risk.
    
            The Texas Supreme Court, comprised of nine Republicans, on Monday ruled against a woman seeking an abortion under the “medical emergency” exception to Texas’ near-total abortion ban, placing the law, which went into effect in 2022, under intense national scrutiny.
    
            Thirty-one-year-old Kate Cox sought an abortion after learning her fetus had a fatal condition and her life and future fertility could be at risk without the procedure. Her doctor said she believed in good faith that the abortion was medically necessary. After a state judge ruled she could terminate her pregnancy, the case went to the Texas Supreme Court, which ruled against Cox.
    
            By the time that ruling was made, Cox had already left the state to obtain an abortion elsewhere, her attorneys said.
    
            The “medical emergency” statute in Texas – which went into effect after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade – allows for an abortion only if the mother has a “life-threatening” condition while pregnant or is at “serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” 
    
            After the state Supreme Court ruling, Molly Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, argued that the case is proof that proposed exceptions to abortion bans don’t work.
    
             “If Kate can’t get an abortion in Texas, who can?” Duane said in a statement.
    
            Thirty-four abortions were performed in the state as of September 15 this year, data from Texas Health and Human Services shows. All were performed in a hospital, as opposed to a clinic or a doctor’s office. All were performed both because of a “medical emergency” and to “preserve the health of the pregnant woman,” the data notes.
    
            In 2020, the last full year before Texas put in place its most severe restrictions on access to abortion, 53,949 abortions were performed in the state, according to the health department. Of those, less than 1% were performed in a hospital. The data shows the number of abortions declining in the following years.
    
            In September 2021, the state law banning abortion after six weeks went into effect. At the time it was one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, outlawing the procedure at a stage when many do not yet know they are pregnant.
    
            In 2022, the data shows 17,212 abortions, most of which were performed before Roe v. Wade was overturned on June 24, triggering a complete ban on abortion in the state, except those intended to protect the life of the mother. Less than 1% of those were performed in a hospital.
    
            That year, the health department listed 33 of the 17,212 abortions as being due to a medical emergency and to preserve the pregnant person’s health.
    
            The state Supreme Court ruling left many asking: If Cox’s case doesn’t constitute a medical emergency, what does?
    
            “There is no clear definition in the statute,” said Sonia Suter, a professor of law at George Washington University who specializes in medical ethics and reproductive rights.
    
            “Part of the problem is trying to define an exception for a medical profession in a statute that doesn’t necessarily rely on medical terms,” Suter said. “You’re almost speaking two different languages.”
    
            The fact that all of the 34 abortions recorded in Texas this year were performed in hospitals, as opposed to less than 1% in previous years, suggests that exceptions are being made only in the most dire cases, when a pregnant person is dying or in imminent risk of death, Suter said.
    
            Reproductive health advocates say those 34 cases don’t represent the full scope of Texans who need abortion care to preserve their lives and health.
    
            Rates of severe maternal morbidity, or unexpected complications of labor and delivery that can have significant acute or long-term consequences to a woman’s health, have increased in the US from 2008 to 2021, according to research published by the medical journal JAMA.
    
            About 2,200 infants died in Texas in 2022, an 11.5% jump from the year before, according to Texas Department of State Health Services data. The spike reversed a nearly decadelong decline in infant deaths, CNN previously reported.
    
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists filed an amicus brief in support of Cox’s case, citing its concerns.
    
            “The inability of clinicians in Texas to provide essential reproductive health care, starkly presented in this case, will increase existing disparities in health outcomes for Texas residents, exacerbate the shortage of qualified health care providers and worsen the maternal mortality rate in Texas, which is already at crisis levels,” the group wrote.
    
            Maternal death rates soared in Texas between 1999 and 2019, according to a study published in JAMA.
    
            “This is harming countless Texans who are pregnant or might one day become pregnant – whether or not they ever seek abortions or experience a serious obstetrical complication,” the brief read.
    
            “Life threatening – well, what does it mean to threaten your life?” said Suter. “Is a one percent risk enough? Two percent? Eighty percent? How great does the risk have to be?”
    
            The Texas Supreme Court claimed its ruling provides some clarity around the legal standards and called on the Texas Medical Board to provide more guidance on the “medical emergency” exception to the abortion ban.
    
            “The courts cannot go further by entering into the medical-judgment arena,” the court stated in its opinion. “The Texas Medical Board, however, can do more to provide guidance in response to any confusion that currently prevails.”
    
            The board has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    
            A separate case pending before the Texas Supreme Court is demanding clarity on what is included under the exception.
    
            Providers, courts and medical authorities have been unable to provide clarity on the exception – and some argue that’s by design.
    
            “The vagueness may not be a bug, but a feature,” said Suter. “Look at the numbers – abortions are not happening. If that’s your primary goal, then you want it to be an exception that looks good on paper but that actually chills the provision of abortions.”
    
            Proponents of the state’s abortion ban argue that the law can’t outline every possible medical emergency, and doctors have the power to make the final decision about whether a person needs an abortion to preserve their life or major bodily functions.
    
            Those who are calling for more clarity around the law say Cox’s case revealed cracks in that argument.
    
            Because there is no uniform guidance on what falls within the exception, every doctor who authorizes or facilitates an abortion in Texas could have their “reasonable medical judgment” challenged, leaving them vulnerable to civil or criminal charges, or having their medical license challenged, Suter said.
    
            Before Cox’s case went to the state’s Supreme Court, a county judge granted a temporary restraining order allowing her physician, Dr. Damla Karsan, to facilitate an abortion under the state’s medical emergency exception.
    
            In response, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent an open letter to three hospitals where Karsan holds privileges, threatening potential first degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of $100,000 for each violation if they allowed Karsan to provide the abortion at their facilities.
    
            The temporary restraining order, Paxton warned, “will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws.”
    
            “We remind you that the (temporary restraining order) will expire long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas’ abortion laws expires,” he added. Paxton named both Karsan and Cox in the letter.
    
            Earlier this year, reproductive health advocates set up a legal defense network to help doctors providing abortion care.
    
            “There’s a serious problem when you are imposing this kind of criminal penalty on somebody who doesn’t know they’re violating the law, because there’s so many different ways to interpret it,” Suter said.

      Woman accuses Boston fertility doctor of secretly inseminating her with his own sperm in lawsuit spurred by DNA kit discovery
    ","

        9:33 PM EST, Thu December 14, 2023
    ","
            More than 40 years after a couple sought the help of a Boston, Massachusetts, fertility specialist, their daughter discovered through a purchased DNA kit that the doctor is her biological father, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court District of Massachusetts.
    
            The suit alleges Dr. Merle Berger secretly used his own sperm to inseminate the mother, Sarah Depoian, in 1980.
    
            “This is an extreme violation,” Depoian said in a statement released by her attorney, Adam Wolf. “I am still struggling to process it. I trusted Dr. Berger fully. We thought he would act responsibly and ethically. I will never fully recover from his violation of me.”
    
            At the time, Depoian was told by Dr. Berger — one of the founders of Boston IVF and a former Harvard Medical School professor — that the sperm used in the insemination would be from a medical resident “who resembled her husband” and “whom she did not know,” according to the complaint.
    
            But instead, Dr. Berger used his own sperm to inseminate Depoian, the complaint alleges.
    
            “Dr. Berger secretly inserted his own sperm into his patient, Sarah Depoian. He did so without her consent and against her wishes,” Depoian’s attorney Wolf said in a news release.
    
            Depoian’s daughter Carolyn found out Dr. Berger was her father after she purchased DNA kits last year from Ancestry.com and 23andMe, according to court documents.
    
            The results showed that she was related to Dr. Berger’s granddaughter and Dr. Berger’s second cousin, the lawsuit alleged. She later pieced it all together after talking to “one of her newfound relatives,” the complaint alleged.
    
            “To say I experienced shock when I figured this out would be an extreme understatement,” Carolyn said in the statement. “It feels like reality has shifted. I just want to say how proud I am of my mom for speaking out, and I’m honored to stand by her side.”
    
            After learning what had happened, Depoian reached out through her attorney to Dr. Berger, who didn’t deny that she consented only to insemination with a donor’s sperm who didn’t know her, and whom she didn’t know, according to the complaint.
    
            CNN affiliate WCVB obtained a statement from Berger’s legal team denying the allegations.
    
            “Dr. Merle Berger was a pioneer in the medical fertility field who in 50 years of practice helped thousands of families fulfill their dreams of having a child,” according to the statement. “He is widely known for his sensitivity to the emotional anguish of the women who came to him for help conceiving. The allegations concern events from over 40 years ago, in the early days of artificial insemination. At a time before sperm banks and IVF, it was dramatically different from modern-day fertility treatment.”
    
            The statement said, “The allegations, which have changed repeatedly in the six months since the plaintiff’s attorney first contacted Dr. Berger, have no legal or factual merit, and will be disproven in court.”
    
            CNN has reached out to Dr. Berger for comment but has yet to hear back.
    
            Boston IVF told CNN in a statement that the incident happened before they existed.
    
            “We recently learned that Dr. Merle Berger was named in a lawsuit,” the company said. “This matter occurred more than 40 years ago which was prior to Dr. Berger’s employment at BostonIVF and, in fact, before our company existed. We wish to highlight that the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility is much different than it was decades ago, and the safety measures and safeguards currently in place would make such allegations virtually impossible nowadays. Patients should be assured that our field continues to uphold the most rigorous ethical and medical standards.”
    
            Dr. Berger retired from Boston IVF in 2020, according to WCVB.

      Top Justice Department official on police reform and abortion to leave

            Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta is leaving the Justice Department after three years overseeing some of the administration’s most contentious legal issues ranging from protecting abortion rights to criminal and police reform efforts, according to the department.
    
            Gupta is the first woman of color and first civil rights attorney to hold the Justice Department’s No. 3 post, which oversees the department’s civil litigation sections including antitrust enforcement, as well as the Civil Rights and the Environmental and Natural Resources divisions.
    
            Her departure early next year is expected to come after the Justice Department completes its critical incident review of the law enforcement response to the May 2022 mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas. In a statement to CNN, Attorney General Merrick Garland thanked Gupta for her work and for being one of his trusted advisers.
    
            “Vanita’s commitment to the pursuit of justice, and her relentless focus on bringing people together to find common ground, has made her an incredibly effective leader in dealing with some of the most complex challenges facing the American people,” Garland said. “Vanita has played an essential role in our work to fulfill DOJ’s mission to uphold the rule of law, keep our country safe, and protect civil rights. … I am confident that her enormous contributions to the Department will continue to be felt long after her departure.”
    
            Gupta is credited with helping to oversee major legal settlements in tort cases brought against the federal government by victims in mass shootings, including at Sutherland Springs, Parkland and the Charleston Mother Emanuel AME Church. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe vs. Wade last June, she helped establish the Justice Department’s Reproductive Rights Task Force. As the chair of the task force, Gupta is leading the push to scrutinize legal threats to reproductive health rights, including suing the state of Idaho for restricting access to abortion to patients who need lifesaving medical treatment and fighting to protect access to the widely used abortion drug mifepristone.
    
            Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, credited Gupta with juggling “so many issues that are directly affecting people’s lives.”
    
            “That’s a lot of work. That’s a lot of weight,” Wiley said. “And what she brought to it was not only the commitment to withstand that weight, but to carry it. And in some instances, importantly, tocarry it over the finish line.” Gupta’s work as a civil rights lawyer appeared to cut against the grain when major police groups rallied to support her nomination as associate attorney general, helping to overcome objections from Senate Republicans. For years, Gupta has been a constant at police conventions, sometimes enduring hostile audiences as she argued for policing reforms. During her time leading civil rights enforcement in the Obama administration, Gupta launched pattern or practice investigations of police forces in Baltimore and Chicago. Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, the nation’s largest police union, said Gupta managed to gain the confidence of officers in those cities despite investigating them. “She will go toe to toe. She does it in a very civil way, and not back down an inch. And she gains respect,” Pasco said. “I told her one time she can talk a dog off a meat wagon.” Confirmed just one day after former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of killing George Floyd in 2021, Gupta stepped into office as Americans were reckoning with what many saw as flawed systems of policing.  That feeling was further bolstered when, one year later, police failed to quickly respond to a deadly rampage at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, when a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers and remained in the school for more than an hour while officers waited nearby. In response, Gupta helped lead the Justice Department push for better strategies to build trust between police and the communities they serve. One of those efforts was to revamp a departmentpolice reform program that offered voluntary federal help to local law enforcement agencies in reducing officer-involved shootings and excessive-force incidents. The Justice Department review in Uvalde one that Gupta helped engineer with Mayor DonMcLaughlin. The botched police response had prompted pressure from victim families for federal action, but Biden administration officials were confronted with limited jurisdiction to investigate anda state government that has repeatedly sued the federal government. McLaughlin told CNN he personally called Gupta, because he didn’t trust the state to investigate its own response. “Was she surprised when you said, ‘OK, I’m gonna have you come in?’” CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz asked McLaughlin of Gupta. “I want the truth of this to come out,” McLaughlin responded. “If there’s one thing that was done wrong with that deal that we can tell some other community so they can correct that, we need toknow, and they need to know.” The department review is ongoing, and investigators have analyzed more than 13,000 pieces of evidence connected to the massacre and police response, and have interviewed more than 200 people, including law enforcement officers, family members, school personnel and witnesses.
    
            CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz and Matthew Friedman contributed to this report.

      An abortion rights horror story explains the new reality for some American women
    ","
			Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN
		","
  Published
        12:00 AM EST, Thu December 14, 2023
    ","
            The post-Roe v. Wade landscape for American women includes the term “court-ordered abortion” due to a troubling case in Texas, consideration of a Civil War-era abortion law in Arizona and the US Supreme Court announcing it would revisit the issue for the first time since removing nationwide abortion rights last year.
    
            There are very different realities for women across the country:
    
            ► A Texas woman’s horror story raised serious questions about whether women who need life-saving exceptions to abortion bans can actually obtain them.
    
            The woman, 31-year-old Kate Cox, had to flee the state, which has one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, to end a pregnancy where the fetus had a fatal condition. Her doctor said it would jeopardize her life and future fertility. The state’s Republican-dominated Supreme Court wanted more guidance from the state’s medical board before granting an exception.
    
            ► Lawyers for a woman who is the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit challenging Kentucky’s six-week abortion ban said her pregnancy is no longer viable, which could call the lawsuit into question.
    
            ► Abortion rights opponents argued before Arizona’s Supreme Court in favor of reverting to an 1864 law that predates Arizona’s statehood and could send abortion providers to prison.
    
            ► In New Mexico, which has a more liberal abortion law, the state Supreme Court is considering whether to strike down local restrictions at the city and county levels.
    
            ► Michigan’s governor signed a new law to do away with restrictions on abortion rights and no longer require women to obtain a special abortion rider in their health insurance plans.
    
            ► At the national level, the US Supreme Court agreed to consider whether to restrict the access of every American woman to mifepristone, the long-approved medication behind most early term US abortions.
    
            Court whisperers say that case may not, as many American women worried when they read the headlines, jeopardize access to the medication, which has been safely used in conjunction with another drug as an abortion method for nearly a quarter century.
    
            The details of that case get complicated and include multiple Food and Drug Administration actions since 2000. Biden administration lawyers have argued the anti-abortion rights doctors who brought the case lack standing because they don’t themselves prescribe the drugs or perform abortions.
    
            Read CNN’s report on the court’s decision to hear the case.
    
            It’s most likely “the case will be resolved on procedural grounds that won’t have any direct effect on access to mifepristone going forward,” Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas Law School, told CNN’s Devan Cole and Ariane de Vogue.
    
            CNN’s Supreme Court biographer Joan Biskupic writes this analysis of the court’s move: “The most personal choices of women (with their physicians) are now litigated in courtrooms, alongside new policy dilemmas, such as over government’s approval of mifepristone.” She adds that the federal government is also challenging Idaho’s near total abortion ban based on its reading of Medicare law.
    
            Texas and Idaho are two of the 14 states in which abortion is essentially banned. But even in red states, voters have taken the opposite direction of GOP-dominated legislatures.
    
            CNN’s Deidre McPhillips reported on a steep rise in the number of women – up to 20% of women seeking abortions in the US – traveling in order to obtain care.
    
            She writes: “Nearly three-quarters of the abortions in New Mexico were provided to people who had traveled across state lines, according to the new data from the Guttmacher Institute. More than 8,200 people from out of state had an abortion in New Mexico in the first half of 2023. Only Illinois and North Carolina saw more out-of-state patients.”
    
            Cox’s nightmare in Texas was the kind of relatable story that had even abortion opponents treading carefully.
    
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban in his state, but said the law, which is under review by the state’s Supreme Court, is different than the one in Texas. DeSantis tried to exude compassion for Cox.
    
            “If you’re in that situation as a mother, that’s an incredibly difficult thing to have to deal with,” he said during CNN’s Iowa town hall on Tuesday. “We’ve got to approach these issues with compassion, because these are very difficult issues.”
    
            DeSantis is challenging former President Donald Trump, who remains the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. Trump has criticized the six-week abortion ban in Florida as too strict.
    
            Meanwhile, President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, already anticipating a Trump GOP primary victory, is honing its argument that Trump is to blame for the chaos that has resulted from a conservative-dominated Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            CNN’s Betsy Klein writes: “As the campaign begins to highlight more contrasts with Trump, it will continue efforts to amplify the politically potent issue, with communications director Michael Tyler telling CNN it will be a ‘central pillar of the campaign moving forward’ compared to Trump’s ‘unpopular and toxic agenda.’”
    
            Abortion rights are also likely to appear on multiple ballots in 2024, according to CNN’s Arit John. After voters in Ohio recently voted to protect abortion rights in that state, and voters in Virginia rejected Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s plan to push a 15-week abortion ban by putting the legislature under the control of Democrats, there are more efforts to get abortion measures on the ballot, including in Florida, John notes.
    
            The initiative process there, unlike in many states, requires a supermajority of 60% of voters to approve a measure that would amend the state’s constitution. Voters reached that threshold when they legalized medical marijuana and raised the state’s minimum wage in recent years.
    
            There are also efforts to get abortion questions on the ballot in the battleground states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. These efforts could further alter a fast-changing landscape.

      Mother wrongly jailed for 20 years over the death of her four children has convictions quashed
    ","

    ","
            An Australian mother who spent two decades in prison after she was wrongly found guilty of killing her four children had her convictions formally quashed Thursday, as her lawyers called for legal reform and “substantial” compensation.
    
            Kathleen Folbigg was pardoned and freed in June on the recommendation of retired judge Tom Bathurst, who re-examined all the evidence put to her 2003 trial and found “reasonable doubt” as to her guilt.
    
            But clearing her name required a formal ruling by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, and on Thursday, a panel of judges agreed she should be acquitted of all charges, concluding one of the country’s most prominent miscarriages of justice.
    
            Outside the court, an emotional Folbigg thanked supporters who worked tirelessly to convince the NSW government and legal system that new scientific evidence warranted closer scrutiny of her convictions.
    
            “The time this has taken in seeing today’s result has cost many people a lot,” Folbigg said, as she stood beside her lawyers and closest friends. “I hoped and prayed that one day I would be able to stand here with my name cleared.”
    
            Folbigg was jailed in 2003 on three counts of murder and one of manslaughter following the deaths of her four babies over a decade from 1989.
    
            No physical proof was submitted that she had killed them, but the jury was convinced that the chances of all four dying from natural causes was so unlikely that it must have been murder. Certain passages in her diary were also interpreted as admissions of guilt.
    
            As recently as 2019, an inquiry into her convictions found there was “no reasonable doubt” she had committed the crimes. But another inquiry began in 2022 after scientists discovered a previously unknown mutant gene in her two daughters that could have been fatal.
    
            The evidence provided a genetic explanation for the children’s deaths, which created “reasonable doubt” about her convictions, and enough to convince a judge to recommend her pardon.
    
            Folbigg’s first baby Caleb died in 1989, followed by Patrick in 1991, Sarah in 1993 and finally Laura in 1999.
    
            The first three deaths were initially attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a term used when babies under 1 die for no apparent reason.
    
            At 18 months, Laura was the longest lived of Folbigg’s children, and police began investigating after a forensic pathologist marked the cause of her death as “undetermined.” She was charged and convicted as newspaper headlines declared her to be “Australia’s worst serial killer.”
    
            For decades, Folbigg languished in prison despite acquittals in similar cases in the United Kingdom that had also relied on “Meadow’s law,” the false maxim pushed by discredited British pediatrician Roy Meadow that one sudden infant death in a family is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder.
    
            On Thursday, Chief Justice Andrew Bell said the appeals court judges agreed with Bathurst’s findings that “substantial and extensive body of new scientific evidence” outweighed evidence heard at her trial. They also found that her diaries, when viewed in the full context supported by new expert psychological and psychiatric evidence, were “not reliable admissions of guilt.”
    
            Outside the court, Folbigg’s lawyer Rhanee Rego said Folbigg’s legal team will now seek compensation, which she predicted would be “substantial.”
    
            “I’m not prepared to put a figure on it, but it will be bigger than any substantial payment that has been made before,” she said.
    
            More importantly, they’re pushing all Australian states to create an independent body for review, such as a Criminal Cases Review Commission, to prevent future miscarriages of justice.
    
            “An innocent woman suffering can and should be recognized and become a major impetus to improve our legal system,” Rego said.
    
            Anna-Maria Rabia, Chief Executive of the Australian Academy of Science, echoed calls for an independent review commission in all the country’s jurisdictions.
    
            “Here in New South Wales, we’ve just seen the crushing of the convictions of Kathleen Folbigg after 20 years in jail. If a case of this magnitude does not trigger law reform, I’m not sure what does,” she said.
    
            “It is time for Australia to review its legal system to ensure it can be more scientifically informed, particularly given the pace of change of scientific discovery and technological advances.”

      Abortion access is before supreme courts in Arizona, New Mexico and Wyoming this week. What we know
    ","

    ","
            Before the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, Arizona lawmakers outlawed nearly all abortions after 15 weeks.
    
            By taking away the federal right to an abortion, however, the nation’s highest court enabled Arizona’s attorney general to also enforce a 1901 abortion ban that was on the books more than a decade before the territory officially became a state﻿.
    
            That law, which can be traced back to as early as 1864, barred the procedure in all cases except when “it is necessary to save” a mother’s life, and carried a prison sentence of two to five years for abortion providers.
    
            When Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed the 15-week abortion ban in March 2022, he said the new legislation would not override the 1901 law.
    
            On Tuesday, the state Supreme Court was asked for clarity following months of uncertainty and legal wrangling over whether the pre-statehood, near-total abortion ban should apply.
    
            The case not only gets at the heart of how restrictive abortion law should be in Arizona, but also reflects a heated debate nationwide in the wake of the Roe v. Wade decision –- happening in other state Supreme Court cases this week on abortion access in Wyoming and New Mexico.
    
            Arizona’s Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday from abortion rights opponents who claim the state should revert to the 1901 ban, and advocates, who asked the court to affirm the 2022 law allowing abortions up to 15 weeks.
    
            The state’s top court will now decide which law applies in Arizona.
    
            The case, Planned Parenthood Arizona v. Mayes, was brought in Pima County by Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative law firm representing Dr. Eric Hazelrigg, a physician who opposes abortion rights, as well as Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen and Speaker of the House Ben Toma.
    
            “For over 100 years Arizona has fully protected life from the moment of conception. Roe temporarily stopped that protection, but the legislature never gave up. We asked this court to reverse and fully remove the injunction below,” Jake Warner, an attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, told the judges, referring to a court injunction that barred enforcement of the pre-statehood law after the Roe decision in 1973.
    
            Late last year, the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled both abortion laws in the state must be reconciled, or “harmonized,” and that abortion is legal through 15 weeks when provided by licensed physicians in compliance with the state’s other laws and regulations.
    
            Arizona’s six justices, all appointed by Republican governors, at times grappled with how each law would treat punishment to doctors and other care providers who assist abortions that occur after 15 weeks and did not meet certain exceptions, such as the life of the mother and the medical need for it to be performed immediately.
    
            “In Arizona, the law must be clear. Here, as we just mentioned, there are conflicts when we are attempting to criminalize in one law that which is permitted in another,” Samuel Brown, of the Pima County Attorney’s Office, told the justices.
    
            “Doctors and the people of Arizona need to be clear on what is illegal, what is legal,” added Brown, whose office is named in the case and takes the position that people in the state have the right to make their own reproductive health choices.
    
            Andy Gaona, who represents Planned Parenthood of Arizona in the case, told the judges the case is about access to safe abortions.  
    
            “Abortion is health care. And I’m not sure that anyone has ever said those words in this courtroom before, so they bear repeating – abortion is health care. And what that means is that this court’s decision will have a profound impact on the ability of pregnant Arizonans to access that health care.”
    
            In rebuttal, Warner said the pre-statehood law’s existing protections suffice, noting “the application of law protects the mother while respecting the state’s growing interest in protecting unborn children as they near viability.”
    
            Chief Justice Robert M. Brutinel adjourned the proceedings Tuesday, stating the court would issue an opinion in “due course.”
    
            Here are two other state court cases on abortion access to watch this week:
    
            In March, a district judge temporarily blocked a ban that would prohibit abortion in most circumstances a few days after the ban took effect.
    
            Wyoming was also the first state to pass legislation explicitly banning access to abortion pills, though the same district judge temporarily blocked that ban in June, days before it was supposed to take effect.
    
            That judge is to decide Thursday whether to issue a ruling or send the case to trial to resolve the issue of whether the abortion and medication bans violate Wyoming’s constitution.
    
            Separately, the state Supreme Court, whose five members were all appointed by Republican governors, heard arguments Tuesday on whether to let two state lawmakers, the secretary of state and Right to Life of Wyoming intervene in the case involving the abortion ban to “provide expert evidence and testimony to show the harms to women and unborn children from abortion itself, which would rebut the claim that elective abortion should be considered health care,” according to a court filing.
    
            The parties seeking to intervene want to be allowed to offer evidence countering the plaintiffs’ legal argument that the abortion law “is vague, that abortion on demand is a fundamental right in Wyoming, that abortion should be considered health care,” and that the law violates religious freedom and equal protection, according to their motion.
    
            The state Supreme Court will hear arguments this week over whether localities can ban abortion while the state protects it. Abortion is legal in New Mexico.
    
            Raúl Torrez, the state’s Democratic attorney general, in January challenged the bans at the local and state levels, saying they violate state constitutional protections including discrimination based on sex and pregnancy status.
    
            In March, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed into law a bill prohibiting  local municipalities and other public bodies from interfering with a person’s ability to access reproductive or gender-affirming health care services.
    
            The law followed ordinances that several municipalities in the state had passed related to abortion care access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

      Supreme Court action on mifepristone demonstrates abortion care is all about the courtroom

            The Supreme Court’s acceptance of an appeal from the Biden administration on Wednesday opens a new front in the national controversy over access to abortion as states, including Texas, have been moving aggressively against women since the high court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            Fourteen states have outright forbidden abortion and many others have significantly restricted when a pregnancy can be terminated since the June 2022 decision.
    
            Texas, which bans it, also recently blocked a woman from aborting a fetus diagnosed with a fatal genetic condition, even though physicians said continuing the pregnancy could threaten her life and future fertility. (Lawyers for the woman, who was 21 weeks pregnant, said she had already left the state to seek the procedure elsewhere.)
    
            More broadly, these cases demonstrate the new post-Roe world created by the Supreme Court.
    
            The most personal choices of women (with their physicians) are now litigated in courtrooms, alongside new policy dilemmas, such as over government’s approval of mifepristone. Another pending federal dispute tests whether a near total abortion ban (in Idaho) is preempted by a US law that requires hospitals receiving Medicare reimbursement to provide emergency care for needy patients.
    
            The new case accepted by the high court on Wednesday, Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, will determine abortion access and the power of federal regulators to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs, whether related to abortion or treatment for cancer, epilepsy and other medical conditions.
    
            The case, expected to be heard this spring with a decision likely by July, is destined to be a flashpoint in the 2024 presidential election and political races nationwide. It marks the first test of the justices’ sentiment on abortion since their 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade. The 1973 case had been repeatedly upheld until the hard-right coalesced on the court, with the addition of three appointees by former President Donald Trump.
    
            The FDA case will also be the first abortion-related dispute with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on the bench. She succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer in 2022. (The Democratic appointees support abortion rights.)
    
            Reverberations from Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization remain strong, including in the political sphere, where the consequences have generally given Democratic candidates leverage.
    
            The new controversy at the court differs from Dobbs, which involved the fundamental right to abortion. At issue now are statutory rules that test whether the FDA’s actions regarding the drug’s use were sufficiently grounded in science and medicine.
    
            Mifepristone, first approved by the FDA in 2000, is part of a two-pill protocol that has become the most common method in the US for women seeking to end a pregnancy.
    
            A crucial threshold question for the justices is whether the challengers to the FDA – physicians who oppose abortion and do not prescribe mifepristone – have legal standing to bring the case. Lower federal court judges allowed the lawsuit and then invalidated various FDA rules for the drug’s use. The Supreme Court in late April put a hold on the earlier court action, and mifepristone remains available today.
    
            Biden administration lawyers at the Department of Justice, whose appeal was accepted on Wednesday, argue that those physicians lack standing because they cannot show a concrete injury.
    
            The physician and medical group challengers counter that some women who use medication abortion have complications and seek emergency treatment. The challenging physicians say they would be forced to provide care that violates their consciences and compromises care for their regular patients.
    
            FDA approval of mifepristone goes back 23 years, but two sets of regulations for its use, from 2016 and 2021, are specifically in dispute in the new case. The question is whether those actions were “arbitrary and capricious,” rather than sufficiently justified. The court rejected a petition from the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine directly challenging the core 2000 approval of the drug.
    
            Before the court will be the 2016 action, when the FDA said the abortion medication could be taken up to ten weeks into a pregnancy, not just seven weeks as had been the gestational age limit. The agency also allowed certain non-physician healthcare providers to prescribe and dispense mifepristone. Five years later, in 2021, FDA dropped the requirement that the medication be dispensed in person, rather than
    
            The Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine is represented by the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom. It filed the initial case in the Texas region covered by US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, known to be sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause.
    
            Kacsmaryk let the lawsuit proceed and said the FDA had failed to evaluate sufficiently the harms of mifepristone. “The Court,” he wrote of his determination last April, “does not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly. But here, FDA acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns – in violation of its statutory duty – based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions.”
    
            Kacsmaryk wanted to reject FDA determinations back to its 2000 approval of mifepristone. But the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals found that the deadline for a challenge to the 2000 approval had passed, even as it agreed with much of Kacsmaryk’s decision. The US appellate court similarly accepted the arguments that the FDA’s loosening of requirements since 2016 were not sufficiently supported by expert studies.
    
            In appealing the case to the high court, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said those lower court rulings “mark the first time any court has restricted access to an FDA-approved drug based on a disagreement with FDA’s expert judgment about the conditions required to assure that drug’s safe use.”
    
            She said the 5th Circuit decision would severely disrupt the pharmaceutical industry, a position also emphasized by Danco Laboratories, which gained FDA approval for its drug Mifeprex in 2000. Danco separately appealed the 5th Circuit decision. The justices consolidated the cases.
    
            The FDA’s defenders contend that the anti-abortion doctors and groups are not required to prescribe mifepristone and that their fears about emergency room problems are speculative.
    
            As it urged the justices to reject the government’s appeal, the Alliance of Hippocratic Medicine told the court, “FDA has always known that those doctors would be needed to respond to harms caused by chemical abortion,” adding that “between 2.9% and 4.6% of women who take chemical abortion drugs end up in the emergency room, and (the physicians’) harms here are the furthest thing from speculative.”
    
            A group of pharmaceutical companies, executives and investors submitted a “friend of the court” brief pointing up possible ramifications of the case. Avoiding the word “abortion,” the group said the 5th Circuit ruling would have consequences throughout the drug industry.
    
            “Far from being limited to a single drug,” the pharmaceutical coalition wrote, “the logic of the decision below will create chaos for the drug development and approval processes. That decision casts a shadow of uncertainty over every FDA approval and invites spurious lawsuits challenging FDA’s safety and effectiveness determinations.”

      Supreme Court to decide whether to restrict abortion drug nationwide
    ","

    ","
            The Supreme Court said Wednesday it will consider whether to restrict access to a widely used abortion drug — even in states where the procedure is still allowed.
    
            The case concerns the drug mifepristone that — when coupled with another drug — is one of the most common abortion methods in the United States.
    
            The decision means the conservative-leaning court will again wade into the abortion debate after overturning Roe v. Wade last year, altering the landscape of abortion rights nationwide and triggering more than half the states to outlaw or severely restrict the procedure.
    
            The new case could be decided by July, inserting the Supreme Court into the middle of the presidential election, where abortion access is once again a key issue.
    
            For now, mifepristone remains available and not subject to restrictions the lower courts have said should be imposed on its use. The high court determined in April that access to the drug would remain unchanged until the appeals process finishes.
    
            The Biden administration and a manufacturer of the drug are asking the justices to reverse a federal appeals court decision that, if allowed to go into effect, would restrict access to the drug. At the same time, groups and doctors that oppose abortion want the justices to go even further than a conservative federal appeals court did and hold that the initial 2000 approval of the drug was also unlawful.
    
            The White House said that the government will continue to support the US Food and Drug Administration’s “safe and effective” approval and regulation of the drug.
    
            “As the Department of Justice continues defending the FDA’s actions before the Supreme Court, President Biden and Vice President Harris remain firmly committed to defending women’s ability to access reproductive care,” White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said in a statement.
    
            Erin Hawley, an attorney with the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing the abortion pill challengers, urged the justices to agree with the lower-court decisions restricting access to the drug when they eventually decide the case.
    
            “Every court so far has agreed that the FDA acted unlawfully in removing common-sense safeguards for women and authorizing dangerous mail-order abortions. We urge the Supreme Court to do the same,” Hawley said.
    
            Central to the dispute is the scope of the US Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate mifepristone, a drug that the medical community has deemed safe and effective. It has been used by millions of women across the country in the more than two decades it’s been on the market.
    
            The drug was initially approved by the FDA in 2000, but in 2016, 2019 and 2021, the FDA put in place modifications that would make the drug more easily accessible. Those modifications were related to issues such as dosing and in person dispensing requirements. The changes also allowed the drug to be taken later in pregnancy.
    
            Challengers – including doctors and groups who oppose abortion – argue that the FDA did not do enough to study the safety implications of the drug when it approved its use and made it more easily accessible in subsequent years.
    
            The legal volleying jumpstarted this spring, when US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, issued a ruling that would have a halted the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug.
    
            The judge said that the FDA failed to consider “the intense psychological trauma and post-traumatic stress women often experience from chemical abortion.” The term “chemical abortion,” which is preferred by abortion opponents, was repeatedly invoked by the judge in his ruling, as was “abortionist” and “unborn human.”
    
            Kacsmaryk also suggested that the FDA’s data was downplaying the frequency with which the drug was being mistakenly administered to someone who had an ectopic pregnancy, i.e. a pregnancy outside the cavity of the uterus. He repeated the challengers’ accusations that the FDA’s approval process had been the subject of improper political pressure.
    
            At the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, the conservative court backtracked somewhat, saying that while it was too late for the challengers to mount a case against the initial 2000 approval of the drug and left in place the 2019 approval of a generic version of the drug, it would block changes made in 2016 and 2021 that made the drug more easily accessible.
    
            “Because the drug could not safely be approved without restrictions, the agency conditioned its approval on numerous safeguards,” Erin Hawley, of the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, told the justices in court papers. “Yet in 2016, FDA stripped away many of the safeguards, failing to explain why it was proper to eliminate them without a study showing their cumulative safety.”
    
            Though the justices on Wednesday agreed to consider an appeals court decision that restricted access to the drug, they declined a separate appeal by the abortion foes to consider if the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug was unlawful.
    
            “The denial of the cross-petition may seem technical, but it’s a strong sign that the Court is focused only on what the Biden administration and Danco laboratories are challenging – the lower courts’ conclusion that the plaintiffs could bring this case in the first place,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
    
            “That makes it far less likely that the court will reach the merits of whether the FDA has acted lawfully in first approving and then expanding access to mifepristone, and far more likely that the case will be resolved on procedural grounds that won’t have any direct effect on access to mifepristone going forward,” he added.
    
            In September, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing in legal briefs that “more than half of American women who choose to terminate their pregnancies rely on mifepristone to do so” and that “study after study has shown that when mifepristone is taken in accordance with its approved conditions of use, serious adverse events are exceedingly rare.”
    
            Prelogar said that if the lower court decision is allowed to take effect it would “up-end the regulatory regime for mifepristone, with damaging consequences for women seeking lawful abortions and a healthcare system that relies on the availability of the drug under the current conditions of use.”
    
            She said the “unprecedented decision” would also “threaten to severely disrupt the pharmaceutical industry and prevent FDA from fulfilling its statutory responsibilities according to its scientific judgment.
    
            Jessica L. Ellsworth, a lawyer for Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of the drug and an intervenor in the case, told the justices in court papers that “for the women and teenage girls, health care providers and States that depend on FDA’s actions to ensure safe and effective reproductive health care is available, this case matters tremendously.”
    
            She said the court should take up the dispute because it “affects the availability of a drug with lawful uses in States across the country” and “raises questions about whether a single federal court can limit abortion access in the States that protect it.”
    
            The 5th Circuit decision “destabilizes” the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries “by questioning when scientific studies – accepted by FDA – are sufficient to support conditions of use,” Ellsworth added.

      What is mifepristone?
    ","

    ","
            Mifepristone can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor after the US Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit that challenged regulation of the abortion pill.
    
            Mifepristone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration decades ago and has been shown to be safe and effective.
    
            Anti-abortion advocates have claimed that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn’t study it enough to approve it. A lawsuit was brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations alleged that the FDA violated the law in how it regulated mifepristone. If a 5th Circuit ruling had been upheld, it could have ended availability of mifepristone for medication abortion via telehealth, which would have affected abortion access — even in states where it’s legal.
    
            The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. The court’s reasoning could still allow other mifepristone challenges in the future.
    
            Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery.
    
            Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it’s sometimes known as RU-486.
    
            Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus.
    
            Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents.
    
            Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions.
    
            The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period.
    
            This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show.
    
            Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country’s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, that signed an amicus brief in the Texas case.
    
            This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries.
    
            Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the FDA. That means the death rate is 0.0005%.
    
            Mifepristone’s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show.
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra – used to treat erectile dysfunction – is nearly 10 times higher.
    
            Mifepristone usually doesn’t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones.
    
            Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA.
    
            Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are “exceedingly rare,” happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations’ amicus brief.
    
            The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US.
    
            Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, shows that this option has become steadily more common over the two decades it’s been available, rising from less than 10% of all abortions in the US in 2001 to 53% in 2020 and 63% in 2023.
    
            No matter the status of mifepristone, misoprostol would still be available and could be used for a medication abortion on its own.
    
            The only use of misoprostol that’s approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it “off-label” by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor.
    
            Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a “reasonable” option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective.
    
            This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization.
    
            People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, previously told CNN.
    
            “Misoprostol still works very well and is very safe,” Wong said. “Mifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.”

      Pregnant woman in lawsuit challenging Kentucky’s abortion bans learns her embryo has no ‘cardiac activity,’ attorneys say

    ","
            A pregnant Kentucky woman involved in a class action lawsuit challenging the state’s two abortion bans has learned her embryo no longer has cardiac activity, her attorneys said.
    
            The woman, identified as Jane Doe, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court last week, which challenges the state’s trigger law and six-week abortion ban because “the government has denied her access to the care she needs,” the American Civil Liberties Union said in a news release.
    
            It marks the first time a pregnant woman in Kentucky has filed a lawsuit of this kind, ACLU of Kentucky spokesperson Angela Cooper told CNN.
    
            Jane Doe’s attorneys from the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project declined to say whether she will continue her legal fight after receiving the news about the lack of cardiac activity in the embryo.
    
            “All we can say at this time is that Jane Doe sought an abortion in the Commonwealth and couldn’t get one because of Kentucky’s abortion ban - that hasn’t changed,” an ACLU spokesperson told CNN.
    
            The lawsuit, filed by Jane Doe and Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, was filed one day after a Texas judge ruled Kate Cox, a woman who is 20 weeks pregnant, could obtain an emergency abortion. But that decision was overturned Monday by the Texas Supreme Court – even as Cox was traveling out of the state to pursue the procedure.
    
            Cox’s legal battle is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by an individual seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, according to the New York Times. The case has become the intense focus of the ongoing debate over Texas’ medical exception to its controversial ban on abortions after six weeks – one of the strictest in the nation.
    
            In Kentucky, the trigger law, which was passed in 2019 and went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, banned most abortions at any pregnancy stage, making them a felony offense, with very limited exceptions when necessary to prevent serious injury or save a patient’s life.
    
            The near-total bans in both states outlaw abortion in most instances with no exceptions for rape or incest, making Kentucky and Texas two of 13 states banning or severely restricting abortion.
    
            Jane Doe’s suit names Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and other state officials as defendants. A spokesperson from the office of Kentucky’s Republican attorney general told CNN they are “reviewing the complaint.”
    
            “I am a proud Kentuckian and I love the life and family I have built here. But I am angry that now that I am pregnant and do not want to be, the government is interfering in my private matters and blocking me from having an abortion,” the woman said in a statement provided by the ACLU.
    
            “This is my decision – not the government’s or any other person’s,” she added. “I am bringing this lawsuit because I firmly believe that everyone should have the ability to make their own decisions about their pregnancies. I hope this case will restore abortion access in Kentucky, if not for me, then for the countless people in the future who deserve the autonomy to decide what is best for themselves and their families.”
    
            Jane Doe filed the class action suit to include all pregnant women in Kentucky who may also want an abortion because they “are suffering medical, constitutional, and irreparable harm because they are denied the ability to obtain an abortion,” according to the court complaint.
    
            “Jane Doe should have the power to make decisions about her body, and to access essential health care in her community, but Kentucky politicians have denied her that fundamental right,” said Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, in the news release. “Kentucky’s abortion bans violate the Kentucky Constitution, including its promise of protecting everyone’s right to privacy, which encompasses the right to access abortion.”
    
            “These bans have harmed countless Kentuckians since going into effect last year, and we are relieved to be back in court to try to restore abortion access in Kentucky,” Amiri added.
    
            Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, said in a Friday news conference, “Access to reproductive health care has been denied for far too long.”
    
            “We know people in Kentucky agree with us because, in 2022, Kentuckians voiced their opinion by voting down the constitutional amendment that would have amended the state constitution to explicitly say that it does not protect the right to an abortion,” Gibron said.
    
            In June 2022, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood were granted a restraining order and temporary injunction after they argued the state’s trigger law and six-week abortion ban violated pregnant Kentuckians’ constitutional rights to “privacy, bodily autonomy, and self-determination,” the ACLU said in an earlier news release.
    
            The injunction was dissolved in February by the state’s Supreme Court, which ruled the circuit court wrongfully stopped the enforcement of two state abortion laws.
    
            This year, health care providers and abortion activists have continued to file legal challenges to stop bans in several states from being enforced – and with abortion banned in more than a dozen states and restricted in many others, it has become about twice as common for people in the United States to travel across state lines for their abortion care.

      Here’s what we know about a Texas woman’s battle for an abortion

    ","
            In one of the most high-profile abortion cases since the fall of Roe V. Wade, a Texas woman has been battling the state to terminate her high-risk pregnancy — a legal dispute that could have ripple effects for many as the Texas law, one of the strictest in the country, is tested.
    
            Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, filed a lawsuit last week to end a pregnancy she and her doctors say threatens her life and future fertility.  The case triggered a tense legal battle with the eyes of the country watching. The Texas Supreme Court ruled against her on Monday after she left the state to pursue the procedure.
    
            The lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by someone seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, according to the New York Times. The 1973 US Supreme Court ruling established a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability.
    
            Here’s what we know so far about Cox – and what her case reveals about the state of abortion law in a post-Roe America.
    
            Cox’s name came into the public sphere when she filed a lawsuit against the state of Texas on December 5, asking a court to declare she has the right to terminate her pregnancy.
    
            Cox was 20 weeks pregnant when she sued. Her fetus had been diagnosed with a rare and deadly genetic condition called trisomy 18.
    
            “I’m trying to do what is best for my baby daughter and myself and my family, but we are suffering because of the laws in Texas,” Cox wrote in an op-ed for the Dallas Morning News about her abortion fight. “I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.”
    
            “I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health, for parenting my children, and for a future pregnancy,” she added.
    
            Trisomy 18, sometimes called Edwards syndrome, is a rare chromosomal condition that can cause heart defects and other organ abnormalities. Almost all pregnancies end in miscarriage or stillbirth, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Of the babies that do survive full-term, no more than 10% survive past their first birthday, says the clinic.
    
            The lawsuit states Cox had been to three different emergency rooms over the last month “due to severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks.”
    
            “Because Ms. Cox has had two prior cesarean surgeries (‘C-sections’), continuing the pregnancy puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy,” the lawsuit states.
    
            In 2021, Texas banned abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy –- before many people know they are pregnant. When the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law came into effect, essentially blocking all abortions other than those when the mother is “at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced.”
    
            In addition to criminalizing abortions, Texas also allows private citizens to file a civil lawsuit against anyone who knowingly “aids or abets” an abortion.
    
            What exactly is necessary to protect the life of the mother is the key area of contention. Cox has said despite her pain and medical problems during her pregnancy, the law is too vague to determine whether an abortion under her circumstances would be legal.
    
            “Ms. Cox’s physicians have informed her that their ‘hands are tied’ and she will have to wait until her baby dies inside her or carry the pregnancy to term, at which point she will be forced to have a third C-section, only to watch her baby suffer until death,” the lawsuit states.
    
            On December 7, a district court judge ruled Cox could legally terminate her pregnancy. In an emergency ruling, the judge granted a temporary restraining order against the state that would allow Cox to immediately have an abortion.
    
            “The idea that Mrs. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said in her ruling.
    
            After the ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned Cox’s physician she could still face civil and criminal penalties at some point should Cox undergo the procedure, which could include first-degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of at least $100,000 for each violation. Paxton petitioned for immediate intervention from the state’s supreme court, arguing Cox did not demonstrate her pregnancy was threatening her life.
    
            On December 8, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked Cox from receiving the procedure. Then on Monday, the court – comprised of nine Republican justices – issued a ruling and opinion, siding with Paxton and reversing the lower court’s ruling.
    
            But the court also called on the state’s medical board to provide more guidance on the state’s medical emergency exception at the heart of Cox’s case.
    
            In an opinion, the court said it should be up to doctors -– not judges –- to decide whether to provide an abortion. The court said Cox’s doctor did not establish her symptoms were life-threatening.
    
            “A pregnant woman does not need a court order to have a lifesaving abortion in Texas,” the court wrote in its opinion. Instead, a physician must determine “that one is needed under the appropriate legal standard, using reasonable medical judgment.”
    
            Cox’s attorney, Molly Duane, called the state Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the lower court’s decision “disappointing.”
    
            “But frankly, the court system, the political system, the infrastructure entirely in Texas had already failed Kate and her family,” Duane told CNN Tuesday.
    
            She added, “No one is taking responsibility for what is happening to her.”
    
            On Monday, Cox’s attorneys with the Center for Reproductive Rights announced she had left the state to undergo an abortion.
    
            While the center is not disclosing more details about her plans, their statement said she’s received “offers to help her access abortion elsewhere, from Kansas to Colorado to Canada.”
    
            “This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in an earlier statement. “Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer. This is why judges and politicians should not be making health care decisions for pregnant people—they are not doctors.”
    
            When asked why Cox decided to file suit rather than seek care in another state earlier Thursday, Duane, her attorney, replied, “For most people who need abortion care, they can’t leave their home communities for urgent health care. Getting on the plane in the middle of a medical emergency, let alone an obstetrical emergency, is, is a human rights violation in and of itself.”
    
            Her attorneys haven’t said whether Cox plans to continue her legal fight following the latest ruling from the Texas Supreme Court.
    
            “It’s been a very challenging week for Kate and her family,” Duane told CNN Tuesday. “To feel that her state has failed her so spectacularly that she has had to flee her own state for medically necessary abortion care is truly heartbreaking.”
    
            Others have sued Texas over the same medical exception at the center of Cox’s case.
    
            A group of five women and two medical providers sued the state in March, arguing the abortion ban poses significant risks to their health, endangering their lives, health and fertility. The women asked the court to clarify that abortions can be performed when a physician makes a “good faith judgment” that “the pregnant person has a physical emergent medical condition that poses a risk of death or a risk to their health (including their fertility).”
    
            Their case has expanded to include 15 more women and argues the language regarding medical exceptions in the law is unclear and causes doctors to refrain from performing abortions in serious cases. It also was filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights.
    
            Before the Texas Supreme Court last week, an attorney with the state’s attorney general office argued the law was clear and that if women with life-threatening medical issues were not receiving abortions, then it should be considered negligence on the doctor’s part.
    
            Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described litigation separate from Kate Cox’s suit challenging the Texas abortion law. Twenty women and two medical providers now are plaintiffs in one lawsuit, filed in March by the Center for Reproductive Rights.

      Biden campaign sharpens its attacks on Trump over abortion restrictions amid Texas case
    ","

    ","
            The Biden campaign is sharpening its efforts to call out former President Donald Trump for what it casts as “chaos and cruelty” on the issue of abortion as women across the country grapple with a patchwork of tightening restrictions.
    
            The crux of their message: “Donald Trump is to blame.”
    
            The messaging push comes one day after the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, who filed a lawsuit last week to end a pregnancy that she and her doctors say threatens her life and future fertility. The lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by an individual seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            Monday’s ruling, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a call with reporters, is the “latest development in the shocking, horrifying and heartbreaking story,” seeking to tie the case directly to Trump’s policies. She noted that Cox’s doctors “were threatened with a lifetime in jail sentence by Donald Trump’s-endorsed MAGA Republican (Texas Attorney General) Ken Paxton.” Cox eventually left the state to seek an abortion before the Texas Supreme Court’s ruling.
    
            Campaign officials view abortion as a key galvanizing issue for general election voters heading into 2024 – and one where they have the upper hand, pointing to turnout and enthusiasm among Democratic voters in the 2022 midterm elections, as well as statewide races in 2023.
    
            They have work to do: A national Wall Street Journal poll out last week found that Trump narrowly leads Biden in a hypothetical 2024 presidential rematch, with Biden weighed down by relatively soft support among “disaffected Democrats.” Forty-seven percent of registered voters in the US currently say they’d support Trump and 43% say they’d support Biden. Abortion is one of the issues where the campaign feels it can boost that Democratic enthusiasm and court independent voters.
    
            The campaign has been homing in on the former president, who remains the GOP primary front-runner. But it is also preparing messaging for other candidates, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former US Ambassador to the UN and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, casting them as “extreme,” as well.
    
            As the campaign begins to highlight more contrasts with Trump, it will continue efforts to amplify the politically potent issue, with communications director Michael Tyler telling CNN it will be a “central pillar of the campaign moving forward” compared to Trump’s “unpopular and toxic agenda.”
    
            “We will make sure that the American people know that Donald Trump is to blame,” Tyler said.
    
            He added, “If Trump is reelected, we will face the reality of a nightmare scenario – and that’s a national abortion ban.”
    
            CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on the Biden team’s plans.
    
            Those plans include outreach to the “Women for Biden” coalition, as well as the use of key surrogates on the issue. But the campaign also feels that stories of real people, like Kate Cox, are resonating.
    
            “It’s critical that we continue to lift up these stories and really remind women what’s at stake in this election, and really the choice that they have before them,” Chavez Rodriguez said.
    
            In Texas, Cox’s attorneys with the Center for Reproductive Rights announced Monday she had left her state to undergo an abortion.
    
            “Kate had to leave her home state to seek the health care she urgently needs. This is happening right here in the United States of America. And it’s happening because of Donald Trump,” Chavez Rodriguez said.
    
            She noted that “Trump proudly brags to this day, it was his Supreme Court picks who provided the deciding votes to overturn Roe v. Wade, allowing Republican extremists across the country to pass draconian bans that are hurting women and threatening doctors.”
    
            Chavez Rodriguez pointed to other states where the “chaos and cruelty created by Trump’s work overturning Roe v. Wade continues to worsen all across the country,” including legislation banning abortion with few exceptions in Florida and Alabama, as well as recently-introduced bill in Missouri, where, she said, “MAGA Republicans introduced a bill to charge women with murder for receiving reproductive care.”
    
            Trump and other Republicans running for president, she warned, want “to ban abortion nationwide.”

      Texas woman forced to carry high-risk pregnancy files lawsuit to have abortion

            A pregnant Texas woman who says her unborn baby has a genetic condition and carrying the child to term could threaten her life filed suit against the state Tuesday, asking a court to declare she has the right to terminate the pregnancy.
    
            Kate Cox said the state’s current abortion ban puts her husband and her gynecologist at legal risk if she has an abortion in Texas.
    
            The lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by an individual seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, according to the New York Times.
    
            “Ms. Cox is currently 20 weeks pregnant, and she has been to three different emergency rooms in the last month due to severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks,” according to the lawsuit. “Because Ms. Cox has had two prior cesarean surgeries (‘C-sections’), continuing the pregnancy puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”
    
            The lawsuit says Cox’s baby was diagnosed with trisomy 18 and is not expected to live more than a few days outside the womb. “Ms. Cox’s physicians have informed her that their ‘hands are tied’ and she will have to wait until her baby dies inside her or carry the pregnancy to term, at which point she will be forced to have a third C-section, only to watch her baby suffer until death,” the lawsuit states.
    
            Trisomy 18, sometimes called Edwards syndrome, is a chromosomal condition that can cause heart defects and other organ abnormalities. In at least 95% of cases, the fetus doesn’t survive full-term, and the pregnancy ends in miscarriage or stillbirth, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Many children who are born with it die within a few days, and more than 90% die within a year.
    
            Texas law prohibits abortion after approximately six weeks, except to save the life of the mother or to prevent “substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, other than a psychological condition.” Cox – who is 20 weeks pregnant – said although she has gone to the emergency room three times with severe cramping, the law is too vague to make clear whether an abortion under those circumstances would be legal.
    
            “I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy. I do not want to put my body through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,” Cox said in a written statement released by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit in Travis County.
    
            Cox is asking the judge to issue a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction preventing the state from enforcing its abortion ban against her, her husband and her doctor.
    
            “While Ms. Cox’s life may not be imminently at risk, she is at high risk for many serious medical conditions that pose risks to her future fertility and can become suddenly and unexpectedly life-threatening,” the lawsuit says.
    
            It states Cox’s OB-GYN, Dr. Damla Karsan, has a “good faith belief” that Cox falls under the legal exception to the abortion ban, but can’t provide the abortion without a court order because she “cannot risk loss of her medical license, life in prison, and massive civil fines” if her belief is not accepted by the courts.
    
            The Texas Attorney General’s Office did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment Tuesday.
    
            Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the likelihood of a fetus with trisomy 18 surviving full-term. Almost all fetuses with trisomy 18 don’t survive full-term, and pregnancies end in miscarriage or stillbirth.

      Texas Supreme Court rules against pregnant woman seeking abortion as she leaves state for procedure

    ","
            The Texas Supreme Court on Monday reversed a lower court’s ruling that would have allowed a woman to obtain an abortion under the state’s “medical emergency” exception, though the woman’s attorneys hours earlier said she had left the state to have the procedure.
    
            Kate Cox sought the abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. A state judge last week ruled Cox, who is 21 weeks pregnant, could terminate her pregnancy — but the Texas Supreme Court temporarily put that ruling on hold late Friday.
    
            On Monday, the Center for Reproductive Rights announced the 31-year-old mother had left Texas to get health care elsewhere following what the group that represents Cox described as “a week of legal whiplash.”
    
            Then, hours later, the state’s high court ruled against her.
    
            The ruling calls into question whether the decision could deter women in similar situations from seeking a court-authorized abortion. Cox’s lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by a person seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, according to the New York Times.
    
            While the center did not disclose more details of Cox’s plans, she had received “offers to help her access abortion elsewhere, from Kansas to Colorado to Canada,” its statement said.
    
            Cox wants her care “the fastest way” possible, her attorney said.
    
            On Thursday, a state district court judge sided with Cox and granted a temporary restraining order against the state so she could legally have an abortion under the state’s “medical emergency” exception. Texas has a near-complete abortion ban with narrow exceptions.
    
            Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, quickly threatened criminal prosecution against doctors or hospitals who would help facilitate the abortion, saying they could face charges even after the 14-day temporary restraining order. CNN has reached out to Paxton’s office for comment.
    
            Late Friday night, the state’s high court temporarily blocked Cox from obtaining an abortion while it reviewed the case.
    
            In its ruling late Monday, the Texas Supreme Court – comprised of nine Republicans – called on the state’s medical board to provide more guidance on the “medical emergency” exception at the heart of Cox’s case.
    
            The high court also released an opinion, saying Cox’s doctor did not establish or attest that Cox’s symptoms were life-threatening and noting it should be up to doctors – not judges – to decide whether to provide an abortion.
    
            “No one disputes that Ms. Cox’s pregnancy has been extremely complicated. Any parents would be devastated to learn of their unborn (fatal condition) diagnosis. Some difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses,” the opinion states.
    
            “The exception requires a doctor to decide whether Ms. Cox’s difficulties pose such risks,” the ruling continues. “(A doctor) asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.”
    
            A separate case pending before the Texas Supreme Court seeks clarity on the “medical emergency” exception. Notably, in its opinion, the court called on the Texas Medical Board to provide further guidance on the law.
    
            “The courts cannot go further by entering into the medical-judgment arena. The Texas Medical Board, however, can do more to provide guidance in response to any confusion that currently prevails,” the opinion states. “Each of the three branches of government has a distinct role, and while the judiciary cannot compel executive branch entities to do their part, it is obvious that the legal process works more smoothly when they do.”
    
            For Cox, “this past week of legal limbo has been hellish,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. “Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer.
    
            “This is why judges and politicians should not be making health care decisions for pregnant people – they are not doctors.”
    
            Texas’ “medical emergency” exception allows for an abortion if the mother has a “life-threatening” physical condition while pregnant or has “a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”
    
            Critics argue the statute is too vague and has a chilling effect on doctors who fear criminal prosecution.
    
            The same legal group representing Cox – the Center for Reproductive Rights – is also representing a group of women and physicians before the Texas Supreme Court in the lawsuit seeking clarity. The state argues the law is adequate.
    
            Cox has been to the emergency room four times in the last month due to symptoms like severe cramping, diarrhea, leaking of fluid and elevated vital signs, her attorney said. And because she’s already delivered two children via C-section, her physicians have warned she is at high risk for complications, including possible uterine rupture in future pregnancies.
    
            This pregnancy would need to be delivered via another C-section, which Cox fears could jeopardize her health and future fertility, her attorneys said.
    
            Additionally, the fetus has trisomy 18, a fatal genetic condition sometimes called Edwards syndrome that can cause heart defects and other organ abnormalities. In at least 95% of cases, the fetus doesn’t survive full-term and the pregnancy ends in miscarriage or stillbirth, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
    
            Paxton argued Cox has not established her symptoms as to meet the “life-threatening” criteria in the law.
    
            The filing from his office stated Cox inquired about getting an abortion only after learning her fetus might not survive the pregnancy or long afterward and already knew she might need another C-section before her current pregnancy.
    
            “Plaintiffs plead no facts linking Ms. Cox’s physical condition related to the birth of this child to the loss of fertility. Instead, it appears she will face the same risks regarding the birth of any future child,” the filing states.
    
            As his office has done in the broader case on this issue before the state Supreme Court, Paxton’s attorneys also argued “a fatal fetal condition does not meet the medical exception,” adding the exception applies only to the mother’s condition.
    
            Paxton’s office also said none of the physicians who have treated Cox in the Dallas-Fort Worth area have recommended an abortion.
    
            Dr. Damla Karsan, a Houston-based physician – and a plaintiff in the other case – is cited in legal filings as having reviewed Cox’s medical records, recommended the abortion and agreed to provide the medical care.
    
            The state wrote in the filing Karsan’s recommendation “is not enough.”
    
            “What he’s (Paxton) saying is that physicians in Texas shouldn’t be practicing medicine,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Ken Paxton is practicing medicine – because that’s what he wants – he wants to review her medical records. He wants to decide if he thinks she’s sick enough.
    
            “When people tout the medical exceptions to abortion bans as meaning that the abortion bans are OK, and that people who really need care are still getting it, that’s a lie.”
    
            The case shows why “it is completely untenable for patients to have to come to court and ask for court authorization for lifesaving medical care,” she said. “It’s simply outrageous and people should be outraged but what is happening in Texas right now.”

      A Texas judge ruled a pregnant woman who sued the state seeking an abortion can legally terminate her pregnancy

    ","
            A Texas judge ruled Thursday that a pregnant woman who sued the state seeking a court-ordered abortion can legally terminate her pregnancy.
    
            The decision marks a significant development in the ongoing debate over the state’s medical exception to its controversial ban on abortions after six weeks – one of the strictest in the nation.
    
            Kate Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, filed a lawsuit this week asking a state district court in Austin court to temporarily block the state’s abortion ban, because she has been unable to get the procedure due to concerns of violating the law. Cox’s baby was diagnosed with trisomy 18 and is not expected to live more than a few days outside the womb, according to the suit.
    
            After the ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned Cox’s physician she could still face civil and criminal penalties at some point should she perform the court-ordered procedure.
    
            Cox’s lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by an individual seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, according to the New York Times.
    
            Cox, 31, has been to three different emergency rooms in the last month due to severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks, according to her suit. She has had two prior cesarean surgeries – C-sections – and, the suit said, “continuing the pregnancy puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”
    
            In an emergency hearing Thursday, a judge granted a temporary restraining order against the state that would allow Cox to immediately have an abortion.
    
            “The idea that Mrs. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said. “So I will be signing the order and it will be processed and sent out today.”
    
            Cox and her husband were present for the hearing – which took place over Zoom – and grew emotional at the judge’s decision and could be seen wiping away tears.
    
            Molly Duane, Cox’s attorney, said they are working to figure out “the fastest way to get her abortion care” but will not disclose when for the safety of her client, her family and physician.
    
            Duane said the fight is far from over, as the ruling only applies to Cox and does not “restore access” to abortion to thousands of other women. She called the state’s argument “callous in the extreme,” and said “they don’t care whether people live or die as long as they’re forced to give birth.”
    
            Marc Hearron, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, added: “This can’t be the new normal. I don’t think you can expect to see now hundreds of cases being filed on behalf of patients. It’s not realistic.”
    
            Paxton, in the letter threatening future legal action, wrote that Cox has failed to demonstrate she has a “life-threatening” medical condition related to her pregnancy or that her symptoms place her “at risk of death” or major bodily harm.
    
            The letter was sent to three hospitals in Houston where, according to the Texas Medical Board, Cox’s physician has privileges. It was released to the media by Paxton’s office. CNN has reached out to the hospitals for a response.
    
            The state attorney general warned the hospitals that Thursday’s ruling “will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability,” including first-degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of at least $100,000 for each violation.
    
            And the ruling, Paxton wrote, does not prevent civil action by private citizens – a reference to Senate Bill 8, the controversial Texas law that allows people to sue those who perform or facilitate an abortion.
    
             A lawyer representing Texas argued Thursday that Cox’s pregnancy symptoms did not meet the standard set out by the state for a medical emergency that would allow for an abortion.
    
            Johnathan Stone, special counsel with the state attorney general’s office, said Cox’s doctor made a “subjective” belief that Cox qualified for an abortion, rather than basing her medical opinion on “objective” standards outlined in the law.
    
            The argument over subjective versus objective medical reasons for an abortion is central to the ongoing debate and legal fights regarding the state’s exception rule. Critics argue the rule is vague and unclear – causing doctors, who face a felony for performing an illegal abortion, to refrain from taking action. The state maintains the language in the law is adequate and clear.
    
            Duane argued the state was second-guessing her client’s physicians and saying Cox was not sick enough. Duane works for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has been involved in a separate court battle against the state to seek clarity on the state’s medical emergency exception.
    
            “They have moved the goalposts once again. Now a patient must be about to die before a doctor can rely on the exception,” she said of the state, calling the position “cruel and dangerous.”
    
            CNN has reached out to the state’s attorney general office for comment.
    
            Trisomy 18, sometimes called Edwards syndrome, is a chromosomal condition that can cause heart defects and other organ abnormalities. In at least 95% of cases, the fetus doesn’t survive full-term, and the pregnancy ends in miscarriage or stillbirth, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Many children who are born with it die within a few days, and more than 90% die within a year.
    
            Attorneys for the state argued Cox’s condition – as laid out in the court filings – was not severe enough to meet the state’s medical exception standard and that the judge would be essentially changing the law if she granted the temporary restraining order.
    
            Cox’s gynecologist, Dr. Damla Karsan, has previously said she had a “good faith belief” that Cox falls under the legal exception to the abortion ban, but couldn’t provide the abortion without a court order because she “cannot risk loss of her medical license, life in prison, and massive civil fines” if her belief is not accepted by the courts.
    
            The state allows for abortions after six weeks if a woman experiences a “medical emergency,” which is defined in the law as “a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that, as certified by a physician, places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.”
    
            A group of 20 women and two physicians have been fighting the state in a separate lawsuit over the medical exception this year, arguing the language in the law is unclear and causes doctors to refrain from performing abortions in serious cases due to a lack of clarity in the law.
    
            Before the Texas Supreme Court last week, an attorney with the state’s attorney general office argued the law was clear and that if women with life-threatening medical issues were not receiving abortions, then it should be considered negligence on the doctor’s part.
    
            Cox said that although she has gone to the emergency room three times with severe cramping, the law is too vague to make clear whether an abortion under those circumstances would be legal.
    
            “I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy. I do not want to put my body through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,” Cox said in a statement released by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit in Travis County.
    
            Cox wrote in an op-ed for the Dallas Morning News that her unborn baby girl was diagnosed with full trisomy 18.
    
            “I’m trying to do what is best for my baby daughter and myself and my family, but we are suffering because of the laws in Texas,” Cox wrote. “I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.”
    
            “I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health, for parenting my children, and for a future pregnancy,” she added.
    
            Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the likelihood of a fetus with trisomy 18 surviving full-term. Almost all fetuses with trisomy 18 don’t survive full-term, and pregnancies end in miscarriage or stillbirth.

      Whitmer’s push for abortion rights continues as she repeals insurance requirement in Michigan
    ","
			By Jessica Estepa, CNN

    ","
            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday signed the final piece of the state’s Reproductive Health Act into law, which repealed a requirement for a separate insurance rider for abortion coverage.
    
            The move comes after voters enshrined abortion rights to the battleground state’s constitution in last year’s midterm elections, and ahead of 2024, when Democrats will continue to highlight the issue.
    
            Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year, abortion rights has become a driving force to the ballot box. Democratic candidates, including Whitmer during her 2022 reelection campaign, have made the issue a central part of their pitch. And voters, in turn, have consistently chosen to protect abortion rights and picked candidates who support those rights.
    
            “Today, 10 years after I gave a speech on the Senate floor and shared my own story as a survivor of sexual assault, I am honored as governor to repeal the ban on insurance coverage for abortion,” Whitmer posted on X after signing the bill.
    
            “The moral of the story is, never stop fighting for what you know is right,” she said in the post.
    
            Per the state, of the more than 27,000 abortion that took place in Michigan last year, only 2.5% were paid for by insurance. The vast majority were self-paid.
    
            The controversial insurance rider requirement was approved in 2013 by the then-Republican-led legislature.
    
            Whitmer, then the state Senate minority leader, spoke against it at the time and revealed her own personal story.
    
            “The Republican male majority continues to ignorantly and unnecessarily weigh in on important women’s health issues that they know nothing about,” she said, according to MLive.com.
    
            Whitmer has long been a vocal supporter of abortion rights. Six months after she won reelection and Democrats took control of the state legislature, the governor signed legislation repealing a 1931 abortion ban in Michigan – one that she had challenged even ahead of the overturning of Roe.
    
            In August, Whitmer said many “bad laws” were still in place which “put politically motivated, medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion.”
    
            A new CNN poll released this week found that in a hypothetical rematch, former President Donald Trump had 50% support of registered voters in Michigan while President Joe Biden had 40%. Biden had flipped the state in 2020 after it voted for Trump four years earlier.
    
            Biden, like his fellow Democrats, plans to highlight abortion rights as he seeks reelection in 2024. His campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, told CNN earlier this year that the president will continue to focus on “efforts that are helping motivate and mobilize voters right now” – like abortion access – as he looks toward reelection.
    
            CNN’s Melissa Alonso contributed to this report.

      Opinion: This Texas woman is exposing a chilling truth about abortion law
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler
		","
  Updated
        8:49 AM EST, Tue December 12, 2023
    ","
            In a court in Harris County, Texas, something remarkable happened this week: A woman and her husband asked a judge for an emergency order granting her permission to end a pregnancy.
    
            Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had learned that the child she was carrying had full trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition that is almost always fatal. Her physicians have warned that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk for life-threatening complications. Cox, who wants to have a third child, might also lose her ability to do so if forced to carry the pregnancy to term.
    
            The judge granted Cox’s request on Thursday, but the state will almost certainly appeal to what is a Texas Supreme Court with nine Republican members. Late Friday, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s ruling and Monday, the court ruled against her after she left the state to pursue the procedure. Cox’s suit will shape the abortion debate going forward — not least because it is historic.
    
            Cox is part of a new generation of plaintiffs telling heartbreaking stories about their experiences under criminal laws in places such as Texas, Idaho, Tennessee and Oklahoma — plaintiffs willing to speak out in a climate where support for abortion is at a record high, according to a WSJ-NORC poll, and some of the stigma surrounding abortion seems less intense. But given the popularity of abortion rights  — and the obvious tragedy faced by women like Cox — why are states like Texas fighting so hard to defend their narrow exceptions?
    
            The answer is that Cox’s case and others like it expose how unworkable abortion exceptions are under current law in states with virtual bans, especially when they are attached to harsh penalties like life in prison. Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.
    
            It is worth remarking on how rare Cox’s suit is. Before Roe v. Wade, patients and doctors both questioned the constitutionality of abortion laws. In some cases, pregnant patients were named plaintiffs: This was the case for Norma McCorvey, the “Roe” in Roe v. Wade, and Sandra Cano, the plaintiff in Roe’s companion case, Doe v. Bolton. These suits adjudicated whether a law was permissible, but often did not change what happened to a particular pregnant plaintiff (McCorvey, for example, famously carried what some called the “Roe baby” to term). After Roe, minors acting without parental consent or notification sought court-ordered abortion under what were called “judicial bypass” laws, often also while maintaining anonymity.
    
            Cox’s case is quite different. She is an adult, not a minor, and she has not concealed her identity. Her willingness to tell her story is no doubt due to her own strength and commitment, but our present political moment likely has something to do with it too. Poll after poll find strong, if not unprecedented, support for legal abortion, even in states where abortion bans are already in effect. Backlash to these bans — and to the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — has made it easier for other women to describe their own experiences with criminal laws and to file suits of their own.
    
            McCorvey and Cano used pseudonyms at a time when pursuing abortion rights might have come at great personal and political cost. Women like Cox and Amanda Zurawski, who is challenging the validity of Texas’s medical emergency exception to abortion, use their own names, and do so with the knowledge that most Americans support legal abortion — and all the more so in cases like theirs.
    
            When states fight plaintiffs like Cox and Zurawski in court, it hardly helps Republicans already on the defensive about abortion. It is comparably easy to paint bans as heartless and extreme when the state shows no sympathy for women who stand to lose their fertility, health or lives.
    
            Suits like Cox’s expose how hard it would be to devise a workable abortion exception. In theory, a functioning exception would advance the state’s interest in fetal life while offering a real opportunity for people in exceptional cases that the state deems deserving. But if a state requires harsh punishment — Texas, for example, authorizes life in prison for abortion — few doctors will be willing to gamble that they are interpreting the law correctly, even if an exception is relatively clear.
    
            Most exceptions, it turns out, aren’t clear anyway, written not by physicians but by lawmakers who use the language of criminal law, and sometimes write more than one exception into various criminal abortion laws, as in Oklahoma. The broader and more compassionate a state makes an exception, the higher the odds that more plaintiffs like Cox will prevail, but that will require deference to patients and physicians that anti-abortion states focused on punishing abortion providers reject as a matter of principle.
    
            Exceptions almost always leave out other tragic circumstances. Texas has a medical emergency exception, but dismisses a fatal fetal abnormality that could deprive Cox of the ability to have a third child as nothing different than what is experienced by “countless women who give birth every day.” The risk of death, the state says, is simply “not imminent” enough. Andy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, just made anger about a similar provision in his state’s law a central message of his successful reelection campaign.
    
            Republican lawmakers often seem to want it both ways on abortion. They define themselves as pro-life but insist on compassion for women, especially in the so-called hard cases like Cox’s.
    
            But what is happening in Texas complicates that narrative. Texas purports to value fetal life and women’s health — but then denies that the unborn have rights when that strategy will help defeat a lawsuit brought by a prison employee forced to stay at her post who lost her pregnancy. Texas claims compassion for women but requires that their lives or a major bodily function be at imminent risk before a doctor can step in. And Texas claims to protect life by forcing a woman like Cox to carry a child who almost certainly won’t live while threatening her ability to have a child who will.
    
            All of this is a reminder of the priorities of state abortion laws, which are not about the value of life in the womb, but about criminal punishment — and about crafting exceptions that will rarely, if ever, be used. Cox’s suit matters because it is historic, but also because of what it tells us. When the chips are down, given a choice between protecting women like Cox and criminalizing those who offer abortions, we know what states like Texas will choose every time.
    
            This essay has been updated to reflect news of the ruling by the Texas Supreme Court.

      Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocks pregnant woman from emergency abortion
    ","

    ","
            The Texas Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a pregnant woman from obtaining an emergency abortion in a ruling issued late Friday.
    
            The court froze a lower court’s ruling that would have allowed Kate Cox, who sued the state seeking a court-ordered abortion, to obtain the procedure. “Without regard to the merits, the Court administratively stays the district court’s December 7, 2023 order,” the order states.
    
            The court noted the case would remain pending before them but did not include any timeline on when a full ruling might be issued. Cox is 20 weeks pregnant. Her unborn baby was diagnosed with a fatal genetic condition and she says complications in her pregnancy are putting her health at risk.
    
            Following the ruling, Cox’s attorney said they remain hopeful the state’s request is quickly rejected. “We are talking about urgent medical care. Kate is already 20 weeks pregnant,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “This is why people should not need to beg for healthcare in a court of law.”
    
            The ruling came just hours after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton petitioned the high court to intervene in the case.
    
            Paxton’s petition stemmed from a ruling on Thursday by a Texas judge who granted a 14-day temporary restraining order against the state’s abortion ban, so Cox could legally terminate her pregnancy.
    
            The decision marked a significant development in the ongoing debate over the state’s medical exception to its controversial ban on abortions after six weeks – one of the strictest in the nation.
    
            In the petition filings with the state Supreme Court, Paxton – who has threatened prosecution against anyone who helps facilitate the abortion – asked for an emergency stay of the district court judge’s ruling.
    
            In a letter to three hospitals in Houston where, according to the Texas Medical Board, Cox’s physician has privileges, Paxton wrote Cox has failed to demonstrate she has a “life-threatening” medical condition related to her pregnancy or that her symptoms place her “at risk of death” or major bodily harm.
    
            The state attorney general also warned the hospitals Thursday’s ruling “will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability,” including first-degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of at least $100,000 for each violation.
    
            Cox sought an emergency hearing to obtain an abortion after learning her unborn baby had trisomy 18, a fatal genetic condition, and is not expected to live more than a few days outside the womb, according to the suit.
    
            Cox, 31, has been to three different emergency rooms in the last month due to severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks, according to her suit. She has had two prior caesarean surgeries – C-sections – and, the suit said, “continuing the pregnancy puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”
    
            Before the state’s Supreme Court weighed in, attorneys for Cox and the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights legal group representing Cox, said Paxton’s petition to block her procedure was “stunning” and showed a “disregard for Ms. Cox’s life, fertility, and the rule of law.”
    
            “The State claims that it alone has the power to value Ms. Cox’s current nonviable pregnancy more highly than Ms. Cox’s own life and life of the future children she and her husband hope to have, regardless of Ms. Cox’s wishes for her family and the good faith advice of her medical team,” their response states.
    
            The response goes on to say the plaintiffs agree the state Supreme Court should take urgent action, “specifically, to remind the Attorney General that he does not exist outside the systems of laws of which he is an officer, and that he must follow court orders just like the citizens he purports to serve.”
    
            The filing also requests the state Supreme Court to reject Paxton’s threat of prosecution of the doctors and anyone else who helps facilitate the abortion.
    
            Molly Duane, Cox’s attorney, would not say Thursday when and where Cox would be getting the abortion but said they planned to help get her the care “the fastest way” possible.

      As the nation battles a maternal health crisis, more women of color are choosing birth centers over hospitals

            Vernette Kountz had given birth to four children in hospitals — including a set of surrogate twins — before deciding she was ready for a different experience.
    
            Kountz said while her previous deliveries had all been healthy and smooth, she felt her hospital and medical office visits were rushed, routine and impersonal.
    
            “When you’re in this medical model, you feel kind of shuffled around, told what to do, you have all of these assessments and ultrasounds,” Kountz said. “It feels more so transactional and less intimate.”
    
            So, in 2021, when Kountz found out she was pregnant with her fifth child, she decided to have the baby at the Atlanta Birth Center. The facility, she said, provided the holistic, personal and intimate care she had longed for as a mother and she had a water birth to deliver her son, Hudson.
    
            Kountz said she valued the experience so much she’s preparing to deliver her sixth baby at the same birth center in January.
    
            “It’s more than just treating a mom that’s pregnant,” she told CNN during a mid-November appointment at the center. “It’s like there is space for all parts of her. It creates a level of intimacy that you’re not really getting from a traditional medical office.”
    
            Kountz is among a small but growing number of women of color who are choosing birth centers over traditional medical facilities for prenatal, childbirth and postpartum care.
    
            While the majority of births in the US still happen in a hospital setting, in 2020 nearly 2% of people chose to give birth in a “community birth setting” such as a birth center or home birth, according to the most recent data from the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit that tracked these trends based on birth certificate data.
    
            Between 2019 and 2020, there was a 30% increase in Black women opting to give birth in those settings, and a 26% increase for Native American women, according to the nonprofit. The number of Hispanic women choosing to give birth in those settings increased by 24% and 18% for White as well as Asian women.
    
            The decision by some families to move away from traditional hospital birth settings comes as the nation battles a maternal health crisis in which Black women are nearly three times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than White women, according to the CDC.
    
            Birth centers are often home-like facilities that offer clients longer appointments and more freedom and autonomy in their birth experience. They are designed to care for those with low-risk pregnancies and state regulations prohibit them from performing c-sections, according to the American Association of Birth Centers.
    
            Atlanta Birth Center Executive Director Tamara Taitt said if a client has complications beyond the scope of care— such as elevated blood pressure, a breeched baby, or if the baby’s weight is smaller than its gestational age — they are transferred to a local hospital. The birth center also does not offer epidurals, or medications to induce labor, she added.
    
            Birth centers also generally have risk assessment criteria that helps them to determine whether it’s safe for someone to give birth at their facility or if they need to be transferred to a hospital, Taitt said.
    
            The pivot to﻿ birth centers also comes as maternity wards across the nation are closing, with many citing low birth rates and insufficient funds as key reasons for shuttering.
    
            The Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, California — a majority Black and Hispanic city — closed its maternity unit in October. A statement released by the hospital said, “the demand for maternal health services at Centinela has significantly declined over the last several years, with fewer than two deliveries a day.” 
    
            Leseliey Welch, co-founder and co-director of Birth Center Equity, said birth centers are often focused on showing respect, building trust and bonding with families – something women of color across the country desire, especially those who have experienced trauma or racism in health care.
    
            According to a report released in November by the National Partnership For Women & Families, Black women are “twice as likely as White women to report that a medical professional ignored them, refused a request for help, or failed to respond to requests for help in a reasonable amount of time
    
            Welch said she feels the disparity in maternal mortality rates is yet another example of the legacy of systemic racism in America.
    
            “This whole country has operated in a hierarchy of human value based on race,” Welch said. “Our hospitals and health systems are no exception. Survival should be the least we expect in birth care. That’s the least we can do for so many families in this country.”
    
            Fueled by a desire to address those inequalities, Welch said she plans to open Birth Detroit in 2024, the city’s first free-standing birth center led by Black women.
    
            Many birth centers are designed to provide families with the comforts of home. The delivery rooms at the Atlanta Birth Center, for example, resemble bedrooms with queen size beds, lamps, paintings on the walls and changing tables for babies.
    
            On a recent Friday, Kountz eased herself into a light blue velvet chair in a dimly lit room across from her midwife, Anjli Hinman.
    
            “How is your body feeling these days?” Hinman asked.
    
            Kountz, who was 32 weeks pregnant, cupped the side of her belly and explained to Hinman that today had been a good day — she didn’t have much pelvic floor dysfunction and she was able to walk up and down the stairs at home without help.
    
            They chatted for 30 minutes about everything from Kountz’ mental health state and her job as a chiropractor, to her family life, water intake and sleep routines. When they were done, Hinman took Kountz’ blood pressure and used a fetal Doppler to listen to the baby’s heartbeat.
    
            “I see them moving,” Hinman said, as she moved her hand around Kountz’ stomach.
    
            It’s these interpersonal moments, Kountz told CNN, that make appointments at the Atlanta Birth Center, feel so unique. The staff, she added, is fully invested in her physical, mental and emotional health.
    
            Joia Crear-Perry, president and founder of the National Birth Equity Collaborative, said she thinks birth centers are rising in popularity because women want to interact with providers who understand their cultural needs.
    
            Crear-Perry said many women of color also choose to deliver at a birth center to combat the racial bias they say they often experience in traditional health care facilities.
    
            The Breath of My Heart Birthplace has served the Indigenous community of rural northern New Mexico since 2010.  Founder Beata Tsosie-Peña said the facility currently handles about eight childbirths a month, with half of those being Native American families.  According to the CDC, “American Indian and Alaska Native women are two times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than White women.”
    
            Tsosie-Peña said she opened the center because she felt people in the community needed a place that embraced cultural traditions around childbirth with bilingual staff.
    
            Families who deliver at the center are allowed to have ceremonies around the baby’s birth with music, fire, food, herbal medicines and special clothing. A lot of these practices, she noted, might be limited in a hospital setting.
    
            “There are a lot of things that different cultures hold around birthing … and it’s so special and unique,” Tsosie-Peña said. “I think it really focuses on the needs of the client.”
    
            Back in Atlanta, Kountz, said she is looking forward to giving birth in the Atlanta Birth Center’s “Fire Room.” It’s one of three nature-themed birthing rooms at the facility.
    
            The Fire Room boasts an orange and black painting of a tree on the wall, a queen size bed topped with a soft orange and blue comforter, a rocking chair and a canvas that reads, “Some women fear the fire and some women simply become it.”
    
            “It accommodates that desire to feel home and safe and grounded and protected,” Kountz said. “They have aromatherapy, they have music, tapestries, words of affirmation hung up. They are promoting pain coping skills versus narcotics.”
    
            Hinman, Kountz’s midwife, said she believes birth centers are part of the solution to the maternal health crisis facing Black women because of their holistic approach.
    
            Staff members, she said, are closely monitoring their clients even during the postpartum period when many face life-threatening complications and depression.
    
            According to a study published in the journal JBI Evidence Synthesis, while nearly half of maternal deaths occur on the first day of birth; 24% occur between days two and seven; and 25% between days eight and 42. 
    
            Simply checking in with a client, Hinman said, can save their life.
    
            “It feels like family,” Hinman said. “This is a life-changing time for people.”

      Life in prison ‘is not enough’ for this Michigan school shooter, say the parents of one student killed
    ","

    ","
            It’s the harshest penalty available in Michigan, a life sentence without the possibility of parole. But that isn’t enough for the parents of one student killed by a school shooter.
    
            Ethan Crumbley killed four of his classmates and wounded seven other people at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, among them 17-year-old Justin Shilling. Friday, Shilling’s parents will join the hundreds of American families who have had to meld grief with legal procedure.
    
            “I personally feel that when you do something like that, that you should meet the same fate. You can’t just pull the trigger on somebody and then walk away like nothing happened,” Craig Shilling, Justin’s father, told CNN ahead of Crumbley’s scheduled sentencing.
    
            “I actually, I don’t think he’s going to get what he deserves to get, but I feel like he’s going to be punished for the full extent that they can be, but then in my mind that is not enough,” Shilling added.
    
            In October 2022, the gunman pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of first-degree murder and 19 other charges. Prosecutors said at the time they believe this was the first time a mass shooter had ever been convicted of terrorism on state charges for “an act of targeted violence like this.”
    
            The state of Michigan doesn’t have the death penalty, but in September 2023 a judge ruled the shooter is eligible for life without parole, despite him being 15 at the time of the shooting. A lesser sentence of life with the potential for parole could also be handed down.
    
            “I’m praying for life without parole,” Justin Shilling’s mother, Jill Soave, told CNN. “That would be the least amount of justice, you know, that I would consider for his actions.”
    
            “Nothing is enough. You know, he gets to live, and my son doesn’t. So I’m never going to feel satisfied as a parent, but that is the maximum punishment allowed by the law. So I am praying that the judge will make that decision,” Soave added.
    
            Justin’s parents are among those planning to provide a victim impact statement to the court at the sentencing hearing Friday to talk about how their lives have changed since the shooting.
    
            “I’m very grateful that Friday we do have the final sentencing for the shooter. That part, to be over, is going to be huge for me,” Soave said. “Being in the courtroom with a person that murdered my son, I don’t want to do that. It’s hard, but I’m going to speak for myself and for Justin,” she said as she fought back tears.
    
            Both parents describe “primal” feelings of rage against the shooter, and they want their voices to be heard.
    
            Soave said she can feel Justin’s presence still, that it helps her feel a sense of calm. Shilling hopes to keep a similar level of composure.
    
            “That’s all that I can do, try and keep myself composed enough to get through my speech,” he said. “And make sure that I do the best for my son.”
    
            In some of Justin Shilling’s final moments, he was hiding in a bathroom with another student, Keegan Gregory, who was texting his family groupchat in real time as everything played out.
    
            “IM [sic] HIDING IN THE BATHROOM, OMG, HELP, MOM,” read a series of messages. “He killed him, OMFG” read the next two.
    
            Then for four excruciating minutes, nothing.
    
            “He wasn’t responding, and I started screaming hysterically,” Meghan Gregory, Keegan’s mother, told CNN.
    
            Finally, a text came through, “I JUST WATCHED HIM KILL SOMEONE,” AND “HE PUT ME UP AGAINST THE WALL” before he texted that he ran and, likely as a result, survived.
    
            “The day he came home, he sat with us and he said, ‘I shouldn’t have left him,’” Gregory said, recalling what her son told her about Justin Shilling, who was killed in the same bathroom where Keegan was hiding. “There’s nothing he could’ve done for Justin, but he feels this guilt because they were in it together.”
    
            ﻿Keegan was 15 at the time of the shooting and for years has gone to therapy to try and process what happened. He’s now moved away from the area to a different school. “He couldn’t go back into Oxford. He tried. But it was too much for him,” Meghan Gregory said.
    
            While CNN sat with his mother, Keegan was working on his victim impact statement, something he initially wanted nothing to do with, his mother said. Now, “he feels it’s important that he gets up there.”
    
            “He’s a completely different person” than he used to be, his mother told CNN. “Having that innocence ripped from him changed him. He doesn’t get the childhood that most kids get.”
    
            While the sentencing in the criminal case is one major thing these families are dealing with, they’ve also filed civil lawsuits alleging the school and some of its employees should have done more to stop the shooting from happening in the first place.
    
            “I’m not really one of those guys that’s just gonna go out and sue, sue, sue,” said Craig Shilling. That said, “You have to have accountability. You have to know that everything, every rock was overturned, you looked everywhere, that all the questions got asked and answered,” he added.
    
            An independent report commissioned by the Oxford Board of Education, and released in October, found in part, “that had proper threat assessment guidelines been in place and District threat assessment policy followed, this tragedy was avoidable.”
    
            Ven Johnson, President of Ven Johnson Law in Detroit and Flint, Michigan, is representing a number of the Oxford shooting victims and families, including the Shillings and Gregorys, who have filed state and federal lawsuits.
    
            “What we do in civil law is we go after everybody who’s culpable,” Johnson told CNN. “Their own paid-for report says they screwed up and could have prevented the shooting. And they didn’t. And yet, they’re still here in court, trying to get out of being held responsible.”
    
            A portion of their civil claims center on the morning of the November 2021 shooting. Ethan Crumbley’s teacher found a note on his desk. It had a drawing of a handgun pointed at the words, “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me,” as another section showed someone who appeared to have been shot twice and the words “blood everywhere,” according to the lawsuit.
    
            That was among the warnings that prompted a meeting with school officials and his parents. His parents resisted the idea of taking him out of school, so he returned to class, according to the civil lawsuit. No one ever checked his backpack.
    
            Hours later, he went into a bathroom with that backpack and came out with a gun, according to criminal prosecutors.
    
            However, in state civil court, a judge sided with the school district, ruling the district was protected by governmental immunity and that the employees were not the “direct cause of the injury or damage.”
    
            “That’s all B.S., if you ask me. I mean, you have to, you have to own up to your mistakes, no matter what they are,” Shilling said.
    
            Meghan Gregory told CNN she won’t be able to rest until anyone who may be found culpable in the school district is held accountable.
    
            “I cannot let it go,” she said.
    
            CNN has reached out to attorneys for the school district about the appeals process and for comment about governmental immunity wins they have had in state circuit court, but has not received a response.
    
            The families are in an appeals process for their cases filed at the state and federal levels, and if successful, the state case, for example, could be “absolutely a potential landmark decision under Michigan law” in terms of governmental immunity, Johnson said.
    
            Michigan is one of many states that extends some protections from civil lawsuits to government agencies and workers while engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.
    
            “It’s absolutely, absolutely, in my opinion, it is denial of equal protection, it’s unconstitutional, and it should be thrown out. And that’s one of many arguments we’re making on appeal,” Johnson said.
    
            Regardless of all the court efforts, none of them will bring back the four people who were killed in this shooting, 16-year-old Tate Myre, 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, and Justin Shilling.
    
            “He was the only Justin Shilling there ever will be,” Craig Shilling told CNN. It’s part of why he said they started the CHOOCH Foundation, which stands for Caring and Helping Others Often Creates Hope, in honor of Justin, because “that’s the kind of person he was,” said Shilling.
    
            Jill Soave also created the “Forever Justin Shilling Foundation” to honor his love for nature. She told CNN Shilling was an organ donor and helped save the lives of six others through donations of his organs and tissue.
    
            It’s a reality that’s helped Soave cope, she says, even as she prepares to stare down his killer.
    
            “I wouldn’t say that I will ever forgive him. And I don’t think I’m required to. But I have to accept that this has happened,” Soave said. “The grieving doesn’t end. It’s an ongoing process of trying to learn how to live how to get through every day.”
    
            “I have not held [onto] anything and when I need to fall onto my knees and pray and cry and scream, I’ve allowed myself to do that,” she said.

      ‘Completely ignored’: Why health problems caused by childbirth are neglected
    ","
			By Jessie Gretener, CNN
		;Jessie Gretener","
  Published
        3:49 PM EST, Thu December 7, 2023
    ","
            Expansive new research says that more than a third of women globally experience lasting health problems caused by childbirth, saying the conditions are often “neglected” and “ignored.”
    
            The study, published Wednesday in The Lancet Global Health, is a call to action to better the quality of life for women in the months and years after birth.
    
            The study, which examined health problems arising or continuing six weeks after childbirth, says that many complications after birth are “rarely acknowledged.”
    
            The most common complication is pain during sex, which affects more than a third (35%) of postpartum women, the study says. This can be a significant stress for couples trying to relearn intimacy after changing their relationship dynamic with the addition of a child.
    
            Other common complications include low back pain (32%), anal incontinence (19%), urinary incontinence (8-31%), anxiety (9-24%), depression (11-17%), perineal pain (11%) and fear of childbirth (6-15%). Just over a tenth of women also experienced secondary infertility, the inability to get pregnant after a complication-free first pregnancy.
    
            The researchers – from the World Health Organization and institutions around the world – say many of these conditions can be difficult for women and health care providers, stemming from cultural and political stigmas.
    
            Dr. Pascale Allotey, director of WHO’s Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research, said in a statement that these conditions cause “considerable suffering” in the day-to-day life of women long after birth.
    
            Allotey, who was not involved in the study, said that women who have medium- to long-term health complications from childbirth are “largely underappreciated, underrecognized, and underreported.”
    
            “Throughout their lives, and beyond motherhood, women need access to a range of services from health-care providers who listen to their concerns and meet their needs - so they not only survive childbirth but can enjoy good health and quality of life,” Allotey urged.
    
            The findings of this study play a part in a bigger narrative, with women’s health often overlooked. According to WHO, women face greater barriers than men when it comes to accessing health information and services. These barriers include lack of awareness of the specific health needs of women, discriminatory attitudes within communities and by health care providers, and lack of access to decision-making power.
    
            The report is one of several papers in a special series by The Lancet, backed by the United Nations’ Special Programme on Human Reproduction, WHO and the US Agency for International Development. The series highlights the need to broaden maternal health care, including before and after pregnancy.
    
            While the new report celebrates the collective efforts that have shrunk the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to its lowest level in history, the authors recommend looking beyond that to other health care complications.
    
            “Many of the medium-term and long-term (and often chronic) complications, which emerge after 6 weeks following childbirth, are comparatively less visible, or completely ignored,” the report says.
    
            The authors also note that health providers can be “ill-equipped to address these chronic conditions” when some women have birth-related complications after their access to postpartum care has ended.
    
            The report points to a “scarcity of data” as a critical hurdle, saying that many common complications are “not prioritised from a public health perspective.”
    
            These data gaps are particularly significant for low- and middle-income countries, where the “scale of the burden” is not fully available.
    
            The authors conclude the call to action for greater recognition, increased funding and access to information, arguing that “neglect” toward these health issues results in “low visibility, financing, and collective effort.”
    
            “Countries should prioritise the development and implementation of health policies that address the full range of health conditions that tend to emerge long after the time of birth,” the authors say.

      Post-Roe, nearly 1 in 5 people seeking an abortion traveled out of state, analysis finds
    ","

    ","
            With abortion banned in more than a dozen states and restricted in many others, it’s become about twice as common for people in the United States to travel across state lines for their abortion care, a new analysis found.
    
            Nearly 1 in 5 people who had an abortion in the first half of 2023 – more than 92,000 people – traveled across state lines for their care, according to a report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights. In a similar timeframe in 2020, before the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion, less than 1 in 10 people left their home state for an abortion – about 50,000 fewer people.
    
            The data probably understates the impact that the Dobbs decision has had, says Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist with the Guttmacher Institute and lead researcher for the new report. More people are traveling for abortion care, and they’re traveling farther – largely because many states with bans and restrictions border each other.
    
            “Folks from Texas, for example, might have been traveling to Oklahoma [in 2020]. Now, in 2023, those folks are still traveling, but they can’t travel to Oklahoma anymore. It leads to a situation where people have to cross multiple state lines and travel very far distances,” Maddow-Zimet said. “And when you have to travel so much farther, the costs start to multiply. It really implies much higher financial costs and much higher logistical costs.”
    
            The increase in travel is changing the clinical needs for people seeking abortions, and providers are adapting.
    
            Clinics in Ohio are seeing patients at later gestational age, said Dr. Adarsh Krishen, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio. And although medication abortion is still most common, more patients are opting for procedural abortion, he said, especially those who have traveled from other states who want to be sure it was effective.
    
            “We treat each patient as an individual. Our commitment is to make sure that they’re getting the health care they need and deserve,” Krishen said. “There are just added layers of complexity.”
    
            Supporting patients outside of the exam room also looks different.
    
            “The abortion itself is the same no matter if you come from a banned state or you come from a state where abortion is still protected,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder and chief executive officer of Whole Woman’s Health, an abortion provider with clinics in multiple states. “But when a patient is in our clinic, lots of different things come into effect.”
    
            People who traveled for abortion care may have time pressures, with a flight to catch or a long drive home, she said. Many have driven hundreds of miles and often travel with the family – both children and elders – whom they support.
    
            Whole Woman’s Health has adapted its waiting rooms accordingly, Hagstrom Miller said. In New Mexico, for example, clinics have a separate waiting room area with toys, snacks and comfortable couches to better serve patients and their families, especially those who have traveled for long hours.
    
            Nearly three-quarters of the abortions in New Mexico were provided to people who had traveled across state lines, according to the new data from the Guttmacher Institute. More than 8,200 people from out of state had an abortion in New Mexico in the first half of 2023. Only Illinois and North Carolina saw more out-of-state patients.
    
            “The amount of things that people bring with them, literally and figuratively, is very different,” Hagstrom Miller said. “They’re tired and fatigued, but mostly they’re just so resolved. They’ve gone through so much to get that appointment. There is not indecision.”
    
            The new data from the Guttmacher Institute is based on a monthly survey of a core set of providers and broadened to the state level using a model that also factors in historical trends. Estimates represent abortions provided within formal health care settings, including in-person clinics and telehealth, but do not include data on self-managed abortions, such medication abortion provided by AidAccess.
    
            Earlier reports have found that abortions increased in the US overall after the Dobbs decision, especially in states that border those with bans.
    
            But the abortion landscape in the US continues to fluctuate, and looming uncertainty threatens the abortion access that remains, particularly in the South.
    
            South Carolina had become a “reliable source for abortion care in the region in the post-Dobbs era,” according to the Guttmacher Institute report. More than 40% of abortions there in the first half of 2023 – about 2,500 – were provided to people who traveled from other states, up from 3% in 2020. But a six-week ban took effect in August, and monthly abortions were slashed to a fifth of what they were a month earlier, Guttmacher data shows – an even greater cut than Texas and Georgia saw when their six-week bans took effect.
    
            A pending decision from the Florida Supreme Court could bring similar restrictions to the state, which would have even larger ripple effects, Maddow-Zimet said.
    
            “It really becomes out-of-reach – an obstacle that is perhaps one too many – for many people to be able to access care,” he said.
    
            Abortion bans and restrictions have increased the demand for abortions in many states where it remains legal, but not all of the increase can be attributed to out-of-state patients, the Guttmacher data suggests.
    
            In Illinois, there were nearly 19,000 more abortions in the first half of 2023 than there were in half of 2020. The rise in the number of people who traveled to Illinois for an abortion represent about 70% of that increase, meaning about 30% was among residents seeking care.
    
            “A lot of the policies that states are passing, or other kinds of support that’s available for abortion patients more broadly, may be initially focused on helping folks traveling from out of state – which it does – but it also really helps to improve access for residents of those states,” Maddow-Zimet said. “In Illinois, we have this situation where a lot of clinics have scaled up capacity, a lot of funds have increased support, and that has definitely helped manage the huge amount of people who are coming in. And it’s also improved access for folks living in Illinois. It helps both sides of that story.”
    
            Still, despite the increased support and rise in abortions overall, broader trends suggest that thousands were not able to overcome the increased barriers to care.
    
            A separate analysis estimated that nearly a quarter of people seeking an abortion in the US were unable to get one due to bans that took effect after the Dobbs decision, leading to about 32,000 more births than expected in the first half of 2023.
    
            “How many people get left behind? We get to see and study how many people make it and actually get their abortion. It’s much more difficult to study the folks that don’t,” Hagstrom Miller said. “And now there’s this huge, different borderland – what does it mean to be on the frontier? What does it mean to be in southwestern Virginia or southern Illinois or Kansas, and what’s that going to mean for the people who travel into those places?”

      Family’s pet ‘wolf-hybrid’ kills 3-month-old baby in Alabama, sheriff’s office says

    ","
            A 3-month-old baby in Alabama died after being bitten by a “wolf-hybrid” kept as the family’s pet, according to the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office.
    
            Around 12:54 p.m. on Thursday, sheriff’s deputies, firefighters and county animal control officers responded to a 911 call about an apparent animal attack involving an infant at a home in Chelsea, the sheriff’s office said in a news release.
    
            The infant was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead due to injuries suspected to have been caused by the animal, the release said.
    
            A wolf-hybrid is a term for a canine with mixed wolf and dog ancestry. The family was aware there was wolf in the dog’s lineage, Shelby County Coroner Lina Evans confirmed to CNN on Saturday.
    
            By request of law enforcement, the animal was euthanized at the scene and taken to the Alabama State Diagnostics Laboratory.
    
            The death remains under investigation and an autopsy will be performed, Evans said.
    
            “We are deeply saddened by this unfortunate and tragic event,” Chelsea Mayor Tony Picklesimer said in a statement Friday. “We lift up the family and all those affected with our deepest prayers and thoughts.”
    
            In further comments to CNN, Picklesimer noted Alabama is one of just four states to allow ownership of exotic pets.
    
            He offered a word of caution to exotic pet owners, according to CNN affiliate WBRC.
    
            “It’s just unthinkable that this could happen to this baby,” he said. “If you choose to own an exotic pet, what comes with that is additional responsibilities to be sure that not only your family is safe, but your neighbors are safe.”
    
            Chelsea is about 20 miles southeast of Birmingham and has about 16,000 people, according to the US Census.

      ‘It was a wake-up call’: After Roe v. Wade, French lawmakers seek to enshrine abortion rights
    ","
			By Maya Szaniecki and Claudia Colliva, CNN

  Published
        1:00 AM EST, Sat December 2, 2023
    ","
            When the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, French women were paying close attention. They watched with alarm as those across the Atlantic lost their long-standing right to abortion, seemingly overnight. What if France came next?
    
            “It was a wake-up call for everyone,” French Senator Mélanie Vogel told CNN. “We don’t want to wake up like American women… with this right being taken from us,” she said.
    
            A year and a half later, France is en route to enshrine the right to abortion in its constitution, a move that would make it very difficult for future parliaments to chip away at it with restrictive legislation.
    
            Left-wing lawmakers like Vogel are leading the charge, but the bill has garnered rare cross-party support. It’s backed by the French government itself, with President Emmanuel Macron recently promising that “in 2024, women’s freedom to have an abortion will be irreversible.”
    
            If the bid is successful, the French constitution will become the first in the world to include the right to abortion, according to Stephanie Hennette-Vauchez, a public law professor and constitutional expert..
    
            Although the motion has garnered broad support in France, there has been no shortage of criticism from right-wing lawmakers. Politicians such as Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally party, have suggested constitutionalization is pointless, as abortion rights in France are not under threat.
    
            “France is not the United States’ 51st federal state,” Bardella said on French TV, “there is no serious widespread political movement in France calling into question the [abortion] law.”
    
            Meanwhile, women’s rights advocates insist that enshrining abortion rights in the constitution, while important, will do nothing to facilitate access, a growing issue in rural parts of France.
    
            “Access to abortion in France today is very unequal depending on the area,” French Senator Laurence Rossignol told CNN. In Paris, access is “much easier than if you live in what we now call a medical desert,” she added.
    
            For many women in France, the overturning of Roe v. Wade last summer hit too close to home. Popular French TV host Enora Malagré, who has spoken openly about her own abortion aged 20, said she was distraught when she heard the news.
    
            “When we heard in France that the United States was moving in this direction, we cried a lot,” she told CNN.  “We said to ourselves, if this is happening to our friends in the US, it’s catastrophic.”
    
            Currently, abortion rights in France are protected by a 1975 law which has been amended on numerous occasions, most recently in 2022, to lengthen the time frame for legal abortions from 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. Like all laws, however, it could be revoked by a vote in the French parliament.
    
            Changing the constitution, on the other hand, is a much more challenging process, requiring either a national referendum or a 3/5th majority vote in the French Congress — a special body composed of both chambers of parliament. According to backers of the bill, therefore, constitutionalization would safeguard abortion rights even if a pro-life majority were to be voted into office.
    
            Rossignol believes that the overturning of Roe v. Wade had a huge impact on public opinion in France, instilling a fear that abortion rights could be placed under threat at any moment.
    
            “The United States is perceived as… a liberal country… a country that resembles ours,” she told CNN. “The idea that this could happen in a country like the US got everyone thinking: Are we safe?”
    
            The sentiment is echoed by organizations in France on the front line of the fight for reproductive rights, who are fearful of further reversals globally.
    
            “When the far right came into power in certain countries, one of the first things they attacked was… the right to abortion,” said Sarah Durocher, president of Planning Familial, the French branch of Planned Parenthood International. “I don’t see why France would be an exception,” she added.
    
            Last year, Hungary’s hardline nationalist government made it mandatory for women to listen to the fetal heartbeat before an abortion. In Poland, where abortions are only allowed in the event of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s health, further restrictions were passed in 2020, when abortions on the grounds of fetal defect were outlawed by the conservative Law and Justice party. Just last week, Argentina elected a far-right president who has pledged to reverse the abortion rights the country acquired in 2020.
    
            In France, recent polling data suggests 86% of people are now favorable to the constitutionalization of abortion rights.
    
            On November 3, the French government presented a draft text to France’s highest administrative court. Once the text is approved, the Congress will convene in the Palace of Versailles to vote on it. If a majority vote is achieved, the amendment will be added to the constitution.
    
            Macron’s government currently holds enough support in parliament to presume a positive vote.
    
            “We have to do it now,” said Vogel, who submitted the first draft proposal in August 2022. “We have a majority in parliament. We have a majority in society. So it’s now or never,” she concluded.
    
            Many, including Vogel, fear that the growing popularity of right-wing political parties in France might make a similar amendment impossible to pass as early as the next French elections in 2027.
    
            Despite voting in favor of the bill, right-wing political leader Marine Le Pen, who won 41.5% of the French vote in the 2022 presidential election, has traditionally supported rollbacks on abortion rights.
    
            Just last year, the National Rally lawmaker opposed the extension of the legal abortion time frame from 12 to 14 weeks. In those two weeks “the medical act completely changes in nature,” Le Pen told French media outlet Brut, “it is much more traumatizing for women.”
    
            Like other right-wing leaders, Le Pen has also said the proposal to constitutionalize abortion rights is “completely useless.”
    
            Earlier this year, an anti-abortion campaign group called Les Survivants (The Survivors) brought this sentiment into the public domain, plastering stickers with anti-abortion messages onto Paris’s public rental bikes.
    
            In a statement issued in May, the group said this move was a direct response to the efforts to enshrine abortion rights in the French constitution.
    
            Even among those advocating for the constitutionalization of the amendment, there has been debate over its exact wording.
    
            The current draft submitted by the government accords women the “freedom” to access abortions rather than the “right” to do so, as had been the case in Vogel’s first draft.
    
            The exact phrasing of the article reads: “The law determines the conditions under which a woman’s freedom to resort to a voluntary interruption of pregnancy, which is guaranteed to her, is exercised.”
    
            Hennette-Vauchez, the constitutional expert, is wary that this “watered-down” version of the text might not be as effective at safeguarding abortion rights as the original. While the article guarantees the freedom to have an abortion, it also gives lawmakers leeway to determine the conditions under which this freedom can be exercised, she explained, a power that could be abused in the future.
    
            Additionally, the constitutional amendment per se will do nothing to address France’s growing problem with abortion access, according to Hennette-Vauchez. “You can put it in the constitution,” she said, but that’s “not going to open up a service that actually does abortions … less than 120 km (75 miles) from where you live.”
    
            Recent cuts to public health funding have led to the closure of hundreds of maternity clinics in France, making access to abortions, although legal, difficult for many, said Durocher. Her organization, Planning Familial, has assisted several women needing to travel to different areas of the country to get abortions, she added.
    
            The closure of maternity clinics has also limited the access to surgical abortions, which made up just 22% of abortions in France in 2022. According to Durocher, this predominance of medication abortions is evidence of a lack of choice when it comes to reproductive rights and care.
    
            Even if its impact could be limited, however, all the women with whom CNN spoke consider constitutionalization an important step.
    
            At the moment, there are only three constitutions in the world that mention abortion, all  with the purpose of outlawing it, Hannette-Vauchez explained. “If we are the first country to gesture towards a freedom to have an abortion in the constitution,” she said, “it opens up a conversation about why we have been living in a world where reproductive issues are silenced by constitutions globally.”
    
            Vogel is determined to continue to speak up.
    
            “Anti-choice movements and reactionary forces are organized and they are strong, but we are stronger and we should never give up on fighting for abortion rights,” said Vogel. “It’s at the core of having an egalitarian society.”

      Chris Christie says he wouldn’t sign 6-week federal abortion ban
    ","
			By Alison Main, CNN

  Published
        4:08 PM EST, Tue November 28, 2023
    ","
            Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday he would not sign a six-week federal abortion ban as president because he does not believe such legislation aligns with the views of the American public.
    
            “One thing I know for sure is there is no consensus around a six-week abortion ban nationally,” the GOP presidential candidate said Tuesday on “CNN This Morning,” pointing to recent victories at the ballot box for supporters of abortion rights since the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling was overturned last year.
    
            Christie has said that he personally opposes abortion and that he would only sign a federal bill restricting the procedure if it represented a national consensus, something he acknowledges would be difficult in a divided Congress.
    
            By weighing in specifically on a six-week ban, Christie sought to draw a contrast with some of his Republican rivals on an issue that the party has struggled with following the elimination of federal abortion protections with the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision.
    
            Christie told CNN he thinks primary rival Nikki Haley’s recent comments saying she would sign a six-week abortion ban in her home state of South Carolina if she were still governor could make her potential general election prospects “much more difficult.”
    
            “You could see when [Gov. Ron] DeSantis signed that bill in Florida, it certainly affected his popularity with a broader electorate,” Christie said, referring to a measure the Florida governor signed earlier this year to ban most abortions in the state after six weeks. (That law is currently on hold as the state Supreme Court decides a challenge to an earlier 15-week ban on the procedure.)
    
            Christie pointed out that Haley’s comments on the six-week ban came at an conservative Christian forum earlier this month in Iowa, where she was asked by evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats if she would sign such legislation if she were governor.
    
            “Yes, whatever the people decide, you should go,” Haley said. “I think it’s right to be in the hands of the people. I think that the people decided this was put in the states. That’s where it should be. Everybody can give their voice to it.”
    
            “That’s where the people of South Carolina decided. They decided to be at six weeks as well,” she said. “When we find these states that are more pro-life, it’s a blessing. We should welcome that.”
    
            While Haley has said she would support a 15-week federal abortion ban as president if it were able to get the needed 60 votes in the Senate, she has emphasized that such a scenario is unrealistic. The former governor often describes herself as “unapologetically pro-life” but has said she believes Republicans and Democrats need to find national consensus on the issue.
    
            “I’m going to fight on the side of life every chance I get, but I’m not going to demonize people in the process,” she said at an Iowa evangelical gathering in September.
    
            Christie has sharpened his criticism of Haley in recent weeks, telling CNN on Tuesday, “You can’t say one thing in Iowa and something different in New Hampshire.” A recent CNN poll of the GOP primary in New Hampshire, where Christie has spent most of his time campaigning, found him trailing both former President Donald Trump and Haley, who has also made the state a focus of her efforts to win the GOP nomination.
    
            The former New Jersey governor called the topic of abortion “emotional” and said he thinks the issue should be in the hands of people, not politicians.
    
            “If you are the American people and watch this House of Representatives try to pick a speaker and see what they went through. Watch the Senate not able to promote military officers because they are so paralyzed. You want to put abortion in the hands of those folks? I don’t. As president, I would not sign a six-week abortion ban,” he said.
    
            CNN’s Ebony Davis, Kit Maher and David Wright contributed to this report.

      Idaho asks Supreme Court to let abortion law that penalizes doctors to take full effect

    ","
            Idaho asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow its state abortion ban that imposes penalties on doctors who perform abortions to take full effect despite federal requirements for emergency room doctors.
    
            The case comes to the high court more than a year after the justices overturned a constitutional right to abortion, altering the landscape of abortion rights nationwide and triggering more than half the states, including Idaho, to outlaw or severely restrict the procedure.
    
            Idaho’s Defense of Life Act is a near total ban on abortion, but there is an exception to prevent the mother’s death. The law imposes penalties on doctors who perform prohibited abortions unless the “physician determined in good faith medical judgement and based on the facts known to the physician at the time, that the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.” Physicians who violate the law could face criminal penalties and risks the suspension of their licenses.
    
            But a district court blocked the law in hospital emergency rooms that receive Medicare funding, holding that the state law interferes with a federal Medicare statute.
    
            The United States sued, claiming that a provision of a federal Medicare statue – the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) preempts Idaho’s law in emergency rooms. The federal law requires hospitals to provide stabilizing care to emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay. The law was enacted to ensure that the poor and uninsured receive emergency medical care at hospitals receiving Medicare reimbursement.
    
            In 2022 Judge B. Lynn Winmill of the US District Court for the District of Idaho said that the “broad scope” of Idaho’s near total ban on abortion meant that he was not convinced that it would be possible for emergency health care workers to “simultaneously comply with obligations” under both state and federal law. “The state law must therefore yield to federal law to the extent of that conflict.”
    
            A federal appeals court initially agreed to put the district court ruling on hold pending appeal, but a larger panel of judges on the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the stay on November 13.
    
            Now the state, represented by a conservative legal group that opposes abortion, is asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to put the district court ruling on hold while appeals play out.
    
            “After Dobbs,” Erin Hawley a lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom told the justices in court papers, “the United States adopted the novel view that EMTALA creates a federal right to abortion in emergency rooms, even though EMTALA is silent on abortion and actually requires stabilizing for the unborn children of pregnant women.”
    
            A similar case is pending in Texas.

      An Alabama mom is pregnant in each of her two uteruses in an extremely rare case of twins

    ","
            Kelsey Hatcher’s fourth pregnancy started like most others: with a missed period.
    
            From there, a home pregnancy test turned positive, and she shared the news with her husband, Caleb, who has always been “the greatest encourager.” The Hatchers, who live in Dora, Alabama, thought they were done with middle-of-the night feedings after their youngest was born in 2021.
    
            “When I told him I was pregnant again, he’s like, ‘OK, well, what’s one more? It’ll be great. It’ll be fine,’ ” she said.
    
            At her first ultrasound appointment, about eight weeks into her pregnancy, things took an unexpected turn.
    
            The ultrasound technician quickly found the baby and told Hatcher everything looked perfect. The baby was healthy.
    
            Then Hatcher remembered to tell the tech that her anatomy was a little different. She was born with two uteruses, a condition called uterine didelphys.
    
            “So if you’re scanning and maybe catch a glimpse of it or something, don’t think it’s just something random or there’s something wrong. There is a totally separate uterus there,” said Hatcher, 32.
    
            Hatcher said the ultrasound tech thanked her for letting her know and said she would just take a quick peek at the second uterus to make sure everything looked good.
    
            “And as soon as she moved the ultrasound wand over to the other side of my belly, I said, ‘Oh, my gosh! There’s another one.’ “
    
            Hatcher didn’t even need to be told there was another baby. She could see it herself.
    
            “The nurse practitioner that I met with that day, she was just blown away. She said, ‘I’m not even sure what the statistics of this are,’ ” Hatcher recalled. 
    
            The odds are mind-boggling. About 3.6 million babies were born in the US last year, but only about 114,000 of those births were twins, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            In other words, about three sets of twins are born for every 200 live births, according to the CDC, and two of those sets are likely to be fraternal, which means they come from two separate fertilized eggs.
    
            Hatcher’s condition is rare, too: About 1 in 2,000 women is born with uterine didelphys.
    
            In order for her to become pregnant in both of her uteruses at the same time, two eggs had to be fertilized, one in each uterus.
    
            Like most women, Hatcher has two ovaries, the glands that store and release eggs.  Each of her ovaries feeds a single uterus. Typically, ovaries take turns releasing eggs, sending one into the uterus each cycle for a chance at being fertilized. Occasionally, however, an ovary may release more than one egg during each cycle, a phenomenon called hyperovulation.
    
            Hyperovulation hasn’t been extensively researched, but one 2006 study of 500 women found that about 1 in 5 of them was able to hyperovulate. But even for those women, it doesn’t happen each cycle. When it does, sometimes a single ovary may release two eggs. And even more infrequently, both ovaries will release a single egg at the same time, which is what happened in Hatcher’s case.
    
            Case studies estimate the chances of pregnancy like this – a woman with two uteruses carrying a baby in each one at the same time – at around 1 in 2 billion in the general population, though it’s impossible to know for sure with something this infrequent.
    
            Hatcher was about seven times more likely to win a Powerball jackpot and about 131,000 times more likely to get hit by lightning at some point in her life.
    
            Uterine didelphys happens in the first weeks of a baby’s development. Females are born with two uterine horns, or halves, that normally fuse to form one larger cavity. With didelphys, the uterine walls don’t fuse as they should, and women are born with two.
    
            Hatcher says she got lucky, in a way, because some women with uterine didelphys have only one working uterus; the other can’t support a pregnancy. But her medical records show that she has carried babies in both of hers, just never before at the same time.
    
            Even her doctors are playing it by ear.
    
            “Even in medical school, we don’t really learn about this because this is such a rare thing,” said Dr. Shweta Patel, who is Hatcher’s obstetrician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
    
            “Because it’s such an unusual circumstance, we did not have as much guidance for her prenatal care,” Patel said. “We know a lot about how to take care of twin pregnancies in general when there’s one uterus involved, and so extrapolating the patient care for that is what we’ve been doing for Kelsey.”
    
            Both babies are girls, and they are growing well. At 34 weeks gestation, they are right on track, Hatcher says.
    
            One thing that’s different with this pregnancy, Hatcher says, is that in certain positions, she has not just one baby bump but two.
    
            When she lies in her recliner in the evening, “the girls will separate, almost, and you can see vividly the two separate wombs, because there’s a big gap in my stomach where they fall to one side or the other.”
    
            The babies are technically twins, but because they don’t share a womb and can’t touch each other, Hatcher has wondered whether they’ll have a bond as some other twins do.
    
            “I’m very curious to see how they turn out, as if they’ll have any type of connection like that or if they’ll just be siblings,” she said.
    
            Her due date is Christmas, but Hatcher knows it’s not likely that she’ll make it that far, since being pregnant with multiples makes preterm birth more likely.
    
            “I’ve moreso just wanted to make it to December,” she said.
    
            Hatcher wants to have a vaginal birth, but with two uteruses, it’s unclear how labor and delivery will play out.
    
            “I think birth is probably the biggest unknown,” Patel said.
    
            The medical team isn’t sure whether both uteruses will begin contracting at the same time or whether the babies will be born separately. Perhaps one side will go into labor, but the other doesn’t, so they might have to induce labor on that side with hormones. Maybe Hatcher will need a c-section. “We won’t know until we see it,” Patel said.
    
            In the meantime, Hatcher and her husband have their bags packed, and she’s trying to work as much as possible – she’s a massage therapist – because they need the income. Friends have started a GoFundMe page to help with unexpected expenses, including home renovations, child care and missed income after the twins are born.
    
            “Things could go really quickly, and I could go into labor tonight,” Hatcher said. “Or it could take a little while. We’re prepared. We’re ready for at any point. Whenever it happens, it happens.”
    
            One thing they have not yet figured out are the girls’ names. Their other three children, two girls and a boy, ages 6, 4 and 2, all have names that start with the letter R, and Hatcher says they plan to stick with that for the twins. Beyond that, nothing is settled.
    
            Her son was a little upset at first when he found out that both babies were girls, but now he’s getting excited about being a big brother.
    
            She says the rareness of this pregnancy makes it all the more meaningful to them.
    
            “There’s no denying the miracle in these babies and knowing that they are here for something great, because for all of that to line up perfectly and it to happen the way that it has, you can’t question that, you know?”

      Births have increased in states with abortion bans, research finds
    ","

    ","
            Nearly a quarter of people seeking an abortion in the United States were unable to get one due to bans that took effect after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, researchers estimate. In the first half of 2023, states with abortion bans had an average fertility rate that was 2.3% higher than states where abortion was not restricted, according to the analysis – leading to about 32,000 more births than expected.
    
            The findings are based on preliminary births data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The research has not yet been peer-reviewed but experts say the data paints a clear picture about the direct impact of abortion restrictions.
    
            “It’s an assault on reproductive autonomy,” said Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She was not involved in the new analysis, but has published research on the effect that a strict abortion law had on births in Texas.
    
            “We don’t always detect signals in these population aggregates because there’s a lot of variation when you group everybody together. The fact that there is a signal at the population level means that something’s really going on. It’s pretty strong evidence.”
    
            Fertility rates – the number of births per women of reproductive age – don’t typically change dramatically. A “shock” like Covid-19, for example, led to a “temporary baby bust,” said Gemmill, who has also researched infertility during the pandemic. The 4.5% decrease in fertility rate in the first year of the pandemic was the largest in decades, according to CDC data.
    
            Other research has found that the number of abortions increased nationwide in the year following the Dobbs decision, with especially large increases in states that border those with bans. But complete data on the number of abortions provided to people who crossed states lines for their care is not yet available, and the new research suggests that travel remains a significant barrier to access.
    
            After the Dobbs decision, fertility rates increased most significantly in states with longer travel times to the nearest abortion providers, the new research found, including a 5.1% increase in Texas and a 4.4% increase in Mississippi.
    
            Abortions have been trending up in the US for years. But rising birth rates could indicate that unmet need persists, despite an increase in the number of abortions in the year post-Dobbs.
    
            “One might think that those data conflict,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco’s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. She was not involved in the new analysis, but is co-chair of the #WeCount project that tracks abortion trends. “But in actuality, we’ve known that there are many people who still can’t get abortions.”
    
            While some people may have been able to travel out of banned states for an abortion, abortions are likely also increasing among residents of states where it remains legal as additional resources and support help to address unmet need that existed even before Roe v. Wade was overturned, she said.
    
            Earlier research has found that there are many consequences of unintended birth, affecting the health and livelihood of the mother, the child and the family in general. And the new research found that abortion bans have especially affected Hispanic women, with a 4.7% increase in fertility rate in the first half of 2023, as well as younger women, with a 3.3% increase among those in their early 20s.
    
            “Restricted access to abortion services causes this domino effect,” said Rachel Hardeman, a professor of health and racial equity at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the new research. People who do not have the resources to overcome additional barriers, such as costly travel to an out-of-state provider, may then have less opportunity to build long-term financial security.
    
            “[The Dobbs decision] has had a profound impact on birthing people’s ability to decide what their family looks like and how they navigate that,” she said. “All of the material resources necessary for a family to not just barely survive, but to thrive in our society are going to be impacted by their ability to access health care, broadly speaking, and abortion care, specifically.”
    
            Not all people who seek an abortion have an unwanted pregnancy, experts say. Some are wanted pregnancies with fetal abnormalities or other life-threatening conditions – and some of the increase in births likely includes unviable pregnancies that were carried to term.
    
            “Infant mortality is one of these more concrete consequences that we can measure right now, and we are seeing impacts there,” Gemmill said. In Texas, for example, infant mortality increased about 12% in 2022, including a 22% spike in infant deaths caused by severe genetic and birth defects.
    
            “I think about these women that had to carry these gestations and give birth to them, knowing that they were likely going to die shortly after birth and the trauma related to that,” Gemmill said. “We’re just going to be learning more and more about the consequences.”

      Opinion: An 11-year-old who survived Uvalde says he and his friends will ‘never be the same’
    ","
			Opinion by Danielle Campoamor

        2:37 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023
    ","
            On May 24, 2022, then-fourth-grader Daniel Ruiz managed to escape the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas that claimed the lives of 19 of his classmates and two teachers.  Daniel climbed out of classroom 109 to safety through broken glass.
    
            But Daniel, now 11, says the fun-loving kid he was, prior to that fateful day, did not survive the massacre. He doesn’t know anyone who is the same person after that experience.
    
            “Sometimes, when my anxiety makes me zone out, I wish that I would just be back in the fourth grade and wake up and this would just be a bad, bad dream,” Daniel told me. “My friends, cousins and I will never be the same again … I miss how happy I used to be. I hate how I can’t stop my head from spinning or thinking of things that can go bad.”
    
            Gun violence is the leading cause of death for children living in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and around 132 people succumb to gun-related injuries each day.  Yet these harrowing statistics do not fully or adequately encapsulate the true, ever-lasting harm caused by acts of gun violence.
    
            The children left behind — kids with mental, physical and emotional scars, like Daniel — lose a piece of their former selves, too. And even when they have access to quality mental, physical and emotional support, they face numerous uphill battles that impact their quality of life. Sometimes, forever.
    
            According to a recent study published in the journal Health Affairs, in the one-year period after a shooting, survivors’ health care costs increased by about $34,884, or a 17.1-fold increase.
    
            The study, which only evaluated children who had associated health insurance claims, does not include those who do not have access to health insurance or who cannot afford any out-of-pocket costs for physical, mental and emotional care.
    
            From the needs of children who were injured to those for whom the scars of gun violence are not visible, simply having access to health care coverage in the US — already inaccessible to far too many — does not guarantee that a child will fully recover from an act of gun violence.
    
            “I’m a single parent doing it on my own, so any appointments he has or even my other children have, means I have to miss work and it makes it so hard,” Briana Ruiz, Daniel’s mom, told me. “It cost me so much and got to the point where I was afraid I was going to lose (our) home … When Daniel has bad days, I can’t always afford to keep him home and make sure he’s OK mentally, because if I do, I’ll fall behind on my bills and I can’t let that happen.”
    
            Dr. Chethan Sathya, a pediatric trauma surgeon and director of the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at Northwell Health, told me that if US legislators lack the political will to pass common sense gun legislation that curbs the epidemic of gun violence, health care supports for children needs to change in order to adequately meet an increase in pediatric gun violence patients.
    
            “So few resources have been poured into this issue,” Sathya told me. “A lot of the services we’re talking about are beyond surgical care… If someone comes in with a gunshot wound, our trauma team is activated and we care for them surgically.” Her team is not resourced to provide ongoing care for disability, PTSD, substance use or other behavior health issues that may present in the aftermath of a shooting.
    
            As a result, Sathya says that when he has a patient with a gun injury and they survive, he does not know if that patient is “going to have everything they need for rehabilitation.”
    
            “How am I going to know that they have adequate follow-up and social work and case management?” he asks. “A lot of patients who aren’t even able to come in for follow-up care for their wounds get secondary infections — complications that are totally preventable just from the surgeries that we do to repair the wounds.”
    
            In addition, pediatric gunshot victims are often cared for by a burnt out and overworked hospital care system, where doctors, nurses and support staff are facing their own mental health issues, staffing shortages and inadequate workplace environments.
    
            “There is intense trauma among healthcare workers themselves, normalizing — unfortunately — the fact that kids do come in with bullet wounds,” Sathya says. “(Gun violence) affects everybody.”
    
            It is also impacting a crippling mental health care system that is already facing staffing issues, particularly among clinicians of color and at a time when Black children are five times more likely to be a victim of gun violence than their White peers, according to data from PEW Research Center.
    
            “We need people to have more access to not only training programs but creating good training programs. We need to have more diversity and training of diverse groups of people providing (mental health) services,” Dr. Jill Emanuel, vice president of clinical training for the Child Mind Institute, told me.
    
            In addition to a larger and more diverse clinician population, Emanuel says society at large needs to focus more on the mental and emotional needs of young people who manage to escape an act of gun violence with their life.
    
            “Our job as adults and as caretakers of children is to provide as much support for them as possible and to restore their sense of psychological safety.” She notes that people may assume a child is fine if they have access to therapy, but their caretakers also need to be having ongoing conversations with them.
    
            How clinicians are licensed, she adds, can also make a difference. “Right now, we are all licensed in our individual states and there are some initiatives to figure out licensing across state lines,” Emanuel says, noting that making telehealth more accessible and allowing for more reimbursement for health insurances will also eradicate some of the many barriers to long-term care for pediatric gun violence survivors.
    
            For Briana Ruiz, she simply wishes more people understood that just because a child wasn’t struck with a bullet doesn’t mean they’re “perfectly fine and (can) get on with their lives.”
    
            Perhaps then, she hopes, with some societal understanding, her son can start to become the boy he used to be.
    
            “Nobody sees all the anger and uncertainty that these children have to live with for the rest of their lives now … Their worlds were turned completely upside down in a matter of seconds … My son to this day says he can still hear the bullets bouncing off things in his class,” Briana Ruiz says. “He recalls the noise the bullet made when striking a classmate and hearing her and his teacher in pain from being shot. These are the things that are not just going to go away.”

      DeSantis and Ramaswamy share personal stories on campaign trail of their wives’ miscarriages

            GOP presidential candidates Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy shared their wives’ experiences with miscarriages at the Family Leader Thanksgiving forum on Friday.
    
            “Unfortunately, we lost that first baby,” DeSantis said, describing how he and his wife, Casey, struggled to grow their family. “And it was a tough thing because this is something that we had so much hopes for. So much aspirations, but, you know, we just kept the faith.”
    
            Both men, speaking to the gathering of evangelical Christians in Iowa two months ahead of the state’s first-in-the-nation GOP caucuses, stressed the role of their religion in coping with their losses, which they had not previously shared on the campaign trail.
    
            “We wanted to have a family and it didn’t happen at first,” DeSantis said, sitting at a table with Ramaswamy, fellow GOP primary rival Nikki Haley and Family Leader CEO and President Bob Vander Plaats, a longtime GOP powerbroker who is expected to endorse a candidate in the Republican primary soon.
    
            “We eventually took a trip to Israel, when I was a US congressman,” DeSantis continued. “We literally went to Shiloh with Hannah’s Prayer. We went to Ruth’s Tomb and Hebron, Ruth, Chapter Four, Verse 13. And we prayed, we prayed a lot to have a family, and then lo and behold, we go back to the United States, and a lot of time later, we got pregnant.”
    
            After the miscarriage, DeSantis said, he and his wife “just kept praying. We knew that there would be a path that God will lead us on. And lo and behold, you know, short time after we did it, and we had our first baby girl.”
    
            DeSantis said that he and his wife are celebrating their eldest daughter Madison’s seventh birthday next week before Thanksgiving.
    
            The Florida governor often hits the campaign trail with his wife and three children. While he has shared personal stories on the trail, such as meeting his wife, going through her battle with breast cancer, hearing his daughter’s heartbeat for the first time or baptizing his children with holy water from the Sea of Galilee, this was a story he had not previously shared.
    
            It was a particularly touching moment during the forum – which was a mix of policy and personal – and not long after, Ramaswamy shared his own experience.
    
            The tech entrepreneur revealed that his wife, Apoorva, had a miscarriage before getting pregnant with their eldest child, noting that it was the first time he’s shared the personal anecdote.
    
            On stage at the forum, Ramaswamy recalled how his wife had nearly completed her medical residency when she got pregnant, a few years after they were married. He said they were “ecstatic” and “weren’t expecting the blessing, but we were grateful for it.”
    
            “And about three and a half months in, you know, Apoorva, one day she woke up, she said ‘I’m bleeding.’ She had a miscarriage,” he said. “We lost our first child and that was the loss of a life. it was our family’s loss.”
    
            Ramaswamy said his wife went through a state of depression following the miscarriage and that “our faith is what got us through it.”
    
            She got pregnant again shortly afterward but “God wasn’t done testing us,” Ramaswamy recalled.
    
            Apoorva experienced bleeding, leading them to worry about another miscarriage, but at a doctor’s appointment, “they found a heartbeat that was our son, that was our son Karthik.”
    
            He then brought his eldest son on stage and kept him on his lap during the forum.
    
            The two candidates, who were sitting next to each other, did not verbally acknowledge one another’s shared experiences.

      Childhood cancer mortality has fallen significantly in the US, but disparities have emerged, CDC report shows

            The death rate for cancer among children in the United States is a quarter lower than it was two decades ago, but the declines haven’t been equitable across all groups, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            There were 2.1 cancer deaths for every 100,000 children younger than 20 in 2021, down from about 2.8 in 2001, according to the report — a 24% drop.
    
            Death rates dropped at similar rates for Black, White and Hispanic children between 2001 and 2011, and there was not a significant gap in mortality. But rates continued to decline only for White children in the following decade. In 2021, the cancer death rate among Black and Hispanic children was about 20% higher than it was for White children, according to the CDC report.
    
            Childhood cancer mortality dropped across all age groups between 2001 and 2011, but the significant decline continued only among those younger than 10 between 2011 and 2021, the report shows. Still, the cancer death rate among teens — who have had a higher mortality rate than other children — was 23% lower in 2021 than it was in 2001.
    
            Death rates from leukemia, once the most common cause of cancer death among children in the US,  were nearly cut in half between 2001 and 2021.
    
            Brain cancer has since become the leading cause of childhood cancer mortality, leading to about a quarter of all cancer deaths among those younger than 20.
    
            Overall, cancer was the fourth leading cause of death among children ages 1 to 19 in the US, according to data from the CDC.

      Using marijuana during pregnancy may heighten risk for baby
    ","

            Infants born to mothers who used marijuana during pregnancy were twice as likely to be underweight and nearly twice as likely to be premature than infants who were not exposed to cannabis, a new study found.
    
            Cannabis-exposed infants were 2.5 times as likely to be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, compared with unexposed babies, according to the study.
    
            “We know that THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the main psychoactive constituent in cannabis, can cross the placenta from mother to fetus and bind to receptors in the fetal brain,” said first author Maryam Sorkhou, a postdoctoral student at the University of Toronto, in a statement.
    
            “Our study adds to that knowledge by showing that prenatal exposure to cannabis heightens the risk of several adverse birth outcomes.”
    
            Use of marijuana by pregnant women has been growing in the United States and other countries such as Canada in recent decades. A 2019 analysis of over 450,000 pregnant American women ages 12 to 44 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found cannabis use more than doubled between 2002 and 2017.
    
            The vast majority of marijuana use was during the first three months of pregnancy, the study found, and it was predominantly recreational rather than medical.
    
            Yet the first trimester may be one of the most sensitive times for the developing brain of a fetus, when it’s most susceptible to damage. Not only does THC – the compound in marijuana that makes you high – enter the fetal brain from the mother’s bloodstream, but once there it can affect the baby’s developing brain.
    
            Studies have found receptors for cannabis in the brains of animals as early as five and six weeks of gestational age.
    
            Past studies have shown the use of marijuana during pregnancy is linked to low birth weight, impulsivity, hyperactivity, attention issues and other cognitive and behavioral issues in children, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            There’s even a connection to autism. A 2020 study found that women who used weed during pregnancy were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism.
    
            The new review, which published Thursday in the journal Addiction, analyzed 57 studies with a total of nearly 13 million infant participants — over 100,000 of those babies had been exposed to cannabis while in the womb.
    
            There was good news: The study did not find an increased risk of birth defects due to cannabis use. Nor did it find a link between marijuana exposure in the womb and death within a year, including sudden unexpected infant death, or SIDS.
    
            However, mothers using marijuana during pregnancy were 2.6 times more likely to give birth to a baby with a low birth weight, which can contribute to difficulties in eating, gaining weight and fighting infection.
    
            “Low birth weight is one of the strongest predictors of a child’s health and development long-term,” Beth Bailey, professor of psychology and director of population health research at Central Michigan University’s College of Medicine in Mount Pleasant, told CNN in May.
    
            “These kids are more prone to developmental delays, higher rates of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), learning disabilities, and have higher rates of emotional problems,” she said.
    
            In fact, the meta-analysis found babies who were exposed in the womb had poorer attention spans and more problems with behavior in infancy and early childhood.
    
            In addition, mothers using cannabis were 1.7 times more likely to spontaneously deliver their newborn prematurely in comparison with mothers without cannabis use, according to the study.
    
            Premature infants can have issues with breathing and suffer a lack of development in the heart, lungs, brain, metabolism, digestive and immune systems. Indeed, the study also found that infants born to moms using marijuana were 2.5 times more likely to need to be admitted for intensive care.
    
            Any woman using marijuana who discovers she is pregnant should immediately discuss the issue with her doctors, experts say.
    
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has this warning on its website: “Because of concerns regarding impaired neurodevelopment, as well as maternal and fetal exposure to the adverse effects of smoking, women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy should be encouraged to discontinue marijuana use.”
    
            Yet many young women aren’t honest about their use, studies have shown. One study of women 24 years old and younger found they were about twice as likely to screen positive for marijuana use than they stated in self-reports.

      Justice Department charges woman over alleged threats to kill Texas judge in medication abortion case

    ","
            The Justice Department announced charges Tuesday against a Florida woman who allegedly threatened to kill the federal judge in Texas who issued a major ruling that would’ve taken a key medication abortion pill off the market.
    
            Alice Marie Pence, 67, of Port Charlotte, Florida, allegedly placed a phone call in March to a judge’s chambers in Amarillo, Texas, in which she threatened to kill the judge.
    
            While court documents do not identify the judge by name, the only district judge in Amarillo is Matthew Kacsmaryk, who presided over a high-profile challenge to the US Food and Drug Administration’s two-decade-old approval of the medication abortion drug mifepristone. The court filings don’t say anything about Pence’s motivation for the alleged threats and don’t mention the abortion-related case.
    
            Pence is charged with transmitting interstate threats and intending to influence a federal official by threat. She is scheduled for an initial appearance in court next week and has not yet entered a formal plea.
    
            A lawyer for Pence is not yet listed on the court docket. The federal court in Texas did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    
            According to court filings, the allegedly threatening call was placed one day after news broke in March that Kacsmaryk had scheduled a major hearing in the mifepristone case.
    
            In April, Kacsmaryk suspended the FDA’s approval of mifepristone and a federal appeals court later affirmed some parts of his ruling. But the drug has remained available after the Supreme Court earlier this year signed an order saying access to it will be the same until all legal challenges are resolved. DOJ and a manufacturer of the drug have asked the justices to take up the case and overturn the court rulings that would roll back access to the drug.
    
            Tuesday’s announcement comes as federal law enforcement officials face an increasing number of threats from the public. Other federal judges – including both the judge overseeing former President Donald Trump’s classified documents case in Florida and his election subversion case in Washington, DC – have received death threats. Supreme Court justices have also faced increased threats, including one man charged with attempting to murder Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
    
            Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray have repeatedly warned about the rise in threat levels, and have reiterated their commitment to prosecuting those who make criminal threats.
    
            Federal prosecutors also announced charges Tuesday against 44-year-old Daniel Ray Garcia for allegedly sending threatening letters to a federal judge in Lubbock, Texas. The judge is not named in court filings.
    
            Garcia is currently being held in custody, and his lawyers have requested that he be evaluated by a medical professional to determine whether Garcia is competent to stand trial.
    
            CNN has reached out to Garcia’s lawyer for comment.

      Opinion: Marjorie Taylor Greene botches the explanation
    ","

    ","
            On the day after Republicans lost pivotal races in Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia last week, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene offered a diagnosis for her party’s ills. “There’s multiple problems,” the Georgia representative said to CNN’s Manu Raju. “One of them being that I think Republicans are weak. They never come through on the promises that they give to their voters.”
    
            Actually, that is the opposite of the problem Republicans currently face. When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, he promised he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
    
            And he was true to his word. Mexico didn’t pay for the wall, but Trump did nominate three hard-right conservatives who were instrumental in tossing out Roe in June 2022.
    
            The problem for Republicans is that the Supreme Court’s action was hugely unpopular: roughly two-thirds of Americans disapproved of the move, and voters have made that apparent, even in red states. On Tuesday, Ohio voters passed an amendment to the state constitution that guarantees abortion rights.
    
            The disconnect may or may not cost Trump votes in 2024, but it’s hurting Republicans up and down the ballot. “In Virginia,” wrote Kate Bedingfield, President Joe Biden’s former White House communications director, “Gov. Youngkin tried to take the Republicans’ abortion problem head on, claiming that he had articulated a ‘reasonable’ position on the issue that would net Republicans control of both houses of the state legislature. In fact, Virginians didn’t view rolling back existing protections in the state and instituting a new ban as ‘reasonable,’ and Democrats wound up taking the House of Delegates and growing their margin in the State Senate.”
    
            Bedingfield radiated confidence, convinced that Democrats will prevail in 2024, despite last week’s polls showing Biden trailing Trump in five out of six swing states. “Democrats will win in 2024 by making the election a choice, not just a referendum on Biden’s performance in office. They’ll win re-election to the White House and clinch victories across the country by keeping Republicans squarely on the defensive about the most extreme pieces of their agenda.”
    
            Historian Julian Zelizer raised questions about whether voters will turn out for Biden just because they agree with his stance on issues like abortion. And “even if Biden can get a bump from voters who are passionate about defending abortion rights,” he wrote, “polling also shows that core constituencies, such as Black and Latino voters, are having serious doubts about him. A number of Muslim and Arab voters in key states like Michigan have also voiced their dismay over Biden’s strong backing of Israel in its war with Hamas, though the lasting effect isn’t yet clear.”
    
            Republican Lanhee Chen was unfazed by the defeats dealt to his party. “For those looking to extrapolate Tuesday night’s results to what might happen next November, a piece of advice — don’t. Odd-year elections tend to be, well, odd.” The electorate which turns out in a presidential election year is different and the issues that dominate races tend to vary, Chen wrote.
    
            “Finally, none of Tuesday night’s significant elections took place in the states that will likely decide the 2024 presidential elections, or even control of Congress. The lack of reliable election data from voters in states like Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona means that we should be careful to extrapolate what results in states like Kentucky and Mississippi — or even Ohio, where abortion was directly on the ballot — might mean for results in the swing states that will decide who wins the White House next year.”
    
            Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the anti-abortion movement, argued that “these defeats aren’t the seismic victory for abortion rights that Democrats may wish they were. Just because Republicans don’t seem to know how to win over voters doesn’t mean the GOP and the anti-abortion movement don’t know where to go next. They do.”
    
            “The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a presidential transition plan vetted and crafted by more than 70 conservative and pro-life groups, details an abortion policy focused almost entirely on the operations of the Department of Justice in a second Trump term. Project 2025 outlines how to stop enforcement of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which would make it easier for protesters to block and intimidate patients entering clinics.”
    
            “More centrally, Project 2025 insists that there is already a de facto federal ban on abortion, whether voters like it or not: the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that conservatives argue makes it a federal felony to mail or receive items intended, designed, or adapted for abortion.”
    
            While Trump, the leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination, spent the week testifying in a civil fraud case against his company and rallying his supporters in Florida, his rivals took part in a more standard election ritual: a debate in Miami.
    
            In the spotlight was former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, whose debate performances have propelled her candidacy forward. Ana Marie Cox wrote, “I don’t agree with much she has to say, but I bristled in solidarity when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dismissed the female politician’s cordial correspondence with a Chinese official as a ‘love letter’ and when Vivek Ramaswamy employed gendered insults by referring to her (and, I think, DeSantis) as ‘Dick Cheney in three-inch heels.’ Haley later noted that her shoes are five inches and qualify as ammunition, which is certainly one way to make them more acceptable attire for men.”
    
            “At one point, Haley flushed dark purple when Ramaswamy branded her a hypocrite for wanting to crack down on TikTok even though her own daughter has an account. ‘You’re just scum,’ she breathed with the quiet rage usually reserved for horror movie final girls. I have never come closer to cheering anyone for anything at a Republican debate.”
    
            On abortion, Haley “continued her realist approach to the issue, again pointing out that a federal 15-week abortion ban — the goal of many pro-life advocacy groups — would stand almost no chance of passing without a dramatic change in the composition of the US Senate,” Patrick T. Brown observed.
    
            “Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was out to prove,” Roxanne Jones noted “that Florida belongs to him, which was no easy task with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump just down the road in Hialeah, Florida, hosting his own rowdy rally telling the world that Florida is Trump territory.”
    
            “But for once, DeSantis did not seem shaken. For much of the night, he commanded the stage convincingly.”

            Tuesday marked one month since Hamas launched a terror attack in southern Israel and sparked an ongoing war in Gaza.
    
            “Hamas’ massive, brutal attacks and kidnappings perpetrated against Israelis on October 7 violated humanity’s most fundamental international legal principles,” wrote Mary Ellen O’Connell, an international law expert at the University of Notre Dame. “Those same principles govern Israel’s right of response, and they are best fulfilled through an immediate ceasefire by all parties, not an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza. … The protections to which civilians have a right under international law during armed conflict are almost impossible to respect in anti-terror wars, as Israel’s bombing of densely populated Gaza shows.”
    
            “If there is any doubt about whether people are civilians or not, the presumption is that they have civilian status. Denial of food, water, medicine and other necessities to the civilian population is never permissible.”
    
            “Hamas militants know they are putting innocent lives at risk and have as much responsibility as Israel to end their resort to force. They have a clear duty to release hostages. The cost to civilians in this conflict is so high that the principle of humanity demands an end to all fighting.”
    
            John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the Modern War Institute (MWI) at West Point, argued that from what he’s seen, Israel is following the laws of war and attempting to minimize civilian casualties.
    
            “There is no escaping that pursuing a terrorist organization touches off a nightmarish landscape of war. The visually repulsive imagery in Gaza essentially recreates the same scenes that unfolded under American and allied campaigns fighting Al Qaeda, ISIS and other terror groups, because that is what it looks like when you are forced to uproot a sadistic terror organization embedded in an urban area. Sadly, successful US-led or supported campaigns in places such as Mosul and Raqqa caused billions of dollars in damage and killed and displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians; that is the hellish reality of defeating terrorism.”

            Suzanne Nossel: Why college presidents seem flummoxed
    
            Frida Ghitis: What drives Biden’s wholehearted support of Israel?
    
            The media coverage was intense as Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump testified last week in a Manhattan courtroom, but as Elliot Williams wrote, “the allegations in the case are far less splashy than others in which the former president is currently a defendant.” The court proceedings had nothing to do with the four criminal cases in which the former president has been charged with 91 felony counts (and has argued he did no wrong).
    
            “In contrast, the central issue in the current trial, initiated by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, is a straightforward question of corporate law: did a real estate entity improperly inflate the values of properties in appraisals in order to secure favorable loan and tax treatment? Despite fireworks from Trump and two of his sons on the witness stand earlier in the trial, the case is as uncontroversial (or, dare I say, boring) as they come.”
    
            But the potential penalty is eye-catching, Williams noted, as the judge could strip the Trump Organization of its ability to conduct business in the state. “Trump the business came long before Trump the president. Losing that would be cataclysmic for Trump on every level. No amount of bluster on the campaign trail can change that,” Williams wrote.
    
            Even the iconic Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue — where he came down the famous escalator to announce his candidacy for president and the site of his gold-laden triplex apartment — could be wrested from the former president’s control.
    
            In “Masters of War,” a 1963 jeremiad that excoriated arms manufacturers and dealers, Bob Dylan sang of “the worst fear that can ever be hurled”: “Fear to bring children into the world.” For different reasons, that fear haunts a new generation today.
    
            Anna Lee, a senior at the College of the Holy Cross and an intern at CNN Opinion, wrote, “If temperatures weren’t rising, I’d choose the name Athena for a girl. If the rivers were safe, I’d choose William for a boy. If I could breathe clean air on my morning commute, I’d paint the nursery a warm yellow. If I could see hope for a sustainable future on this planet, I wouldn’t be spending time mourning the children I’ll probably never have.”
    
            “If things were different, I’d be honored to become a parent — indeed, I think there is no greater privilege or responsibility. But each day, the current state of the world dissuades me more and more from having children. Like many folks in Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012), my main concern is climate change. And, as climate catastrophes are already well in motion (coupled with a host of related socioeconomic and equality issues), I feel as if I would be doing an increasingly irreparable injustice to any children I would bring into this world with my inability to offer them a future.“
    
            In a new book, “The Big Fail,” Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera critically examine the policy choices officials made during the Covid-19 pandemic. A New York Magazine excerpt was headlined: “Covid Lockdowns were a Giant Experiment. It was a Failure.”
    
            Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert, took issue with that conclusion. He wrote that the book’s “authors make some good points: The lockdown dislocated students from schools and customers from places of business. Medical care was delayed for some (though needed surgeries continued when hospital beds were available). And, most dramatically, young students lost the educational and social advantage of a physical classroom… “
    
            But was the lockdown worth it? “You bet it was worth it,” Sepkowitz argued.
    
            “Yes, lockdown was a blunt instrument that caused a great deal of collateral damage. The difference between my view and theirs, I think, is that they consider the lockdown a single activity stretched across the entire pandemic; in contrast, I would distinguish the initial lockdown, which was crucial, from the off-and-on lockdowns as therapies, vaccines and overall care improved. There is an argument to be made that these were not anywhere near as effective.”
    
            “I consider the ‘short-term benefits’ to be absolutely critical in allowing the medical world to steady itself and gain a much firmer grasp of the task at hand. One only had to work in health care in New York City to see the difference between early 2020, when the explosion of cases overwhelmed the city, versus later in 2020 when an effective therapy had been identified, supplies and diagnostic testing had been greatly improved (though still completely inadequate) and the makeshift ICUs and emergency rooms had been set in place.”

            Promoting her memoir of nearly a thousand pages, Barbra Streisand lamented in an interview with the BBC: “I haven’t had much fun in my life, to tell you the truth.”
    
            As Holly Thomas wrote, “This is the legend who kicked off her singing career by winning a talent contest at a gay bar in Greenwich Village. She enjoys pancakes in bed with her husband James Brolin, and her basement contains an entire street of antique ‘shops’ (minus cash registers) to house her treasures. If Barbra’s not having fun, who on earth is?”
    
            But maybe there’s a lesson in this for everyone. “We, and the world, feel more fragile than we ever have before,” noted Thomas, who pointed out that the oft-predicted revival of the “Roaring 20s” hasn’t materialized.
    
            Apart from worries about war and the climate crisis, “the more individualized stressors of work, mental illness and the rest, requires stamina to cope. Blowing off steam 1920s-style feels harder to legitimize when we’re all acutely aware of the adverse effects of booze, cigarettes and under-sleeping. Instead, the 21st-century obsession is self-care. And while no one’s arguing the benefits of hydration and a solid eight hours, neither offers the high of a night spent dancing with abandon.”

      Opinion: Here’s one more reason to stop shaming parents
    ","
			Opinion by Kara Alaimo

  Published
        3:06 PM EST, Sat November 11, 2023
    ","
            For years, experts and self-anointed experts like momfluencers have been telling parents like me that following certain practices would get our kids to put themselves to sleep and sleep through the night. Now, a new study suggests the reason some kids don’t sleep well is because they’re genetically predisposed to insomnia — not because their moms can’t get sleep training right. I hope these findings will prompt our society to radically rethink the way parents — but, let’s face it, especially mothers — are instructed, judged and shamed for our parenting practices.
    
            The new research, published Wednesday in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, finds that children who have genetic predispositions for insomnia are more likely to have trouble falling asleep and tend to wake up more throughout the night.
    
            This makes perfect sense to me because, as a baby, my first child was a terrible sleeper. For the first several years of her life, it took her an incredibly long time to fall asleep, and she woke up regularly all night long. Reading this study, I have to wonder if maybe the reason was genetic.
    
            Of course, as a new mom, I was asked by everyone — pediatricians, family members, fellow mamas, strangers I passed on the sidewalk — how my baby was sleeping, and when I said it wasn’t going well, I almost always got the same answer: I needed to try harder to sleep train her. The problem, most people seemed to assume, was that I wasn’t tough enough to let her cry it out for a few nights until she got the hang of things.
    
            Sleep training — or letting a baby cry until they learn how to sleep — feels like the predominant advice given to parents these days, though there are also plenty of people who will shame parents for doing so (of course). I tried this method with my first child. It didn’t work. This new study suggests it’s possible that it wasn’t my parenting after all — maybe my kid’s genetics just make it difficult for her to sleep.
    
            There’s a bigger lesson here that goes far beyond what parents should be taught about getting kids to sleep. It’s that there isn’t a right way to parent all kids because every one is different. So, when we see a momfluencer share a TikTok with the tips that help her get her kid magically to sleep, what she’s sharing is what works for her child in the context of her family’s circumstances. That’s often quite different from what will work for others.
    
            Yet so many moms are left feeling like they can’t cut it if other people’s recipes don’t work for them. As I argue in my forthcoming book “Over the Influence: Why Social Media is Toxic for Women and Girls and How We Can Take It Back,” all this advice targeted at moms on social media can help explain why, as the use of social networks exploded from 2000-2015, the rate of postpartum depression among women who gave birth in hospitals rose by a rate of seven, according to a 2019 study.
    
            I don’t want to judge momfluencers too harshly here. Amy Tuteur, an obstetrician I interviewed for my book, pointed out that many moms who share their tips online are doing so because it’s one of the only ways moms can get validation in our society. “There’s a lot of doubt involved in parenting,” she told me. “You never know if you’re doing it the right way, and it’s not like your child is helping you. Your child isn’t saying, ‘Thank you for sending me to time out and helping me learn about delayed gratification.’ No, they’re lying there on the floor screaming at you.”
    
            But, when we see these posts, we should take them for what they are: advice that worked for one family. If it’s helpful (and safe), take it — but if it doesn’t work given the (likely very different) characteristics of our own kid and life, it doesn’t mean we’ve failed. It just means we’re different!
    
            Our society, too, should stop preaching what works for some people as universal gospel. The study released this week reminds us that when a kid struggles, it’s often not their parent’s fault. So, it would be a good idea for everyone to think twice before pushing their parenting strategies on others — and perhaps, instead, acknowledge how very hard parenting can be. Not having to deal with these kinds of messages of failure would at least give parents one less thing to lose sleep over.

      Anti-abortion group pushes back after DeSantis faulted movement for Ohio defeat
    ","

    ","
            A leading anti-abortion group is pushing back a day after Gov. Ron DeSantis accused the movement of getting caught “flat-footed” in the latest electoral fight over access to the procedure.
    
            Responding to the Florida governor’s remarks at Wednesday’s presidential debate, Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told CNN that DeSantis “may not be aware of how hard the pro-life community fought in Ohio,” where voters on Tuesday approved a ballot initiative to enshrine abortion access into the state constitution.
    
            Activists in Ohio, Pritchard said in a statement, “spent countless hours pouring everything they had” into attempting to defeat the measure and were outspent 2-to-1. She went on to issue a warning to the Florida Republican.
    
            “With Florida expecting a ballot measure fight in 2024, Gov. DeSantis will need to raise the funds and lead the fight to defend the heartbeat protection he signed into law,” she said.
    
            DeSantis’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
    
            The fight over abortion in America gained new urgency for GOP presidential contenders at the third primary debate, which took place a day after Republicans suffered defeats in key races where abortion loomed large, including the Kentucky governor’s race and the fight for control of the Virginia legislature.
    
            Asked to identify “the path forward for Republicans on this issue,” DeSantis pointed a finger at the anti-abortion movement.
    
            “You got to do a better job on these referenda,” he said. “All this stuff that’s happened to the pro-life cause – they have been caught flat-footed on these referenda, and they have been losing the referenda.”
    
            He doubled down after the debate, telling NBC News that the “pro-life movement has got to start keying in on these referenda.”
    
            “They have been getting their clock cleaned,” he said.
    
            Since the reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, voters in a cross section of states have moved to affirm the right to an abortion through ballot measures. Last year, voters in Michigan, Vermont and California added abortion protections to their state constitutions, while Kansas, Kentucky and Montana voters rejected efforts to roll back access.
    
            Amber Roseboom, vice president of operations for Right to Life of Michigan, said that abortion rights advocates were ready for a fight “the moment that Roe v. Wade was overturned” but that their enthusiasm had not been matched by the donors that reliably fund GOP candidates. In Michigan, for example, abortion rights groups spent more than $40 million last year urging voters to support a ballot initiative to codify abortion access, while anti-abortion groups had about half as much for their persuasion campaign.
    
            “Since the election, there’s an unfortunate and uniformed narrative which is blaming the pro-life movement for recent losses,” Roseboom said. “I can appreciate Gov. DeSantis’ perspective. But I don’t agree with the inference. As far as a failure, it’s from donors on the right who have for whatever reason determined it’s not worth investing in the fight at this point.”
    
            Danielle Underwood, a spokeswoman for Kansans for Life, said the anti-abortion movement is up against an opposition that she said was “funded by coastal elites” since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision erased federal abortion protections.
    
            DeSantis had previously defended anti-abortion activists against accusations – primarily from former President Donald Trump – that they were at fault for GOP losses in 2022. He cited his own 19-point reelection victory in Florida after signing a 15-week abortion ban into law. He has since signed a new law that cuts off abortion access at six weeks with limited exemptions in cases of rape, incest or if the mother’s life is at risk. (That law is currently on hold as the state Supreme Court decides a challenge to the 15-week ban.)
    
            “I reject this idea that pro-lifers are to blame for midterm defeats,” he said at the second GOP debate.
    
            This isn’t the first time, though, that DeSantis has clashed with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America as a presidential candidate. The organization’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, questioned DeSantis’ leadership after he declined to back a federal abortion ban earlier this year.
    
            “A pro-life president has a duty to protect the lives of all Americans,” she said. “He should be the national defender of life.”
    
            DeSantis has since said he would sign a 15-week abortion ban as president if it reached his desk, though he did not reaffirm that commitment at Wednesday’s debate, saying states may take different approaches depending on their political makeup.
    
            “You’ve got to work from the bottom up,” he said.
    
            The Ohio ballot initiative, called Issue 1, will prevent the state from restricting abortion access before fetal viability, which doctors believe is around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            Ohio’s anti-abortion movement made a concerted effort to block Issue 1. Republicans, including Gov. Mike DeWine, Sen. J.D. Vance and Secretary of State and 2024 Senate candidate Frank LaRose, actively campaigned against the measure. DeWine appeared in a direct-to-camera ad with his wife, Fran, urging voters to reject the initiative, which they called confusing and too extreme.
    
            In August, Ohio voters rejected an initiative advanced by the state’s Republican-led legislature that would have raised the threshold for passing ballot measures to amend the state constitution from a simple majority to a 60% vote, a move seen as an effort to make the November abortion rights amendment harder to approve.
    
            SBA Pro-Life America poured more than $15 million into the state to help pass the August measure and block the November vote, its biggest contribution to an abortion-related ballot initiative since Roe was overturned. Protect Women Ohio, the coalition urging a “no” vote on Issue 1, raised more than $9.9 million for the November election.
    
            Still, abortion rights advocates in Ohio outraised and outspent anti-abortion groups thanks to major contributions from national partners, continuing a trend seen last year. Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the coalition backing Issue 1, raised more than $28.7 million, a mix of small-dollar donors, large donations from liberal groups, coalition partners like the ACLU and wealthy donors like Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.
    
            Abortion rights advocates are working to get initiatives on the 2024 ballot in more states, including Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Florida, South Dakota and Nebraska.
    
            In DeSantis’ home state, the Florida Division of Elections has already validated 490,000 signatures submitted by the coalition backing an abortion rights initiative, more than half of the total necessary to get on the ballot in 2024. Constitutional amendments need 60% of the vote to pass in Florida, but advocates say they feel buoyed by the success in Ohio.
    
            “I think there are other hurdles, but the momentum is absolutely on our side,” said Laura Goodhue, the executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates. “The citizens of Florida do not want the government interfering in their decisions about their health care, and if and when to become a parent.”
    
            Floridians Protecting Freedom, the coalition gathering signatures for the initiative, raised more than $8.9 million between April and the end of September, according to a recent campaign finance report. Goodhue said the coalition has raised about $12 million to date.

      Abortion rights advocates look to replicate Ohio success with more ballot initiatives in 2024
    ","
			By Arit John, CNN

    ","
            Abortion rights advocates have now racked up seven consecutive wins since the fall of Roe v. Wade when voters have weighed in directly on reproductive rights. Next year, they’re hoping to build on that momentum.
    
            The approval of Ohio’s Issue 1, the latest measure to enshrine abortion rights in a state constitution, is yet another sign that abortion is a winning issue for groups gathering signatures for even more reproductive rights amendments in 2024.
    
            The ballot initiative process is not available in all states. But for months, coalitions have been working to replicate a version of Ohio’s amendment in states that allow for such an exercise: from battleground states like Arizona, Florida and Nevada to blue states like Colorado and Maryland to red states like Missouri, South Dakota and Nebraska.
    
            For Democrats, who have made abortion rights a central part of their pitch to voters since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling erased federal protections, the initiatives could help boost turnout among the kind of voters they’ll need in the general election. The increased turnout will be critical to President Joe Biden’s reelection hopes with polls by CNN and others showing him struggling to generate enthusiasm amid deep public discontent over his job performance and the state of the economy. Arizona, Nevada and Florida are also expected to have competitive Senate races next year.
    
            For abortion rights advocates in red states that have enacted severe bans on the procedure, these measures are sometimes the only viable path to restoring abortion access.
    
            The Ohio result is “a signal to keep pushing forward” for groups gathering signatures for abortion rights initiatives, said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which works to advance progressive measures.
    
            “When we put reproductive freedom before voters, we win,” she said.
    
            As Ohio demonstrated, winning isn’t just about getting more votes. The coalition backing abortion rights in the Buckeye State first had to defeat a measure aimed at raising the threshold for ballot initiatives to pass from a simple majority to 60%. They also sued to remove what they said was misleading language in the summary of the amendment that appeared on ballots, with limited success. Abortion rights coalitions in other states are facing similar opposition.
    
            Since the Dobbs decision, abortion rights advocates have won ballot initiatives expanding or protecting access in Michigan, Vermont, California and Ohio and blocked attempts to restrict access in Kansas, Kentucky and Montana.
    
            Next year one of the biggest abortion battles could take place in Florida, where the Division of Elections has so far validated more than 490,000 signatures to add a measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, more than half of the total required.
    
            “This was a big win for Ohio, but it also just really buoys Florida’s attempt to get this on the ballot,” said Laura Goodhue, the executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.
    
            Unlike Ohio, Florida has a 60% vote threshold for constitutional amendments, but advocates say they’re optimistic. Florida voters approved a medical marijuana amendment with 71% of the vote in 2016 and a $15 minimum wage amendment with nearly 61% of the vote in 2020.
    
            The state is also facing its own strict abortion ban. Most abortions are currently banned in Florida after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a six-week ban could soon go into effect, pending a decision from the state Supreme Court. If the court rules in favor of the 15-week limit, the six-week ban signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year will go into effect 30 days later. Goodhue said branches of her organization are preparing for such a ruling to drop any day now.
    
            The ACLU, along with its state-level affiliate in Ohio, invested $6 million into Issue 1 this year. Heading into 2024, the national organization is monitoring efforts in a number of states, including Arizona, where a coalition stated gathering signatures in September for a measure to enshrine abortion access in the state constitution.
    
            “We are really bullish on the prospect of protecting reproductive health in some additional states next year, but we are also very excited to work on elections where the issue of abortion access is front and center,” said Deirdre Schifeling, the ACLU’s chief political and advocacy officer, who cautioned that going state by state via ballot initiatives is a slow process and an enormous undertaking, and only an option in about half of states.
    
            “From our perspective, this is an issue that really needs to be addressed at the federal level,” she added.
    
            Abortion opponents are also starting to push for federal regulation. After Issue 1 passed in his home state, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance told CNN his fellow Republicans in Congress need to change strategy and clearly state where they stand by advocating a federal limit on abortion at 15 weeks. They also need to come up with a strategy to win on the state level, he said.
    
            “I do think, given how big the state ballot referenda are going to be, whether they’re constitutional referenda or just statutory referenda, we’re going to have to figure out how to actually win these things, because this is now the battleground for the pro-life movement,” Vance said.
    
            Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a news release that the results in Ohio and Virginia – where Democrats expanded their control of the state legislature – “underscore the dire need for a National Defender of Life who will advocate federal protections” banning abortions after 15-weeks of pregnancy. SBA Pro-Life America spent more than $15 million in Ohio this year to block the abortion rights amendment and has been calling on GOP presidential primary candidates to forcefully support a 15-week federal restriction.
    
            “The true lesson from last night’s loss is that Democrats are going to make abortion front and center throughout 2024 campaigns,” the news release read. “The GOP consultant class needs to wake up. Candidates must put money and messaging toward countering the Democrats’ attacks or they will lose every time.”

      Opinion: How Republicans intend to bounce back from devastating losses on abortion
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler

        1:49 PM EST, Wed November 8, 2023
    ","
            A CNN interview with GOP presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy capped off a dismal election night for Republicans on Tuesday —Ramaswamy implausibly suggested that Republicans could right the ship on abortion if they simply talked more about sexual responsibility for men.
    
            In some ways, it’s not all that surprising that Ramaswamy’s repeated insistence that men’s sexual responsibility should be “codified in the law” was the best he could come up with, because these elections could not have gone much worse for Republicans and their allies in the antiabortion movement.
    
            In Kentucky, the state’s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, who had stood out as the state’s most vocal defender of sweeping bans, took a beating from incumbent Democrat Andy Beshear, who had labeled Cameron an antiabortion extremist. As the Washington Post noted, the first person Beshear thanked after his family in his victory speech, was Hadley Duvall, a young woman who appeared in a viral Beshear ad that featured her sharing a wrenching story about being sexually assaulted by her stepfather—and her calling out Cameron for opposing rape and incest exceptions. “Because of her courage, this commonwealth is going to be a better place,” Beshear said.
    
            Ohio Republicans seeking to stop Issue 1, a state amendment enshrining reproductive rights in the constitution, tried making it harder for voters to weigh in, first attempting to raise the threshold for successful ballot initiatives, then relying on a misleading and inaccurate description of the ballot measure to lead voters astray. More than 55% of voters in deep red Ohio rejected the effort.
    
            Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin tried to put Republicans in his state on the offensive, embracing a 15-week “limit” and insisting that Democrats who opposed it were the real extremists. That effort backfired too, with Virginia Democrats taking control of the state legislature.
    
            But these defeats aren’t the seismic victory for abortion rights that Democrats may wish they were. Just because Republicans don’t seem to know how to win over voters doesn’t mean the GOP and the antiabortion movement don’t know where to go next. They do.
    
            While GOP presidential candidates are facing tough questions about the electoral viability of their positions on abortion, plans are already in place to federalize the issue and ignore the will of voters. The beauty of these plans, for Republicans and for leaders in the antiabortion movement, is that they rely not on voters but on a 2024 victory for former President Donald Trump and the control of the Supreme Court that his first term already guaranteed.
    
            The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 a presidential transition plan vetted and crafted by more than 70 conservative and pro-life groups, details an abortion policy focused almost entirely on the operations of the Department of Justice in a second Trump term. Project 2025 outlines how to stop enforcement of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which would make it easier for protesters to block and intimidate patients entering clinics.
    
            More centrally, Project 2025 insists that there is already a de facto federal ban on abortion, whether voters like it or not: the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that conservatives argue makes it a federal felony to mail or receive items intended, designed, or adapted for abortion.
    
            Heritage and its allies urge a future Trump DOJ to launch prosecutions against abortion providers and pill manufacturers for violating Comstock—even in states like California, Michigan or Ohio, where abortion is now protected.
    
            On the campaign trail, Trump has struck a less extreme tone on abortion, but there is no reason to think that will last if he is in office, unable to run for reelection and dependent on his most ardent allies for support of his divisive plans to remake the DOJ and pursue revenge against his political opponents.
    
            If Trump tried to execute Heritage’s plans, the Supreme Court would have to sign off too, but that is not hard to imagine either. The reinvention of Comstock is tailormade for this conservative majority, which identifies with textualism, a method of interpretation centered on what is said to be the plain meaning of a statute.
    
            Other GOP strategies rely on the Supreme Court and control over red states legislatures. Not every state has a mechanism for voter-initiated ballot measures. Others, like South Carolina, cut voters out of the process of selecting and reconfirming state Supreme Court judges. So in states like Tennessee or South Carolina, it m﻿ay not matter what voters think about abortion unless they are willing to elect a democratic legislative majority—no mean feat in gerrymandered conservative states, even those, like Florida or Georgia, that should be politically competitive.
    
            Conservative states cannot only honor the wishes of abortion opponents but also try to project their power outside of state borders. Conservative attorneys general in states from Texas to Alabama to Idaho have claimed the authority to prosecute people for aiding women to travel to states where abortion is protected. Idaho has passed a law allowing for prosecutions for people who help minors travel for abortion without parental consent.
    
            Controlling red state legislatures affords abortion opponents a chance to experiment with these potentially laws, which might violate the right to travel and the Full Faith and Credit Clause, which requires states to honor judgments and statutes from other states. These experiments seem worth trying for the same reason that Republicans wish to resurrect the Comstock Act: Trump stacked the federal courts with conservative judges who might be open to novel and potentially unconstitutional enforcement strategies.
    
            And then there are abortion pills. The Supreme Court is already considering taking up a case challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s authority to approve mifepristone, a pill used in over half of all abortions. A Trump FDA could entertain new restrictions on mifepristone or even revisit its approval.
    
            There is a final linchpin to Republicans’ abortion plans: the 2024 presidential election. Polls show President Joe Biden trailing Trump in almost every battleground state despite the latter’s ever-growing list of criminal charges. Voters clearly care about abortion, but unlike in ballot initiative or state races, many might believe that another Biden term won’t make a difference.
    
            It’s true that a second Biden term probably won’t lead to passage of a federal statute protecting abortion or restore Roe v. Wade. But what Republicans are banking on is that voters will believe that a second Trump term won’t further dismantle abortion rights — either because Trump has backed away from the antiabortion movement, or because the president would need Congress to introduce a meaningful ban.
    
            The Project 2025 plan shows that many abortion opponents believe both of those assumptions are wrong. They think that Trump, once in office, will try to deliver for the social conservatives who have always been his most ardent supporters. And they believe that he will not need voters to do it as long as he has the keys to the White House and the support of the conservatives on the Supreme Court.
    
            So as the dust settles after the 2023 election, Democrats may have won the first battle for the hearts and minds of voters when it comes to abortion, but if Trump wins a second term, abortion opponents feel confident they will win the war.

      How Ohio’s special election predicted the future of abortion in the state
    ","
			By Annette Choi, CNN

    ","
            Ohio on Tuesday night became the latest state to protect reproductive rights in its state constitution — joining California, Vermont and Michigan. It is the first and only state under full Republican legislative control to do so, signifying a growing disconnect between Ohio voters and the state’s Republican leadership, including Gov. Mike DeWine who signed a “heartbeat bill” banning abortion at around six weeks into law in 2019.
    
            This comes months after a special election where 57% of Ohio voters rejected an initiative that would’ve raised the threshold to amend the state constitution from a simple majority to 60%. Although the measure was not directly about abortion, it served as a proxy battle for abortion rights in the state.
    
            Here are four charts that illustrate how the election in August foreshadowed the result in last night’s abortion ballot measure.
    
            Ohio voters’ decision to protect the right to abortion in the state constitution overrides a six-week ban that was briefly in effect following the overturn of Roe v. Wade and has since been blocked by an injunction.
    
            Abortion is currently legal through 22 weeks in Ohio and banned with limited or no exceptions in surrounding states including Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia.
    
            Support for protecting abortion was strongest in Ohio’s most populous counties, including Cuyahoga and Franklin County, home to Cleveland and Columbus, respectively. The results for the abortion ballot measure on November 7 mirror the outcome of the special election in August — counties that voted strongest against raising the threshold to amend the state constitution also showed strong support for establishing a constitutional right to abortion.
    
            Following the special election, abortion rights advocates ramped up advertising efforts and far outspent their opponents in the general election. Abortion rights proponents spent nearly $25 million on advertising in favor of the measure, according to recent data from AdImpact. In comparison, opponents spent $16.3 million.
    
            Abortion proved to be a big motivator for Ohio voters during the off-year special election in August — which otherwise might’ve passed by under the radar. Voters turned out in droves to defeat the measure that would have altered the state’s amendment process. Over three million votes were cast for the issue, according to the Ohio Secretary of State, compared to the 2.4 million votes that were recorded in 2017, the last off-year general election with state-wide ballot measures.
    
            Even more Ohio voters turned out for the general election, with abortion on the ballot bringing in 3.9 million votes.

      Takeaways from elections in Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and more
    ","
			By Gregory Krieg, CNN

        5:23 AM EST, Wed November 8, 2023
    ","
            For all the sound and fury around Tuesday’s elections, there was one clear signal: Abortion rights are politically popular, no matter where or when they are on the ballot.
    
            And that, no matter how you slice it, is good news for Democrats as the parties plot their strategies ahead of the 2024 elections.
    
            Gov. Glenn Youngkin – the Virginia Republican who believed he could crack one of the most intractable issues in American politics with the promise of “reasonable” abortion restrictions – will not lead a GOP-controlled legislature in the Commonwealth, which denied the party control of the state Senate and put a swift end to both his plan for a 15-week abortion ban and rumors he might pursue a 2024 presidential bid.
    
            Meanwhile, voters in Ohio decisively said they wanted a constitutionally protected right to abortion with the passage of a ballot measure – only a few months after they rejected another measure that would have made it harder for them to shield abortion rights.
    
            And in Kentucky, the Democratic governor defeated his Republican challenger, a state attorney general with close ties to former President Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, after a campaign in which abortion became a flashpoint.
    
            Retaining control of the Virginia state Senate completed a hat trick of invigorating results for Democrats, who have endured a dispiriting week with multiple polls, including a new one from CNN, that show President Joe Biden could face an uphill fight against Trump in case of a 2020 rematch in 2024.
    
            Here are the key election night takeaways on a strong night for Democrats:
    
            Tuesday night’s election results probably won’t change the equation for Biden in 2024, given Ohio’s recent presidential electoral history. But how about Sen. Sherrod Brown? The Ohio Democrat faces a difficult reelection run next year, but outcomes from the Buckeye State may give him a boost.
    
            Already a proven political winner for Democrats, abortion rights further solidified their place as a driving force in next year’s elections when voters in Ohio, an increasingly conservative state that voted twice for Trump, passed a ballot measure on Tuesday enshrining them in the state constitution.
    
            Red, blue and purple states alike have green-lit similar proposals, solidifying a trend that defies partisan expectations and could have an outsized influence on next year’s federal elections.
    
            In the end, though, Ohio Republicans might have gotten off easy. Their referendum took place now, during an off-year with no voting for statewide office or president. Other state Republican parties might not be so lucky.
    
            In Arizona, activists are gathering signatures for a 2024 ballot initiative that will ask voters a similar question to Ohio’s this year – a development that already has Republicans there fretting.
    
            “Tonight’s results in Ohio should scare every Republican in a state where an abortion question is on the ballot in 2024,” Arizona Republican strategist Barrett Marson told CNN. “Abortion initiatives are both driving turnout among Democrats and forcing Republicans to talk about an issue of which they are on the wrong side of the electorate.”
    
            A handful of potential swing states, including Pennsylvania, Iowa, Florida and Colorado, could have abortion rights measures on their ballots alongside the presidential candidates next year.
    
            The Youngkin 2024 bandwagon ran off the road on Tuesday, when Virginia voters denied the governor and his party the legislative majorities they craved.
    
            That means no 15-week abortion ban, which Youngkin backed as a “reasonable” solution that, in his telling, was going to douse the rage of Americans who disagreed with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            It also likely puts to bed rumors that Youngkin, who has always insisted he had no ambitions to move north of Virginia, will attempt a late entry into the 2024 GOP presidential primary. The logic there turned on the governor’s ability to craft a coalition that included the far-right, the center-right and the pure centrist swing voter – or something akin to what won him the governor’s mansion in 2021.
    
            But with CNN projecting Virginia Democrats will retain control of the state Senate and flip the House of Delegates, Youngkin’s power appears to have met its limit.
    
            Andy Beshear won a second term on Tuesday in a state that Trump carried by more than 25 points in 2020.
    
            Now the real fight begins.
    
            Endorsed by Trump but often described as McConnell’s protégé, Daniel Cameron’s defeat will stir a lot of finger-pointing within the Republican Party. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was directing his at the former president shortly after the polls closed, calling the result “another loss for Trump.”
    
            “The losing will only end for Republicans if we rid ourselves of Donald Trump,” Christie tweeted in a preview of his message to primary voters Wednesday night during the third GOP presidential debate. “Trump – loser in ‘18, ‘20, ‘21, ‘22 and now ‘23.”
    
            Trump will likely take a different view of the matter, but the reality might be that neither high-ranking Republican Party leader had a direct effect on the Kentucky electorate, which has routinely given Beshear high marks for his work and appears to have been concerned about Cameron’s stance on abortion.
    
            Last year, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied constitutional protections for abortion. During the campaign, Beshear hammered Cameron, the state attorney general, over his support for the the strict law currently in place, which does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.
    
            The president’s party notched a series of high-stakes victories on Tuesday night, with Democratic candidates and Democratic issues winning big ticket votes.
    
            Still, it’s been a bummer of a week for Biden, who found himself on the short end of multiple 2024 polls. Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley all came in ahead, if narrowly, in hypothetical matchups against the president, per a new CNN poll of registered voters.
    
            The picture was similarly grim in battleground state surveys, conducted by The New York Times and Siena College and released over the weekend.
    
            But for one night, at least, the Biden campaign believed it had reason to crow.
    
            After Beshear clinched Kentucky and Ohio enshrined abortion rights in its state constitution, Biden’s campaign manager sent out a statement (to reporters) and an email (to supporters) touting the results.
    
            “In hundreds of races since Donald Trump’s conservative Supreme Court appointments overturned Roe v. Wade, we’ve seen Americans overwhelmingly side with President Biden and Democrats’ vision for this country,” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez wrote, after railing against “the dangerous MAGA extremism that has come to define today’s Republican Party at every level.”
    
            Direct votes on hot button issues rarely correlate with candidate performance, even when those candidates are on the right side of public opinion. But another round of elections with abortion rights winning across party lines is plainly good news for a president who, after these last few weeks, can use it.
    
            Government will look a little more like the governed after Tuesday night’s results are all in.
    
            To start, Democrat Gabe Amo is the projected winner of Rhode Island’s special congressional election. He will be the first Black person to represent the state in Congress.
    
            “As the first Black man to represent Rhode Island in Congress and a proven, dedicated leader, Gabe will be an important voice in the Democratic Caucus and the House of Representatives,” the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a statement.
    
            And in Philadelphia, former city councilmember Cherelle Parker will become the first woman to lead the City of Brotherly Love.
    
            She’ll be the city’s fourth Black mayor – and the 100th in its long history.

      Exit poll: Most Ohio voters still largely favor legal abortion

            An electorate driven by continued discontent at the overturn of Roe v. Wade last year turned out to help enshrine reproductive rights into Ohio’s state constitution, according to the initial results of CNN’s Ohio exit poll.
    
            CNN projects that the ballot measure Issue 1 will pass, preventing the Buckeye State from restricting abortion access before fetal viability, which doctors believe to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. After viability, the state would be able to restrict abortion access, unless the patient’s life or health are at risk.
    
            A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, voters in Ohio who turned out for Tuesday’s election are still feeling the sting.
    
            Roughly 6 in 10 expressed negative feelings about the court’s decision, including about 4 in 10 who called themselves outright angry about it – nearly identical to the sentiments among midterm voters in Ohio last year. By contrast, fewer than 20% of Ohio voters this year said they were enthusiastic about the 2022 decision.
    
            Amid that political environment, support for Issue 1 (indicated with a “yes” vote) was nearly universal among Democrats and self-described liberal voters, with nearly 70% of self-described moderates and more than 6 in 10 political independents who voted also backing the initiative. They were joined by a significant minority of Republicans, with nearly 1 in 5 GOP voters backing “yes.” Nearly 6 in 10 parents of children under 18 voted in support of the abortion rights initiative, as did a slim majority of suburban women.
    
            Ohio voters younger than 30 were at least as much of a presence in this year’s election as they were in last year’s midterms. More than three-quarters of them voted “yes,” as did roughly two-thirds of those voters ages 30 to 44 and about half of those 45 and older. (Voters younger than 30 were even more broadly supportive of another Ohio ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana, the exit poll finds. CNN projects that measure, Issue 2, has also passed.)
    
            While backing for Issue 1 was somewhat broader among female than male voters, race and education also served as dividing lines. About 80% of voters of color supported the abortion rights initiative, as did about 63% of White female voters with a college degree and nearly 6 in 10 White male college graduates. By contrast, White women without college degrees were about evenly split. White men without college degrees were among the relatively few demographic groups to solidly vote “no” on the initiative.
    
            A roughly 6 in 10 majority of Ohio voters this year said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases. About 96% who said abortion should always be legal voted to enshrine abortion rights into the constitution, while about 95% who said abortion should mostly or always be illegal voted against the initiative. Voters who said abortion should be legal in most, but not all, cases backed Issue 1 with a slightly less overwhelming majority of roughly 83%.
    
            Notably, the Ohio electorate’s broad support for legalized abortion does not translate into similarly broad support for the Democratic Party to handle the issue. Voters trust Democrats over the GOP by only a relatively modest, single-digit margin on abortion.
    
            By contrast, Ohio voters give the GOP the edge when it comes to which party they trust to handle the economy. Slightly less than a quarter of voters said their family’s financial situation has improved over the past three years, with about 4 in 10 saying things have worsened, and the rest that they’ve remained about the same.
    
            Only about 4 in 10 Ohio voters approve of President Joe Biden’s job performance, similar to his standing among the electorate in the 2022 midterms. Only about a quarter of voters said they think Biden should be running for president again. But former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination, fares little better: Only about a third of this electorate in Ohio thinks he should be running to retake the White House. Trump carried Ohio by 8 points in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.
    
            The Ohio CNN Exit Poll is a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and early in-person voters, along with telephone and online polls measuring the views of absentee by-mail and early voters. It was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 35 Ohio polling locations among 668 Election Day voters and at a random sample of 10 early in-person voting locations, among 1,188 early in-person voters. The results also include 842 interviews with early and absentee voters conducted by phone, online or by text. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

      Ohio voters will approve constitutional right to an abortion, CNN projects

            Ohio will become the latest state to enshrine reproductive rights in its state constitution, CNN projects, continuing a winning trend for abortion rights advocates since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
    
            With the passage of the ballot measure Issue 1, Ohio will be prevented from restricting abortion access before fetal viability, which doctors believe to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. After viability, the state can restrict abortion access unless the patient’s life or health are at risk.
    
            The vote is yet another sign that abortion access is a key issue for voters across party lines, even in a state like Ohio, which has trended Republican in recent elections.
    
            “Abortion access isn’t just a winning issue with voters; it’s a fundamental right that impacts every aspect of their lives,” Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, an abortion rights group, said in a statement. “Ohioans have now constitutionally guaranteed this right, and the nation is watching.”
    
            It’s also a blow to state and national abortion opponents, who had hoped that their investment in the odd-year election would help turn the tide after losing a half-dozen abortion-related ballot initiatives in 2022.
    
            Abortion opponents in Ohio vowed to keep fighting following Tuesday’s result. They attributed their loss to millions in outside money that flowed into the state and the ad campaign run by proponents of Issue 1. Though abortion opponents were outraised, both sides received help from around the country.
    
            “We stand ready during this unthinkable time to advocate for women and the unborn, just as we have always done,” Protect Women Ohio, the main group working to oppose the ballot initiative, said in a statement. “We persevered for 50 years to overturn Roe v Wade. Ours is a movement that has always endured, and always will.”
    
            At the center of the debate over Issue 1 was Ohio’s six-week abortion ban, which was blocked by a court last year but is being considered by the state Supreme Court. Abortion rights advocates argued that the only way to stop the law, which has no exceptions for victims of rape or incest, was to pass Issue 1.
    
            In contrast, abortion opponents argued that the measure went too far and would prevent the state from enacting a consensus bill with exceptions. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed the six-week ban into law, campaigned heavily against Issue 1 and shot an ad urging Ohioans to vote “no.”
    
            In August, Ohio voters defeated a measure that would have raised the threshold for passage of ballot initiatives to change the state constitution from a simple majority to 60%. The measure was viewed as an attempt to block the abortion rights amendment, and its failure was seen as a sign that the fall amendment would pass.
    
            According to preliminary results of CNN’s Ohio exit poll, roughly 6 in 10 voters who turned out for Tuesday’s election expressed negative feelings about the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. About 3 in 10 said abortion should be legal in all cases and about a third said that it should be legal in most cases.

      Opinion: Why American women of childbearing age now have another Supreme Court case to watch
    ","
			Opinion by Jill Filipovic

    ","
            On Tuesday, the US Supreme Court heard arguments on a pivotal gun case over a federal law that bars people subject to certain domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms.
    
            It seems like a pretty common-sense regulation: People who courts have deemed violent threats to their family members, significant others or exes shouldn’t be able to get their hands on deadly weapons. But the staunchly pro-gun-rights conservative justices of the Supreme Court, now in a majority, have the power to overturn this law and put women’s lives at even greater risk.  Abuse is always dangerous, but when an abuser has access to a gun, his victim is five times more likely to be murdered by him.
    
            The story at the heart of this case is an illustrative one. The man who brought it is Zackey Rahimi, a Texan who violently assaulted his then-girlfriend in a parking lot and then shot at a bystander who witnessed the attack. The woman he attacked got a civil protective order against him, which he violated; he also threatened another woman with a gun that the protective order barred him from having and was then involved in five more shootings.
    
            Rahimi’s record makes clear that he is not someone any reasonable person would say should own a firearm. When he was caught with a rifle and a pistol in his home, he was charged with violating the federal law that bars those under domestic abuse orders from owning firearms.
    
            Rahimi’s lawyers argued that that law violated his Second Amendment rights; the courts generally disagreed. But last year, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, and changed the game. The Bruen ruling essentially held that, for a gun restriction to be valid, the justification can’t simply be safety or the public good, but a clear “historical tradition” of that kind of regulation.
    
            With this new standard, the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Rahimi, holding that the federal government hadn’t proven that there is a historical tradition of withholding firearms from domestic abusers. And now, the case is in the hands of the same Supreme Court that decided Bruen.
    
            It’s worth mentioning that there isn’t much of a historical tradition in the US of doing anything about domestic abuse. American courts in the 1800s upheld the right of a husband to beat his wife, as long as he didn’t do too much damage. Even after it was illegal to beat your wife, the law was poorly enforced, and domestic violence was often considered a personal or family problem, not a real crime.
    
            The Violence Against Women Act wasn’t implemented until 1994, and it took into that same decade for all 50 states to outlaw marital rape. It wasn’t until 1990 that judges were required to take spousal abuse into account when determining child custody arrangements. It wasn’t until the 1960s that a woman could get a divorce in New York on the grounds that her husband was beating her (and even then, she had to prove a minimum number of beatings to be permitted to leave him).
    
            In other words, the federal government is being asked to prove that a law banning accused domestic abusers from having guns is valid because there’s a historical tradition of banning domestic abusers from having guns –— in a country that has only very recently even thought about domestic abuse as a problem.
    
            Rahimi’s lawyers argued as much: “Despite casting an incredibly broad net, the Government has yet to find even a single American jurisdiction that adopted a similar ban while the founding generation walked the earth,” they wrote in their filings.
    
            The government argued instead that the law should turn on the question of dangerousness: that there is a robust history of US removing firearms from dangerous individuals, and a law barring people with domestic violence retraining orders from possessing guns follows that tradition. This argument has the dual benefit of being both clearly true and clearly sensible: If you can’t or won’t prevent people who are a danger to society and those around them from having guns, you’re closer to a failed state than a nation that protects individual rights.
    
            But some of the more conservative justices had questions. Justice Clarence Thomas seemed troubled by Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar’s argument that the law can restrict gun ownership from those who are not law-abiding and responsible, asking her to clarify what she meant –— suggesting, perhaps, that there may be a justification for restricting gun ownership among people deemed dangerous, but not from those who are simply irresponsible citizens.
    
            In the government’s filings, they argued that “during the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress recommended, and many States adopted, laws disarming loyalists. States in the 19th century disarmed minors, intoxicated persons, and vagrants. And Congress in the 20th century disarmed felons and persons with mental illnesses.” That, they said, amounted to “the same enduring principle: Legislatures may disarm those who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens.”
    
            Before the Court, Prelogar continued with that line, arguing that there is a long history of restricting gun ownership from people who have proven to be dangerous or irresponsible citizens and that “history and tradition show that applies to those whose possession of firearms would pose an unusual danger beyond the ordinary citizen with respect to harm to themselves or harm to others.”
    
            The dangerousness argument, at least, seemed to resonate with some of the judges. “Just to be clear,” Justice John Roberts asked Prelogar, “your argument today is that [the Second Amendment] doesn’t apply to people who present the threat of dangerousness, whether you want to characterize them as responsible or irresponsible, whatever the test that you’re asking us to adopt turns on dangerousness.” Prelogar confirmed, adding that those who are dangerous are by definition also not responsible.
    
            For his part, Rahimi’s lawyer was hesitant to describe his client, the perpetrator of multiple shootings and an attack on his former girlfriend, as “dangerous.” In a stunning exchange, Roberts asked Rahimi’s lawyer, J. Matthew Wright, if he agreed his client was dangerous. “Your Honor, I would want to know what ‘dangerous person’ means,” Wright responded, to which Roberts said, “Well, it means someone who’s shooting, you know, at people. That’s a good start.” Wright responded with, “that’s fair.” Still, his position –— that Bruen requires an analogous law, not simply a comparable principle — is the one favored by the most extreme gun advocates.
    
            The government’s dangerousness test, though, does give the Court a fairly straightforward way to uphold their frankly atrocious and dangerous ruling in Bruen, while not handing accused domestic abusers deadly weapons: They can maintain the fiction that history must dictate the legal present, and also hold that America has a long history of keeping certain deemed-dangerous groups from owning firearms. That will help the government in this particular case. But it may not do all that much to curb gun violence more broadly.
    
            That said, though, upholding the law preventing those with domestic violence restraining orders from gun ownership is crucial to saving lives, given the fact that the evidence is stunningly clear that domestic violence plus guns equals extreme life-threatening danger, mostly for women.
    
            More than half of all abuse victims killed by their abusers involve a firearm. And America’s gun laws are to blame. While women everywhere experience abuse, American women are 21 times more likely to be murdered by gun than women in other wealthy nations. And as rates of gun ownership have risen, so too have the rates of women killed by guns – women who are usually killed by men wielding those guns.
    
            Among men who have been convicted of intimate partner violence, 1 in 8 say they have used a gun to threaten a partner. One 2018 assessment of the data found that nearly 1 million women say they have been shot or shot at by an abusive partner, and close to 4.5 million have been threatened by an abuser with a gun.
    
            Among pregnant women, trauma is the leading non-pregnancy-related cause of death, with one study finding that nearly a quarter of maternal deaths were due to gunshot wounds, and as many as 57% may be due to homicide. Nor do these acts of intimate partner violence always stay between two people: One study found that, between 2014 and 2019, 68% of mass shootings were perpetrated by men who had histories of domestic violence or who killed family members or partners.
    
            There is one big problem with the law restricting gun ownership by people with domestic violence restraining orders: It doesn’t go far enough.
    
            Women are still routinely threatened, shot, and killed by men they had restraining orders against. Many judges do not order people with restraining orders against them to surrender their guns, and the law is often under-enforced.
    
            America is already an exceptionally dangerous place, with our lax gun laws making our gun homicide rates astronomically higher than those of our economic peers. Getting rid of the most basic restriction — a law that says that a man who violently abuses his partner shouldn’t have a gun — wouldn’t be a win for gun rights or individual liberties. It would be a loss: For women, for public safety, and for common sense.

      How a Republican victory in Virginia could lead to abortion restrictions in every Southern state
    ","

    ","
            In the 16 months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, all states across the South have restricted or banned abortions except one: Virginia.
    
            On Tuesday, Virginia voters will decide who will control the state legislature, which is currently divided between Republicans and Democrats each controlling one chamber. If Republicans win full control of the legislature, it would pave the way for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to push through a conservative agenda, including restrictions to abortion.
    
            Youngkin has said he would sign legislation to outlaw abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. The current Democratic majority in Virginia’s state senate has already blocked an attempt at such a restriction earlier this year.
    
            Outlawing abortion at 15 weeks or earlier would mean residents of southern states seeking the procedure after this point would be funneled into clinics in states even further away. Bans or restrictions in all the southern states would also mean denying or restricting access to more than 110 million Americans, or one third of the entire country’s population, and seven of the 10 fastest-growing cities. CNN defines southern states here as the states that seceded during the Civil War, which while a popular definition is not how the US Census defines the South.
    
            Ads run by Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC have been careful not to include “banning abortion” language.
    
            “Here’s the truth: There is no ban,” a woman says in a Youngkin ad. “Virgnia Republicans support a reasonable 15-week limit.”
    
            Abortion in the state is currently legal through the second trimester, or 26 weeks, with some rare exceptions in the third trimester. But without Roe v. Wade or explicit protection under state law, Republican legislation could end or limit access to the procedure.
    
            In 2021, Republicans won the governor and attorney general races plus a narrow 52-48 majority in the House of Delegates. Democrats, who previously controlled both the legislature and governorship, were left with a 22-17 majority in the State Senate.

      How these suburban Virginia women vote could shape the future of America’s abortion debate
    ","

    ","
            Nanette Mees is a registered Republican and a textbook example of Virginia’s shift from red to blue.
    
            Her last Republican vote for president was in 2004, which is also the last time a GOP presidential nominee – George W. Bush back then – carried suburban Loudoun County and the commonwealth.
    
            In the nearly two decades since, Mees voted for Barack Obama twice, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.
    
            “I mean, abortion, guns – those are two big things,” said Mees, explaining her choice to vote Democratic in the past four presidential elections.
    
            She is prepared to extend that streak to five next November, but not without hesitation.
    
            “I don’t think he is the perfect one,” Mees said of Biden. “But if I have to pick between him and [Donald] Trump, who I would never, ever, ever vote for, it would be Biden. I would just pray.”
    
            That choice is a year away.
    
            A more immediate choice will also have significant national ripples – Tuesday’s legislative elections in Virginia, where control of the state House and Senate is at stake. The outcome will impact America’s abortion debate, its broader political fight for supremacy in the suburbs and the ambitions of the commonwealth’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin.
    
            “Hold the House, flip the Senate” has been Youngkin’s mantra campaigning for GOP candidates in the run-up to Tuesday. The governor, who is about halfway through his term and not on the ballot, sees himself as a Republican who appeals to both the GOP’s Trump base and suburban voters.
    
            And he thinks he can maintain that appeal while pushing new abortion restrictions, promising that if Republicans take full control of the legislature, they will pass and he will sign legislation to outlaw abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.
    
            His Spirit of Virginia political action committee has spent heavily, and Youngkin’s rallies across the state look very much like a presidential test run. The legislative candidates get a few minutes to make their case, and then Youngkin promises, if given a Republican legislature, to cut taxes, boost police spending and give parents more rights over school curricula.
    
            “The other side is so afraid of losing Virginia totally because in 24 months we’ve turned this state from blue to red,” Youngkin said at a rally last month in Henrico County.
    
            Missing from his rally speeches: any mention of abortion.
    
            The governor rejects the idea that he omits abortion because of worries his proposal will alienate swing voters.
    
            “It’s very clear where I stand on this,” Youngkin said after the Henrico County rally. “We’re running a big advertising campaign. … I believe Virginians can come together around a bill to protect life at 15 weeks with full exceptions for rape and incest and when a mother’s life is at risk.”
    
            Since the Supreme Court tossed out the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, Republicans have suffered a series of electoral setbacks in direct votes on the future of abortion rights, even in solidly conservative states like Kansas.
    
            Youngkin is trying to prove there is a middle ground that is enough to keep the GOP’s anti-abortion base on board while also winning enough votes from abortion rights supporters who are open to some restrictions. This test is playing out in a state Biden carried by 10 points, buoyed by big wins in the same suburbs where you find most of the legislative districts critical to settling the balance of power in Richmond.
    
            “The discussion around abortion is one between an extreme position from the left and a reasonable position from all Republicans,” Youngkin said after the rally, which was attended by state Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant – a Republican running in a Democratic-leaning suburban Richmond district.
    
            Dunnavant’s Democratic opponent, state Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, puts a heavy emphasis on abortion in his TV ads. “There is nothing reasonable about banning abortion. But that’s exactly what Siobhan Dunnavant wants to do,” one ad opens.
    
            Ads run by Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC aim to change the conversation from the “banning abortion” language, which Republican strategists acknowledge has hurt them in elections since the Dobbs decision – especially among swing voters.
    
            “Here’s the truth: There is no ban,” a woman says in a Youngkin ad. “Virgnia Republicans support a reasonable 15-week limit.”
    
            Rachel Kulak, a stay-at-home mom and Trump supporter, describes herself as a conservative independent who is “a little disillusioned with both parties right now.”
    
            She lives in Dunnavant’s district and supports the Republican because “during the Covid lockdowns, it was Siobhan Dunnavant that really worked to get our kids back in the classroom and I’m deeply appreciative for that.”
    
            Kulak is an abortion opponent who wishes Virginia would copy Florida’s six-week ban.
    
            “But if you can get it to 15 weeks, I think perhaps that is a fair middle ground,” she said in an interview. “We’ll never all agree on this issue.”
    
            Xi Van Fleet, a conservative activist in Loudoun County, is an outspoken critic of local school officials who she says remind her of growing up in Mao’s China.
    
            “In China, it’s basically class, you know, divided by oppressors and oppressed,” she said in an interview. “And here: race, gender, sexuality and it goes on and on and on.”
    
            Van Fleet is a Youngkin fan because of his push for more parental say in school decisions.
    
            She is not so sure about the abortion proposal.
    
            Once a staunch abortion foe, she said, “I do think it should be legal. We should not ban it.”
    
            But Van Fleet added, “Fifteen weeks probably is a reasonable cut-off.”
    
            Van Fleet is a reliable Republican voter, and Loudoun County still leaned decidedly red when she moved to Northern Virginia 18 years ago.
    
            The population was just shy of 90,000 then. Today, Loudoun is home to more than 420,000 people, its Civil War historic sites and horse country now competing with a housing and warehouse boom linked to the county’s new identity as a premier high-tech data hub.
    
            Most of the new jobs require college degrees, and education is the most telling dividing line in today’s politics. The median household income in the county is nearly $157,000, more than twice the national median household income of $74,580.
    
            In 1990, Loudoun’s population was 88% White and 7% Black. Now, the county is 53% White, 22% Asian and Pacific Islander, 14% Hispanic and 7.5% Black.
    
            “My neighbors are Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, and I’m Chinese,” Van Fleet said.
    
            There is, in Van Fleet’s view, a downside to the Loudoun population boom: a giant shift to Democrats.
    
            “Very much so,” she said. “That bothers me, yes.”
    
            George W. Bush won Loudoun County with 56% of the vote in 2004. In 2020, Trump received just 37%. Youngkin did not carry the county in his 2021 gubernatorial win, but margins matter: His 44% in Loudoun County was a big improvement from Trump’s share.
    
            Youngkin boosters frame the governor as a model for a post-Trump Republican Party. To that end, the governor has been all-in this year in encouraging early voting, something the former president has for years ridiculed as corrupt and a waste of time.
    
            “I think we have had great success,” Youngkin told CNN in response to a question about trying to leave the Trump approach behind. “We started behind because the Democrats had started embracing early voting a long time ago, and we’ve made real progress against that.”
    
            Mees is one registered Republican who voted early.
    
            But she backed Democratic state Senate candidate Russet Perry for the same reasons she stopped voting Republican for president nearly two decades ago.
    
            “Abortion and guns, those were the two for me,” Mees said.
    
            The Republican nominee in the newly drawn Loudoun County district is Juan Pablo Segura, the son of a billionaire whose ads portray Perry, a former county prosecutor, as soft on crime.
    
            “I get tons of stuff,” Gladys Burke said when asked about the millions spent on ads, mailers and text messages in the Perry-Segura contest.
    
            A South Carolina native, Burke is part of Loudoun’s big change – and part of the challenge Republicans face in appealing to potential swing voters.
    
            Burke, who is Black, owns a promotional products business in downtown Leesburg. She is an independent but votes predominantly for Democrats.
    
            “I feel like the Democrats have done more for the masses, for the poor people,” Burke said.
    
            She did not vote for Youngkin and dislikes his education policy because she believes it has led to “this thing about not teaching Black history in the schools.”
    
            But she has not decided how to vote for state Senate.
    
            “I don’t know that I have ever been this torn before,” Burke told CNN.
    
            “Absolutely, yeah,” she answered when asked if she is open to some restrictions on abortion access. “I don’t know about the 15 weeks. I don’t know what weeks it should be at. But I like those exceptions.”
    
            On the flipside, she worries about Youngkin and Republicans having too much power if they win majorities in both the state House and Senate.
    
            “The Republican Party being so far right on race relations is a difficult one,” Burke said. “It’s like, yes, you might be right on this issue for me, but you’re wrong on this other issue for me.”
    
            Even if she votes Republican in her state Senate race, Burke said Youngkin is mistaken when he predicts he can help flip Virginia back to Republican red in the 2024 presidential election.
    
            “Biden, Biden, Biden,” she said. “I think he has done a great job.”
    
            Burke shakes her head no at the idea that Youngkin could make a viable late entry into the 2024 GOP presidential race if his party wins big in the legislative contests Tuesday.
    
            Kulak, the conservative mom in Henrico County, also thinks a 2024 Youngkin run would be a mistake. But for a very different reason.
    
            “I don’t really think anyone really should go up against Trump right now,” she said.
    
            “I think that the popular polls, he’s got the vote.”
    
            Her message to Youngkin: “Wait. I would wait.”

      In the South, looming uncertainty threatens the limited abortion access that remains
    ","

    ","
            Amy Hagstrom Miller probably knows US geography better than most.
    
            The founder and chief executive officer of Whole Woman’s Health, an abortion provider with clinics in multiple states, says it’s become a critical part of her work to know the routes of major highways and the best travel patterns for people to get out of states with restrictions to a provider.
    
            After the US Supreme Court decision that removed guaranteed access to abortion in June 2022, disparate state laws have created a fractured abortion landscape in the US – with massive upheaval across the South, in particular.
    
            “I’m staring at this map I have of the United States – it’s on a dry erase board because I’ve had to change things all along – but it looks like what I would describe as a new borderlands,” Hagstrom Miller said. She used to think of Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico and the oceans as the borders. Now, she said, she can trace a finger around the South, “and that’s the border now. All those contiguous states [to the South] have banned abortion.”
    
            Of the 16 states in the South, 10 have banned abortion. Two have restricted it to the first trimester: Georgia with a six-week limit and North Carolina with a 12-week limit. Florida is one of four states in that US Census region – along with Delaware, Maryland and Virginia – where abortion is legal past the first trimester.
    
            And things are far from settled in the region. Major legal and political challenges loom in some states, with impacts that would reverberate through the region – and nationwide.
    
            Abortion is legal up to 15 weeks in Florida, making it one of the least restrictive states in the South. It has become a key access point for people who are no longer able to receive care where they live, in addition to a significant number of its own residents. But an impending ruling from the state Supreme Court could bring a dramatic shift.
    
            Abortion rights advocates have challenged the state’s 15-week ban, citing a decades-old precedent that abortion is protected by the state Constitution under the right to privacy. If the state’s high court rules that it does not protect the right to abortion, a stricter six-week limit would take effect a month later, limiting access to a time before most people even know they’re pregnant.
    
            In the year since the Dobbs decision, abortion providers in Florida reported the third most abortions of any state and the second largest increase, according to a report from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning. There were more than 92,000 abortions in the state, about 20,000 more than the year before.
    
            If Florida’s high court rules to restrict abortion access there, it would affect more than a third of abortions in the South and nearly 1 in 10 nationwide.
    
            “Florida would be extreme,” Hagstrom Miller said. “I just stare at the map and think, ‘OK, if they ban abortion in Florida or they ban abortion in Georgia, where are people going to go?’”
    
            Displaced patients from Florida and those from other states who relied on the clinics there would probably head north for care, experts say, flooding providers that are already stretched thin and straining the limited resources that remain.
    
            “Abortion bans don’t change the need for an abortion,” Hagstrom Miller said.
    
            In fact, average monthly abortions in the US increased in the year after the Dobbs decision, the #WeCount report found – but thousands more patients were served by a significantly smaller number of providers.
    
            Providers in states where abortion remains legal are doing their best to keep up.
    
            “We don’t know what the next step will be, and it certainly causes anxiety,” said Michael Scheinberg, director of operations for the Falls Church Healthcare Center, an abortion clinic in northern Virginia.
    
            It’s hard to say whether the clinic is at full capacity at any time, he says, because there’s ongoing analysis of patient needs and regular adjustments the clinic’s offerings to match. Requests for medication abortion have become more common, for example, but there’s also been an increased need for procedural abortions for people with later gestational age, many of whom have had to travel from other states.
    
            “We kind of tweak things around to make sure that we’re able to see as many patients as we possibly can with the resources that we have available, just hoping that we are able to keep up with the trends,” he said. “In this case, the best way that we can work is to be as positive as we can and try to help as much as we can.”
    
            Whole Woman’s Health has two clinics in Virginia: one in Alexandria and one a bit farther south in Charlottesville. Although it doesn’t always fill all available appointment slots, patient volumes have increased significantly over the past year, Hagstrom Miller said – and the potential impact of a Florida ban is big enough that she’s considering opening another clinic along the North Carolina border, along with expanding gestational limits and increasing capacity in the existing locations.
    
            Even if providers are able to absorb a surge from Florida, individuals seeking abortions need to find the means to travel significant distances for care.
    
            Abortion funds can help fill the financial gap for some, but many of those organizations are stretched thin, as well.
    
            The Tampa Bay Abortion Fund had to close its doors to new clients for a month this fall, said Bree Wallace, its director of case management. And now, for the first time, it’s budgeting how much it’s spending each month.
    
            Donations aren’t as large or as frequent as they were right after the Dobbs decision, Wallace said, despite a growing need.
    
            “We’re spending more, but we’re not recouping,” she said. And supporting out-of-state travel would be raise expenses significantly.
    
            At the midway point for the latest budget cycle, the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund had used about three-quarters of the allotted monthly funds. Only about $1,000 has been spent on practical support such as travel costs, with the remaining $41,000 put toward appointment costs at clinics. But that ratio would flip dramatically with additional restrictions to abortion access in Florida – and the overall need would only grow, Wallace said.
    
            “It’s a lot easier to come up with $350 for appointments versus $350 plus a flight, hotel and all the travel costs for one appointment,” she said. “We’d never leave anyone stranded, so we’re trying to make sure we have money when people might be traveling a lot and it gets more expensive.”
    
            The potential change in Florida isn’t the only looming uncertainty around abortion access in the US.
    
            Virginia is also a crucial access point for people seeking abortion and, like Florida, reported a significant increase in abortions in the year post-Dobbs. Average monthly abortions rose 25%, according to the #WeCount report, a difference of about 550 abortions a month or more than 6,600 additional abortions over the course of a year.
    
            This week, Virginia has its first general election since the Dobbs decision, and shifts in the control of the Legislature could pave the way for new restrictions.
    
            “This election is so critical for Virginians and so many of our neighbors because Virginia is such a key access state,” said Jamie Lockhart, executive director at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. “Virginia is truly holding the line, and we need to keep it that way.”
    
            Impending change – from a court decision, election results or otherwise – raises anxiety for local providers and compounds broader uncertainty nationwide.
    
            The staff members at A Woman’s Choice, an independent abortion clinic with locations in Florida and North Carolina, know that the Florida Supreme Court decisions are typically released each Thursday at 11 a.m.
    
            “Our frontline staff in the midst of it. They’re in the middle of clinics, consults, making sure patients are educated about their care and making the best decisions for them and their family,” said Amber Gavin, vice president of advocacy and operations for the organization. “But our leadership team, that’s when we’re on the Florida Supreme Court website, checking and refreshing. There’s a lot of anxiety for a few hours.”
    
            The past few Thursdays have brought a “sigh of relief,” she said, but the regular anxiety can wear on patients and staff.
    
            “It’s exhausting and frustrating,” Gavin said. “Every time folks hear that there’s change, people think that it immediately goes into effect, and there’s a lot of chaos and confusion.” Patients often call with questions about keeping their appointments, and staff are worried about keeping their jobs, she said.
    
            In some ways, operating under uncertainty has become the norm.
    
            “We want to retain freedom to abortion care in the South, and we’re working to be that safe haven, but nothing is a certainty,” Scheinberg said. “With the political landscape, it’s very hard to tell exactly what’s going to happen next. I don’t think there is a safe place in the United States. We just have to be vigilant and keep working.”

      States with restrictive abortion laws place more kids in foster care, particularly kids of color
    ","
			By Jen Christensen, CNN

    ","
            A new study finds that in states with certain restrictive abortion laws, even before the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the number of children whose parents couldn’t or wouldn’t care for them increased and their children end up in foster care.
    
            The study, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, found that there was an 11% increase in children placed in foster care in states with certain abortion restrictions called TRAP laws, following the enactment of those TRAP laws, relative to states without such abortion restrictions. The study saw this increase by comparing the number of children who were conceived between 1990 and 2011 and placed in foster care between 2000 and 2020 in states with TRAP laws to those who lived in states without such laws. More than 4 million children went into foster care during this time period. Black children disproportionately got placed in foster care.
    
            TRAP stands for Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers. Ever since abortion became legal in 1973, states found ways to create laws that reduce access to abortion by restricting what clinics can and can’t do. Often restrictions become so burdensome, down to prescribing how long a hall in a clinic must be, clinics shut down. So, people seeking an abortion in these states may have a right to an abortion, but finding one is impossible. Twenty-three states have such restrictions.
    
            Anti-abortion politicians often argue TRAP laws protect mothers and children, but multiple studies and courts have found that the laws do not make the procedure any safer.
    
            Compared to people who live in states without abortion access issues, studies have consistently shown that pregnant people who live in abortion-restrictive states typically face more problems, some of them are even deadly. People are much more likely to die in childbirth or die due to a pregnancy-related issues, particularly people of color who live in abortion restricted states, earlier studies have shown and so are their infants. People denied abortions are also much more likely to experience financial distress.
    
            An 11% increase in the number of children put into foster care may not sound like a lot, but the foster care system is already overburdened. The situation became even more stressed during the pandemic. In 2022, more than half of all states saw a significant decline in the number of available foster care homes, one study showed. So, even an 11% increase could push the system into further jeopardy.
    
            With the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the situation isn’t likely to improve, according to study coauthor Dr. Savannah Atkins, a lecturer in Economics at Bentley University.
    
            “Now with a total restriction of abortion in certain states, we’re obviously going to see this being exacerbated,” said Atkins. “We need to take into account these effects when we’re thinking of these, you know, sweeping legislations that regulate abortion.”
    
            An editorial that accompanied the new study, written by doctors at Indiana University Medical School, highlighted the disproportionate burden abortion restrictions place on racial and ethnic minority families. The study found mainly families from these communities had to put children into foster care not due to neglect or abuse, but because they didn’t have adequate housing.
    
            “I thought it was really sad and devastating,” said editorial co-author Dr. Tracey Wilkinson, an associate professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine. “I think when people hear foster care, I think their head goes to a space of either neglect or abuse. And that’s not what’s happening here.”
    
            Wilkinson said even when she sees patients who experience neglect or abuse, sometimes when she calls child protective services, the department cannot even return her calls; they are that overwhelmed with cases.
    
            “These long-term downstream impacts of abortion restrictions will significantly add to this burden,” Wilkinson who is a pediatrician said.
    
            In the editorial, she and her colleague Dr. Caitlin Barnard, an assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Indiana University School of Medicine, pointed out what they say is flawed reasoning behind abortion restrictions.
    
            “This highlights the contradiction in the anti abortion position as it purports to protect women and families and at the same time, refuses to provide the support needed to safely raise their children,” the editorial said. “It is a sad day when we are faced with statistical evidence that our national policy includes forcing women to carry pregnancies and deliver children only to take them away due to an inability to afford housing.”
    
            While there are loving foster families, children placed in foster care often fare worse when it comes to health, education, and income, than those who come from stable homes, particularly children of color, research shows.
    
            Adkins says she knows firsthand that foster care can be good for children. Her own parents adopted some of her younger siblings out of foster care, but generally, being in foster care is not ideal for children.
    
            “If you think about research that has been done on the effects of people that are in the foster care system itself, they’re obviously affected negatively in terms of their education, their health, and their mental health,” Adkins said. “So, it’s not just the burden that’s now placed on the foster care system that these abortion restrictions have had; it’s all these other effects, even after, that are now being impacted as well.”

      Democrats are counting on abortion politics to help deliver wins in key races across the country this week

    ","
            In the 16 months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, six states have held direct votes on the future of abortion rights within their borders. And on six occasions, the pro-abortion rights side has prevailed — including in traditionally conservative states like Kentucky.
    
            This calculus will be tested again on Tuesday, when voters in Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania have their say in races that, to varying degrees, have been defined by the prospect of a future with limited or severely restricted abortion rights.
    
            Abortion has been an influential factor in campaigns for elective office up and down the ballot. The GOP’s failure to meet expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats retained control of the US Senate and only narrowly lost the House of Representatives, raised the prospect that the high court’s decision could alter the political landscape for years to come.
    
            “There’s not like a referendum question on the ballot, but it is on the ballot,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine told CNN after a backyard rally for Democratic state legislative candidates in September.
    
            Though Virginia is now reliably blue in presidential races, its local races are a fierce battleground. A year after voting for Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a 10-point margin, the Commonwealth elected Republican Glenn Youngkin its new governor, defeating Democrat Terry McAuliffe by 2 points. Now Virginians will decide whether to give Youngkin, who is rumored to be weighing a late entry into the GOP presidential primary, the backing that would allow him to move forward with new abortion restrictions.
    
            Virginia’s off-off-year local elections – held a year after federal midterm elections and featuring no statewide contests – are famously difficult to predict. But the throughline this fall is clear: Should the GOP flip control of the state Senate and keep its majority in the House of Delegates, Youngkin will be free to pursue legislation to place a 15-week limit on abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.
    
            Understanding the potency of the issue across party lines, Virginia Republicans, led by the governor, have either downplayed the issue or argued that unified GOP control would not put the state on a path to an outright abortion ban. Youngkin’s political action committee spent more than $1 million last month on a television ad attempting to undermine Democrats’ warnings. The House GOP caucus has also spent to send a similar message.
    
            But abortion rights advocates are crying foul, insisting that the 15-week plan is a stepping stone to harsher restrictions.
    
            “Whatever the GOP wants to call it, a ban is a ban, and they will pass one into law in Virginia if given the chance,” said Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a statement days before the polls opened.
    
            The stakes in Ohio are less open to interpretation or spin.
    
            Voters in the increasingly conservative Midwestern state will on Tuesday decide “Issue 1,” a referendum that could stamp abortion rights into the state constitution and wipe away a six-week ban that would otherwise be headed to the state supreme court for review.
    
            Defeat in Ohio, which voted for Trump twice as it’s gone from bellwether to conservative stronghold, would continue a worrisome trend for Republicans and give Democrats some hope of clawing back – or maintaining – some of their power in the state.
    
            Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is preparing for a tough reelection fight in 2024, has been pushing the “Yes on Issue 1” line. In a video last month, he talked up his bona fides as a supporter of legal abortion rights and said, “I trust Ohioans to make the decisions best for themselves, best for their families.”
    
            That argument – which places personal freedom and independence from government overreach, messaging tools usually associated with conservatives, at the forefront – mirrors similar arguments successfully made by Democrats across the country in 2022.
    
            Top Ohio Republicans, like their counterparts in Virginia, have sought to downplay the implications of the vote. Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed a six-week “heartbeat bill” that did not include exceptions for rape and incest in 2019, while Roe was still in place, insists that Republicans would not interpret Issue 1’s potential failure as carte blanche for tougher bans.
    
            “If we can defeat this amendment, which I certainly hope we can, it will give us the opportunity in Ohio to try to come up with something that the majority of Ohioans can support,” DeWine told CNN last month. He added that future legislation should include exceptions for rape and incest and said the 6-week timeline is “certainly something to be discussed.”
    
            DeWine continued along those lines a in a recent ad, saying, “I know Ohioans are divided on the issue of abortion, but whether you’re pro-life or pro-choice issue, Issue 1 is just not right for Ohio.”
    
            Ohioans for Reproductive Rights, the main group on the side supporting the amendment, has also sought to win over conflicted voters. In a recent ad, it argued that the Ohio “government’s life-threatening abortion ban ties the hands of doctors, putting women at risk when complications arise later in pregnancy.”
    
            But the spot also seeks to appeal to voters with mixed feelings, saying that “’Yes’ (on Issue 1) keeps sensible restrictions on abortion later in pregnancy.”
    
            Democrats and abortion rights advocates have reason for optimism. Just this summer, Ohio voters rejected a Republican-led effort to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution from a simple majority to 60% of voters.
    
            The failed referendum was seen as a clear rebuke of what opponents described as a bald-faced attempt to tip the scales ahead of the November vote.
    
            Biden celebrated the result from Washington, slamming Ohio Republicans’ “blatant attempt to weaken voters’ voices and further erode the freedom of women to make their own health care decisions.”
    
            The governor’s race in Kentucky, where Democrat Andy Beshear is seeking a second term in the Commonwealth’s top office, is expected to go down to the wire, with recent polling showing Beshear and GOP challenger Daniel Cameron in a tight contest.
    
            Like Democratic leaders in so many other red states, Beshear has consistently pushed Cameron on his abortion stance, saying it’s more hardcore than the Republican wants voters to know.
    
            In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion. Still, the state currently has a pair of laws, passed in 2019 and signed by then-Gov. Matt Bevin, that amount to a near-total ban, with the only exception being for the health of the mother.
    
            Cameron has said he would support legislation broadening exceptions if it were put before him by lawmakers, but Beshear in a debate noted that Cameron had signed a Kentucky Right to Life survey saying he opposed exceptions.
    
            “What you couldn’t and didn’t hear (Cameron) say is that he supports, personally, exceptions for victims of rape and incest,” Beshear said during a recent debate.
    
            Cameron, in turn, has criticized Beshear for vetoing a 15-week ban back in the spring of 2022, months before the Supreme Court ruling, arguing Beshear is out of step with Kentucky voters and beholden to groups like Planned Parenthood.
    
            In addition to these high-profile contests, abortion rights advocates have also set their sights on an otherwise little-noted state supreme court race in Pennsylvania, which will on Tuesday elect a new state supreme court justice following the death last year of Chief Justice Max Baer, a Democrat.
    
            The winner of this unusually expensive race will serve 10 years on the bench before coming up for re-election. Democrats currently hold a 4-2 advantage, but some hot-button cases have split the court 3-3, and liberals are warning that a dent in their majority, with some abortion-related cases pending, could undermine the state’s otherwise robust protections.
    
            Republican candidate Judge Carolyn Carluccio, after winning her primary in May, removed from her campaign website a resume that highlighted her anti-abortion stance, calling her a defender of “all life under the law,” according to a report in liberal-backed news outlet The Keystone. Carluccio has said she will adhere to the state law, which is in line with the Roe standard of roughly 24 weeks.
    
            Carluccio has also received significant support from a group with ties to billionaire Jeffrey Yass, a Pennsylvania-based financier and major Republican donor. Planned Parenthood Votes, the abortion rights group, launched an ad campaign against her over the summer.
    
            “Carolyn Carluccio ran on being an anti-abortion judge in the Republican primary but now she’s trying to hide her anti-abortion views,” PPV spokesperson Breana Ross said. “She cannot be trusted to respect Pennsylvanians’ constitutional rights.”
    
            Judge Daniel McCaffery, the Democratic nominee, has the endorsement of the Philadelphia Inquirer and nearly all major liberal Pennsylvania groups and leaders. The energy behind his candidacy is due in part to what lies beyond November, looking to 2025, when all three Democratic justices now on the bench come up for reelection.
    
            While Carluccio has attempted to downplay the issue during the campaign, McCaffrey has been unequivocal and, like other Democrats, has used the language of “personal freedom” to describe his support for abortion rights.
    
            “Our freedoms are under attack: Workers’ rights. Women’s reproductive rights. The right to vote,” McCaffrey said in a recent ad that, in a nod to the broad coalition he is hoping to win over, touted his support from “police, Planned Parenthood and labor unions.”

      Opinion: The right-wing’s opposition to abortion is not about saving or protecting women lives

    ","
            A year and a half after Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices overturned Roe v. Wade and stripped the constitutional right to abortion from American women, the Republican Party has been floundering.
    
            It turns out that the American public is broadly pro-choice, according to a CNN poll from August, and many voters are horrified by the predictable results of abortion bans: child rape victims unable to end dangerous pregnancies in their home states, women nearly dying of treatable pregnancy complications, mothers with much-wanted but tragically doomed pregnancies being denied the ability to choose how those pregnancies end.
    
            And, of course, women who are simply forced to remain pregnant when they don’t want to be or can’t afford to be. Some Republican politicians, and some conservative activists, argue that the party needs to show it’s actually “pro-life,” as it calls itself, and not just anti-woman by embracing a slew of policies that would help women prevent unwanted pregnancies, and help them to carry pregnancies safely to term and raise children in more stable environments.
    
            None of this, of course, has come to pass. Republicans have not made the US a safer or better place for pregnant women or mothers since they banned abortion or scaled access to the procedure back in nearly every red state. Nor have they made contraception easier to access.
    
            But now they have a chance. Democrats are pushing for full insurance coverage of over-the-counter birth control pills, a move that would make a reliable pregnancy prevention tool much more accessible — especially for the financially struggling women who are the most likely to experience unexpected pregnancies.
    
            So where are the Republicans?
    
            Back in July, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an over-the-counter birth control pill, called Opill. Health advocates emphasize that this pill could be a gamechanger for American women, who for long have had one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy among developed countries.
    
            Solving this problem is fairly simple: Give women easily accessible and very reliable tools for preventing pregnancy, and women have far fewer unintended pregnancies — and by extension, fewer abortions and fewer unplanned births.
    
            Conservative advocacy groups and the anti-abortion Republican Party, though, have largely opposed this strategy. While a few conservatives have written op-eds in favor of contraception being legal, they also routinely position it as a matter of “individual responsibility”: in other words, that if women want to have sex without risking pregnancy, they should have to (literally) pay for it.
    
            The GOP generally does not support efforts to make birth control free. And most major anti-abortion organizations either oppose the most reliable forms of contraception or take no position.
    
            The problem with that, though, is that women living in poverty or at its edge, or women who are young or uninsured, can have a tough time getting their hands on reliable contraception. A doctor’s appointment can be a significant barrier to women who are struggling to manage low-wage work and the demands of children: It means time off of work, lost wages, paying for childcare, money for gas or bus fare, then getting to the pharmacy to fill a prescription — and then doing it all again whenever the script runs out.
    
            Over-the-counter birth control removes a big barrier — the doctor — but it doesn’t solve for cost. As it stands, the Affordable Care Act (ACA)’s contraception mandate generally makes contraceptives free — an effort that conservatives fought tooth and nail, and even took to the Supreme Court in 2014, arguing that religious “pro-life” businesses owners shouldn’t have to provide insurance plans that cover contraceptives they object to (they won).
    
            But over-the-counter drugs are often not covered by insurance, and the contraception mandate doesn’t cover over-the-counter contraceptives, even though these more-accessible pills may soon become the most popular contraceptive pill option.
    
            Democrats are trying to change that by extending the ACA’s contraception mandate to over-the-counter pills. Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington has 35 cosponsors for a Senate bill that would require insurance to cover any contraceptive approved by the FDA for over-the-counter use, with or without a prescription. The bill doesn’t have a single Republican cosponsor.
    
            That’s awfully telling: The same party that claims it wants to end abortion refuses to support one of the most effective ways to decrease the abortion rate.
    
            At the same time, American women are seeing a health care crisis, especially in conservative “pro-life” states. Republican abortion bans have made these states extremely hostile to health workers, especially those specializing in women’s health, OB/GYN, and obstetrics.
    
            Doctors in anti-abortion states now face serious civil and criminal penalties if they make treatment decisions that conservative legislators have outlawed — including treatments that are standard in places where abortion is legal, such as miscarriage management, procedures to end life — and health-threatening pregnancies, and treatments for ectopic pregnancies. And doctors are people, many of them of reproductive age, or parents of children who will eventually be of reproductive age. Who can blame them for refusing to put their lives, livelihoods and freedom at risk by living and practicing medicine in states with laws that ban abortion, threaten doctors and risk women’s lives in the name of “pro-life” politics?
    
            As a result of abortion bans, some doctors are fleeing conservative states and health clinics are shutting their doors. Many of these states were already struggling with health care shortages and major health care challenges. Now, women have fewer options for care: nowhere to get a safe abortion, and fewer and fewer options for gynecological care, emergency care and childbirth.
    
            Women and children in conservative “pro-life” states are also worse off by a variety of measures. Children in these states are more likely to live in poverty. Women are more likely to die in pregnancy, childbirth or soon after.  Women and their children are less healthy. These are the conditions that anti-abortion Republican politicians have failed to correct, or even helped to create.
    
            So, it is perhaps no surprise that Republicans are also refusing to make it easier for women to prevent unintended pregnancies, at the same time as they are making it harder for women to end unintended pregnancies. But it is shameful. It should be scandalous. And it serves as further proof that the right-wing opposition to abortion is not about saving lives or protecting women. It’s all about making women’s lives smaller and making all of us less free.

      US infant mortality rate rises for first time in more than 20 years
    ","
			By Giri Viswanathan, CNN

    ","
            For the first time in more than two decades, the United States saw an increase in infant mortality rates in 2022.
    
            According to a report released Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics, the overall infant mortality rate rose by 3% from 2021 to 2022. The mortality rate for neonatal infants climbed by 3%, while the post-neonatal mortality rate—for infants who survived past 28 days—rose by 4%.
    
            Infant deaths due to maternal complications—like preeclampsia or preterm delivery—and bacterial sepsis also shot up by 8% and 14%, respectively.
    
            “We live in a country with significant resources, so the infant mortality rate and the increase are shockingly high,” wrote Dr. Sandy Chung, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in an email to CNN. “As pediatricians who help children grow into healthy adults, any death of any child is one too many.  The infant mortality rate in this country in unacceptable.”
    
            For public health experts, infant mortality is often a useful benchmark for a country’s health system at large, said Danielle Ely, a health statistician at NCHS and one of the report’s authors.  This year’s increase in infant mortality, she said, could be either a “weird blip” for one year, or the sign of an underlying health care issue. They’ll need to see next year’s data to know for certain.
    
            The increase in infant mortality could also be a product of the COVID-19 pandemic, which put a strain on communities and health resources, said Rachel Hardeman, a professor of health and racial equity at the University of Minnesota.
    
            The year before, in 2021, an analysis from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while the total number of infant deaths had increased from 2020, the mortality rate had remained the same—at 5.44 deaths per 1,000 live births.
    
            The new report, citing provisional data, found the rate rose to 5.60 infant deaths per 1,000 births, corresponding with 20,538 infant deaths in 2022.
    
            “This is clearly the wrong direction,” said Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, President and CEO of March of Dimes, a nonprofit maternal and infant health advocacy organization. “Overall, I’m just discouraged.”
    
            The NCHS study found that the infant mortality rate in 2022 increased for mothers aged 25-29. Mortality rates also climbed for preterm babies, male infants, and for infants born in Georgia, Iowa, Missouri and Texas. Nevada, however, saw a decline in infant mortality rates.
    
            The report also found that different racial groups experienced different rates of infant mortality. For infants of American Indian or Alaska Native women, mortality rates climbed by over 20% from about 7.4 deaths per 1,000 births to over 9 deaths per 1,000 births. Infant mortality rates for White women also increased by about 3%.
    
            Mortality rates for infants of Black women did not increase by much, the report found, but Black infants experienced the highest overall rates of infant mortality: nearly 11 deaths per 1,000 births, or over double the mortality rate of White infants.
    
            “We know that for people who live in or near poverty and for certain racial and ethnic groups there are significant challenges with getting access to a doctor or getting treatments,” Chung wrote. “This can lead to moms and babies showing up for care when they are sicker and more likely have serious outcomes, even death.”
    
            Cherot and Hardeman described areas with those accessibility challenges as “maternity care deserts” where people—predominantly women of color—might have to drive for long distances to find scarce labor or delivery units.
    
            Those women also face a higher risk of preterm birth, Cherot said — and when coupled with obstacles to receiving health care, the probability of infant complications is “exceptionally high.”
    
            “In a country as wealthy as ours, no one should have difficulty accessing healthcare,” Chung wrote. “We need to change policies to help lift families out of poverty and help them get access to healthcare sooner, before is it too late.”
    
            According to Hardeman, racism and marginalization, particularly for indigenous and Black people, can also have a physiological toll on health outcomes. Training physicians and other health care providers about the links between inequity and health, she said, might “chip away” at some of the racial disparities in infant health.
    
            Based on her previous research, in fact, Hardeman found that when Black infants were delivered by Black physicians, a higher number survived —particularly during challenging births or maternal complications.
    
            According to the report, maternal complications and bacterial sepsis, or infection, were responsible for a greater rate of newborn deaths than before. Maternal health and infant mortality are often intertwined, Cherot explained, and maternal complications like preeclampsia and diabetes have been on the rise — resulting in high maternal death rates compared to other high-income countries.
    
            However, the NCHS study only reports the latest numbers, without explanations for why infant mortality may be rising. Cherot hopes that researchers dive into the data to better understand the underlying for growing infant deaths.
    
            “I see a 14% increase [in infant mortality from bacterial sepsis],” Cherot said. “When I see double digits, I start to worry. There’s a lot more questions than answers with this data.”
    
            “I think we have a lot more questions to be able to get into the heart of what’s happening,” Hardeman added.

      Abortion rights groups have been on a winning streak. Opponents hope Ohio’s Issue 1 offers a reset
    ","
			By Arit John, CNN

        6:03 AM EDT, Tue October 31, 2023
    ","
            When polls close on November 7, Ohio will either become the latest state to enshrine abortion rights into its constitution or enter a period of uncertainty as the state Supreme Court considers allowing a six-week abortion ban to be enforced.
    
            For Joel Spring, a 33-year-old from West Chester, neither option seems ideal.
    
            Spring said he’s “pro-life” but also thinks “we have to have some legal abortion,” with a cutoff somewhere in the first or second trimester. The state’s six-week ban went too far, he said, but so does Issue 1, a ballot initiative that would prevent the state from restricting abortion access before fetal viability, which doctors generally consider to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            “I think there needs to be a balance. Unfortunately, when it comes to the issue of abortion, you’re either one extreme or the other,” Spring, who voted “no” on the abortion amendment, said after casting his ballot early at his local county board of elections. “I don’t really know what the solution is.”
    
            Ohio’s Issue 1 could drastically reshape reproductive rights in a state where Republican leaders have proposed legislation to completely ban abortion post-Roe. But it will also serve as a bellwether for 2024, suggesting what strategies and messages will resonate most with voters during a general election in which Democrats will make abortion a key issue.
    
            After a string of defeats in last year’s midterm elections, anti-abortion groups at the state and national level hope the Buckeye State will offer a new playbook as abortion advocates seek to introduce similar initiatives to undo strict bans in other red states. Abortion opponents argue that groups such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, which have been working on the ballot strategy, were more prepared after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year and erased federal abortion protections.
    
            “We felt it was imperative to get together with the in-state pro-life leaders and the pro-life coalitions from all across Ohio and help build a model to fight back,” said Stephen Billy, the vice president of state affairs at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion advocacy group. “When you work with a unified pro-life movement, alongside political leadership in the state, you have an opportunity to have an impact and defeat these amendments.”
    
            Last year voters in Michigan, Vermont and California voted to add abortion protections to their state constitutions, while Kansas, Kentucky and Montana voters rejected efforts to roll access back. Abortion advocates are working to get initiatives on the 2024 ballot in states including Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Florida, South Dakota and Nebraska.
    
            In Ohio, abortion rights advocates defeated a ballot initiative in August that would have raised the threshold to amend the constitution from a simple majority to 60%. Now, after urging voters to vote “no” on the August amendment – also called Issue 1 – they are urging people to vote “yes” on the November version, a switch that has caused some confusion with voters.
    
            Abortion opponents say that the defeat of the August measure to change the constitution – which was opposed by 57% of voters – isn’t a sign the November abortion initiative will pass. Supporters aren’t taking it that way, either.
    
            “I don’t think you can look at any election as a given, although the vast majority of Ohioans obviously support abortion access,” said Kellie Copeland, the executive director of Pro-Choice Ohio.
    
            As of Thursday, more than 380,000 Ohioans had cast their ballots early, according to absentee voter reports from the secretary of state’s office.
    
            Abortion rights groups have outraised opponents and outspent them on TV. Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the main coalition supporting Issue 1, has raised $28.7 million for the general election, compared with $9.9 million raised by Protect Women Ohio, the main group opposing it, according to campaign finance reports filed Thursday. Since Labor Day, Democratic groups backing Issue 1 have spent more than $20 million in ads, compared with $8.5 million spent by groups opposing Issue 1, according to data from AdImpact.
    
            The “yes” coalition sued the Ohio Ballot Board and Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose in August over how the state described the proposed amendment on ballots, arguing the summarized text aimed to “mislead Ohioans and persuade them to oppose” it. The state Supreme Court granted the “yes” coalition a partial rewrite, but ruled against it on issues such as the use of “unborn child” over “unborn fetus” and the summary’s exclusion of the proposed amendment’s protections for contraceptive care.
    
            Unlike Michigan, which had a Democratic governor, secretary of state and attorney general when it passed a very similar abortion rights amendment last year, Ohio Republicans have trifecta control of the government, and run the offices of attorney general and secretary of state. Those leaders have been deeply involved in trying to defeat the measure.
    
            Gov. Mike DeWine, who won reelection last year by 25 points against a Democrat who supported abortion access, cut a TV ad urging Ohioans to vote “no” on Issue 1, which he’s said is too extreme for the state. Attorney General Dave Yost released a legal analysis of the amendment that argued it went “further” than the protections in Roe and could overturn parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions.
    
            Nationally, the state’s anti-abortion coalition has received more than $15 million from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America for both the August and November Issue 1 initiatives, according to campaign finance records.
    
            Under current Ohio law, abortion is legal before 22 weeks of pregnancy. But that could change depending on the fate of a six-week abortion ban signed into law by DeWine in 2019. The “heartbeat bill,” which bans the procedure after fetal cardiac activity is detected, was blocked by a federal court at the time. The court then, at the behest of Yost, lifted the injunction against the law hours after the Supreme Court overturned Roe.
    
            The six-week ban, which included no exceptions for rape or incest victims, was in effect from June to September 2022, before it was paused by a court. Among those affected was a 10-year-old rape victim who had to travel to Indiana to get an abortion. It’s now being considered by the state Supreme Court.
    
            “It has really helped illustrate what a ‘yes’ vote means,” Jordyn Close, the deputy director of the Ohio Women’s Alliance, one of the groups in the coalition backing Issue 1, said of the six-week ban. “We’re able to say Ohio has experienced this already. Ohio doesn’t want to go back to this.”
    
            Opponents have tried to frame Issue 1 as an extreme in the other direction.
    
            “People have very differing views about at what point in a pregnancy abortion should be permitted, but a very small number of people think that abortion should be permitted at all times, up until the time of birth,” DeWine said in an interview with CNN. “They’ve just grossly overreached.”
    
            Issue 1 does allow abortion to be prohibited after fetal viability, a point determined by the pregnant patient’s treating physician. However, there are no circumstances under which abortion can be prohibited if the presiding physician deems it “necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”
    
            Under the state’s six-week ban, abortions are allowed after fetal cardiac activity is detected if the patient’s physician believes one is necessary to “avoid a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman” or to prevent the patient’s death.
    
            Most abortions are induced during the first three months of pregnancy. Of the 21,813 abortions performed in Ohio in 2021 — the year before the six-week ban briefly went into effect — about 87% were performed before 13 weeks of pregnancy, according to data from the Ohio Department of Health.
    
            Less than 1% were performed after 20 weeks, and none were performed after 24 weeks. The number of abortions in Ohio dropped 15% between 2021 and 2022, according to the department.
    
            DeWine and other Issue 1 opponents have sought to separate the six-week bill from the debate over the ballot initiative, arguing it’s easier to change a state law than it is to amend the state constitution.
    
            “If we can defeat this amendment, which I certainly hope we can, it will give us the opportunity in Ohio to try to come up with something that the majority of Ohioans can support,” DeWine said in an interview. He said a new bill should include exceptions for rape and incest, and that the timeline of the restriction is “certainly something to be discussed.”
    
            But abortion rights advocates say they worry Republicans would go even further than the six-week ban and prohibit all abortions as some states, including neighboring Indiana, have done.
    
            “I have no doubt they will go forward with [a total ban], because that’s always been their agenda,” said Copeland of Pro-Choice Ohio. “That’s really what’s at stake with Issue 1.”
    
            While the “yes” side has pointed to the six-week limit, the “no” side has pointed to Michigan, where Democratic lawmakers have advanced a slate of bills designed to repeal other existing abortion regulations.
    
            “They are providing this perfect test case for us to look at and see what will come to Ohio if Issue 1 passes,” said Amy Natoce, a spokesperson for Protect Women Ohio.
    
            After Michigan enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution and Democrats won control of government, state lawmakers introduced a package of bills aimed at dropping remaining abortion policies they viewed as restrictive, such as the state’s 24-hour waiting period and informed consent form requirement and other requirements targeted at abortion clinics.
    
            Abortion rights advocates say the regulations are unnecessary hurdles designed to dissuade patients or make it harder for clinics to operate. Opponents say such regulations are about patient safety.
    
            In both Michigan and Ohio, abortion opponents argued the constitutional amendments would also eliminate parental consent laws in the state.
    
            So far, that hasn’t come to pass in Michigan.
    
            While abortions rights advocates have called the consent law unnecessary or outdated, Democratic lawmakers have not introduced legislation to repeal it.
    
            For Shannon Gracen, a 52-year-old from Symmes Township near Cincinnati, it wouldn’t be a bad thing if Ohio followed in Michigan’s footsteps.
    
            “Republicans are saying, what a mess it is in Michigan because they did this last year,” Gracen said. “And it’s just lies.”
    
            Gracen took her two adult daughters with her to vote early recently, and all three voted “yes” on Issue 1.
    
            “We voted ‘yes’ because we want to make sure that women have rights,” she said.

      Three generations of women under one roof raised an outgoing, curious boy. They’ll never see him graduate from high school

            “Hi Grandson, I started grief counseling today, I need to do this to help me with why you are not here, I yearn for you sooooooo much.”
    
            “Hi Grandson, I know you said YaYa don’t cry, but I am crying Bryson because my heart hurts so much for you, I miss you like crazy, I am so sad that you are not here.”
    
            “Hi Grandson, YaYa is fighting for you, because you did not deserve what has happened to you.”
    
            Erica Colbert texts her grandson, Bryson Hudson, almost every day. She gives him updates about his mother, Katika Travis, and younger brother, Drake. She tells him how she talks about him to everybody. She tells him he is her “everything.”
    
            The curious, rambunctious child was raised by his mother, his grandmother and great-grandmother, Colbert’s mother. When 19-year-old Travis learned she was pregnant with Bryson, her firstborn, the three generations of women were living under the same roof in Baltimore.
    
            The moment she laid eyes on her grandson, Colbert said he changed her life.
    
            She said they showered their outgoing boy with love and affection, instilled in him an infectious sense of humor, taught him and nurtured him from his birth to his senseless, violent death this year.
    
            “He was very much the light of where he stepped,” Colbert said.
    
            But now, Colbert spends her days trying to answer the “whys” surrounding her grandson’s killing, she said. She won’t see Bryson graduate from high school; she won’t see him have a girlfriend, wife, or children.
    
            He will always be 16 years old, Colbert said.
    
            On August 14, two months after his 16th birthday, Bryson was killed in the East Baltimore neighborhood where he grew up. He was two blocks from home when he was shot multiple times in broad daylight.
    
            Bryson was pronounced dead roughly 11 minutes after arriving at the hospital, according to his grandmother.
    
            His death came just two weeks before he would have started his junior year at Digital Harbor High School, a Baltimore City public college preparatory high school for students who desire to pursue a technology career. His mother had been planning to surprise him with driving lessons soon, Colbert said. Bryson had told his family he wanted to travel the country after graduation.
    
            Christopher McLean, 28, was charged in September with first- and second-degree murder in Bryson’s killing and faces additional charges related to the shooting, including first-degree assault and attempted murder, state charging documents show. Robert D. Cole, an attorney for McLean, declined to comment on his client’s behalf when contacted by CNN.
    
            A 28-year-old man was also wounded in the shooting, police said. It’s unclear whether Bryson was a bystander or targeted.
    
            Bryson is among at least 1,400 children and teens killed by a gun so far in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Firearms became the No. 1 killer of children and teens in America in 2020, surpassing motor vehicle accidents, which had long been the leading cause of death among America’s youth.

            “He should be looking at my death certificate, not me looking at his death certificate that says he died from multiple gunshot wounds,” Colbert said through tears. “That should not be a reality.”
    
            The grandmother winces every time she hears the phrase, “He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
    
            “Where was he supposed to be? Are all of us in the wrong place at the wrong time? He wasn’t in the wrong place. He was in his neighborhood,” she said.
    
            Bryson loved to make jokes, his grandmother said, often causing belly-laughs just by being himself. His outgoing spirit and warmth helped even shyer children open up around him.
    
            He also loved to dance, Colbert said, and they danced together often.
    
            But she misses his deep, full-bodied laughter the most.
    
            “I just want to hear him laugh. He had such a unique laugh and we used to have such a good time,” his grandmother said.
    
            Bryson was also interested in fashion and liked to dress in his own way. He was known for his hair, Colbert said, so much so that his friends would tell her, “You know, YaYa, everybody wants to get their hair just like Bryson’s.”
    
            But most of all, Bryson had a “heart of gold.”
    
            Colbert laughed when she recalled his 15th birthday, when he asked her for a Louis Vuitton belt as a gift. Though it was expensive, she bought it for him anyway.
    
            Then, one day, she noticed Bryson’s friend wearing a very similar belt.
    
            “‘Your friend got a belt like yours?’” Colbert recalled asking Bryson at the time. “He said, ‘Oh no, YaYa, I just let him use it. We borrow each other’s things.’”
    
            “Anything he did – if he had $10, he was going to give a friend five,” she said.
    
            Bryson’s friends are devastated by his loss, Colbert said. They grew up together and never missed the chance to celebrate each other’s milestones. As kids, they played football. As teens, they rapped and made music videos.
    
            “He was definitely the light. His friends, everyone came around him,” Colbert added. “I could see my daughter’s house was the house that all the kids migrated to.”
    
            But no one came between Bryson and his 12-year-old brother, Drake. Colbert described them as “two peas in a pod,” constantly playing, bickering and teasing each other.
    
            Drake misses his brother, and it shows, she said.
    
            At the start of the school year, his mother bought Drake a new pair of shoes. But he chose to wear Bryson’s sneakers to school instead, even though they were a size too big.
    
            “Anything he can still wear of Bryson’s, he’s wearing it,” Colbert said.
    
            Gun violence is an epidemic in the US. Here are 4 things you can do today
    
            Along with his younger brother, Bryson was especially close to his great-grandmother. One of the hardest moments in his young life, Colbert recalled, was when his “Granny” died. Bryson was 13 at the time.
    
            They had a special bond, communicating often and effortlessly, despite their wide age gap, Colbert said of her grandson and mother. When the family all came together, the pair were always laughing and whispering to each other, Colbert said.
    
            “It would just be them wanting to get a reaction from you,” she said. “Because my mom was a jokester, she always wanted laughter. She always felt like something was funny to laugh at, so she definitely passed that on to him and he carried it well.”
    
            In her texts now to her grandson, Colbert tells Bryson she often thinks about him reuniting with his Granny.
    
            “I want you here, but I feel Granny has you in her arms, Bryson you are my heart and not having you here my heart is broken.”  
    
            “I miss you Grandson #1, wyd? Are you and Granny whispering?”

      First on CNN: Democratic lawmakers call for insurance plans to fully cover over-the-counter birth control pill
    ","
			By Jacqueline Howard, CNN

        6:00 AM EDT, Mon October 30, 2023
    ","
            Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are urging the Biden administration to require private health insurance plans to fully cover the first over-the-counter birth control pill in the United States, which is expected to hit store shelves starting early next year.
    
            The US Food and Drug Administration approved the medication Opill in July, making it the first daily oral contraceptive approved for use in the US without needing a prescription. This over-the-counter birth control pill, which contains only the hormone progestin, is expected to be available in drug stores, convenience stores and grocery stores, as well as online.
    
            It’s still unclear what the retail price of Opill will be and, in a letter obtained by CNN, several dozen Senate Democrats are calling for federal agencies to ensure that private health insurance plans will fully cover the pill without a prescription. The letter, sent Monday morning, was addressed to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Labor Secretary Julie Su.
    
            “Over-the-counter birth control has the potential to be a real game-changer for so many women—but only if it’s actually affordable. The Biden Administration can and must do everything possible to get us there, and one major step they can take is requiring insurance companies to cover over-the-counter birth control without out-of-pocket costs or a prescription,” Washington Sen. Patty Murray, an author of the letter, said in an email.
    
            “As someone who worked to pass the Affordable Care Act that mandated no-cost coverage of birth control, I see no reason the ACA’s coverage mandate wouldn’t apply to FDA-approved over-the-counter birth control as well,” she said. “And since over-the-counter birth control may very well become the most convenient contraceptive option for many women, it’s that much more important that we make sure it’s fully covered.”
    
            In the letter, Murray — along with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and 44 of their Senate colleagues — asked the heads of the US departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor to undertake “additional actions” ensuring coverage for over-the-counter contraceptive products without cost-sharing or the need for a prescription. Those three departments have the authority to require plans to cover over-the-counter contraception.
    
            “The FDA’s approval of Opill is a milestone; however, for an OTC birth control pill to meet its potential and be truly accessible, federal departments must ensure that it is covered without cost-sharing and without the need for a prescription as a condition of coverage,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter.
    
            The letter mentioned that additional training and billing guidance for pharmacists and other health care providers would help these efforts to expand access to over-the-counter contraceptives like Opill.
    
            “To expand access to affordable contraception, we urge the tri-departments to issue new guidance that reflects current HRSA guidelines and clarifies that federally and state-regulated private health plans must cover OTC contraceptive products without cost-sharing, including when purchased without a prescription,” the lawmakers wrote, referring to guidelines from the Health Resources and Services Administration that currently doesn’t include a prescription requirement for coverage of contraception. “We request that you do this as soon as possible.”
    
            As for how much Opill might cost, a representative at Perrigo, the manufacturer of the drug, said in an email Thursday that “pricing of Opill at the shelf will be at the sole discretion of each retailer. Perrigo has not disclosed its suggested manufacturers retail price at this time. We are committed to ensuring that Opill will be accessible to people who need it, and more details will be shared in the coming months.”
    
            Currently, federal law mandates most private health insurance plans and Medicaid expansion programs to cover the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive methods, but for that coverage, health plans typically say a prescription is needed — and such coverage varies state by state.
    
            As of October, at least six states had passed laws requiring health plans to cover certain oral contraception without a prescription and without cost-sharing, according to a report released last month by the nonprofit KFF.
    
            But in theory, if the three federal departments — HHS, Treasury and Labor — require private health insurers to fully cover over-the-counter contraceptives without a prescription, “this could certainly impact access across the United States and make that coverage more even,” said Michelle Long, an author of the KFF report and senior policy analyst of women’s health policy at KFF.
    
            In June, President Biden issued an executive order directing administration officials to consider new ways to improve access to affordable over-the-counter contraception and to consider new guidance to ensure that private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act covers all FDA-cleared contraceptives without cost sharing.
    
            Then earlier this month, the Departments of Treasury, Labor and HHS issued a “request for information” to gather input from the public regarding the potential benefits and costs of requiring coverage for over-the-counter preventive services, including contraception. The public can submit their comments until December 4.
    
            These public comments will help inform any rules around extending coverage requirements to over-the-counter preventive products and services, including oral contraception.
    
            “It’s one thing to put a law on the books. It’s another thing entirely to figure out the mechanics of it, and how to actually operationalize it,” Long said. “Obviously, cost is a big part of access and how far reaching and effective this OTC pill can be really depends on insurance coverage.”
    
            On Friday, Biden administration officials convened a meeting with private sector leaders — including insurers and pharmacies — to discuss efforts to ensure access to affordable and high-quality contraception. Many of those same organizations are in the process of responding to the “request for information,” said Jennifer Klein, assistant to the President and director of the Gender Policy Council.
    
            “The first daily oral contraceptive will be available for over-the-counter use and we need to make sure that the private sector as well as government actors are doing everything they can to make sure that that contraceptive product gets into the hands of people who need it,” Klein said. “We are looking at all of the options to ensure access.”
    
            Without a federal requirement for private health insurers to fully cover over-the-counter contraceptives, consumers wanting to use Opill will have one of two options — pay out of pocket for whatever the retail price of Opill will be or get a comparable contraceptive pill prescribed by their provider with no out of pocket cost as it would be covered by their insurance, said Dana Singiser, a health care policy expert and co-founder of the advocacy nonprofit Contraceptive Access Initiative (CAI).
    
            “On one hand, if you get a prescription, then your contraception is covered by insurance under the ACA. But if you buy it at the retail store over the counter, it’s not covered,” Singiser said. “So, it just makes no sense that a contraceptive product would be covered when you buy it on the shelf as opposed to when you obtain it with a prescription when it has the exact same health benefits.”
    
            Singiser’s organization CAI is in support of the lawmakers’ letter, she said, adding that equitable access to contraception is even more important now, following last year’s Supreme Court Dobbs decision to reverse Roe v. Wade in the United States, which overturned the constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            “We are working to eliminate the unnecessary prescription barrier for oral contraceptives, which Opill did by getting FDA approval to sell their product over the counter. We also need to address the affordability issue by making sure that Opill and other forms of OTC contraception are covered by insurance,” Singiser said.
    
            “We can only really achieve fully equitable access if we address both the prescription barrier and affordability for Opill,” she said. “In the wake of the Dobbs decision, policymakers need to be doing everything possible to make contraception more affordable for pregnancy prevention, for personal autonomy, and for all of the health benefits that contraception offers.”
    
            In her email, Sen. Murray said the Dobbs decision led to a “health care crisis” and it is among the factors making the push for “accessible and affordable” birth control even more urgent now.
    
            For decades, Murray has pushed for affordable and accessible birth control, and last year, before the approval of Opill, she introduced the Affordability is Access Act — reintroducing it in May — which would ensure that insurers fully cover over-the-counter birth control without any fees or out-of-pocket costs.
    
            “The Dobbs decision unleashed a full-blown health care crisis across the country—and in the wake of this disastrous decision that has made pregnancy more dangerous and has caused so many women to suffer, it’s more important than ever that we make sure birth control is as accessible and affordable as possible,” Murray said in her email.
    
            “The truth is, we have always had to fight tooth and nail, and really be vocal about that fight, in order to get women contraception and basic reproductive health care they can actually afford,” she said in part. “This time is no different.”

      After infant’s death, FDA sends new warning about probiotics for premature babies in the hospital
    ","

    ","
            The US Food and Drug Administration is sharing a new warning about the risks of probiotics for hospitalized preterm infants. The products have been linked with over two dozen reported adverse events since 2018 and one death in 2023, the agency said.
    
            On Thursday, the agency announced it had sent a warning letter to Abbott Laboratories for its Similac Probiotic Tri-Blend product, which the FDA described as an unapproved new drug and unlicensed biological product based on statements on its website and in marketing materials. The company agreed to discontinue sales of the product, the agency said.
    
            In a statement on Friday, Abbott said that the issue “pertains to a single probiotic additive” for Similac Probiotic Tri-Blend, and that the probiotic is used by fewer than 200 hospitals. It does not apply to Abbott infant formula products.
    
            “Parents and caregivers can continue to find and use Similac infant formulas nationwide. This Warning Letter is not related to any manufacturing quality issue. This product has been used for the past several years and has had a strong safety profile,” the statement said.
    
            Probiotics, which contain live bacteria or other microorganisms for health benefits, are commonly used in the United States as dietary supplements. However, dietary supplements are not subject to the rigorous FDA approval process.
    
            In hospitals, probiotics are often used to help prevent necrotizing enterocolitis, known as NEC, a life-threatening inflammation of the intestines in preterm infants. According to Dr. Katherine Chetta, a pediatric neonatologist at the Medical University of South Carolina, the disease can affect up to 1 in 20 premature infants, causing about one baby each day to die.
    
            The American Academy of Pediatrics says that about 10% of preterm infants receive probiotics while in neonatal ICUs, a number that’s steadily increasing around the country. They’re one of the “main tools” that health care providers use for NEC, Chetta said.
    
            However, in a statement, the FDA said that there is “conflicting data” about safety and effectiveness of probiotics for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis. It urged more “high quality clinical trials” that could provide definitive evidence.
    
            “Adverse events in any infant following the use of a probiotic are a concern to the FDA. We especially want to make clear that products containing live microorganisms may present serious risks to preterm infants in hospital settings,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.
    
            Earlier this month, the FDA reported that an infant died after receiving the probiotic Evivo with MCT Oil. The product, manufactured by Infinant Health for use in hospital settings, contained the infantis subspecies of the live bacterium Bifidobacterium longum. The baby died after developing sepsis caused by the same species of bacteria.
    
            In a warning letter, the agency cautioned health care providers that bacteria and fungi found in probiotics might put preterm infants at risk of “invasive, potentially fatal” infections. The product was recalled after the FDA sent the warning letter and is no longer available in the US.
    
            The FDA emphasized that it hasn’t approved any probiotic products for infants of any age, and products haven’t been evaluated for safety, effectiveness or compliance with manufacturing and testing standards.
    
            “With today’s message, we want to warn parents, caregivers and healthcare providers that if these products are used for the prevention or treatment of disease, they have not undergone the agency’s rigorous premarket process to evaluate their safety, effectiveness and quality for these medical uses,” Marks added.
    
            The American Academy of Pediatrics also does not recommend the supplements for preterm infants.
    
            “Given the lack of FDA-regulated pharmaceutical-grade products in the United States, conflicting data on safety and efficacy, and potential for harm in a highly vulnerable population, current evidence does not support the routine, universal administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight of <1000 g,” according to a 2021 clinical report from the pediatrician group.
    
            But some physicians are concerned by the FDA’s opposition to probiotic therapy.
    
            For many infants being treated in hospitals, Chetta explained, antibiotic treatment can alter the ecosystem, or microbiome, of bacteria in a baby’s gut, killing “good” types of bacteria while leaving “bad” types, like E. coli. Probiotics can help reintroduce more diverse, healthy bacteria into the infant’s body — rebuilding the microbiome and staving off infections such as NEC.
    
            For Chetta, there’s enough data supporting the use of probiotics, especially since hospitals like hers select probiotics that they say they’ve seen work.
    
            “We have high confidence in the probiotics we use,“ Chetta said. “We know that the babies actually get less sepsis with probiotics, they get less NEC, they get less death. “The real concern was and is: When is the FDA going to approve a product?”
    
            There’s about a 1 in 5,000 chance that an infant receiving probiotics develops sepsis, far lower than the chance of an NEC infection, Chetta said. When preparing to treat an infant with probiotics, she also gives parents a say in evaluating the risks — including that the treatments are not FDA approved — compared with its effectiveness. For her, those benefits far outweigh the harms.
    
            “The answer is not just removing all probiotics,” she said. “The answer is finding a solution, a safe solution where our babies can get the medicines and supplements they need.”

      Opinion: ‘The Dobbs effect’ isn’t just galvanizing voters, it’s creating candidates
    ","

            Tennessee mom Allie Phillips isn’t supposed to be running for office.
    
            If everything had gone according to plan, the 28-year-old would be the mom of two living daughters. She would be balancing the Herculean task of raising her six-year-old, Adalie, while navigating exhausting late-night feedings, never-ending diaper changes and everything else that goes with caring for a three-month-old.
    
            Instead, she’s running for the District 75 seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives, and suing the state over its abortion ban, after she was forced to travel out of state to obtain an abortion to end her non-viable pregnancy.
    
            “My journey is the biggest reason why I’m running,” Phillips told me. “But the people in my state deserve better. My family and the people in my community, we all deserve to have happy, healthy lives — no matter how we choose to do that. It should be our choice.”
    
            Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion has become an even more galvanizing political issue, dominating the midterm elections, becoming one of the top issues for voters in the upcoming presidential vote and drawing a record number of voters to the polls in local and state elections. 
    
            The Dobbs decision also motivated an increased number of women to consider running for office. Organizations like Emerge and Run For Something all reported an increase in website traffic and in the number of women signing up for information about public office training programs – what was dubbed “The Dobbs effect.” 
    
            It has also opened the floodgates for countless, harrowing stories of women being denied abortion care, in some cases putting their lives at risk, forcing them to carry doomed pregnancies to term and traumatizing families in the process.
    
            Phillips’ much-wanted second pregnancy was diagnosed with multiple fatal fetal abnormalities at 18 weeks gestation. The fetus — a baby girl named Miley Rose had a brain that did not split into two hemispheres, a heart with only two working chambers and a bladder, stomach and kidneys that did not develop properly.
    
            Phillips was faced with two options: Carry a non-viable pregnancy to term, possibly putting her own life at risk, or end her pregnancy.
    
            “My baby was going to die,” Phillips says. “And I was forced to leave my home state.”
    
            In Tennessee, all abortions are banned with few exceptions for instances when the pregnant person’s life is at risk. Doctors there could not offer Phillips abortion care, despite her daughter’s multiple abnormalities and complications, because they could still detect a fetal heartbeat.
    
            Until Miley died in utero or Phillips was, as she recalled, near-death “enough,” physicians could do nothing.
    
            “I had to go to New York to get an abortion,” Phillips says. Travel, lodging and the procedure itself cost Phillips’ family, who lives paycheck to paycheck, over $3,200.
    
            As an ultrasound technician prepped Phillips for the procedure, she discovered that Miley had already passed in utero, though it was unclear when her heart had stopped beating. Phillips’ had the procedure immediately, instead of the next day as planned, as doctors feared she could develop a severe infection.
    
            To ensure she would survive her non-viable pregnancy, Phillips was treated by physicians she didn’t know, in a city she had never visited, far away from home.
    
            Stories like Phillips are not uncommon. A woman in Texas, Amanda Zurawski, nearly died after she was denied an abortion and developed a life-threatening infection. A woman in Oklahoma, Jaci Statton, was told to wait in a hospital parking lot until she was closer to death before doctors would provide her with abortion care. A mom in Idaho, Jennifer Adkins, was forced to leave her home state after her 12-week pregnancy had a 1% chance of survival and was likely to endanger her health or kill her.
    
            These stories also directly conflict with the GOP’s supposedly “pro-life” narrative, and Americans are noticing. A reported 6 out of 10 US adults disapprove of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. In a recent Gallup poll, 51% of Americans  said abortion should be legal “only under certain circumstances” and 34% believe it should be legal under “any circumstances.” The vast majority of Republicans support abortion exceptions in the cases of rape, incest and threats to the pregnant person’s life.
    
            When voters are asked which party best represents their view on abortion, 42% cite the Democratic party versus the 26% who cite the Republican party, according to KFF.
    
            It’s difficult for Republicans to posit their anti-abortion policies as a valiant, almost martyr-like effort to “protect the sanctity of life” when those same policies are undeniably harming pregnant people and putting their lives in danger.
    
            That’s why people like Phillips should send a chill down the GOP’s collective spine. Their talking points are not in line with reality — not the medical realities of abortion care nor the realities of those who are denied that care — and the American public is getting a front row seat to their rank hypocrisy by way of not just women’s personal stories but their political opponents.
    
            Of course, politicians sharing personal stories is nothing new. But the stigma surrounding abortion has historically kept many if not most lawmakers tight-lipped when it comes to personal abortion stories — until recently. Now, more and more lawmakers are coming forward and sharing their personal abortion stories in the face of extreme anti-abortion bans and policies, including Rep. Cori Bush, who had an abortion after she was sexually assaulted as a teenager; Rep. Barbara Lee, who received an illegal abortion in Mexico as a teen; and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who had an abortion after she was told her pregnancy was high-risk.
    
            As more lawmakers and potential lawmakers share their personal stories, those vying for or already in position of power will continue to make the GOP’s anti-abortion stance all the more unpopular. In fact — it’s science. Studies show that personal stories are remembered 22 more times more than facts alone and are more effective at persuading individuals than figures or statistics.
    
            “One of the moments that led me to run for office was my meeting with my current state representative, Jeff Burkhart,” Phillips says. “Hearing how ill-informed he was when it came to women’s reproductive health – it didn’t shock me, but it was one of those things when you know they don’t know what they’re talking about… then you hear them actually say words.” When Phillips asked Burkhart what he would tell his daughter to do if she was pregnant with a fetus that was incompatible with life, she says he replied: “I’d tell her to continue the pregnancy.” Burkhart has not commented publicly in response to press inquiries about Phillips’ account of their meeting.
    
            Given that the GOP is woefully (and arguably intentionally) ignorant of the facts regarding abortion care, the party has neither facts nor personal narratives on their side – a looming political pitfall that will continue to cost the party dearly. The GOP is likely to face an increase of political opponents that not only support abortion rights but who, like Phillips, also carry with them personal stories of how those reproductive justice policies can save lives and support families. They are the canary in the coal mine for an already-chaotic Republican party.
    
            Phillips wants to be clear: Her abortion story is just one of many reasons why she says she is running for office. “There are so many other things I care about,” she says. “I care about the LGBTQ+ community, expanding Medicaid… I care about so many things. I grew up here in Tennessee and I’m raising a daughter here. I want to make sure this is a safe place for her.
    
            “The Republican narrative is that women who have abortions just love ‘killing babies’ and we shouldn’t be in office,” she adds. “Nothing could be further from the truth, and stories like mine prove it.”

      Democrats lean into abortion fight in deep-red Kentucky governor’s race
    ","

    ","
            Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s reelection bid in Kentucky has emerged as a critical test of how the fight over abortion rights will shape the political landscape ahead of the 2024 presidential election.
    
            The Democratic incumbent’s focus on abortion rights – in a Republican-leaning state where abortions are outlawed in virtually all cases – comes in a race featuring cultural crosscurrents, as GOP nominee Daniel Cameron, the state attorney general, hammers Beshear over transgender issues, pandemic-era shutdowns and more.
    
            Beshear is seeking to buck the trend of states snapping back to their partisan foundations in gubernatorial races. Deep-blue Maryland and Massachusetts last year elected Democratic governors after eight years of moderate Republican chief executives. And reliably red Louisiana earlier this month chose Republican Jeff Landry as its replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards.
    
            It’s left just two states with governors dramatically at odds with their states’ typical partisan leanings: Kansas and Kentucky.
    
            What those two states have in common: In the wake of Roe v. Wade’s reversal by the Supreme Court last year, voters in both states rejected anti-abortion ballot measures.
    
            In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly was narrowly reelected in 2022 after running a campaign against Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt that focused on the economy, tax cuts and education.
    
            Now, in Kentucky, Beshear is similarly touting economic wins and sharing credit with the Republican-led state legislature. And Beshear, the son of a former governor, is popular – while nonpartisan public polling of the race is limited, both Republican and Democratic groups have released polls in recent months showing him ahead of Cameron.
    
            But he is also leaning much more aggressively than Kelly did in her race into his differences with Cameron on abortion.
    
            As the result of a 2019 law that took effect when the US Supreme Court reversed Roe’s federal abortion rights protections, Kentucky currently bans the procedure in all cases, except when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. The state’s law does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.
    
            Beshear’s campaign has aired a series of television ads focused on the issue – including a searing attack on Cameron featuring Hadley Duvall, a 21-year-old woman who discussed the trauma of being raped by her stepfather as she lambasted the Republican attorney general for failing to support exemptions to Kentucky’s abortion ban for cases of rape and incest.
    
            “This is to you, Daniel Cameron,” she says in the ad, looking directly into a camera. “To tell a 12-year-old girl she must have the baby of her stepfather who raped her is unthinkable.”
    
            Cameron responded to Duvall’s criticism, saying at a forum hosted by Spectrum News 1 that he “cannot comprehend just how traumatic that experience was. And my heart goes out to her. And I want her to know that.”
    
            “But when it comes to the issue of life, look, this is a delicate issue,” Cameron said. “I was at church a couple of weeks ago, and our pastor talked about this issue in particular. We need to speak gently and kindly because it is such a sensitive issue, and there are a range of different viewpoints on the question of life. Mine happens to evolve from my position on faith and my relationship with Christ, and I think as a person of faith, I have a responsibility to protect the unborn.”
    
            Over five debates in recent weeks, Beshear has returned again and again to the issue of abortion.
    
            “He cannot and he will not look into the camera and tell girls like Hadley that they deserve exceptions and he will support them. These are little kids that he would force to carry the baby of their rapist. That is wrong, that’s extreme and that’s not who we are as Kentuckians,” Beshear said at a debate last week.
    
            Cameron said he would sign into law a bill that would add exceptions for cases of rape and incest to Kentucky’s abortion law, if he is elected and sent one by the state’s GOP-led legislature.
    
            However, Beshear said: “What you couldn’t and didn’t hear him say is that he supports, personally, exceptions for victims of rape and incest.”
    
            The Democratic governor pointed to a Kentucky Right to Life survey on which Cameron said he opposes those exceptions.
    
            “He signed his name. When someone shows you who they are, believe them,” Beshear said.
    
            Cameron, meanwhile, criticized Beshear for his April 2022 veto of a bill that would have banned abortion after 15 weeks. That veto came before the Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade.
    
            “His largest campaign contributor outside of Joe Biden is Planned Parenthood. So don’t be at all fooled by the fact that Andy Beshear won’t tell you what he wants in terms of limits, because what he wants is no limits and the taxpayer to pay for it,” Cameron said.
    
            Beshear said he had vetoed that bill because it had no exceptions for rape and incest, “showing exactly where (Cameron) is on it.” The Democratic governor has also said he opposes late-term abortions.
    
            Cameron criticized Beshear for his 2021 decision to allow a bill that required doctors to perform life-saving care on any infant who shows signs of life – including surviving an abortion attempt – to become law without his signature.
    
            “You heard TV Andy, who tells you what you want to hear. But Frankfort Andy does the exact opposite,” Cameron said.
    
            Outside Democratic groups have hammered Cameron on abortion too.
    
            Defending Bluegrass Values, a political action committee backed by the Democratic Governors Association, last week launched an ad that features a woman who says she had learned at her 20-week ultrasound that her baby would be born with a serious birth defect called anencephaly, which would have prevented the child’s survival.
    
            “We had to end the pregnancy. But if Daniel Cameron had gotten his way, it would have forced us to give birth to our child with no brain,” the woman said.
    
            In an attempt to redirect the race’s focus – and shift it onto seemingly friendlier ground for Republican positions – Cameron has sharply criticized Beshear over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, blaming him for student learning loss after school closures in 2020.
    
            If he had been governor, Cameron said at a debate Monday night, he would have acted like other GOP chief executives who tried “to get their states open as quickly as possible.”
    
            “But Andy Beshear, like (California Gov.) Gavin Newsom, tried to shut this state down for nearly two years,” Cameron said.
    
            Cameron would not address whether he would have broken with Donald Trump on pandemic policies, when the then-president relied on health experts’ advice in the spring and summer of 2020.
    
            “You have to do what’s hard when you’re in a 1-in-100-year pandemic,” Beshear said. “He couldn’t even answer a question about whether he would have made one or two decisions, and I had to make them every day. These were battlefield decisions.”
    
            Beshear said he waited to send teachers back to classrooms until they’d been prioritized to receive Covid-19 vaccines. He also said Cameron would have sent teachers back to school before the vaccine was available. Beshear signed an executive order in March 2021 encouraging schools to return to in-person learning; later that month, he signed into law a bill requiring at least some in-person instruction.
    
            “It was real, and acting like it wasn’t – acting like we shouldn’t have taken those steps – is a slap in the face” to health care workers, the governor said.
    
            Cameron said Beshear was to blame for test results that showed large numbers of students struggling across core subjects, including reading, math and science.
    
            “This governor, because of pride, won’t tell you that he has regrets,” Cameron said.
    
            The clash between Beshear and Cameron over education has also focused on private school vouchers, which are illegal under the Kentucky constitution’s ban on taxation for non-public schools without voters’ approval.
    
            At Monday night’s debate, Cameron refused to directly answer a question about whether he supports private school vouchers.
    
            He pointed to an education plan he has touted on the campaign trail, which he said is focused on “catching up kids from the shutdown,” and asserted that he would “support primarily our public school system.”
    
            He did not directly answer when the moderator followed up twice. Beshear jumped in to accuse Cameron of dodging the question three times.
    
            “Look in a camera and answer the question. I oppose vouchers, 100%. They steal money from our public schools and send it to our private schools,” Beshear said. “What’s concerning is, he won’t be honest with you and answer a direct question.”
    
            Cameron said he agrees “that we need to expand opportunity and choice” but again pivoted to criticizing Beshear for school shutdowns during the coronavirus pandemic.
    
            “Andy Beshear shut you down for two years. Your kids are behind on learning – reading, science and math,” Cameron said. The pandemic began in March 2020; Beshear signed a bill approved by the Republican-led legislature requiring schools to return to in-person instruction by March 29, 2021.
    
            Beshear again pointed out that Cameron was not directly addressing his position on vouchers, before the GOP nominee finally conceded that he would sign a voucher plan into law if sent one by the Republican-led legislature.
    
            “He won’t be honest enough with your viewers to say a view that we all know that he has,” Beshear said.

      Fact check: DeSantis falsely claims ‘no pro-lifer has ever argued’ to jail a woman for getting an abortion
    ","
			By Daniel Dale, CNN

        1:40 PM EDT, Tue October 24, 2023
    ","
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis falsely claimed last week that “no pro-lifer has ever argued” that a woman should be jailed for getting an abortion.
    
            DeSantis made the claim while criticizing a rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations. DeSantis and Haley have sparred more frequently in recent weeks as they have battled to become the top alternative to former President Donald Trump, who holds a big lead in opinion polls of the party primary.
    
            At a Thursday event at Winthrop College in South Carolina, DeSantis was asked if he took exception to anything Haley has been advocating on abortion-related policy, such as banning “late-term” abortions, encouraging adoptions, ensuring access to contraception and making sure women are not jailed for having an abortion.
    
            DeSantis scoffed at Haley’s comments about preventing women from being jailed.
    
            “Well, look, I mean, of course you’re not going to jail a woman. No pro-lifer has ever argued for that,” DeSantis said in remarks his campaign subsequently posted on social media. 
    
            DeSantis continued, “So when she’s saying that, she’s indulging media narratives. That’s a narrative; that’s not how it is. We have a heartbeat bill in Florida; has nothing to do with putting a woman – it’s ridiculous that that would even be mentioned. So I think she’s playing in to some of the stereotypes that the left uses against conservatives. Don’t accept the media narrative.”
    
            Facts First: DeSantis’ claim that “no pro-lifer has ever argued” to jail women for getting an abortion is not true. Some opponents of abortion rights, including a group of party lawmakers in the South Carolina state House this year, have pushed for the passage of laws that would treat women who get abortions as murderers and subject them to the possibility of decades in prison. 
    
            DeSantis could have fairly said that the most prominent US anti-abortion groups have expressed opposition to the idea of jailing women for getting an abortion. But the idea is supported by some hard-line anti-abortion groups and at least a smattering of Republican state lawmakers around the country. So it’s not true that “no pro-lifer has ever” called for such penalties or that Haley or the media conjured up this notion from thin air. 
    
            The DeSantis campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article.
    
            Earlier this year, some Republican members of the South Carolina state House announced their support for a bill, the South Carolina Prenatal Equal Protection Act, that would have treated abortion as homicide and allowed the person who got the abortion to be punished as a murderer – and subjected to the state’s usual sentences for murder, ranging from 30 years in prison to the death penalty.
    
            The Post and Courier newspaper of Charleston reported that the bill had as many as 24 Republican cosponsors at its peak. The bill never came close to becoming law – the number of cosponsors fell sharply after a backlash – but it was nonetheless a real proposal backed by some of the party’s elected officials. 
    
            Broadly similar bills have also been introduced by Republican legislators in other states, products of an anti-abortion “abolitionist” movement that lies outside the mainstream of the anti-abortion movement but that has grown in prominence this decade. 
    
            In a 2022 story on the movement, CNN’s Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken reported on a Republican bill introduced in the Louisiana state House that year that would have allowed murder charges against women who received abortions. Their article noted that more than a dozen states had seen the introduction of “abolition” bills that would allow women who got abortions to be punished as criminals. 
    
            “It is false that no-anti abortion advocate has argued for incarcerating people for their abortion,” Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel and legal director at If/When/How, an organization that supports abortion rights, said in an email last week. Citing the Louisiana proposal, Diaz-Tello said, “This policy effort was the brainchild of the anti-abortion faction that has gained supporters and momentum over the last five years. This group’s primary platform focuses on the idea that abortion is murder and anyone involved, including the person who had the abortion, should be held criminally liable. “
    
            Diaz-Tello also noted that during Haley’s governorship of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017, South Carolina had a decades-old law on the books that allowed a maximum penalty of two years in prison for the crime of self-administering an abortion, such as by ordering abortion medication. The law was little-known and rarely enforced.
    
            When DeSantis spoke of having “a heartbeat bill in Florida” that he said has nothing to do with jailing women, he appeared to be referring to a bill he signed into law earlier this year, called the Heartbeat Protection Act, that would ban most abortions in Florida after the six-week mark of pregnancy. (The law hasn’t taken effect because the state Supreme Court hasn’t yet ruled on a challenge to the state’s existing 15-week ban.)
    
            Journalist Norah O’Donnell of CBS asked DeSantis last month about a provision in the new six-week ban that says a felony has been committed by “any person who performs, or actively participates in, a termination of pregnancy” in violation of the requirements of that section of the law.
    
            The section in question is focused on physicians, and DeSantis argued that reading the law makes it clear that the criminal penalties apply only to medical practitioners and not at all to the women who get abortions. Florida Democrats have argued that the law’s “actively participates in” language is so broad that it could potentially be interpreted as also applying to the women who get abortions or even to people who help transport them to their appointments.
    
            For the purpose of this fact check, a verdict on the meaning of the Florida statute isn’t necessary. DeSantis was wrong regardless in categorically declaring that “no pro-lifer,” period, has called for jailing women for getting abortions.

      Georgia State Supreme Court upholds six-week abortion ban

    ","
            The Georgia State Supreme Court upheld the state’s six-week abortion ban in a ruling Tuesday morning.
    
            The ruling reverses a lower court’s decision to void certain sections of the LIFE Act because it was enacted prior to the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision one year ago that overturned the federal right to an abortion under Roe v. Wade.
    
            Georgia’s LIFE Act bans, with some exceptions, abortion when early cardiac activity is detected – which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when many women don’t yet know they are pregnant.
    
            The Tuesday ruling said in part, “the trial court erred in relying on overruled decisions of the United States Supreme Court to conclude that portions of the LIFE Act violated the United States Constitution when enacted in 2019. The same United States Constitution governs today as when the LIFE Act was enacted, and Georgia courts are required to look to the United States Supreme Court’s now-controlling interpretation of the United States Constitution when determining whether a statutory law violates that Constitution.”
    
            “We are pleased with the court’s decision and will continue to defend the constitutionality of Georgia’s LIFE Act,” Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement. 
    
            In response to the state Supreme Court’s decision, Monica Simpson, the executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, a plaintiff in the case, said, “Today’s devastating decision means that our people will continue to face the horrible reality that they are in today where Georgians are suffering because they cannot access abortion care. This abortion ban has forced Georgians to travel across state lines at great expense or continue the life-altering consequences of pregnancy and childbirth against their wills.” 
    
            Lauren Eden, the Georgia advocate for the Abortion Survivors network, told CNN, “I am thrilled. It’s going to protect so many innocent lives like mine. This will not only protect the lives of unborn babies, but also the lives of the mothers who we know suffer so much pain after an abortion procedure.”
    
            Georgia House Democrats denounced the decision in a statement, “This harmful decision leaves in place a deadly restriction on reproductive rights and criminalizes doctors who are seeking to provide life saving healthcare to patients across the state.”
    
            The Georgia State Supreme Court did not offer a ruling on a subsequent challenge by plaintiffs that said the ban “violates the due-process, equal-protection, and/or inherent-rights provisions of the Georgia Constitution,” but instead remanded the case back to the trial court for a decision.

      Abortions increased in the US overall in the year post-Dobbs, but there are stark inequalities state-to-state
    ","

    ","
            In the year following the Supreme Court Dobbs decision, the abortion landscape in the United States became more fractured than ever.
    
            Abortions increased nationwide, according to a new report from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning — the average monthly change in the 12 months post-Dobbs compared to the two months pre-Dobbs adds up to about 2,200 more abortions over the course of a year.
    
            But the trends diverged sharply based on state policy, with abortions all but stopped in states with bans and significant increases in many states where abortion remained legal.
    
            There were about 115,000 fewer abortions in the 17 states with total or six-week bans in effect, plummeting 98% in banned states and dropping 40% in those with 6-week gestational limits, according to the new report. About a third of the overall decline can be attributed to Texas.
    
            The remaining 33 states where abortion remained legal, along with the District of Columbia, recorded nearly 117,000 more abortions — a 14% increase year-over-year.
    
            “This is a sign of increasing inequality of access,” said Caitlin Myers, a  professor of economics at Middlebury College. Her research has focused on abortion trends, but she was not involved in the new analysis.
    
            “Whether somebody who wants to access abortion can actually do so depends more than ever on where they live,” she said.
    
            The #WeCount analysis tracks both procedural and medication abortions through data reported by providers, but it does not account for self-managed abortions such as those received through Aid Access that are not obtained within the formal US health care system.
    
            Much of the increase in states where abortion remains legal were among patients who traveled from states with bans or restrictions, experts say. The new report doesn’t capture how widespread the need to travel for an abortion has become, but local data suggests a clear trend.
    
            There were 21,500 more abortions in Illinois in the year after the Dobbs decision, more than any other state, according to the new report. Nearly a quarter of patients that went to Planned Parenthood Illinois traveled from another state in that time, according to the organization – up from 7% before the Supreme Court decision. And Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains says that 90% of the increase they’ve seen has been among out-of-state patients.
    
            Providers in Florida reported the third most abortions overall and the second largest increase, according to the new report. And more than 5,000 people have traveled from out-of-state to receive an abortion in Florida so far this year, according to data from the state health department — already more than in all of 2021.
    
            Abortion in the conservative state is currently legal but in limbo as the state’s Supreme Court weighs a challenge to restrict it. The situation there highlights the massive consequences that ongoing uncertainty threatens, experts say.
    
            “Florida going dark would reverberate through the South and dramatically increase driving distances,” Myers said. Displaced patients from within the state and others who relied on the clinics there would likely head north for care, and the flood of patients could create congestion in places like North Carolina or even Virginia, she said.
    
            Earlier research has shown that travel is a significant barrier. And even if additional resources help reduce the burden on patients, it shouldn’t be the gauge of success, experts say.
    
            “It’s really not a public health triumph that people have to mobilize the financial and social resources to travel, sometimes hundreds of miles away from their home, to obtain basic health care,” said Dr. Alison Norris, co-chair of #WeCount and association professor at The Ohio State University’s College of Public Health. “That’s really a public health crisis.”
    
            And there is no measure of how many are falling through the cracks.
    
            About 30% of patients don’t show up for the appointments they make for their abortion care, said Adrienne Mansanares, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. But when matched with Patient Navigators — staff dedicated to helping individuals with one-on-one support for their abortion, including finding financial assistance, counseling, logistical guidance and more — the share of missed appointments drops to 2%.
    
            “They were all near-misses. Any one of those details could cause a person to miss (their appointment),” Mansanares said. Access to abortion care is so critical that patients will do whatever it takes to make the appointment as long as they have the resources, she said.
    
            Work to reduce barriers and better protect access in states where abortion remains legal has helped create new opportunities for care that didn’t exist before, expert say.
    
            “Some of these increases are the result of meeting an unmet need, and that’s valuable,” Norris said. Expanded telehealth options, investment in expanding clinics and additional financial resources for patients are among the influx of resources that have helped meet some of the unmet need, she said.
    
            “Still, thousands of people can’t get care in the state where they live. Period. And there’s no reason to assume that the increases in some states are due to everybody who needs an abortion being able to travel for one.”
    
            And for a variety of reasons, there’s looming concern about how permanent some of those valuable resources will be, Norris said.
    
            An increasing share of abortions are provided by virtual-only telehealth providers, according to the new report — up from an average of about 4,000 a month before Dobbs to nearly 7,000 a month afterward.
    
            But legal challenges to the medication abortion drug mifepristone hang in the balance, with the Supreme Court asked to make another significant ruling next year.
    
            “What’s looming over all of this is that the story is not over,” Myers said.

      Infertility gets a new, expanded definition to address ‘the reality of all’ seeking care, medical group says
    ","
			By Jacqueline Howard, CNN
		;Jacqueline Howard","
  Updated
        7:16 PM EDT, Mon October 23, 2023
    ","
            Reproductive health experts are updating how they define “infertility” to be more inclusive.
    
            The new definition, issued last week by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Practice Committee, has been expanded to include anyone needing medical interventions “in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner.”
    
            The updated definition will be published as a report in the society’s journal Fertility and Sterility in about a week or 10 days, Sean Tipton, ASRM’s chief advocacy and policy officer, said Monday.
    
            In the new definition, “we made it explicit that lack of access to the kind of gametes you need is a condition deserving of treatment,” Tipton said, referring to how some people who are single or in same-sex couples would fall into that category.
    
            “That is, the reason you may need medical assistance to build your family, it can be because your fallopian tubes don’t work, or it could be because your sperm don’t swim right. But it could also be because you’re single, or because you are in a relationship with a person who doesn’t have the kind of gametes you need. Those are legitimate causes of infertility, and they need to be treated accordingly,” Tipton said. “It is our hope that this definition removes one of the excuses that insurance companies have attempted to use to deny patients coverage for the medical care they need to have children.”
    
            The ASRM previously defined infertility as the failure to get pregnant within a year of having regular, unprotected intercourse or therapeutic donor insemination in women younger than 35 or within six months in women older than 35. That diagnostic and treatment guideline remains unchanged for heterosexual couples trying to have a baby.
    
            But the updated definition now expands beyond that to also state that infertility is characterized by the “inability to achieve a successful pregnancy based on a patient’s medical, sexual, and reproductive history, age, physical findings, diagnostic testing,” or “the need for medical intervention,” such as donor eggs or sperm.
    
            “This revised definition reflects that all persons, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or gender identity, deserve equal access to reproductive medicine. This inclusive definition helps ensure that anyone seeking to build a family has equitable access to infertility treatment and care,” Dr. Jared Robins, CEO of ASRM, said in a news release last week.
    
            The new definition “acknowledges the reality of all seeking infertility care,” Robins said, and ASRM looks forward to “working with our members, policymakers, and others to normalize this definition.”
    
            While infertility generally has been defined as not being able to conceive after a year or longer of unprotected sex for heterosexual couples, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said on its website that “these definitions of infertility are used for data collection and monitoring,” and “they are not intended to guide recommendations about the provision of fertility care services. Individuals and couples who are unable to conceive a child should consider making an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist—a doctor who specializes in managing infertility.”
    
            Overall, the new ASRM definition addresses two groups. It maintains a definition of infertility for heterosexual couples – being a year of trying but not conceiving for women younger than 35 and six months of trying but not conceiving for those 35 and older – and it includes patients who are single or in same-sex couples, said Dr. Rachel Ashby, director of the Donor Egg and Gestational Carrier Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who was not involved in the new ASRM definition.
    
            On one hand, “infertility is a disease state. It’s a condition that needs treatment,” Ashby said. “Then the other thing that stands out is the idea that for many people, they can’t get pregnant without the use of donor gametes. If I’m a single woman, if I’m in a same-sex relationship as a woman, or if I’m two men, I need donor gametes. This is another tenet of infertility that’s inclusive of the LGBT community.”
    
            Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a San Francisco-based reproductive endocrinologist, called the new ASRM definition a positive step forward.
    
            “By adopting a more inclusive and accurate definition of infertility, the medical community can better serve and support those in need of reproductive assistance. It not only promotes transparency but also helps reduce the stigma often associated with fertility problems,” Eyvazzadeh, who was not involved in the updated definition, said in an email.
    
            “There are doctors who feel compelled to tell patients that insurance won’t cover a service because they don’t meet a ‘definition’ even if it’s unrelated to insurance coverage,” Eyvazzadeh said in the email. “The definition means a lot to fertility doctors and patients and I’m thrilled to see this change.”

      Abortion coverage is limited or unavailable at a quarter of large workplaces
    ","

    ","
            About a quarter of large U.S. employers heavily restrict coverage of legal abortions or don’t cover them at all under health plans for their workers, according to the latest employer health benefits survey by KFF.
    
            The findings demonstrate another realm, beyond state laws, in which access to abortion care varies widely across America since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
    
            More than ever, where someone works and the constraints of their health insurance can determine whether an abortion is possible. Workers without coverage are left to pay out-of-pocket for abortion care and related costs.
    
            In 2021, the median costs for people paying out-of-pocket in the first trimester were $568 for a medication abortion and $625 for an abortion procedure, according to a report from Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California-San Francisco. By the second trimester, the cost increased to $775 for abortion procedures.
    
            KFF’s 2023 annual survey found that 10% of large employers — defined as those with at least 200 workers — don’t cover legal abortion care under their largest job-based health plan. An additional 18% said legal abortions are covered only in limited circumstances, such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or endangers a person’s life or health.
    
            The share of employers that said they don’t cover abortion under any circumstances “is bigger than I would have expected,” said Matthew Rae, an associate director at KFF who helped conduct the survey.
    
            So far, 14 states, mostly in the South and Midwest, have enacted near-total abortion bans, and an additional seven states have instituted gestational limits between six and 18 weeks. Abortion is legal in 24 states and the District of Columbia.
    
            Sharply divergent state abortion laws solidified in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision compound the complexity for employers with workers across multiple states, Rae said. Many large companies employ people in places with vastly different abortion policies, and their health benefits are more likely to cover dependents who may live elsewhere.
    
            “Those dependents can be college kids — and college kids can be anywhere — or any other type of dependent who could just spread out over an area much larger than where you just have actual physical establishments,” Rae said.
    
            The KFF survey found that about a third of large companies said they cover legal abortions in most or all circumstances; the largest companies, with at least 5,000 employees, were more likely to offer the benefit compared with smaller firms. An additional 40% said they were unsure of their coverage — perhaps because employer policies are in flux, Rae said.
    
            Employer health plans’ treatment of abortion has changed little since the Dobbs decision, the survey found. Among companies that said they did not cover legally provided abortion services or covered them in limited circumstances, 3% reduced or eliminated abortion coverage. By contrast, of the large companies that generally covered abortion, 12% added or significantly expanded coverage.
    
            That’s in sharp contrast to the rapidly changing laws governing abortion access in the states. It’s unclear whether workers at companies that don’t cover abortion or heavily restrict coverage are located primarily in states that have outlawed the procedure.
    
            The KFF survey includes information from more than 2,100 large and small companies on their health benefits and the related costs for workers. Annual premiums for family coverage rose 7% on average this year, to $23,968, with employees on average contributing $6,575 toward that cost. The jump in premiums represents a notable increase compared with that of the previous year, when there was virtually no growth in those costs. Average yearly deductibles for workers were $1,735 for single coverage, a cost that was relatively unchanged.
    
            One tactic employers use is to provide separate benefits for abortion-related expenses. In response to increasingly restrictive state abortion laws and the Supreme Court’s decision, large companies — such as Amazon, Starbucks, Disney, Meta, and JPMorgan Chase, among others — announced they would pay for employees’ abortion-related travel expenses.
    
            However, the KFF survey found that a small share of large employers said they provide or plan to provide workers with financial help to cover abortion-related travel expenses. Companies with at least 5,000 workers are the most likely to provide that assistance. Overall, 7% of large employers said they provide or plan to provide financial assistance to employees who must travel out of state for abortion care.
    
            According to the Brigid Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that helps people with logistics and defrays abortion-related costs, average travel costs now exceed $2,300. As restrictive laws proliferate, distances traveled have also increased since the Dobbsruling, with each person on average traveling roughly 1,300 miles round trip in the first half of 2023.
    
            Recent research published by job-search firm Indeed, the Institute of Labor Economics, and academics from the University of Southern California and the University of Maryland found that employers that announced abortion-related travel benefits saw an 8% increase in clicks on their job postings compared with similar jobs at comparable employers that did not announce such a policy.
    
            However, job satisfaction among existing employees also dropped at those companies, with ratings of senior management dropping “8%, driven by workers in typically male-dominated jobs,” they wrote, “illustrating both the potential perks and pitfalls for companies that choose to wade into contentious political waters.”

      Trey’shawn Eunes, who wanted to make his mother proud, was killed at 12 in an accidental shooting in Texas

    ","
            Trey’shawn Eunes was confused. 
    
            “Why would you give me Brooklyn’s uncle’s shirt?” the 11-year-old asked his mother last year, staring at the latest in their family’s series of T-shirts personalized to mark special milestones.
    
            This time, it was a baby shower: Trey’shawn’s older brother was expecting.
    
            “You are Brooklyn’s uncle,” his mother, Lakesha Bay, told him, recalling to CNN how her son’s eyes lit up and his smile spread as the realization struck.
    
            He threw on the shirt. 
    
            Trey, as his mom calls him, was just a kid. But he was going to be an uncle.
    
            A year later came another shirt commemorating Trey’s niece’s first birthday.
    
            Trey never got to wear it.
    
            Instead, his mom placed it in his casket days after he was fatally shot.
    
            The proud young uncle had been at a gathering in Fort Worth, Texas, with his father on Juneteenth when police believe a 3-year-old picked up a handgun and accidentally fired it, striking Trey as he played video games, according to an arrest warrant for a man accused of tampering with evidence after the shooting.
    
            At just 12, Trey became one of more than 1,300 children and teens in the United States killed by a gun so far in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive, as firearms surpassed motor vehicles in 2020 as the No. 1 killer of children and teens in America – a particularly grim facet of the gun violence epidemic ravaging US communities.
    
            Gun violence is an epidemic in the US. Here are 4 things you can do today
    
            Trey’s death also makes Bay one of many mothers struggling with the pain of losing a child to the scourge. She feels the devastating loss anew each morning when she opens her eyes.
    
            “Every day I have to relive that as a parent,” Bay told CNN through tears. “A child passing away, he doesn’t just pass away one time. He passes away every day. Every morning I wake up, it hits me like I’m getting hit by a car … 
    
            “It’s the worst kind of pain for your child to not just have died but to die over and over and over again.”
    
            In the same way Trey doted on his niece – “He was obsessed with Brooklyn,” Bay said – the family had long doted on him.
    
            When Trey was little, relatives used to argue over who would get to hold him or which sibling would sit with him in the backseat of the car, she said. Trey, in turn, loved his siblings and was close with all of them, Bay said.
    
            “He’s always been the family favorite,” she said.
    
            That adoration extended well beyond his family. Trey was charismatic; wherever he went, making friends came easy to him, his mom said, whether they were his classmates, teammates or kids in the neighborhood. If he wasn’t playing football or PlayStation, you’d find him outside with them, riding his electric scooter.
    
            Trey was a natural athlete, Bay said. She recalled fondly how, several years ago, he had to try out – not just sign up – for a football team for the first time. They both knew he would make the roster, but Bay still remembers their shared joy when they saw his name on the list.
    
            “We were just like jumping up and down, hugging each other, taking pictures of his name on the list,” she said, calling it one of her “favorite memories.”
    
            “He achieved something, and he worked for it, and he actually made the team,” Bay said. “I could tell that it did something for him. I was just happy for him.”

            Trey loved playing on that team, his mother said, and he was good at it – among their best. He was a starter and never taken out of the game.
    
            Trey’s love of football was evident too at home, where he often played Madden NFL on his PlayStation 4. He competed online with his best friend, Bay said, but he and his friends each had miniature TVs they would lug back and forth to each other’s homes, so they could play together.
    
            For years, Trey would tell people he wanted to be a police officer when he grew up. But as he got older, he wasn’t sure, his mom said. When she asked what he might want to do, he asked her in turn, “What do you think I’d be good at?”
    
            Really, he just wanted to make people proud, especially his mom and dad. But that was easy, Bay said. Trey was a “really good kid,” always doing his best in school and never disobedient or troublesome. And though money could be tight, his mom tried to find ways to reward him: a trip to the trampoline park here, a PlayStation gift card there.
    
            “He deserved it,” she said.
    
            Just weeks before he died, Trey finished sixth grade and was looking forward to middle school. He was stylish and already was talking with Bay about what clothes and shoes he wanted to get before school started. And he was getting ready to try out for the school football team, one his mother knew he would have made.
    
            But he was most excited because he’d be attending the same middle school his mom had. They dreamed of seeing him follow in her footsteps, eventually graduating from her alma mater, James Martin High School in Arlington, Bay said.
    
            Now, Trey will never get that chance, at least not the way he imagined it. When he finished sixth grade this spring, he and his classmates had a graduation ceremony – at Martin High School.
    
            “I still look at it this way: He achieved that goal for me, for him. He still graduated at Martin High School,” Bay said. “I’ll always have that in my heart because that’s what he wanted to do. 
    
            “He wanted to make me so proud all the time.”

      Mother of 6-year-old killed in alleged anti-Muslim attack near Chicago released from hospital after being stabbed over a dozen times

            A Chicago-area woman who was stabbed multiple times in an alleged anti-Muslim attack that left her 6-year-old son dead last week has been released from the hospital, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Chicago office.
    
            Hanaan Shahin, 32, lived with her son, Wadea Al Fayoume, in a rented house in Plainfield Township, Illinois, for two years before their landlord brutally attacked them on October 14, according to the Will County Sheriff’s Office.
    
            The family was “targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis, the sheriff’s office said.
    
            Shahin told police she was able to get away by locking herself in the nearby bathroom, but was not able to get her son. While in there, she called police, according to a court filing. Shahin was rushed to the hospital with more than a dozen stab wounds, the sheriff’s office said.
    
            Wadea, who was stabbed 26 times, did not survive, according to authorities. Shahin could not attend his funeral services Monday as she remained in the hospital, CAIR said.
    
            It is unclear exactly when Shahin was discharged from the hospital, where she is now or how she is doing. CNN has reached out to CAIR Chicago and the sheriff’s office for more information.
    
            Joseph M. Czuba, the 71-year-old suspect, has been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other charges. The Department of Justice is investigating the attack as a hate crime. Czuba’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for October 30.
    
            “This incident cannot help but further raise the fears of Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities in our country with regard to hate-fueled violence,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement last week.
    
            The attack on the family occurred as thousands of civilians, including children, have been killed in Israel and Gaza after Hamas militants launched attacks in Israel on October 7, causing Israel to respond with airstrikes over Gaza.
    
            Shahin is from a village in the West Bank, according to Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Chicago.

      ‘I’m scared for my unborn child’: Gaza’s pregnant women prepare to give birth in a war zone

            Khulood Khaled was woken up by the sound of Israeli airstrikes as she slept next to her son last week. Black smoke filled the room, making it difficult for her to breathe. She felt a sense of panic setting in, followed by pain in her abdomen. She thought she was going into early labor. 
    
            Eight months pregnant and worried about her unborn child, the 28-year-old decided to leave her home in the al-Karama district of the northern Gaza Strip the next day as the bombing continued. 
    
            “We watched houses dropping as we drove, thinking we could die any minute,” she told CNN. On the way, she saw refugees being struck by Israeli jets “just meters away,” She hugged her son “so we’d die together.” 
    
            Khulood eventually made it to the southern city of Khan Younis, but she is now surviving on “a dry piece of bread,” as the territory faces a food shortage and no electricity or running water. “I don’t know if the bread will be available tomorrow,” she said. 
    
            Around 50,000 women in Gaza are pregnant, 10% of whom are expected to give birth in the coming month, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).  
    
            Those women face a “double nightmare” after a “horrifying week” of Israeli airstrikes, Dominic Allen, the UNFPA’s Representative for the State of Palestine, told CNN Sunday.  
    
            Gaza residents have faced Israeli airstrikes in several rounds of conflict over the past few years. But this time it’s different. Israel has vowed “mighty vengeance” after the Hamas militants that control the territory launched an attack on October 7, killing 1,400 in Israel. 
    
            Between October 7 and 12, Israel dropped 6,000 bombs on the enclave – that’s equivalent to the total number of airstrikes on Gaza during the entire 2014 Gaza-Israel conflict, which lasted 50 days. It now appears to be preparing for a ground operation into the enclave. 
    
            Israel has also imposed what it calls a “complete siege” on the territory, blocking supplies of water, electricity, goods and fuel. Human rights organizations have condemned the move as “collective punishment” and “a war crime.” Locals say that Khan Younis is still being targeted by Israeli strikes. 
    
            Many Gazans have heeded Israel’s call to evacuate from northern Gaza, with hundreds of thousands making their way south. But moving hasn’t been easy for everyone, including the sick, elderly and pregnant.  
    
            Some have been worried about the safety of the escape routes. CNN has geolocated and authenticated videos from the scene of a large explosion on Friday along a route to south. 
    
            Nardeen Fares is nine months pregnant with her first child. Following the call by the Israeli military for civilians to flee the 27-year-old traveled Friday with her husband from the al-Rimal neighborhood in Gaza City to Khan Younis – roughly 16 miles away or a 40-minute drive. 
    
            With her due date rapidly approaching, Fares says she fears what the future holds.  
    
            “Right now, there is an exodus… half of the Gaza Strip is moving to Khan Younis,” Fares told CNN Friday by phone, adding that she is now sharing a 6-bedroom dwelling with more than 80 other people.  
    
            “As a woman who is in her last month of pregnancy, God knows when it will happen and what the situation will be like then,” Fares said. “Bombardment, no bombardment, you don’t know what will happen then.” 
    
            She’s concerned that hospitals in Khan Younis won’t be equipped to treat her if she goes into labor given the sheer number of people that are descending on the city. Khan Younis had a population of just over 400,000 before the war. Given the city’s proximity to the Egyptian border, it’s the destination of choice for many of those fleeing the north. 
    
            Israel on Sunday said that 500,000 residents are estimated to have left northern Gaza for the south. 
    
            Ten members of a single family were killed Monday after an Israeli airstrike hit Al Kizan neighborhood, doctors in the city’s Nasser Hospital told CNN, adding that 23 other people had been injured. 
    
            She says she has heard that hospitals in the city are barely operational and medical services are “almost gone” amid a fuel shortage.  
    
            The World Health Organization warned last week that the health system in the entire strip is at a breaking point, adding that the impact would be devastating for the most vulnerable patients, including the injured who need lifesaving surgery, patients in intensive care units, and newborns depending on care in incubators. 
    
            Allen of the UNFPA said pregnant women in Gaza are “facing unthinkable challenges,” saying the stories he has heard coming out of Gaza’s are “harrowing.”  
    
            “Imagine going through that process in those final stages and your last trimester before giving birth, with possible complications, without clothing, without hygiene, support, and not sure about what the next day, next hour, next minute will bring for themselves and for their unborn child,” Allen said.  
    
            The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has warned that Gaza’s humanitarian situation is reaching catastrophic levels, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning Sunday that the Middle East was “on the verge of the abyss.”  
    
            Mona Ashour, seven months pregnant, has stayed in the north of the Strip, but not by choice. 
    
            Her family doesn’t have the financial means to travel south, she said in messages relayed to CNN by her cousin Hashem Al-Saudi, adding that even if they could travel, the family of four has no one to stay with in the south.  
    
            Ashour has reduced her nutrition to the bare minimum as food and water supplies dwindle due to Israel’s blockade. She knows this could be affecting her unborn child, and that’s causing her a lot of stress.  
    
            Ashour has two daughters, and the family lives in a house that has a makeshift roof made of tin panels, leaving them exposed to shrapnel from potential Israeli missiles.  
    
            “I need a lot of nutritional supplements,” she said, adding that her husband, who used to work on a daily wage before the war, cannot afford them anymore.  
    
            The Palestinian Authority’s media office said Monday that Gaza is “on the brink of a real famine as goods in stores are running out, and no aid is coming in,” adding that over half a million people have been displaced in the enclave.  
    
            Relief groups and the UN are calling for aid to get into Gaza, some of which has arrived in Egypt’s north Sinai but is yet to cross into Gaza through the Egypt-controlled Rafah crossing.  
    
            After meeting the Egyptian president amid a whistle-stop tour of the region, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the crossing – which is the sole remaining route into or out of Gaza – “will be open.” He didn’t say when. 
    
            Over the weekend, concrete slabs were placed at the Egyptian side of the crossing, blocking all gates, a Palestinian border official told CNN Saturday. 
    
            On Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said there has been no progress in efforts to open the crossing, and blamed Israel for its continued closure. 
    
            Khulood, who fled northern Gaza, said she won’t know where to go when it’s time for her to give birth. 
    
            “I’m scared. For my son, my unborn child and myself,” she told CNN. “I don’t want to die. I want to see my son grow up… but there’s no life left here. Gaza has become a ghost city.”

      You can advocate for yourself in labor, and a nurse shares how
    ","

    ","
            Most people anticipate the day of their child’s birth to be one of the happiest of their lives, but the experience isn’t always so uncomplicated.
    
            Things can change quickly when delivering a baby, and the experience could start to look different from what you expected, said North Carolina-based labor and delivery nurse Jen Hamilton.
    
            The goal of labor is to have a happy and healthy mom and baby at the end, but it should be the minimum of what we strive for, she said.
    
            Hamilton spoke to CNN to share how patients and providers can work toward better birth experiences.
    
            This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
    
            CNN: What do people need to know about the birth experience?
    
            Jen Hamilton: Birth trauma does not have to mean that you had an emergency C-section. It doesn’t have to mean that you had a really traumatic-like delivery with forceps.
    
            Birth trauma can come from just not being listened to. It can come from not feeling prepared. It can come from not having things explained to you. It can come from having not the right people on your team, whether it’s health care providers or your own personal support team.
    
            CNN: What should people going into delivery expect from their health care team?
    
            Hamilton: I want people to know — especially if they’re my patients — that we are there to advocate for them, to listen to them, to believe them, and we’re there to make sure that they feel safe and supported. And what’s happening in obstetrics right now — that isn’t always what people feel when they come.
    
            I also want them to know that they have choices in labor. I feel like that’s something that we don’t do well, and obstetrics either it’s kind of like, this is what we’re going to do, rather than this is what we recommend and why we recommend it, and these are the alternatives, and you make the choice for yourself. So, I think that knowing about autonomy in birth is so important.
    
            CNN: When can people having a baby be advocating for themselves in the hospital?
    
            Hamilton: I think basically the whole thing. I think that people don’t know that at any point we can stop. We can talk; we can ask questions; we have time. Unless something is an emergency, then we have time to talk about things and to discuss it before anything happens.
    
            I have a lot of patients who come in who are terrified, and they don’t know what questions to ask. So, as they come up, you know, it’s important that they are able to articulate or have someone there with them that feels confident and comfortable in articulating those concerns or those questions.
    
            But I think most of all, the burden falls on us as health care professionals to set up that environment where patients feel safe to do so, that we’re not making them feel like they’re a burden, that we’re not making them feel like they’re bothering us. We are literally there to make sure that they feel safe in every moment.
    
            CNN: It can be scary when a birth plan doesn’t go as expected. How should families coming into labor and delivery make one — even knowing it may change?
    
            Hamilton: I am all about a birth plan because it helps me get to know who you are as a person and what’s important to you before we get started. I also think it’s so important for us as health care workers to talk about possibilities on the horizon.
    
            I’m very much a fan of what I call birth vibes. Meaning that it’s A-OK if somebody comes into the hospital and they really don’t know what they’re going to want. Because there are a lot of people that come in with birth plans, having researched so many things and what other people think that they should do, and whenever they get to that point, it doesn’t fit what they thought they wanted.
    
            But some things will never change, like they want to feel respected, they want to feel like they have a choice.
    
            I have created like a birth vibe template, and that is really just for me as your nurse to be able to see how you like to be cared for best. So for instance, like whenever I was little, it was comforting to me if my mom put a wet rag on my forehead if I was feeling bad, right? But something that’s not comforting to me is like someone touching my hair … I don’t like that.
    
            It gives me ideas of how I can support you in labor. And also talking about how you like to process information: Are you somebody that if something is changing, you want to know every single detail? Are you somebody who wants to know just the nitty-gritty? It helps me to be able to communicate with you, knowing who is important to you and who you do not want to be there.
    
            Those are some good birth vibes to think about, but any plan that comes in obviously is subject to change. But I’m going to follow it as closely as I possibly can and advocate for every patient. I just want to make sure that all of their decisions are informed, empowered decisions.
    
            CNN: Are some birth plans better than others?
    
            Hamilton: There’s a very big push to do everything natural and to not intervene at all. I think that the word natural kind of can cause some birth trauma and some grief if things don’t go that way.
    
            There are natural processes that happen that are not positive. Infection is a natural process. Other bad things that happen are natural processes. But there are things that can happen in labor that may be seen as interventions that are there in place to be a tool.
    
            (For example), someone … comes into labor and delivery, and everyone has told them to go “natural,” but what that means to them is unmedicated. They don’t want an epidural. They don’t want any medicine. Sometimes they get into labor and realize that that is not what is going to be a positive birth experience for them.
    
            And then they’re in this panic of “I didn’t expect this. Now what do I do?” and they’re having to make decisions on the fly, when they may not feel informed or empowered about those decisions, because they expected it to go a certain way and it didn’t go exactly the way that they want.
    
            Pregame those conversations like, “OK, well, what if I get into labor, and it isn’t what I thought it was going to be, and I do need help? What would I be willing to use as a tool? And what are the pros and cons of using that tool?”
    
            CNN: How should someone having a baby pick the people in the room with them?
    
            Hamilton: The No. 1 thing that you can do in that situation is bring the right people. Sometimes, your baby’s father is not going to be the support person that you need, and that’s OK to make those decisions based off of who you know will be there for you in labor.
    
            I tell people however your partner treats you when you are sick is likely how they will treat you when you are in labor. If your partner when you have the flu expects you to cook and clean and make dinner for them, they are likely going to be this kind of person who is asleep on the couch while you’re going through labor.
    
            If you’re unsure about someone, don’t have them come at all.
    
            If people want to do things on their own to try to ensure a positive experience, the biggest way that you can do that is by picking the right provider. If you’re going with a doula, having the right doula on your team is going to make a world of difference.
    
            And if you’re in the situation and you feel like people on your support team, like your health care team, are not the right people for you, you can ask for a different nurse, you can ask for a different provider in that moment.
    
            Say, “This is not what I want, and I need somebody different.” I tell people, there’s always another nurse, always. If you feel that that person is not listening to you, that you’re not getting what you need, don’t continue going down that path with that person.
    
            And if you’re looking for a provider, that means asking around and (checking with) maybe some moms groups or other people that have had babies, and bonus points, if you know any people who work on labor and delivery who can talk to you about how that provider is you know in an actual real-life situation.
    
            CNN: How can someone in the room best support their loved one having a baby?
    
            Hamilton: I think a great resource is learning about labor, taking prenatal classes with their partner so that they are aware of things that happen.
    
            But I think also some support people can be very strict on a birth plan when even the pregnant person is wanting to change that plan. For instance, I’ve had patients come in who say like, “I do not want an epidural at all.” And then whenever they get to a moment where they’re like screaming for an epidural, their support person (is) saying, “No, you can’t have it.”
    
            Be able to support decisions that that pregnant person makes in the moment — those game-time decisions that they’re making, supporting them throughout those decisions.
    
            But I love it when support people are engaged in the process. Please do not just sleep on the couch the whole time. Don’t bring your Xbox to the room. Don’t eat a deep-dish pizza in front of your partner. I’ve seen so many wild things.

            Britney Spears reveals a personal experience she has kept private for two decades in her upcoming memoir.
    
            During her relationship with Justin Timberlake, Spears became pregnant by the singer and had an abortion, she writes in a book excerpt published by People.
    
            “It was a surprise, but for me, it wasn’t a tragedy. I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I’d anticipated,” Spears writes in her book, “The Woman in Me.”
    
            “But,” she writes, “Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young.”
    
            CNN has not yet been able to independently review “The Woman in Me.” 
    
            A representative for Timberlake did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    
            In the excerpt, Spears writes about how she felt conflicted at the time
    
            “If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it,” she writes. “And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”
    
            “To this day, it’s one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life,” she adds.
    
            Timberlake and Spears dated from 1999 until 2002.
    
            Spears later married dancer Kevin Federline and had two sons, Sean Preston, 18, and Jayden James, 17, prior to her and Federline divorcing in 2007.

      Emergency medical association rejects ‘excited delirium,’ used to describe some deaths in police custody
    ","

  Published
        8:25 PM EDT, Thu October 12, 2023
    ","
            An emergency physicians group is disavowing “excited delirium,” a controversial term that some police officers, clinicians, medical examiners and court experts have used to explain how an agitated person could die in custody through no fault of any force used to subdue them.
    
            Dr. Michele Heisler, medical director for Physicians for Human Rights, says that the American College of Emergency Physicians’ (ACEP) move will take excited delirium off the table in court cases. “This is the final professional medical or psychological or psychiatric association to repudiate the term,” she said.
    
            Excited delirium has been described by other medical associations as “associated with racism” and disproportionately used in the deaths of Black people. It was cited in one of the most high-profile cases of recent years: the death of George Floyd in 2020.
    
            ACEP’s Board of Directors confirmed Thursday that its 2009 white paper on excited delirium syndrome is “outdated and does not align with the College’s position based on the most recent science,” according to a statement on the organization’s website.
    
            “The term excited delirium should not be used among the wider medical and public health community, law enforcement organizations, and ACEP members acting as expert witnesses testifying in relevant civil or criminal litigation,” the statement says.
    
            This decision officially withdraws the board’s approval of the paper.
    
            Joanna Naples-Mitchell, US research adviser to Physicians for Human Rights and co-author of a 2022 report that traced the history and impact of this term and showed how excited delirium was often cited in deaths in police custody, said ACEP’s move was “a tremendous turning point.”
    
            The white paper has been “extremely influential,” she said, and one of the main reasons the term could be used in court.
    
            “Part of the reason that paper is so harmful is because not only has it been cited in court, but the content of the paper puts forth this definition of signs and symptoms of excited delirium that includes terms that have racist undertones and in fact may encourage law enforcement to use excessive force, including saying that someone with a delirium may have superhuman strength and [be] impervious to pain, and may not actually be able to respond to typical uses of force that are nonlethal,” she said.
    
            The paper was often used to bolster evidence in court, including in expert testimony in the trial of Derek Chauvin for the murder of Floyd. Experts would sometimes cite it to argue that the death of someone in custody lay with the person themselves rather than the actions taken by police.
    
            ACEP considered the syndrome a subcategory of delirium. Someone with excited delirium has been described in studies as being agitated, aggressive or disoriented, and the thinking was that this heightened state of emotion could lead to their death.
    
            Technically, excited delirium was never considered an official diagnosis because it isn’t listed in the reference materials used by mental health professionals or in the codes that health care facilities use to chart a diagnosis for insurance purposes and research. There is no blood or diagnostic test that can detect it. The 2022 Physicians for Human Rights report concluded that the term was “scientifically meaningless.”
    
            There is no national database tracking cases of “excited delirium,” but in one study, data showed that from 2010 to 2020, “there were 166 reported instances where a person died in police custody and excited delirium was described as a possible cause of death.” Black people made up 43% of those deaths, despite composing only 13% of the US population, according to the US Census.
    
            The term drew additional attention after the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a Black massage therapist who died after being put in a carotid hold by police. Paramedics had also injected him with ketamine. One of the officers involved in the incident was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and assault by a jury on Thursday, while another was acquitted of all charges. Two paramedics are also scheduled to go on trial in the coming weeks, and they have pleaded not guilty.
    
            In Floyd’s case, the Minneapolis police officer who held down his ankles was overheard saying “I just worry about excited delirium or whatever.” In court, a police surgeon testified that Floyd did not meet the criteria.
    
            In 2020, the American Psychiatric Association adopted a position against the diagnosis, saying that it was “nonspecific” and “lacks clear diagnostic criteria” and that it should not be used until such criteria are validated. The organization also called for the development of evidence-based protocols for when first responders use ketamine in emergency situations.
    
            “It is of concern that it can be used often retrospectively as a way to explain use of force in law enforcement contexts,” Dr. Debra Pinals, chair of the APA Council on Psychiatry and Law, told the association’s Psychiatric News at the time of McClain’s death.
    
            Also in 2020, the American Medical Association adopted a policy that opposed excited delirium as a medical diagnosis. The group warned first responders against using pharmacological interventions without a legitimate medical reason.
    
            The American Medical Association said its policy came about because of a pattern of police using the term and pharmacological interventions like ketamine as a “justification for excessive police force, disproportionately cited in cases where Black men die in law enforcement custody.”
    
            In February, the American College of Medical Toxicology said that because it is used in “multiple distinct contexts with various underlying causes, and has become associated with racism, it is time to discontinue the use of this term.”
    
            In April, the National Association of Medical Examiners issued a statement that asked its members to stop listing excited delirium as a cause of death.
    
            This week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that would make the state the first to ban excited delirium as a diagnosis and as a cause of death.
    
            ACEP has been considering the issue for years. In 2021, a task force decided that the organization should not recognize the use of “excited delirium” and argued that it should no longer be used in clinical settings. Disavowing the paper, as the group did this week, makes the statement stronger, and experts say this means it should no longer be used in court.
    
            The group does, however, recognize a similar term, “hyperactive delirium with severe agitation,” which it says is a “potentially life-threatening clinical condition characterized by a combination of vital sign abnormalities, pronounced agitation, altered mental status, and metabolic derangements.”
    
            When dealing with someone with hyperactive delirium, the organization advised in April, first responders should focus on reducing stress, preventing physical harm and taking the person to a hospital where they can be treated by an emergency physician.
    
            Heisler, who is also a professor of internal medical and public health at the University of Michigan, says excited delirium “is just a baseless concept and should never have been used as a diagnosis – and certainly not as a cause of death.”
    
            Heisler says she hopes ACEP will now work to educate its membership about the policy change to ensure that the concept is never used again.
    
            CNN’s Julia Jones, Amir Vera, Carma Hassan, Amanda Musa and Markian Hawryluk contributed to this report.

      Israeli official says government cannot confirm babies were beheaded in Hamas attack

            The Israeli government has not confirmed the specific claim that Hamas attackers cut off the heads of babies during their shock attack on Saturday, an Israeli official told CNN, contradicting a previous public statement by the Prime Minister’s office.
    
            “There have been cases of Hamas militants carrying out beheadings and other ISIS-style atrocities. However, we cannot confirm if the victims were men or women, soldiers or civilians, adults or children,” the official said. 
    
            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that people had been beheaded by Hamas in an appearance beside Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday, but did not specify if they were children.
    
            His office later released what it described as “horrifying photos of babies murdered and burned by the Hamas monsters.”
    
            The three photos showed two babies whose bodies had been burned beyond recognition and a third infant’s bloodstained body. 
    
            The post said that Netanyahu showed Blinken the photos, as well as others.
    
            The explosive allegations that children had been decapitated at the kibbutz of Kfar Aza emerged Tuesday in Israeli media. Israel Defense Forces later described the scene as a “massacre” in a statement to CNN. Women, children toddlers and the elderly were “brutally butchered in an ISIS way of action,” the IDF said.
    
            Tal Heinrich, a spokeswoman for Netanyahu, said on Wednesday that babies and toddlers had been found with their “heads decapitated” in Kfar Aza.
    
            US President Joe Biden appeared to confirm that information. In a roundtable with Jewish community leaders on Wednesday, he said: “I have been doing this a long time, I never really thought that I would see… have confirmed pictures of terrorist beheading children.” 
    
            A US administration official later clarified Biden’s remarks, telling CNN that neither Biden nor his aides had seen pictures or had received confirmed reports of children or infants having been beheaded by Hamas. The official clarified that Biden was referring to public comments from media outlets and Israeli officials.
    
            An IDF spokesman, Jonathan Conricus, later in the day said terrorists had likely carried out decapitations of babies in the Be’eri kibbutz. 
    
            “We got very very disturbing reports that came from the ground that there were babies that had been beheaded… I think we can now say with relative confidence that unfortunately this is what happened in Be’eri,” he said. 
    
            Israeli officials initially avoided discussing the specifics of how its citizens were killed. They instead likened Hamas’ brutality to that of ISIS, the Sunni terror group that beheaded captives and burned prisoners alive. 
    
            Hamas on Wednesday denied the allegations. Izzat al-Risheq, a senior official and spokesperson for the Islamist militant group, said that the international media had “spread lies about our Palestinian people and the resistance claiming that members of the Palestinian resistance beheaded children and attacked women with no evidence to support such claims and lies.”
    
            Al-Risheq’s claim that Hamas did not attack women is demonstrably false. Women, children and the elderly at kibbutzim like Kfar Aza and Be’eri and were killed during the surprise attack. Videos posted online verified by CNN show women who were attending the music festival targeted by the group’s gunmen being kidnapped.
    
            CNN has pored through hundreds of hours of media posted online attempting to corroborate accounts of atrocities committed by Hamas. In one video, which CNN determined to be authentic but has not been able to geolocate, an assailant attacks an injured man with a garden tool in an attempt to behead him. But CNN has not seen anything that would appear to confirm the claims of decapitated children.
    
            CNN also visited the ransacked ruins of Kfar Aza on Tuesday and saw no evidence of beheaded youths. Israeli officials have not released any photographs of the incident either.

      These women say their babies were stillborn. Courts convicted them of homicide in a country with harsh abortion laws

            A sign greets visitors arriving at a sun-filled two-story house in El Salvador’s capital.
    
            “You must enter smiling,” it says. “Before you come in, you will find an invisible bag where you can leave your sorrows. When you leave, you can decide whether to take them with you.”
    
            Teodora Vásquez knows the women seeking shelter, support or a fresh start here often have decades of sorrows weighing on them. And she’s propped up this sign beside a green plastic turtle near the front door as a first step toward the healing she hopes they’ll start to find within these walls.
    
            It’s been 25 years since El Salvador made abortion illegal in all circumstances, eliminating any exceptions. And it’s been nearly as long since lawmakers passed a constitutional amendment declaring that life begins at conception.
    
            Vásquez was among more than 180 women who advocates say were unjustly convicted of crimes after suffering obstetric emergencies, including miscarriages and stillbirths, in the years since the revised penal code and constitutional amendment went into effect. Activists warn that these women’s experiences show how dangerously far criminalizing abortion can go.
    
            Vásquez was convicted of aggravated homicide and imprisoned for more than 10 years before El Salvador’s Supreme Court commuted her 30-year sentence in 2018.
    
            The overcrowded Ilopango women’s prison where she lived for over a decade seems like a world away from the airy garden courtyard Vásquez points out as she gives a tour of her home via Zoom.
    
            But she says the experiences she endured behind bars — and how important it is to help others who’ve gone through the same thing — are never far from her mind.
    
            This house isn’t just where Vásquez lives. It’s also the headquarters of Mujeres Libres El Salvador, an organization she founded.
    
            The group’s name means “free women” in Spanish. And legally speaking, that’s exactly what Vásquez and the four other people who live here are. So, too, are the dozens of other women who’ve traveled hours to spend their weekends attending workshops here.
    
            Like Vásquez, in the last few years, courts have ordered their release from prison. But since then, there’s another kind of freedom that’s been harder to come by.
    
            “We’ve been living through a double conviction. First, the one the judge gave us,” Vásquez says, “then the one society gave us. And we call that a life sentence. Because from the moment you entered prison, for your entire life, you are going to have this. … You are going to die and they are going to remember you because you were a prisoner.”
    
            In recent years, the cases of Vásquez and other women have spurred global protests, appeals from the UN’s top human rights official and attention from Hollywood stars.
    
            But as recently as 2021, Salvadoran lawmakers voted to uphold the country’s abortion prohibitions. And within the socially conservative country, the ban is popular among many Catholic and evangelical Salvadorans.
    
            That, Vásquez says, is one reason why she and other women keep retelling the stories they wish they could forget. Now, as part of Mujeres Libres, Vásquez says they aren’t just trying to heal themselves. They have a much larger goal, too.
    
            “We want to make sure our history doesn’t repeat itself in future generations,” she says.
    
            The sharp pain hit Vásquez suddenly at the school café where she worked in July 2007. She was nine months pregnant at the time. She already had a young son, and Vásquez says she was looking forward to giving birth to a baby girl.
    
            “I wanted my daughter. I had bought clothes for her,” Vásquez says.
    
            As the pain intensified, she called 911 multiple times asking for help. Vásquez says the help she needed never came.
    
            She says she fainted in a bathroom and was unconscious when she gave birth.
    
            “When she regained consciousness, she was bleeding profusely and the baby was dead,” Amnesty International said in a 2016 summary of her case.
    
            When police finally arrived, they took her into custody.
    
            Vásquez says that initially she, like others, was accused of having an abortion.
    
            “Then they changed the classification to aggravated homicide,” she says. “That means that, to the Salvadoran state, our children were born alive and we killed them.”
    
            In January 2008, she was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
    
            Vásquez’s case and others like it caught the attention of Jocelyn Viterna, a professor of sociology and chair of Studies of Women, Gender and Sexuality at Harvard University who has spent decades studying the impact of abortion restrictions in El Salvador.
    
            “Once you start looking into these cases, the extreme injustice jumps off the page,” Viterna says. “These women had not done anything to break the law, and yet at every step the legal system was set up to prosecute them.”
    
            Many cases, Viterna says, involve impoverished women who were alone when they went into labor, and whose babies were either stillborn or died shortly after birth due to circumstances beyond their control. Subsequent autopsies, Viterna says, often relied on the so-called “lung float test,” a controversial method for investigating allegations of infanticide that dates back to the 17th century and has been discredited by many medical experts.
    
            Advocates in the United States warn that the Salvadoran women’s cases are a telling example of the kinds of prosecutions they fear will intensify in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning the federal constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            “That is just so dangerous,” says Dana Sussman, deputy executive director of Pregnancy Justice, a New York-based organization that defends people in the US facing criminal charges for pregnancy outcomes. “The idea that you could use forensics that are pseudoscience to convict women in these tragic cases is really, really concerning.”
    
            It took time for the women to find each other inside the prison where many of them were held.
    
            The crime they were convicted of — killing their babies — carried such a stigma that they dared not mention it aloud. Those who did were beaten by fellow inmates.
    
            “We were already friends, but nobody was talking about our cases,” Vásquez says in “Fly So Far,” a 2021 documentary that follows her story.
    
            It was only after a group of human rights lawyers met with them together that they realized the connections their cases shared. As advocacy groups mounted protests calling for their freedom, the documentary details how the group of detained women nominated Vásquez to be their spokesperson.
    
            And as she fought for own conviction to be overturned, she also spoke out about the others’ plight.
    
            “I have rarely been as moved as I was by their stories and the cruelty they have endured,” then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said after meeting Vásquez and several other women in 2017. “It only seems to be women from poor and humble backgrounds who are jailed, a telling feature of the injustice suffered.”
    
            The UN official called for authorities to review the cases.
    
            But within El Salvador, a largely Catholic and evangelical Christian country, some viewed the women’s accounts with skepticism and hostility.
    
            As international pressure mounted, the then-head of El Salvador’s Institute of Legal Medicine told reporters that the women, who became widely known as “The 17,” were in prison because they were accused of infanticide, not obstetric emergencies or abortions — a point he reiterated in a recent interview with CNN.
    
            Dr. José Miguel Fortín Magaña, a psychiatrist who resigned from his post directing the institute in 2015, says he stands by the scientific analysis in autopsies his staff conducted. Critiques of the testing used, he says, fail to take into account that additional analysis was done.
    
            “These cases became emblematic because it got political. And when something becomes political the truth is no longer sought after,” he told CNN.
    
            A month after Vásquez met with the UN’s top human rights official in 2017, an appeals court in El Salvador upheld her conviction. Again, the UN’s human rights office weighed in, calling El Salvador’s laws “draconian.”
    
            Two months later, 11 justices from El Salvador’s Supreme Court commuted Vásquez’s sentence, saying evidence in the case did not prove that she had taken any action to end her baby’s life.
    
            She was released in February 2018 after more than 10 years behind bars. A crowd of cheering supporters awaited her outside the prison gates. Her parents and her then-teenage son stood among them, waiting to embrace her.
    
            But even after winning her hard-fought release, finding true freedom was harder than she expected.
    
            Vásquez only had a third-grade education when she entered prison. During her years behind bars, she devoted herself to education, earning her high school diploma. But she says she quickly realized the years of classes she’d taken in prison weren’t enough to help her find her footing once she was released.
    
            “I didn’t even know how to use a computer,” she says.
    
            Vásquez signed up for a computer course and enrolled in college soon afterward. But she says she still found it hard to reenter society.
    
            “I started to think, if I’m dealing with this, how are the women who were released before me?” Vásquez says. “What have they done to make it?”
    
            Vásquez started searching for them to find out. Months after her release from prison, she brought together 16 women and began interviewing them about their experiences. She was surprised to learn that many were struggling even years after their release.
    
            Some were shunned by their families. Many couldn’t find jobs because of their criminal records.
    
            “They started to tell me about very difficult situations, and some of these women had already been out of prison for eight years. And I said to myself, ‘Let’s do something. Let’s change this reality, not just for us, but for all the other women who are going to come out of prison,’” Vásquez recalls.
    
            And from there, she says, the idea of Mujeres Libres was born.
    
            As she walks the halls of the group’s headquarters in San Salvador and shows the space to CNN during a Zoom interview, Vásquez points proudly to rooms with bright blue bunk beds. For some who are originally from more rural parts of the country, the house is a temporary stopping point when they’re in town for appointments. For others, it’s a place to live so they can work in the city, where jobs are more plentiful.
    
            During the week, the house is quiet and calm, but on weekends Vásquez says it’s a hive of activity. Women travel hours from different parts of the country for counseling sessions and workshops on topics like playwriting and women’s rights.
    
            With each passing year, the number of potential members seems to grow.
    
            Since 2009, more than 60 women who were prosecuted after suffering obstetric emergencies have been released, according to the Citizen Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion in El Salvador.
    
            “I’ve been learning to open up,” says 35-year-old Jacqueline Castillo, who says she was wrongfully convicted of attempted homicide after her baby was born in a latrine during an obstetric emergency. “It’s helped me be able to let go of some things.”
    
            Castillo, who was released from prison last year after serving more than 10 years of her 15-year sentence, says she’s been taking computer classes at the Mujeres Libres house, and also gaining confidence to start making plans for her future. She’s a domestic worker now but hopes one day to start her own restaurant.
    
            “It’s very beautiful, because you can let go of things and concentrate, and then you now have something else in your mind, something positive,” she says. “You can learn something, and then you can share it with someone else.”
    
            Jocelyn Viterna points at an anatomy chart on her computer screen as Vásquez and other members of Mujeres Libres look on.
    
            The Harvard professor has been studying these women’s cases and the impact of El Salvador’s abortion restrictions for years. But on Wednesday evenings this fall, she’s serving in another role: their teacher.
    
            At the request of Vásquez and other members of Mujeres Libres, Viterna is leading a weekly Zoom course about gender, sexuality and reproductive health.
    
            Today’s lessons: the anatomy of the female sexual and reproductive system, followed by explanations of how this anatomy connects with sexual pleasure.
    
            “What do you think?” Viterna asks the class as she concludes her presentation. “Why do you think so many people see it as shameful to talk about this?”
    
            Vásquez is the first to raise her hand with an answer. “I think it has a lot to do with our culture, and what our parents teach us,” she says.
    
            Today Vásquez and the other women are students. But soon they hope to be teaching these kinds of lessons, too, as they travel around the country and speak with Salvadoran youth in a series of presentations scheduled to begin next month.
    
            The group plans to screen the documentary about their experiences, perform a play and lead discussion sessions.
    
            Vásquez says she’s already seen signs of a shift in El Salvador. Fewer women who have obstetric emergencies are being prosecuted, she says, after a 2021 Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling ordered the government to grant professional secrecy protections to doctors. That change means doctors are no longer required to report possible abortion attempts. Human rights groups had argued that medical personnel previously felt pressured to report patients fearing that they would be charged or sanctioned themselves.
    
            Advocates also hope another case pending before the court could clear the way for legalizing abortion in some instances in El Salvador and other Latin American countries that criminalize it.
    
            But even if El Salvador’s laws change tomorrow, Vásquez says there’s still more work to do.
    
            She sees a clear connection between the rarity of lessons like the ones Viterna is teaching them and the decisions that sent her and so many others to prison.
    
            “We have to start educating the population, because that is how people are sensitized and how they take action and we get rid of ignorance,” she says. “And that is how things will change.”
    
            Vásquez knows not everyone will welcome their message. Last year, she says, anti-abortion protesters tried to block screenings of the documentary about the group. The protest campaign spurred a flood of threats after her contact information was leaked online, she says.
    
            “They kept saying they were going to report me so that I would shut up,” Vásquez says.
    
            But Vásquez says she’s determined to keep speaking out.
    
            Why spend so much time talking about a painful part of her past? And why take the risks more public exposure could bring?
    
            “We aren’t doing this for ourselves,” Vásquez says. “What more can happen to us?  We already went to prison. We already paid for crimes that we didn’t commit. We are here, but sincerely we are doing this because we want at least the youth of future generations to have better lives.”
    
            As part of this year’s upcoming speaking tour, the group will be performing a play they’ve written dispelling myths around menstruation.
    
            Vásquez is excited to see how audiences respond. She’s already seen first-hand how transformative taking the stage can be.
    
            Last year they put on another play, “Mujeres de Acero,” Spanish for “Women of Steel.” Vásquez tears up whenever she watches a video of the performance, which ends with the women waving scarves to mimic butterflies’ wings fluttering as they circle the stage.
    
            She and the other women, she says, have found strength in each other and made a space for themselves.
    
            That, Vásquez says, is true freedom — the kind that no one can take away.

      2 suspects are facing murder charges after a stray bullet hit a pregnant woman on a Massachusetts bus and her baby died

    ","
            Two men are set to be charged with murder after a stray bullet from a gunfight in western Massachusetts struck a pregnant woman and killed her baby, the Hampden district attorney’s office said Thursday.
    
            The shooting stemmed from an altercation that broke out between three people in Holyoke, a city 8 miles north of Springfield, the DA’s office said in a statement on Facebook.
    
            Authorities believe a stray bullet from that street fight struck the bus and the pregnant woman Wednesday afternoon. Hours before the shooting unfolded, Holyoke police and city officials held a news conference to discuss the frequency of gunfire in the community. 
    
            Police responded to the scene around 12:40 p.m., and the woman was taken to a hospital in critical condition and underwent an emergency procedure to deliver the baby, according to the DA’s office statement. 
    
            “The infant, who was delivered and needed life-saving medical services, tragically passed away,” the DA said in the statement.
    
            CNN has requested an update on the condition of the woman.
    
            Alejandro Ramos, 22, is expected to be arraigned on a murder charge in connection with the shooting in Holyoke District Court on Thursday. The other suspect, Johnluis Sanchez, 30, is still in the hospital and will be formally arraigned on a murder charge when his condition allows, the DA’s office said. 
    
            Other charges are expected to follow for both suspects, according to the DA’s office.
    
            All involved suspects are believed to have been identified, authorities said. Currently, only Ramos and Sanchez are facing charges. 
    
            CNN is attempting to reach legal representation for both men. 
    
            Holyoke Mayor Joshua A. Garcia offered condolences to the victim’s family in a statement.
    
            “I want the public to know that I am equally outraged and frustrated with these senseless acts of violence and illegal activity on our streets. I struggle with it every day attempting to offer a balanced solution,” Garcia wrote. “Quite frankly, I have lost my patience. I plan to work with all resources available to me to push this nonsense out of our city.”
    
            Earlier Wednesday, Holyoke police provided updates in a news conference to their community on a ShotSpotter system installed in March to help detect gunshots fired. 
    
            That system also sent notifications to the police department about Wednesday’s shooting, which was also reported through 911, police said in a news release.
    
            The shooting comes as gun violence has become ubiquitous in the US, with guns becoming the leading cause of children’s deaths since 2020.  
    
            Before Wednesday’s shooting, Garcia said during the news conference that officials are trying their best to help reduce gun violence. The ShotSpotter system is one tool the city is using to assist with gunfire in the city, he said.  
    
            “It pains me to be in a position where I have to invest in things like this to help reduce issues around gun violence to keep the public safe,” Garcia said, referring to the newly-installed system. 
    
            The Massachusetts State Police Detective Unit assigned to the Hampden District Attorney’s Office and the Holyoke Police Department are investigating the shooting.

      More than 1,300 children and teens have been killed by guns so far this year. Here’s why we’re telling you some of their stories

    ","
            The celebratory bullets began flying right around midnight, in the final moments of 2022. 
    
            The child’s father heard two dings – Happy New Year bullets ricocheting in front of their apartment. 
    
            “Ouch,” he heard his 11-year-old say. 
    
            Then, she was gone. 
    
            “Right at midnight, Amethyst was probably the first child to go in 2023,” he said of his “Stranger Things”-obsessed, animal-loving Texas tween who hadn’t yet aged out of clasping her mother’s hand. 
    
            “Ame,” as everybody called Amethyst Sistine Silva, was one of at least nine children and teens to die by gunfire on the first day of 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive – and one of more than 1,300 children and teens killed by a gun so far this year. 
    
            Firearms are now the No. 1 killer of children and teens in America, having surpassed motor vehicles accidents, which had been the leading cause of death among America’s youth until 2020. 
    
            Just as cars and roads were becoming safer, guns were killing more and more kids in America: Federal data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the number of gun deaths among US children and teenagers rose 50 percent between 2019 and 2021. But this terrible trendline cannot be articulated through datasets alone. 
    
            There are devastating stories behind every one of the numbers – of stolen futures and shattered families, of loving memories and incalculable loss. 
    
            Consider King, the Georgia 9-year-old who slept with Lilo & Stitch bedcovers and a Space Jam blanket until he was killed by another child who was handling an unsecured gun. 
    
            Or Frankie, the 10-year-old from California who was playing with his cousins when he was killed in a drive-by – a bullet bouncing off the front door, then a ping-pong table before becoming lodged in his stomach. 
    
            Or Izaiah, the Maryland 16-year-old empath with a musician’s ear who was gunned down near his high school. 
    
            CNN is publishing a series of profiles of these and other gun victims – a daily reminder of some of the many young lives lost this year, and every year, in America. 
    
            These stories are not about the circumstances of the individual deaths. Some of the shootings were accidental; some were intentional. All are horribly sad. 
    
            The project aims to highlight the scope and scale of the issue by sharing their stories, by focusing on the people, not policy debates. 
    
            “I want people to know that Izaiah was your kid – your daughter, your son,” the teen’s mother said. “Izaiah was your child.”

      Opinion: The 19th century sexual purity law that some want to revive
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler
		","
  Published
        2:30 PM EDT, Tue October 3, 2023
    ","
            Matthew Kacsmaryk, an ultra-conservative US District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas, has captured national attention with a string of sweeping rulings on everything from contraception to the freedom of speech. The most recent ruling, now just a few weeks old, breaks from other federal decisions and upholds a ban on drag performances.
    
            There has been a surprising and consistent theme in several of Kacsymaryk’s rulings: the Comstock Act, a 19th-century sexual purity law that has lain dormant for more than a century. Last spring, when Kacsmaryk ruled that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) never had the authority to approve mifepristone, a pill used in the standard protocol for medication abortion, which now accounts for more than half of abortions performed in the United States, he argued that the Comstock Act made it a federal crime to mail abortion pills.
    
            More recently, in upholding a Texas university’s decisions to prohibit drag performances on campus, Kacsmaryk framed the Comstock Act as a central example of the nation’s history and tradition when it came to freedom of speech.
    
            Other conservatives have adopted Kacsmaryk’s Comstock argument. Conservative attorneys general invoked the Comstock Act to threaten pharmacies with criminal charges if they become certified to dispense mifepristone. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a major conservative Christian litigator, frames the Comstock Act as an abortion ban. So does Students for Life, another major anti-abortion player. Until recently, it was easy to dismiss the revival of Comstock as a political expedient: a backdoor attempt to ban abortion and nothing more. Read in context, Kacsmaryk’s latest ruling reveals a more explosive possibility: If approved by more judges and by higher courts, the Comstock Act could become a linchpin in extreme conservatives’ efforts to censor speech about sex.
    
            The Comstock Act, originally passed in 1873, had hardly been enforced in a century when Kacsmaryk’s April 2023 ruling called attention to it. Anti-abortion lawyers, led by Jonathan Mitchell, the former Texas attorney general who helped to create Texas’s abortion bounty bill, SB8, saw untapped potential in the archaic law. These abortion opponents pointed to language in the Comstock Act that made it a federal crime to knowingly mail or receive anything “designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.”
    
            This language, argued anti-abortion attorneys, created a de facto national ban on all abortions because any procedure, including surgical abortion, relied on devices or equipment sent in the mail. That the Comstock Act was about much more than abortion seemed to be an inconvenience for conservatives. Even Mitchell described the statute as “overbroad.”
    
            But Kacsmaryk’s latest ruling, read in the context of other GOP proposals, shows that some conservatives may have had much bigger plans for the Comstock Act all along. The new case involved one of several recent attempts to censor drag performances. An LGBTQ+ group at West Texas A&M University planned what it called “A Fool’s Drag Race” to raise money for LGBTQ+ suicide prevention. The university president shut down the event, and the students sued.
    
            In September, Kacsmaryk ruled that the university had the authority to stop the fundraiser. Technically, the question in the case was whether the president had qualified immunity. When government officials violate an individual’s civil or constitutional rights, federal law allows for lawsuits against them only if the right at issue is “clearly established.” The students at West Texas A&M argued that the First Amendment clearly protected their expressive conduct. In recent decisions, federal judges in Tennessee and Texas considering other drag bans certainly agreed that the First Amendment protected drag performances.
    
            But Kacsmaryk developed a very different vision of the First Amendment. He argued that “history and tradition” should determine which kind of speech was protected. And as a matter of history and tradition, he suggested, the government could and did criminalize “sexualized speech.” For evidence of what “tradition” involved, Kacsmaryk looked to the Comstock Act.
    
            Given that the law had been on the books for more than 100 years, and given that it made it a federal crime to mail “obscene, lewd, or lascivious” materials, it seemed clear to Kacsmaryk that “lewd” speech had never enjoyed much First Amendment protection.
    
            Besides, he argued, drag shows were conduct, not speech, and often had no expressive content besides lewdness. Even if the drag show did have some constitutional protection, Kacsmaryk suggested that the university president had a right to worry that children might be present. He stressed that banning drag served the “physical and psychological wellbeing of minors.”
    
            It’s possible to dismiss Kacsmaryk’s ruling as an outlier, likely to be ignored or overturned by appellate courts. It’s true that Kacsmaryk is one of the nation’s most conservative judges. But read in contemporary political context, his take on the First Amendment doesn’t look so unusual.
    
            Eleven states have introduced laws banning the discussion of sexual orientation, gender identity or even sex in some public school settings (some, like Florida’s, apply through the end of high school). Several states have restricted drag performances. Conservative organizations have mobilized to demand the removal of what they deem sexualized books from libraries.
    
            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has directed the state’s education agency to “investigate any criminal activity in our public schools involving the availability of pornography.” The possibility of criminal charges against librarians, educators and drag performers has already affected what many some are willing to say, and which books are available in many of the nation’s communities.
    
            That’s why the revival of the Comstock Act is about much more than abortion: It bolsters the fight against speech about sex in more ways than one. Conservatives looking to rewrite First Amendment jurisprudence may look to the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the right to choose abortion.
    
            There, the court suggested that the Constitution protected rights not spelled out in the document’s text only when they were deeply rooted in history and tradition. Kacsmaryk wants to import this test into First Amendment jurisprudence. And he sees the Comstock Act as a key piece of evidence that speech about sex has not historically been protected.
    
            Reviving the Comstock Act has a practical dimension too. Until the late 1930s, anti-vice activists and postal inspectors used the statute to persecute a broad category of Americans writing and speaking about sex. That included publishers mailing editions of famous works of literature, from Geoffrey Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales” to Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass.” It also included anatomy texts, sex education materials and information about birth control. Even private love letters — or notes arranging dates — were sometimes seen as lewd.
    
            If conservatives revive the Comstock Act to stop abortion, there is no reason they couldn’t bring the rest of the law to bear too, giving local efforts to criminalize speech about sex a major boost.
    
            The Comstock Act is one of the sleeper issues of the 2024 election. GOP hopefuls have fielded questions about new policies they would favor: fresh bans on drag or school sex education, or prohibitions on abortion or six, or 12 or 15 weeks.
    
            All of these questions seem a little silly because a divided Congress seems unlikely to make any of these policies the law of the land. But congressional polarization and paralysis surely won’t matter to the conservatives looking to resurrect Comstock because it’s already on the books.
    
            Transforming Comstock into a federal ban on abortion — or on most speech about sex — requires a Republican presidential administration ready to enforce the law and federal courts willing to accept conservatives’ interpretation of the statute.
    
            With former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden roughly tied in most polls, it’s not hard to imagine that a Republican could be in the White House soon. And with a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, it isn’t hard to envision the courts buying a sweeping interpretation of Comstock.
    
            If they do, Kacsmaryk’s ruling tells us just how much will be on the line. Abortion access is on the chopping block when it comes to Comstock, but the freedom to talk about sex is under threat too.

      After death of infant, FDA warns hospitals about probiotics for premature babies

    ","
            After the death of a preterm baby who was given a probiotic in a hospital, the US Food and Drug Administration is warning hospitals about using probiotics in infants born prematurely.
    
            In a warning letter Friday, the federal agency cautioned health care providers that bacteria and fungi found in probiotics might put preterm infants at risk of “invasive, potentially fatal” infections. The letter references the case of an infant who received the probiotic Evivo with MCT Oil. The product, which is manufactured by Infinant Health for use in hospital settings, contains the infantis subspecies of the live bacterium Bifidobacterium longum.
    
            The baby died after developing sepsis caused by the same species of bacteria, the letter said.
    
            “Genomic sequencing data demonstrate the bacterium that caused sepsis in this infant was a genetic match to the bacteria contained in this probiotic,” the FDA’s letter said.
    
            Probiotics, which contain live bacteria or other microorganisms for health benefits, are commonly used in the United States as dietary supplements. Since they’re considered dietary supplements, they are not subject to the FDA approval process.
    
            According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 10% of preterm infants receive probiotics while in neonatal ICUs, a number that’s steadily increasing across the country.
    
            The group’s most recent guidelines also don’t recommend the supplements for preterm infants.
    
            “Given the lack of FDA-regulated pharmaceutical-grade products in the United States, conflicting data on safety and efficacy, and potential for harm in a highly vulnerable population, current evidence does not support the routine, universal administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight of <1000 g,” according to a 2021 clinical report from the pediatrician group.
    
            The FDA’s letter points out that the agency has not approved any probiotic product for use in infants. In September, it released a public warning to Infinant Health in which it described Evivo with MCT Oil as “an unapproved new drug and unlicensed biological product.”
    
            The company’s marketing of the probiotic as a drug treatment violated several components of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act, the warning says.
    
            In a statement, Infinant Health said it has agreed to recall Evivo with MCT Oil and notified health care providers and hospitals.
    
            “We are cooperating with FDA’s ongoing investigation” into the infant’s death, the company says.
    
            Its Evivo powder, which is available to consumers, is not subject to an investigation or recall, Infinant noted.
    
            Recent research suggests that probiotics might be a useful treatment option for preterm infants.
    
            A review of 106 trials including nearly 26,000 infants, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that probiotics with multiple strains of bacteria helped reduce overall infant death, feeding intolerance and a life-threatening inflammation of the intestines in infants called necrotizing enterocolitis.
    
            Unlike those products, however, Evivo with MCT Oil contains only a single strain of bacteria.

      Gun homicides and suicides in US children and teens are at a record high

            Children and teens in the US are dying of gun-related homicides and suicides in record numbers, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            There were 2,279 firearm homicides in children and teens (ages 1 to 18) in 2021 – double the number of deaths recorded a decade prior, according to the CDC’s WONDER database. Suicides by gun were also up 11% from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
    
            Not all children, however, are at the same level of risk. Black children and teens are more likely to be killed in firearm-related incidents than children of other races. Seventeen in 100,000 Black children died by gun in 2021, compared to approximately 3 in 100,000 White children or 1 in 100,000 Asian children, according to CDC data.
    
            Firearms have been the leading cause of death in children and teens since 2020, according to CDC data. Surpassing car accidents and cancer, gun-related deaths accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths in 2021.
    
            Although school shootings account for a small share of child and teen gun deaths, they have been on a steady incline since at least 2017, according to a CNN data analysis — except for in 2020, when Covid-19 struck and schools pivoted to online learning. This year, there have been at least 54 shootings — 37 at K-12 schools and 17 on college and universities campuses — as of September 28.
    
            Overall mass shootings are also up this year, consistently outpacing previous years. More than 500 shootings have taken place so far in 2023, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.
    
            More than 1,300 children and teens have been killed by a gun so far this year. These are some of their stories.

      Supreme Court declines to take up appeal from anti-abortion group that secretly recorded clinics

            The Supreme Court declined on Monday to take up an appeal from an anti-abortion group known for releasing secretly recorded footage of abortion providers, leaving in place a lower court ruling that went in favor of Planned Parenthood.    
    
            The anti-abortion group had argued that its actions were protected by the First Amendment and sought to reverse millions of dollars in damages awarded to the abortion providers.  
    
            The case involved David Daleiden, a longtime anti-abortion activist who partnered with other like-minded activists, Troy Newman and Albin Rhomberg, to start a group called the Center for Medical Progress, meant to infiltrate organizations like Planned Parenthood.  
    
            According to court papers, they created a tissue procurement company they called BioMax. Such companies obtain human tissue samples, including fetal tissue, and provide them to medical researchers.  
    
            Although the company had a website and promotional materials, it was not involved in any business activity. Daleiden, using a false name, posed as the company’s procurement manager and vice president of operations.   
    
            According to court papers, employees used fake driver’s licenses and other means to infiltrate conferences that Planned Parenthood hosted or attended, and they arranged and attended lunch meetings and with Planned Parenthood staff, visiting health clinics. During these meetings, they recorded Planned Parenthood staff without their consent over a year and a half and then released on the internet edited videos of the conversations.   
    
            Planned Parenthood brought suit in January 2016 asking for monetary damages and other relief.  
    
            A district court ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood and awarded the group statutory, compensatory and punitive damages.  
    
            A panel of judges on the 9th circuit agreed that the damages were allowed under the First Amendment but rejected the claim under the Federal Wiretap Act.  
    
            “The First Amendment right to gather news within legal bounds does not exempt journalists from thaws of general applicability,” the court held.   
    
            “The First Amendment is not a license to trespass, to steal or to intrude by electronic means into the precincts of another’s home or office,” the court said in its opinion.

      They were ringing in the new year at their apartment when the gunfire started. Then this 11-year-old fell to the ground

            Most tweens might brush off holding their parents’ hands as baby stuff. Not Amethyst Sistine Silva.
    
            The affectionate, hug-loving girl from Corpus Christi, Texas, known to everyone in her life as “Ame,” hadn’t yet aged out of clasping her mother’s palms between her 11-year-old fingers.
    
            “We would walk throughout the mall and she’d hold my hand as if she were 2, 3 years old,” Amethyst’s mother, Melinda Cruz, told CNN. “She’d say, ‘No, don’t let go of my hand.’”
    
            On January 1, 2023, everything changed.
    
            The family chose to ring in the new year near their home to be safe. “We were out there just to make memories,” Robert Silva, Amethyst’s father, told CNN.
    
            What instead unfolded is a nightmare Silva says often replays in his mind.
    
            “I wasn’t prepared for this,” he said.
    
            That night, Amethyst, a sibling to six older brothers and sisters, was standing outside her family’s apartment near the street when she was shot by what police said was celebratory gunfire.
    
            “I heard the building get hit with bullets, and the last one hit Amethyst and she just said, ‘ouch,’ then she fell to the ground,” Silva recounted.
    
            “Right at midnight, Amethyst was probably the first child to go in 2023,” he said.
    
            Amethyst’s parents were told she died some time after they got her to a hospital, they said.
    
            Two men were arrested on charges of deadly conduct for discharging a firearm in connection with her death, according to the Corpus Christi Police Department.
    
            Amethyst is one of more than 1,300 children and teens killed by a gun so far in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Firearms became the No. 1 killer of children and teens in America in 2020, surpassing motor vehicles, which had long been the leading cause of death among America’s youth.
    
            In the months following her death, the family has advocated for justice for Amethyst. They’re consulting with attorneys to investigate what may have led to their difficulties reaching 911 dispatchers that night – a hindrance they say could have affected their daughter’s survival, according to the family’s lawyer, Mauricio R. Celis.
    
            The family attempted to call 911 a few times after Amethyst was shot but failed to get through, Celis said.
    
            “Even though there were perpetrators out there committing this crime, we strongly believe that if the 911 service would have been working properly, she might have been saved,” Celis said.
    
            The Corpus Christi Police Department released a January 5 statement responding to what authorities referred to as a reported “inaccurate timeline” of what occurred that night.
    
            The department’s 911 system received a call from Amethyst’s mother four seconds before midnight, according to the statement. The answering operator reported hearing silence, “and the caller disconnected,” the statement read.
    
            Police say a dispatcher’s callback at midnight reached voicemail and “was considered an incomplete 911 call.” A minute later, a third party called 911 stating a child had been shot and officers were on the scene. The caller then hung up, according to the police statement.
    
            “We want to clarify that our officers were on the scene within less than two minutes of the shooting,” the statement read. “Unfortunately, the parents had left the scene before officers could make contact.”
    
            The family’s legal team is working with experts to pinpoint the cause and responsible party of what they believe was a failure of the 911 communication system, Celis said.
    
            Chowing down on Joe’s Crab Shack seafood. Sticking her feet out the car window along Ocean Drive. Jamming to the music at the Bush and Seether concert. Her “Stranger Things”-themed birthday party last October.
    
            The moments of Amethyst’s short life have become cherished memories for her grieving family. 
    
            In her mom’s embrace, Amethyst smiled brightly in the last photo taken of her on New Year’s Eve.
    
            Her grin offered a glimpse of the light the girl with “a heart of gold” brought to the lives of those who knew her. Amethyst’s biggest talent was caring for others – strangers and loved ones alike, her family said.
    
            “She would see someone panhandling for money and say, ‘stop, let’s give them $1 or something to drink, Dad,’” Silva said.
    
            “If she saw anybody who was sad, she would go and give them a hug, like, ‘it’s gonna be OK,’” Cruz said. “She would draw them a picture, or just go sit by them and hold their hand.”
    
            Amethyst loved animals. She’d befriended a squirrel she began regularly feeding not long before she died, her dad said.
    
            The 11-year-old had two hamsters and a cat. She was such a feline fan, when she’d asked her father how he thought she’d someday be reincarnated, he responded, “You’re going to come back as a cat, Mama, you already know that.”
    
            Amethyst’s cat Noah often hangs out by a memorial near where she was shot, Silva shared.
    
            His daughter enjoyed drawing pictures of people, flowers and butterflies.
    
            When Cruz spots a butterfly these days – especially a purple one – she says her youngest child springs to mind.
    
            Black and purple were Amethyst’s favorite colors, her mother said.
    
            She adored “Stranger Things” and the character Eleven. Her casket, like her final birthday celebration, was themed after the popular show.
    
            Though she typically wore nothing extra beyond a bracelet and a necklace, Amethyst would break out the big, bulky boots, black skirts and charm belts to rock out at concerts.
    
            “One of her favorite stores here in Corpus was Hot Topic,” Cruz said.
    
            She’d play around with goth-inspired makeup, a hobby that might’ve blossomed into a career in special effects, her parents said.
    
            Amethyst’s dad influenced her love of rock ‘n’ roll, and bands like Metallica and Three Days Grace, he said. She wore a black T-shirt bearing a photo of guitarist John 5 the night she died.
    
            Her parents described their child as full of life with a forgiving heart who often said, “I love you,” and was rarely in a bad mood.
    
            “She had her own character, she was always out to make someone laugh, or she was showing you cat videos,” Silva said. “She didn’t want anybody upset.”
    
            Amethyst was eager to start junior high school in the fall.
    
            Students and staff at her elementary school created a memorial with plants and painted rocks in her honor, her parents said.
    
            Silva’s alarm is still set to wake his daughter each morning. He never got a chance to get her ready for the rest of fifth grade.
    
            “She didn’t even get to make it back from Christmas vacation and say goodbye to her friends before summer vacation,” he said.
    
            Silva described his youngest child as “a daddy’s girl” and his “partner in crime.” Her absence has left an irreparable hole in his heart, he said.
    
            Just as his daughter once clung to the palms of her parents, Silva firmly holds dear the memories of his beloved Ame.
    
            “That daddy-and-daughter bond is something that no one can ever take away from you,” he said.

      Federal judge blocks two provisions of North Carolina near-total ban on abortions after 12 weeks, ruling in favor of advocacy groups
    ","
			By Mitchell McCluskey and Emma Tucker, CNN

  Published
        7:43 PM EDT, Sat September 30, 2023
    ","
            A federal judge on Saturday blocked two provisions of a near-total ban on abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy from taking effect in North Carolina, saying that one of the provisions is unconstitutionally vague, while the other lacks medical evidence. 
    
            Senate Bill 20, dubbed the “Care for Women, Children and Families Act,” bans any licensed physician from performing abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It provides exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks.
    
            The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood and physician Beverly Gray jointly filed a lawsuit on June 26 challenging the bill before it took effect on July 1, arguing its restrictions on abortion access will “harm patients and impede health care professionals from providing care.” 
    
            In an order issued on Saturday, US District Judge Catherine Eagles halted the enforcement of a provision requiring surgical abortions administered after 12 weeks to exclusively take place in hospitals rather than abortion clinics. She said the plaintiffs showed the state legislature’s “absence of any rational medical basis” for the mandate, which was set to take effect on Sunday.
    
            “There is credible evidence, including at least one study, that second-trimester surgical abortions in outpatient facilities are safer than hospitals,” Eagles’ order states. 
    
            The judge also blocked a provision that would require doctors to document the location of early pregnancies with ultrasound evidence before prescribing a medication abortion. In the injunction, her order says provision “does not provide a clear standard by which providers can make this determination” and is open to “differing interpretations.” Judge Eagles issued a two-week restraining order on that provision in July to allow for further review. 
    
            Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the ban on most abortions after 12 weeks before it was overridden by the GOP supermajority in May.
    
            The governor signed into law significant changes to the ban on July 29, saying the amendment was “important to clarify the rules and provide some certainty.” The state’s Republican-controlled legislature also made additional last-minute changes to the new abortion law by tacking them onto House Bill 190 – an unrelated measure focusing on the Department of Health and Human Services. 
    
            CNN previously reported that legal filings from attorneys representing Republican leadership appeared to confirm the amendment was written to address a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, which flagged multiple inconsistencies and potential constitutional violations in the original text of the abortion law.
    
            Under the bill, an abortion could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines the procedure is necessary to avert a patient’s death – “not including psychological or emotional conditions.” It prohibits health care providers who object to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.
    
            The plaintiffs challenging the law praised the judge’s order on Saturday, saying the court’s decision “recognizes that abortion is health care and that there is no medical reason to deny even more patients access to this safe, compassionate, evidence-based care,” reads a statement from Jenny Black, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
    
            North Carolina ACLU Legal Director Kristi Graunke said the order is “one step forward in fighting back against these harmful bans.” 
    
            North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein is listed as a defendant in the lawsuit but released a statement supporting the judge’s order, saying “women, not politicians, should be making these decisions.”
    
            “The law is not based in medical reality, and it was sloppily written,” his statement continued.
    
            Erik Baptist, the lawyer for the defendants and senior counsel of Alliance Defending Freedom – a non-profit legal group advocating for abortion restrictions, said the bill amounted to “commonsense protections.” 
    
            “We will consider all legal options to further support North Carolina’s unborn children and mothers, and the right of the General Assembly to protect its vulnerable citizens,” Baptist said.

      DeSantis supports 15-week federal abortion ban for first time in second GOP debate
    ","

    ","
            Sen. Tim Scott on Wednesday successfully pinned down Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the first time on whether he would support a 15-week federal abortion ban.
    
            “Yes, I will,” DeSantis replied to Scott in a moment lost in the crosstalk that engulfed the messy Republican primary debate. 
    
            It’s a commitment DeSantis has avoided making since entering the presidential race – which has at times drawn him sharp criticism from a top anti-abortion group. DeSantis instead has campaigned on the six-week abortion ban he signed in Florida earlier this year while suggesting other states may have different approaches based on their political environments. 
    
            But with his window closing to gain ground in the GOP presidential nominating contest, DeSantis has made abortion a focal point of his efforts to drive a wedge between former President Donald Trump and the conservative base, particularly in Iowa. 
    
            The exchange with Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, came shortly after DeSantis said Trump should be on the debate stage defending his comments that some Republican states have pursued “terrible” restrictions on the procedure. Scott jumped in to press DeSantis, saying, “But would you support (inaudible) a 15-week limit?”
    
            Off camera, DeSantis affirmed he would, as one of the moderators asked former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a new question. The little-noticed exchange was first reported by the Daily Signal, a conservative outlet. 
    
            DeSantis signaled a willingness to back a federal ban in a recent interview on Radio Iowa, telling the host: “I’ve said this from the beginning of this, as president, you put pro-life legislation on my desk, I’m going to look favorably and support the legislation.” 
    
            But Wednesday’s response to Scott marked the first time DeSantis weighed in so directly on a 15-week ban.
    
            As DeSantis doubles-down on anti-abortion policies, Trump has instead said he is willing to compromise with Democrats on abortion to find “peace on that issue.” Trump has privately blamed the GOP’s recent electoral defeats on the party’s anti-abortion push following the fall of Roe v. Wade. He recently called Florida’s ban “a terrible thing and a terrible mistake,” a remark that DeSantis has seized on as he seeks to win over evangelical and anti-abortion voters in Iowa. 
    
            On the debate stage, DeSantis said: “I reject this idea that pro-lifers are to blame for midterm defeats.”
    
            Although he has accused Trump of prioritizing politics over the unborn, DeSantis over the years has also carefully navigated the topic, indicating his own political expediency around a sensitive issue. 
    
            For much of his first term as governor, for example, DeSantis declined to push for a crackdown on abortion despite an overwhelming GOP majority in both chambers of his state legislature, leaving in place an existing law that made Florida one of the most permissive states for the procedure in the southeast. 
    
            In 2022, DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban that did not include exceptions for rape and incest. But two months later, as the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, DeSantis was uncharacteristically reserved in his response and declined for months to say whether he would push for more restrictions on abortion as he ran for a second term as Florida governor.
    
            Just before launching a campaign for president, DeSantis – in the middle of the night and behind closed doors – signed a law to ban abortion in Florida after six weeks with limited exceptions for rape and incest. After jumping into the race, he repeatedly declined to back signing similar legislation at the federal level, saying it was up to states to lead.
    
            His persistent dodging earned a blistering rebuke over the summer from Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.
    
            “A pro-life president has a duty to protect the lives of all Americans,” she said. “He should be the National Defender of Life.”
    
            DeSantis defended himself from the criticism, telling CNN in New Hampshire: “Different groups, you know, are gonna have different agendas, but I can tell you this: Nobody running has actually delivered pro-life protections. I have done that. I’ve stood up. I’ve said that I would stand for life, and we have done that, and we have delivered, and we’re proud of that.” 
    
            In an interview that aired Friday, DeSantis distanced himself slightly from the six-week abortion restriction he signed into law, calling it “a legislative issue.”
    
            “It’s a legislative issue. So they have to figure out what they think, and so the legislature identified the moment where there’s a detectable heartbeat as the time where there’s legal protections,” DeSantis said on “Real Time with Bill Maher.” “Now they did provide exceptions for all the difficult cases that you hear about, but basically once there’s a heartbeat, it shouldn’t be used as a form of birth control.”
    
            Scott has made it a priority to push candidates to back a 15-week abortion ban, telling Fox News last week, “We have to learn to stand up for our rights and make sure every single child in every single state has the same rights.” 
    
            “All the presidential candidates, whether it is Ron, Nikki (Haley), the former president, they should support me with a 15-week limit,” Scott said.
    
            “Ron had months to advocate for a federal limit, yet discouraged efforts to protect life. If you’re going to back down on an issue, this is the one to do it on. Glad Ron is now on board,” Scott communications director Nathan Brand said in a statement Thursday. 
    
            This story has been updated with additional developments.

      Yelp sues Texas to defend its labeling of crisis pregnancy centers

    ","
            Yelp is suing Texas to ensure it can continue to tell users that crisis pregnancy centers listed on its site do not provide abortions or abortion referrals, opening a new front in the fight between states and the tech industry over abortion restrictions.
    
            In a complaint filed Wednesday in San Francisco federal court, Yelp said it is suing Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton preemptively, to head off a lawsuit it anticipates from his office as soon as Friday that may seek to bar Yelp from applying its labels to crisis pregnancy centers.
    
            Yelp said it currently applies the following label to crisis pregnancy center listings: “This is a Crisis Pregnancy Center. Crisis Pregnancy Centers do not offer abortions or referrals to abortion providers.”
    
            Yelp’s complaint said its labels are based on a manual evaluation of “thousands of business pages” on its site and reflect truthful statements. But Paxton’s impending lawsuit threatens to silence Yelp and infringe on the company’s First Amendment rights, the complaint alleges. 
    
            The preemptive lawsuit from one of the internet’s largest user review platforms highlights how the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade has had ripple effects for tech companies.
    
            Democratic lawmakers have previously faulted Google, for example, for not doing enough to remove crisis pregnancy centers from search results for abortion clinics, amid concerns that internet users seeking abortion services may be misled to facilities that do not offer medical care.
    
            The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, has stepped up its scrutiny of data brokers and fertility apps over concerns that leakage of users’ personal data could result in law enforcement obtaining that information for abortion prosecutions.
    
            According to Wednesday’s complaint, Paxton formally notified Yelp of his intent to sue as recently as last week and that the state would be seeking fines for alleged violations of Texas’ Deceptive Trade Practices Act. 
    
            Yelp argues that its labels for crisis pregnancy centers are not deceptive and that Paxton himself had publicly commended the disclosures as “accurate” in a February press release. 
    
            Paxton’s earlier praise for the label came after he alleged that an earlier version of Yelp’s label had been misleading, according to the complaint. Yelp said the initial label had described crisis pregnancy centers as “typically provid[ing] limited medical services and may not have licensed medical professionals onsite.”
    
            In the complaint, Yelp said it agreed to clarify its labels at the time despite believing (then as well as now) that the original label had been “truthful and not misleading.”
    
            Yelp’s lawsuit asks the court to affirm that its labeling of crisis pregnancy centers was not misleading and that it was an exercise of constitutionally protected speech. It also asks the court to block Texas from suing over the labels in the future.

      Opinion: The problem with all this talk about two-parent ‘privilege’
    ","
			Opinion by Jill Filipovic

  Published
        7:21 AM EDT, Wed September 27, 2023
    ","
            A new book by economist Melissa Kearney makes a readily apparent but still-provocative argument: Children raised by two married parents do better than children raised by single parents. The difference, Kearney argues, isn’t just financial (although the money matters a lot); the “two-parent privilege,” as her book calls it, is also about parental time investment and familial stability. The problem with the point she makes — and with the firestorm of discussion it’s touched off on the left and the right — is that there are many things that are statistically better for us, but if those things are not available or accessible, knowing that they’re better is, at best, a moot point.
    
            Kearney bills herself as a moderate, but her argument is being taken up by a great many conservatives who argue that her findings, which are robustly supported by the data, demonstrate that liberal mores around family formation have destroyed the nuclear family and left children worse off. The answer, they say, is for liberals to own up to their wrongdoing and for all of us to start promoting marriage.
    
            A closer look at the facts on the ground, though, shows that the problem isn’t a cultural rejection of marriage, or a nationwide feminist rejection of the nuclear family (I wish). Most people want to get married. The problem is that decades of largely conservative policy-making have fueled inequality, gutted the working class, left a generation of men isolated and under-employed and unmoored, impoverished families and made it harder for women to both control their own fertility and find suitable partners.
    
            Our cultural respect for marriage hasn’t receded. What’s changed is that Americans feel like we should be adults before we get married: that we should be financially stable, that we should marry someone we love and who is also a force for stability and support. And for too many people — heterosexual women especially — that very basic standard isn’t being met by the men around them. And the GOP is at least partly to blame.
    
            The decline of marriage in the United States crosses class lines, but is far more pronounced among Americans without college degrees. College-educated Americans, though on average more politically progressive, continue to form their families in traditional ways: first marriage, then babies. They get married later than their working-class peers, and they have children later, and they are more likely to stay married. Among poor American adults age 18 to 55, just 26% are married, compared to more than half of middle- and upper-class adults, according to a 2017 research brief.
    
            Having a child outside of marriage has taken a similar course: more common across classes than it was a few decades ago, but much more common among poorer Americans and those with the lowest levels of education. One Johns Hopkins sociologist found that, between 2017 and 2018, 24.5% of college-educated women were unmarried when they birthed their first child, a radical increase from 1996, when just 4% were unmarried.
    
            But among Americans with less education, the results are even more startling: Between 2017 and 2018, 86.5% of women without a high school degree gave birth while unmarried, as did more than 60% of those with a high school diploma. The numbers also reflect stark inequities among racial lines: Close to three-quarters of Black mothers have a child outside of marriage, compared with 66% of American Indian and Native Alaskans, 53% of Hispanics, 29% of Whites and 17% of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
    
            Extramarital births are also generally more common in the conservative states that also ban abortion, pay a low minimum wage and have high rates of child poverty, uninsured children and maternal and infant mortality. The women who are living the feminist dream, on the other hand — who graduate from college, who wait to find love before getting married, who delay childbearing and focus on their careers and who largely vote for Democrats — have lower rates of single parenthood and higher rates of marriage (they also have fewer children and have them later, but their children wind up better off).
    
            In other words, this doesn’t seem to be about liberal or feminist ideals, but conservative policies.
    
            At the heart of the marriage gap between socioeconomic classes: men. In the highly-educated communities where men are more likely to be gainfully employed and living independently (and where they are more progressive than their working-class counterparts) and less likely to be incarcerated, formerly incarcerated, or hobbled by substance abuse and mental health disorders, adults are more likely to get married, and to have children after marriage. In lower-income and working-class communities, men have been decimated by deaths of despair, under-employment and mass incarceration. Mass incarceration disproportionately affects Black men far more than White men, but research shows that across racial lines, incarceration sets people up for far lower earnings and dimmer employment prospects, keeping them poor or making them even poorer.
    
            Women, on the other hand, have been doing better: Women are now more likely to be employed than ever; they are making more money, and are more financially independent. Occupational segregation and stark gender pay gaps persist, but far fewer women than ever need to attach themselves to a man in order to make rent and feed their families. In struggling communities, there are simply not enough marriageable men to go around — not enough men who are gainfully employed, living independently and willing to pull their own weight around the home.
    
            A lot of women understand they may never get married but may not want to give up the prospect of being a mother. And many may want to delay childbearing until marriage, but find themselves off course when they become accidentally pregnant — and then, when they do what anti-abortion Republicans want and have their babies, find themselves unsupported and stigmatized by those same conservatives.
    
            There is no easy solution to the surge in births outside of marriage, nor to the fact that children of single parents are on average worse off than children in two-parent households. But there are certainly many policy solutions that could shrink this gap.
    
            An expanded child tax credit, for example, cut child poverty in America by nearly half  — but then Republican lawmakers refused to extend it, and child poverty rates surged back up. Easily accessible, affordable and legal abortion and contraception would allow women to plan their families; Republicans, though, are on an abortion-ban tear. A universal child care scheme would help single parents to work, which would in turn raise their household incomes; Republicans oppose it. A higher minimum wage would put more money in the pockets of families who need it; Republican-led states are less likely than Democratic ones to raise it, and Republicans in Congress broadly oppose a federal increase.
    
            As unions currently fight for workers’ rights and better treatment, the most prominent Democrats are standing in solidarity with them; Republicans have spent decades gutting union power. Democrats have tried valiantly to increase the number of kids who are insured and can get health care; Republicans have opposed them.
    
            Lecturing women to get married before they have babies and then shaming single moms isn’t working. What does work to help kids and families: Giving women and men alike the ability to marry into mutually stable, supportive, and financially viable relationships, while also supporting all children, regardless of who their parents are. In America, we don’t do that — not because of liberals and feminists, but because of self-styled “pro-family” conservatives and their home in the Republican Party.

      Why more women are choosing not to have kids
    ","
			By Harmeet Kaur, CNN

            Dyanna Volek was never someone who dreamed of becoming a mother.
    
            From an early age, she knew deep down that she didn’t want children. Maybe it stemmed from seeing her mother sacrifice her dream of becoming a flight attendant and work three jobs to raise two kids alone. Or maybe it was that other endeavors interested her more.
    
            “I’m always looking forward to the next thing,” said Volek, who works in local government in San Francisco. “Being a parent was never one of them.”
    
            Still, the idea of not having children seemed taboo, so she didn’t dwell on it much. It wasn’t until a few years ago when she started getting serious with her partner that she really reckoned with her feelings. By the time she and her husband got married last November, they had reached a conclusion: They wanted to be child-free.
    
            Volek is now 37, and doesn’t see herself changing her mind.
    
            Not having children gives her a sense of freedom that her friends who are parents don’t have. Now that they’re vaccinated, she and her husband have been able to eat at restaurants, attend concerts and travel without worrying about risking their child’s safety.
    
            They can work toward retiring early, a goal that would be otherwise unattainable in a city as expensive as theirs. And in their day-to-day life, they have plenty of time for themselves.
    
            Volek is one of a growing number of women in the US who are opting to live a child-free lifestyle — part of a trend that has been underway for more than a decade.
    
            Since 2007, the nation’s birth rate had been declining about 2% each year on average. Despite early speculation about a pandemic baby boom, the coronavirus crisis accelerated the decline even further, with births falling by 4% last year.
    
            It was the largest annual decline in the number of births since 1973, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Demographers point to a number of factors driving this phenomenon: economic insecurity, political uncertainty, shifting gender norms and a lessening stigma around the choice to remain child-free. Though the pandemic laid bare just how little support families in the US receive from the government when it comes to childcare and other obligations, some women had already made up their minds before then.
    
            Here are some reasons why some women are choosing not to have kids.
    
            Cecilia Sanders, a 32-year-old project manager in Chicago, was sure early on that she didn’t want children. It felt like too great of a responsibility, and the idea of pregnancy scared her.
    
            Still, she says she felt pressured to feel differently, as though she would be disappointing others by not having kids. For about a year, she tried to force herself to change her mind, talking to friends who were parents about their experiences and how they made time for themselves.
    
            As it turns out, her friends often didn’t have time for themselves. Their kids, they said, came first.
    
            Sanders realized that sacrificing her own needs to fulfill her duty as a parent would be especially taxing for her. She grapples with anxiety and depression, and when those conditions flare up, even taking care of herself becomes challenging.
    
            The thought of raising children while still preserving her mental health seemed near impossible.
    
            “After a year of really thinking about it, I was like, ‘No. If I do this, I’m lying to myself,’” she said.
    
            For some, how the US treats mothers is reason enough not to have children.
    
            Amy Blackstone, a sociologist at the University of Maine and author of “Childfree by Choice: The Movement Redefining Family and Creating a New Age of Independence,” says the lack of family-friendly policies in the US is one explanation behind the declining birth rate in recent years — something that the pandemic made even more clear.
    
            At the height of the coronavirus crisis, parents had to continue working, often without child care or while having to help their children learn remotely. The situation left people stressed and depleted, and perhaps more likely to delay or reconsider having more children.
    
            “The pandemic has really revealed to us how poorly we support parents in the US,” Blackstone said. “We’ve come to see the truth that we’ve always known but never speak out loud, which is that parenting is really hard. And we don’t really support parents in that role.”
    
            That was certainly a consideration for Yana Grant, a 24-year-old in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who decided last year to not have children. The US offers no national, paid parental leave program. Child care can be expensive or hard to find. And women are still more likely to shoulder the brunt of parenting responsibilities and household tasks.
    
            “As soon as you find out that you’re pregnant, you have to be a mother first and then a woman,” Grant said. “Men get to be men and then a father, it seems like.”
    
            As a Black woman, Grant has other things to worry about, too. Black women are more likely than women of any other race to die of pregnancy-related problems. They’re also more likely to have their concerns dismissed, their pain untreated and their experiences disbelieved.
    
            For Grant, those worries are rooted in reality. A few years ago, she felt her heart beating fast and her throat swelling, and went to see a medical professional. She says the doctor told her to stay hydrated and sent her home without checking her thyroid. When she saw another physician for the same symptoms about a year later, she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes an overactive thyroid.
    
            If she got pregnant and something were to go wrong, Grant fears her symptoms and complaints might be similarly dismissed.
    
            “I feel like as a Black woman, you don’t have a lot that is yours,” she said. “And so me keeping that part of me is the only thing I know I have control of. (I can) say that I made that conscious decision to save myself because more than likely, no one else is going to do it.”
    
            While Jordan Levey focused on law school and building her career, she assumed a “maternal instinct” would eventually kick in. Once she found a partner, she figured, they’d settle down and perhaps decide to have kids.
    
            At 35 and married for four years, Levey says she and her husband have realized they prefer their current lifestyle. They own a condo and are loving parents to their dog. And though they both earn a comfortable living, they’d rather spend their money on the things they love.
    
            “We are really happy in our life. We love to travel, we love to cook, we both really value our alone time and that self-care,” she said. “I think we would be perfectly fine parents — I just don’t think we would enjoy it.”
    
            For Sanders, not having kids allows her time to pursue all of her interests: writing, playing guitar, hiking, traveling and rescuing animals. It also means that she can focus more on her career, which for her is “the most important thing.”
    
            “I definitely feel I probably wouldn’t be as far in my career as I am now and [I wouldn’t be] able to just live my normal life and pursue my hobbies and passions,” Sanders said. “I wouldn’t be living my fullest life.”
    
            That women like Levey and Sanders feel empowered to choose a lifestyle without children is significant, says Blackstone.
    
            In the past, women who could have been inclined to remain child-free might have given birth anyway because that is what society expected from them. In recent decades, though, those norms and attitudes have changed.
    
            “We’re having more conversations about the reality that parenthood is an option, not something that everybody has to do,” she said.
    
            It’s perhaps more socially acceptable than ever for women not to have children. Even so, women who choose to remain child-free say they still feel like they constantly have to explain their choices to others.
    
            They’ve been called selfish, accused of hating kids and told they’ll regret their decision later in life when they find themselves alone.
    
            Volek says she feels child-free people like herself are judged as superficial or not having grasped the enormity of the decision they’re making, when that couldn’t be further from the truth.
    
            “People who choose to be child-free think a lot about it — I would argue even more than people who have children,” she added.
    
            The assumption that child-free women don’t care about children simply isn’t true either, some say. Volek loves playing with her friends’ kids. Levey enjoys spending time with her niece and nephew.
    
            Grant is in a relationship with a man who has a son and is perfectly happy to hang out with the youngster one on one.
    
            “I will ask if he wants to go see ‘Boss Baby 2.’ I will take him to some of the Smithsonians,” said the Oklahoma resident, who plans to move with her partner to Washington, DC. “But that’s as far as I will go.”
    
            Blackstone, who has interviewed countless people about their decision to remain child-free, says that the people she’s spoken to acknowledge that it’s possible they may one day regret making the choice that they have.
    
            But she said they’d rather not have kids and regret it later than have kids and regret it later.

      A Nebraska mother who provided an illegal abortion for her daughter and helped dispose of the fetus gets 2 years in prison, report says

    ","
            A Nebraska mother who was accused of helping her 17-year-old daughter have an illegal abortion and disposing of the fetus was sentenced to two years in prison on Friday, the Norfolk Daily News reported. 
    
            The sentence comes after Jessica Burgess, 42, pleaded guilty in July to two felonies – removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body, and performing an abortion beyond 20 weeks – and a misdemeanor charge of false reporting.
    
            CNN has reached out to Burgess’s attorney, the Madison County attorney and the Madison County District Court for comment. 
    
            Burgess’s daughter, Celeste Burgess, now 19, was sentenced in July to 90 days in jail after pleading guilty to a felony charge of removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body.
    
            Norfolk police began investigating the women in April 2022 following concerns Celeste Burgess had delivered a stillborn fetus, according to court documents. 
    
            Authorities alleged Celeste Burgess had a medication abortion, and that it violated the state’s prohibition of abortion after 20 weeks. Celeste Burgess was around 28 weeks pregnant when her pregnancy ended, court documents alleged.
    
            Earlier this year, Nebraska’s governor signed a bill into law that bans most abortions after 12 weeks, with exceptions for sexual assault, incest and medical emergencies.
    
            Investigators used Facebook messages between the Burgesses to establish that they discussed obtaining abortion pills and burning “the evidence,” court documents showed.
    
            The pills purchased by Jessica Burgess are not prescribed by doctors after a pregnancy has reached 10 weeks, Madison County Attorney Joe Smith said, according to the Norfolk Daily News. 
    
            “This defendant actually gave these drugs to her own daughter,” Smith said, according to the newspaper. “The defense lawyer did a good job avoiding a child abuse case. All of this was unnecessary. All of it was foolish.”
    
            Jessica Burgess disputed some of the assertions in the police reports but accepted responsibility for her actions, her attorney Brad Ewalt said in the report.
    
            “I understand that there’s law violations. I understand that there are serious law violations,” Ewalt said, the paper reported. “She understands that she is looking at some serious penalties here, but she’s accepting of that. And she’s ready to take what the court is going to give her.”
    
            Jessica Burgess will be eligible for release after serving a year in prison, the newspaper reported. 
    
            Madison County District Judge Mark Johnson admonished her in court. 
    
            “I shudder to think, Ms. Burgess, that you have such disrespect for a – call it a human fetus, call it a stillborn child – that you would treat it like yesterday’s trash and not give it some respect in its treatment and disposal. Our society expects more; it demands more,” Johnson said. 
    
            “You were the adult throughout this entire time, and you failed miserably in being the adult adviser to your child,” he added.

      The first pill for postpartum depression gives a psychiatrist hope before she gives birth. But is it enough?
    ","
			Analysis by Dr. Neha Chaudhary, CNN

  Published
        8:00 AM EDT, Sat September 23, 2023
    ","
            Editor’s note: Dr. Neha Chaudhary is a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and chief medical officer at Modern Health. 
    
            When I found out I was pregnant a couple years ago, I was overwhelmed with excitement — but it wasn’t long before moments of worry and anxiety crept in.
    
            Was my mental health going to be OK after I gave birth during what’s known as the postpartum period? As a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist, I knew better than most the escalating rates of postpartum mental health challenges and the glaringly obvious gaps in our health care system for new moms. While knowledge is usually power, knowledge made me scared.
    
            I was fortunate after the birth of my son not to suffer from more than the usual sleep deprivation, exhaustion — and feeling like the world as I knew it was over. But I still felt lost and shocked at what I had to figure out myself. I was left wishing that new moms were checked on more often after birthing another human.
    
            Now that I’m expecting my second child, I don’t feel the same fear that I felt the first time around. But I still feel apprehensive knowing our health care system doesn’t offer new parents enough support.
    
            With the recent approval of the first pill for postpartum depression, I feel conflicted, both professionally and personally. On one hand, it’s a great step in the right direction to support new mothers when they need it most. On the other hand, I know it’s still not enough.
    
            For some parents, the period after birth can be one of the most difficult times of their lives, and the truth is, our health care system is not set up to support new mothers. Expectant mothers are seen at least monthly, and sometimes even weekly, in preparation for delivery. But after the baby is born, the recommended appointment with a medical professional isn’t for another six weeks.
    
            Those six weeks can feel like a lifetime for some parents. While 70% of women may experience the “baby blues,” a short period of feeling more sad or anxious than normal, it’s estimated that 1 in 7 women experience postpartum depression. Unfortunately, up to 50% of women with postpartum depression go undiagnosed.
    
            Many new moms are being left to navigate a medically serious condition themselves, all while in one of the only developed countries that doesn’t have paid parental leave from work. It not only puts the mom at risk but also poses a significant risk to the baby’s health.
    
            Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first pill for severe postpartum depression, Zurzuvae (zuranolone). This is, without question, a milestone for the field. Not only is it the first oral medication for this serious condition — it works faster than antidepressants typically do. The course of treatment is 14 days, and some patients even see an improvement after just a few days.
    
            The indirect benefit: The announcement of a medication such as this one finally puts postpartum depression on the map, raising awareness about a condition that affects almost a half million US women every year. It’s that awareness that starts to reduce stigma and encourages people to seek help when they need it. It may even empower clinicians to screen more often for postpartum depression, knowing there’s a potential tool to help people if they do screen positive.
    
            But there’s a catch. Novel medications such as this one will undoubtedly be cost-prohibitive to many individuals. The worst part is that mothers living in poverty generally show higher rates of postpartum depression than those from higher-income communities. So, the ones who may need the medication most may have the hardest time accessing it. To close gaps in health equity instead of increasing them, it will be critical that we address the barriers to maternal mental health care for all, including low-income women or those with limited health care access.
    
            Whether it’s more frequent postpartum check-ins, paid parental leave from work or more support for childcare, there’s work left to do to truly support new mothers (and fathers). The new medication is one step in the right direction.
    
            As a pregnant mom, I’m thrilled that we are finally calling attention to a condition that is taking away what should be some of the most special moments of people’s lives. As a psychiatrist, I see both the promise of having a new medication to offer and the challenges with the barriers to accessing this medication for many people who need it.
    
            Either way, I hope this medication will open up the doors for more vulnerable conversations between moms and their doctors, more screening for postpartum depression, more treatment that works for the most severe cases, and eventually bigger changes to the system to catch those slipping through it.

      California attorney general sues groups over abortion reversal claims
    ","

        8:46 PM EDT, Fri September 22, 2023
    ","
            California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced Thursday that his office has filed a lawsuit against two organizations that operate crisis pregnancy centers, saying the organizations used “fraudulent and misleading claims” about a procedure they claim can reverse medication abortions. 
    
            The complaint alleges that Heartbeat International (HBI) and RealOptions mislead patients by claiming there is a way to “reverse” the effects of mifepristone, the first of two oral drugs used for medically induced abortions, through a process they call “abortion pill reversal.” 
    
            Bonta alleges both companies know there is no evidence showing the protocol works, is safe or is effective, but they keep promoting and advertising it to patients. According to the complaint, the organizations direct a patient to take high doses of progesterone within 72 hours of taking mifepristone to “reverse” the effects of mifepristone. 
    
            HBI operates more than 2,000 “pregnancy resource centers” in the United States. RealOptions operates five clinics in California under the name RealOptions Obria Medical Clinics.
    
            RealOptions said in a statement Friday it had not yet been served with the lawsuit.
    
            “RealOptions provides compassionate, comprehensive, high quality holistic reproductive health care, education, and reproductive loss healing to women, men, students, and families,” CEO Valerie Hill said in the statement. “We disagree with the allegations in this lawsuit (allegations that the California AG never gave us an opportunity to address before filing the action) and we look forward to addressing and refuting them in court.”
    
            In a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, HBI said it learned of the lawsuit through interview requests. As of Thursday night, HBI said it had not been served the lawsuit. 
    
            “Through our Abortion Pill Rescue Network hotline, we know that some women almost immediately regret their chemical abortion choice,” HBI said in its statement. “These women deserve the right to try and save their pregnancies.” 
    
            Its post cited “major studies” showing efficacy for the protocol.  
    
            According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, there is no scientific evidence that abortion reversals are effective or safe. 
    
            “Those who are struggling with the complex decision to get an abortion deserve support and trustworthy guidance – not lies and misinformation,” the attorney general said in a statement released Thursday. 
    
            “HBI and RealOptions took advantage of pregnant patients at a deeply vulnerable time in their lives, using false and misleading claims to lure them in and mislead them about a potentially risky procedure. We are launching today’s lawsuit to put a stop to their predatory and unlawful behavior.” 
    
            Bonta is asking the court to stop both companies from promoting the procedures and fine them for violating business codes.

      Two brothers convicted in murder-for-hire plot in killing of elementary school teacher over child support and alimony

            An Alabama man and the brother he hired to kill his ex-wife in 2017 to avoid paying her child support and alimony were convicted by a federal jury on Wednesday, according to a news release from the US Department of Justice. 
    
            Jason Starr, 50, and his brother, Darin Starr, 54, plotted to kill Jason´s ex-wife, Sara Starr, after a judge ordered Jason to pay her a “significant portion” of his income after their divorce, according to prosecutors. Sara Starr was shot to death outside her home in 2017.
    
            The jury found them guilty of racketeering murder, and prosecutors say they will face a mandatory sentence of life in prison.
    
            “There is no such thing as a perfect crime,” Assistant US Attorney Joshua Wendell told CNN affiliate WTVY after the verdict. “You will be caught. You will be prosecuted.”
    
            During the trial, prosecutors argued that Jason, whose net income was about $6,700 a month, had to pay $2,550 a month in child support and alimony to Sara, with whom he had four children, WTVY reported, citing court records.  
    
            Over approximately two months, starting in September 2017, Jason Starr sent about $2,600 to his brother Darin, who lived in Texas. During the trial, the jury determined that the money “was payment for the murder of his ex-wife,” according to the DOJ news release. 
    
            On Thursday, Darin Starr’s lawyers, J. Carlton Taylor and Aimee Cobb Smith, told CNN via email that “we feel the verdict in this case was the result of emotion and speculation, not evidence.”  
    
            “Darin Starr intends to pursue all remedies available under the law to have his conviction overturned,” his lawyers added. 
    
            CNN has reached out to Jason Starr’s lawyers for comments but has not yet heard back. 
    
            Sara Starr was a 38-year-old elementary school teacher and mother of two sets of twins at the time of her killing, WTVY reported. Court records show that she divorced Jason in July 2017 and that they shared their children’s custody.  
    
            Cell phone records showed that Darin Starr traveled from Texas to Coffee County in Alabama just before Thanksgiving in 2017, and was very near the home of his brother’s ex-wife on multiple occasions, according to the DOJ news release. 
    
            “Around midnight on November 27, 2017, Darin Starr’s phone was turned off. Approximately seven hours later, Darin Starr shot and killed his brother’s ex-wife in her driveway as she was leaving for work,” the release added. “Darin Starr turned his phone back on around 8:00 a.m. when he was on I-10 heading back to Texas.” 
    
            During the trial, their defense lawyers told jurors that investigators failed to find a murder weapon or an eyewitness to the crime, WTVY reported.  
    
            According to the DOJ, the sentencing hearing for both men will be held in the coming months.

      Trump’s Republican rivals jump on his abortion comments

    ","
            Former President Donald Trump faced blowback this week from his Republican presidential rivals over his recent comments to NBC News on abortion, in which he called Florida’s six-week abortion ban a “terrible mistake” and said that he’d be willing to work with both parties on the issue.
    
            Former Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, who is also seeking the GOP presidential nomination, drew on Trump’s comments as part of his argument that his former running mate is moving away from conservative principles.
    
            “Just this weekend again, you saw [Trump] walking away from our commitment to the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. People that know me know, I’ll always stand for the unborn. He actually said that a Heartbeat Bill adopted in Florida, and in places like Georgia and Ohio and South Carolina, and Iowa was a quote, terrible mistake,” he said of Trump on Fox Business.
    
            He also told Fox News Radio that Trump’s comments “just suggests to me that he is backing away from that cause.” 
    
            Pence, who has challenged the GOP field to commit to a 15-week federal ban and is clear about his opposition to abortion, was far from being the only of Trump’s competitors to call out the former president for his comments. The Republican presidential field has been split on the issue of abortion, which particularly has galvanized voters since the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade last year in prior elections.
    
            Trump, for his part, has vacillated on his approach to the polarizing issue. He has said both privately and publicly that he does not believe abortion is a winning political issue, particularly in a general election. During campaign speeches he has often avoided the topic altogether. However, he has repeatedly sought to take credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade after appointing three conservative justices to the Supreme Court while serving as president. 
    
            Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Thursday that Trump is “wrong on the issue” in not backing a 15-week federal ban, and suggested that he would sponsor Senate legislation next week banning abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            “But he’s not alone. Ron (DeSantis) has the same position. Nikki (Haley) has the same position and Vivek (Ramaswamy) has the same position of letting the states decide on when they stop abortions,” he said on Fox News Radio.
    
            Campaigning in Iowa this week, where the abortion issue is important to the state’s Christian conservative voters, Scott, who has been reluctant to attack other Republicans, called out Trump over his comments and refusing to specify how many weeks of pregnancy he’d support restricting abortion.
    
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has also leaned on the issue lately to draw a distinction between him and Trump. On Monday, DeSantis said on a local Iowa radio station that “all pro-lifers should know that he’s preparing to sell you out.”
    
            In an interview with ABC News this week, DeSantis, who was the target of Trump’s NBC comments, said Trump made a “big mistake” for saying some Republicans pursued “terrible” state-level restrictions on abortion. The Florida governor had signed a bill into law in April that’s not in effect yet but would ban most abortions after six weeks.
    
            Trump “claimed to be pro-life. He spoke at the March for Life and was waxing eloquently about how everybody counts. For him to then attack people like Iowa, South Carolina, Florida, all these other states, I thought was a big mistake,” DeSantis told ABC News.
    
            “When you provide pro-life protections that says when a baby has a heartbeat, that there’s protections, that is not something that pro-lifers think is terrible. They think that that is a noble and just thing to do,” DeSantis said.
    
            Asked if he thought Trump was “pro-life,” DeSantis said, “Well, you tell me.”
    
            “If you have something where you have a baby that has a detectable heartbeat, if you’re pro-life, you would want to say that there should be protections there. And he’s saying that that’s a terrible thing. I know most pro-life voters would, would think that he’s wrong,” the Florida governor said.
    
            He, like Pence, also argued Trump is a “different candidate” than who he was in 2015 and has drifted on positions favorable with Republican voters.
    
            “He’s taking positions that I think are different from what he took in 2015 when he first came onto the scene, and I do think he’s a different candidate today than he was back then,” DeSantis said. “I think the one back then was probably closer to where Republican voters want to be than the latest iteration.”
    
            Trump’s comments have also raised alarm among Iowa Republicans and Christian conservatives in the state – a key voting bloc that has helped propel candidates in the race.
    
            Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has left the door open to a late endorsement in the 2024 primary, also appeared to take issue with the president’s comments.
    
            “It’s never a ‘terrible thing’ to protect innocent life,” the Republican governor wrote on X Tuesday. “I’m proud of the fetal heartbeat bill the Iowa legislature passed and I signed in 2018 and again earlier this year.”
    
            On Wednesday, Trump said during a campaign stop in Iowa that Republicans “must learn how to properly talk about abortion” if they want to win in 2024.
    
            “We’d probably lose the majorities in 2024 without the exceptions,” Trump told a crowd of more than 1,000 at his campaign event in Dubuque, Iowa, referring to exceptions of rape, incest and health of the mother, which he supports. 
    
            “You have to follow your heart. You can’t just do it for elections… but at the same time you have to win elections,” he said.

      FDA advisers discuss future of ‘artificial womb’ for human infants
    ","

    ","
            Independent advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration are meeting this week to discuss the regulations, ethics and possibilities of creating an artificial womb to increase the chances that extremely premature babies would survive — and without long-term health problems.
    
            Although no such device has been tested in humans, similar ones have been used in a handful of cases to successfully develop animals. On Tuesday, during the first day of their two-day meeting, the advisers considered what human trials could look like.
    
            An artificial womb for humans would be a scientific advance that could help solve a major health problem. Preterm births are the No. 1 killer of children under the age of 5, according to the World Health Organization.
    
            Because a baby’s lungs and brain finish developing late in pregnancy, a child born prematurely risks a lifetime of health problems including trouble breathing, gastrointestinal issues, vision and hearing problems, developmental delays and cerebral palsy.
    
            Prematurity has become a growing problem in the US. The number of preterm births increased from 10.1% of all babies born in 2020 to 10.5% in 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The issue disproportionately affects African Americans, who give birth prematurely at a rate that is 50% higher than those of White and Hispanic people.
    
            An artificial womb is not designed to replace a pregnant person; it could not be used from conception until birth. Rather, it could be used to help a small number of infants born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, which is considered extreme prematurity. Less than 1% of babies are born this early.
    
            The earlier an infant is born, the greater the risk of death. For example, only about 30% of infants born at 22 weeks survive, and just under 56% survive birth at 23 weeks, according to a 2022 study published in the journal JAMA.
    
            The artificial womb could be able to help the baby develop further through those vital final stages when the lung and brain are developing. Like a person’s womb, it would deliver oxygen, nutrients and hormones.
    
            Premature babies have to stay in a neonatal intensive care unit or NICU, where they can get special nutrition, extra care for their heart, help regulating their body temperature and help with their breathing.
    
            NICUs are regularly successful in getting premature babies through the first part of their lives, but there’s always the danger of infection at a hospital. And if the baby needs to be put on a ventilator, it may injure their tiny lungs.
    
            Before the FDA would approve experimenting with a human in an artificial womb, scientists would have to show that the device could facilitate growth and development while reducing the rate of death and health problems, potentially compared with care with existing technology and techniques in a NICU.
    
            The FDA’s Pediatric Advisory Committee is considering what kind of data scientists will have to show in such trials and what kind of regulations may be required, as well as what ethical considerations may need to be addressed. The committee also discussed what kind of metrics may be needed to determine the success of animal trials.
    
            A handful of scientists have been experimenting with animals and artificial wombs. In each study, the artificial womb is constructed a little bit differently.
    
            In a 2017 experiment, a group at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia was able to keep a developing lamb alive for 28 days in a sterilized plastic bag filled with fluid. Tubes that delivered amniotic fluid, medicine and oxygen were connected to the lamb’s umbilical cord tissue. The team saw positive growth and development in the lambs’ lungs, brains and gastrointestinal tracts.
    
            “The technology is robust and stable,” Dr. Alan Flake, director of the Center for Fetal Research at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told the committee Tuesday. “We’ve now run over 300 lambs in the artificial womb, and the runs are generally remarkably smooth.
    
            “We’ve observed no acute irreversible events that threatens survival,” he added. The “ultimate safety feature,” he said, is that the subject can be immediately removed and placed into standard care if necessary.
    
            “We believe that our preclinical data supports feasibility and safety and that it’s adequate for consideration of a carefully designed clinical study of artificial womb technology,” Flake told the committee.
    
            The group hopes to try a device they’ve been testing named the Extra-uterine Environment for Newborn Development, or EXTEND, in humans.
    
            In a trial of what scientists at the University of Michigan call an artificial placenta, lambs survived 16 days. The team saw positive results in the development of lung function and brain development until they were able to transition to mechanical ventilation.
    
            In a presentation to the committee Tuesday, Dr. George Mychaliska, the Robert Bartlett Collegiate Professor of Pediatric Surgery at C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital at University of Michigan Health, said the group is working on a prospective study involving this work. They foresee using this artificial placenta with humans as a kind of “rescue therapy.”
    
            However, “we recognize there are many ethical and regulatory considerations prior to clinical translation,” Mychaliska said.
    
            In another experiment in Japan and Australia, in an artificial womb scientists call EVE, the lamb incubated for a week and had good development in the lungs, but there was some brain injury due to a technical issue.
    
            Scientists at the University of Toronto used fetal pigs in it experiment with an artificial placenta in a trial modeled on the lamb experiments. Pigs and humans have a similar kind of umbilical cord, but there were problems with blood circulation and some heart issues in that experiment.
    
            Despite the setbacks, Mike Seed, head of the Division of Cardiology at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, thinks they are on the right track.
    
            “We remain extremely enthusiastic about the potential of artificial womb technology and are about to embark on a new set of experiments using a third iteration of our circuit,” he told the committee.
    
            The FDA committee agreed that before such technology could be used with humans, scientists would have to determine the most appropriate animal model to test the artificial womb.
    
            Experts say there may also need to be a conversation about what viability — a concept referring to the ability of a human to survive outside the womb — means.
    
            On Tuesday, the committee discussed at length the ethics of using the technology, including what conversations doctors may have to have with parents about how successful such an intervention could be if it’s tested on humans.
    
            The advisers also wanted to make sure that if humans were part of the trials, they would be inclusive. And they agreed that there would need to be extensive followup to determine what health effects, if any, children had in the long term.
    
            Additionally, the committee discussed regulatory considerations and extra safeguards because trials would involve children, which by law requires extra steps to ensure safety. The advisers examined potential clinical considerations to fairly assess whether the new technology would be an advance over currently available care.
    
            Although the two-day meeting can guide the way the FDA will move forward with regulating artificial wombs, the agency makes decisions on its own terms and does not have to follow the experts’ recommendations.
    
            The first day of the meeting was open to the public, but the second day will be closed because the nature of the research involves proprietary information, the FDA said.

      Indiana Republican AG faces professional ethics charges related to his efforts to punish doctor who provided abortion services to 10-year-old rape victim
    ","

        7:00 PM EDT, Mon September 18, 2023
    ","
            Indiana’s Republican attorney general is facing three professional ethics charges stemming from public statements he made last year about a state doctor he sought to punish for providing abortion services to a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim.  
    
            In a 56-page complaint filed Monday with Indiana’s Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission, Attorney General Todd Rokita was accused of violating three separate state professional conduct rules for a series of public comments he made about Dr. Caitlin Bernard.  
    
            Two of the counts relate to an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters in which Rokita referred to Bernard as an “abortion activist acting as a doctor with a history of failure to report.”  
    
            Rokita is also accused of “intentionally making public statements and/or directing others to issue public statements from July 2022 - September 2022 about the investigation of Dr. Caitlin Bernard, prior to a referral to the Medical Licensing Board, in contravention of the duty of confidentiality required under” Indiana law and professional conduct rules.  
    
            CNN has reached out to Rokita’s office for comment on the disciplinary charges.  
    
            Rokita moved to dismiss the disciplinary charges against him in a filing later Monday, writing that his “statements reflect his commitment to fulfill official duties regardless of political sensitivity and to keep the public informed.” 
    
            Rokita conceded that the comments at issue from the Fox interview “could reasonably be considered to have violated” professional conduct rules, wbut that “should a hearing be necessary, Respondent demands strict proof thereof,” adding that he denies any allegations stemming from his comments about his office’s probe into Bernard.  
    
            Bernard’s attorney, Kathleen DeLaney, said in a statement that her legal team “had no involvement in the recent charges filed and therefore cannot comment on them.” 
    
            Indiana’s Supreme Court will appoint a hearing officer to oversee the matter, much like a trial court judge would, according to the disciplinary commission’s website. That officer will make a report on the case and provide it to the Supreme Court, which will make the final call on whether to reprimand Rokita.  
    
            Should the Indiana Supreme Court find that Rokita violated state ethics rules, it could order disciplinary sanctions ranging from a private or public reprimand to permanent disbarment.  
    
            Bernard was reprimanded and fined by Indiana’s medical licensing board after it determined that her disclosure of the 2022 abortion violated federal and state patient privacy laws. The reprimand came after Rokita had filed a complaint against Bernard last November, citing her decision to discuss the episode with a reporter.   
    
            The procedure was done just days after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, a ruling that paved the way for Ohio to ban almost all abortions after six weeks of gestation. The girl was six weeks and three days into her pregnancy, Bernard previously told CNN.    
    
            Bernard and her medical partner had sued Rokita, alleging his office used illegitimate consumer complaints to pursue his probe into her, but they later dropped their suit.

      Trump, who paved way for Roe v. Wade reversal, says Republicans ‘speak very inarticulately’ about abortion
    ","
			By Eric Bradner, CNN

  Updated
        6:55 PM EDT, Sun September 17, 2023
    ","
            Former President Donald Trump, who paved the way for the undoing of federal abortion rights protections, said that some Republicans “speak very inarticulately” about the issue and have pursued “terrible” state-level restrictions that could alienate much of the country. 
    
            While avoiding taking specific positions himself, Trump said in an NBC interview that if he is reelected he will try to broker compromises on how long into pregnancies abortion should be legal and whether those restrictions should be imposed on the federal or the state level. 
    
            “I would sit down with both sides and I’d negotiate something and we’ll end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years,” he said. 
    
            The former president targeted GOP primary rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in his criticism of how the Republican party has handled the issue, calling Florida’s six-week ban “a terrible thing and a terrible mistake.” 
    
            DeSantis’ camp hit back on Sunday, taking aim at the former president for saying he’d be willing to work with both parties on abortion.
    
            “We’ve already seen the disastrous results of Donald Trump compromising with Democrats: over $7 trillion in new debt, an unfinished border wall, and the jailbreak First Step Act letting violent criminals back on to the streets. Republicans across the country know that Ron DeSantis will never back down,” tweeted spokesperson Andrew Romeo.
    
            Trump also warned Republicans that the party would lose voters by advancing abortion restrictions without exceptions for cases of rape, incest or risks to the mother’s life.
    
            “Other than certain parts of the country, you can’t – you’re not going to win on this issue,” he said. 
    
            Trump’s comments made plain the challenge for 2024 Republican presidential primary contenders: trying to balance the priorities of their conservative base, for whom the Supreme Court’s June 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade was a victory decades in the making, and those of the general electorate, which has consistently supported abortion rights – most recently in the 2022 midterms and the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this spring.
    
            Abortion could also be a pivotal issue this fall in Virginia’s state legislative elections, which are widely viewed as a barometer of the electorate’s mood in the lead-up to next year’s presidential election.
    
            Trump’s appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices paved the way to the reversal of the 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion rights across the United States through the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. 
    
            That reversal left abortion rights up to the states, which has led to a patchwork of laws – including bans on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy in Florida and Iowa, the first state to vote in the GOP presidential nominating process.
    
            Abortion rights have been a major fault line in the 2024 Republican primary. Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, has advocated a federal abortion ban after 15 weeks. DeSantis, Trump’s top-polling rival, has touted the six-week ban he signed into law. However, other contenders, including Nikki Haley, have taken more moderate approaches, warning of the political backlash Republicans could face among the broader electorate by pursuing strict abortion restrictions. 
    
            Trump would not commit to a specific policy preference in the interview. He deflected questions about whether he would support a federal ban – and if so, after how many weeks – or would rather the issue be left to statehouses.
    
            “What’s going to happen is you’re going to come up with a number of weeks or months, you’re going to come up with a number that’s going to make people happy,” Trump said.
    
            Trump said he believed it was “probably better” to leave abortion restrictions up to the states instead of trying to pass federal legislation on the issue. 
    
            “From a pure standpoint, from a legal standpoint, I think it’s probably better. But I can live with it either way,” Trump said. “It could be state or could it federal, I don’t frankly care.” 
    
            The intra-GOP debate over abortion took center stage at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition gathering, attended by many of the state’s leading conservative evangelical activists. 
    
            Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, one of the most vocal Trump critics among the GOP contenders, told reporters Saturday in Iowa that Trump has “taken evangelical voters for granted” and is “waffling on important issues.” 
    
            “I think he is looking at the abortion question as not whether it’s going to win evangelical support, but what that’s going to look like down the road, and as he said he wants everybody to like him,” Hutchinson said. 
    
            Asked about federal legislation on abortion, DeSantis continued not to engage on the topic of a national ban, instead pointing to new restrictions in states such as Iowa and Florida.
    
            “I’ve been a pro-life governor. I’ll be a pro-life president,” DeSantis said. “Clearly, a state like Iowa has been able to move the ball with pro-life protections. Florida has been able to move the ball.”
    
            Pence reiterated his support for a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy as a minimum, saying, “It’s an idea whose time has come.” He said Trump and other GOP candidates want to relegate the abortion issue to the states, “but I won’t have it.” 
    
            However, other contenders more focused on the general electorate, including Haley – the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations – have sought to thread the same needle as Trump. 
    
            Haley on Saturday told attendees at the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Iowa that her beliefs are the “hard truth.” She said pursuing a federal 15-week abortion ban would have “everybody running from us.” 
    
            While Haley opposes abortion, she has emphasized she believes Republicans and Democrats need find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.
    
            “This issue is personal for every woman and every man. And we need to treat it that way. I don’t judge anyone for being pro-choice any more than I want them to judge me for being pro-life,” she said. 
    
            Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on CNN last week that he would be open to signing a federal abortion ban “if it represented consensus,” while admitting the current setbacks to reaching that consensus within the US Senate and across states.
    
            “I want all of the 50 states to be able to weigh in if they want to, and what their state laws should be, and then let’s see if it’s a consensus,” he said. 
    
            Democrats, meanwhile, are eyeing abortion as one of the most important issues in the 2024 presidential election. 
    
            CNN previously reported that President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign earlier this month made a digital advertising buy highlighting the positions of Trump and other GOP 2024 contenders on the issue. 
    
            “As Donald Trump visits states where women are suffering the consequences of his extreme, anti-abortion agenda, this ad reminds voters in states that have passed some of the most extreme abortion bans of Trump’s key role in appointing conservative justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade,” Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a statement to CNN.

      These candidates in Virginia could shape how both parties talk about abortion in 2024
    ","

    ","
            The new epicenter of America’s fight over abortion rights is Henrico County, Virginia, where candidates in bellwether state elections this fall are staking out positions that could test how both parties will try to appeal to moderate voters in 2024.
    
            “They don’t want abortion illegal,” GOP state Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant said of Virginia voters last weekend, sipping coffee as a heavy downpour ruined her plans for knocking on doors in this Richmond suburb. 
    
            “They want a woman to have a reasonable amount of time to figure out what she needs to do,” she added, before explaining why she supports restricting access to abortion in the third trimester.
    
            That’s not typically how Republican politicians broach the topic. But Dunnavant, an OB-GYN, is airing a 60-second TV ad in which she speaks directly to the camera about her abortion position – namely that it should be legal up to 15 weeks, with some exceptions.
    
            Earlier in the day, before the skies had opened up, state Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg – Dunnavant’s Democratic opponent in this competitive state Senate district – told a backyard rally that his campaign had hoped to focus on lowering the cost of living and improving education. But Dunnavant and GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin, he said, had turned the election into something else.
    
            “My opponent, the governor, launched these campaigns with a proposal to take away people’s rights,” VanValkenburg said, using language Democrats have often successfully deployed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. 
    
            While many GOP-led states have toughened abortion restrictions since the fall of Roe, Virginia – with its split legislature – is the only Southern state that hasn’t. And on post-Roe ballot initiatives across the country, voters have sided with the abortion rights position, even in traditionally red states. 
    
            SEE NATIONWIDE ABORTION RULES HERE
    
            This fall’s legislative races in Virginia will be the first major “candidate vs. candidate” contests to spotlight the abortion issue since last year’s midterms. Every seat in both the GOP-led state House and the Democratic-controlled state Senate is up for election.
    
            “There’s not like a referendum question on the ballot, but it is on the ballot,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said in an interview Saturday after the backyard rally, which was hosted by the mother of Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who represented the area for two terms prior to redistricting. (Spanberger’s 2018 victory in what had long been a GOP-dominated district highlighted the suburban area’s move away from Republicans under Donald Trump.)
    
            Kaine and his Democratic colleague, Sen. Mark Warner, have been trying to convince donors who were engaged in other states’ abortion-related ballot measures to step into Virginia – which backed Joe Biden by 10 points in 2020 and then voted for Youngkin by 2 points the following year. At the senators’ urging, Biden recently directed the Democratic National Committee to send $1.2 million for party campaign operations in Virginia. But that’s dwarfed by the $12 million Youngkin’s political action committee raised in the six months from March to August this year. 
    
            The stakes in November are high – for Youngkin, whose political ambitions likely rest on whether his party can win full control of Virginia government, and for 2024 candidates trying to figure out how to talk about abortion. 
    
            Dunnavant’s staff had warned her Saturday that a storm was on the way and her door-knocking plans might be in jeopardy.
    
            But she was having trouble getting away from the Festival of India at the Greater Richmond Convention Center. Seemingly every third person wanted to greet Dunnavant, who was quick to give a hug or take a photo.
    
            First elected to the Virginia Senate in 2015, Dunnavant is now seeking an open seat that’s more Democratic than her current district. But many voters still see her as the incumbent, and she argues that her personal and professional experiences – she’s currently the only medical doctor in the legislature – inform her position on abortion. 
    
            While most GOP candidates in Virginia this year have, publicly at least, coalesced around the Youngkin-endorsed 15-week limit – with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother – Dunnavant differs slightly. She wants those exceptions to include “severe fetal anomalies.” But she also believes that most exceptions, besides life of the mother, shouldn’t extend past the “realm of viability.” 
    
            Current Virginia law allows abortions through about 26 weeks. After that, three physicians must sign off on an abortion. In a Washington Post-Schar School poll released in early April, three-quarters of registered Virginia voters said the state’s abortion law – which the survey did not describe – should either remain as it is or be loosened. Voters were about evenly split, however, on the 15-week proposal with exceptions. 
    
            “I felt very personally a responsibility to step forward when Dobbs came through because it was now something that wasn’t a national discussion,” Dunnavant said, referring to the Supreme Court ruling that ended Roe v. Wade as she explained her focus on abortion in the legislature – and now her campaign. 
    
            After struggling to form an effective abortion message post-Dobbs, more national Republicans seem to be acknowledging the political peril of ignoring the topic.
    
            Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel praised the presidential candidates for at least talking about abortion at last month’s first primary debate. And there’s increasing reflection about how to talk about it. One Nation – a GOP outside group allied with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell – recently conducted research that was shared with Republican senators suggesting candidates must be specific about what being “pro-life” means and should talk about their support for exceptions, according to a person familiar with the group’s polling.
    
            “The ground has shifted and a new approach is required,” Liesl Hickey, a GOP strategist and Dunnavant’s ad maker, said in an email. “When attacked, candidates in toss up areas need to return fire and not let Democrats define the debate.”  
    
            Tammy Campbell isn’t buying Dunnavant’s pitch. Like a lot of Virginians, the 53-year-old Glen Allen resident wants abortion to be legal, even if she thinks having the procedure at the very end of a pregnancy “would be like murder.”
    
            “We fought so hard to get these rights, and now they’re trying to take them away from us,” the self-described “old school Democrat,” who’s backing VanValkenburg, told CNN. 
    
            It’s not Dunnavant’s 15-week position that turns Campbell off, although she thinks the restriction could be pushed back further into pregnancy. It’s the threat of what else a GOP-controlled legislature could do. 
    
            “My fear is that we will – because we’re a conservative state, as it is – we will revert to some of those states where these poor people were seeking (abortions) outside of their state,” Campbell said.
    
            Fear drives a lot of this year’s messaging about abortion. The political debate is often less about the candidates’ stated positions than about the threat of what they could do in office. 
    
            Virginia House Democrats have run an ad highlighting nearby states’ stricter abortion laws and featuring a comment by a state House Republican candidate during the primaries that he would support a “100% ban” on abortion. “MAGA Republicans in Richmond want Virginia to be next,” the narrator in the Democratic ad says. Meanwhile, an ad from Virginia House Republicans says Democrats support “elective abortions up until birth” – alluding to a 2019 bill that would have eased some requirements – as an image of VanValkenburg appears on screen. 
    
            VanValkenburg said in an interview last week that he doesn’t want to change current Virginia law. “I don’t think we should be messing with it,” the history and government teacher said, adding, “I think we need to take the law as-is and codify it into the constitution.” 
    
            While national Democrats largely haven’t specified a time cutoff for abortion access, Virginia Democrats are running on the state’s 26-week status quo, even if they don’t always talk specifics. 
    
            “The Dobbs decision completely changed what Virginia voters are thinking about,” Mamie Locke, the chair of the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus, said in a phone interview last month. She pointed to the issue’s salience in a state Senate special election earlier this year, in which Democrats flipped a GOP-held seat. 
    
            Democratic media consultant Scott Kozar – who worked on that special election and a recent Ohio ballot measure and is now involved in multiple Virginia legislative races this fall, including VanValkenburg’s – thinks the focus on freedoms and rights is paying dividends for Democrats, especially in politically evolving areas like this part of Virginia, which was once represented by Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader, and his tea party vanquisher Dave Brat.
    
            “They were the freedom folks; now they’re the control people,” he said of Republicans. 
    
            “College-educated men are now in play for us,” he added. “Not saying they’re going to vote for us, but they’re a persuadable audience now.”
    
            At last weekend’s Democratic backyard rally, where Arnold Palmers flowed from Spanberger-branded beverage dispensers, nurse practitioner Susanna Gibson was also leaning into the same language about freedoms to make her pitch to voters.
    
            Gibson, who said she’s running for one of the most competitive House districts in the state because of the Dobbs decision, told CNN she’s “terrified” of women losing rights in Virginia. (She used similar framing in her response to reports this week that she and her husband had performed sexual acts on a pornographic livestreaming website, accusing unnamed political opponents of trying to silence women.)
    
            Gibson told CNN that her GOP opponent David Owen wanted to ban abortion, alluding to a Richmond Times-Dispatch story that published a video from a campaign event at which the retired homebuilder called himself “pro-life” and suggested that votes for “outlawing” the procedure didn’t exist in the legislature.
    
            But in a brief interview at the Festival of India in Richmond last weekend, Owen said he supports “a woman’s right to choose” up until 15 weeks, with exceptions – a notable public usage of the language of “choice” by a Republican.
    
            “So nobody knows what the makeup of the legislature is going to be, but whatever it is, I’m not going to vote for a ban. I’m at 15 weeks,” Owen said. 
    
            Dunnavant has made a similar distinction. “I don’t support an abortion ban. Period,” she says in an ad that features other women stating that Dunnavant doesn’t back a ban and casting assertions to the contrary as “political lies.”
    
            VanValkenburg doesn’t see it that way.
    
            “If something’s legal and then it becomes illegal, that’s a ban,” he said as the poolside crowd at Saturday’s rally nodded along.

      Planned Parenthood will resume abortions in Wisconsin next week after judge rules 1849 state law doesn’t apply

    ","
            Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin says they will resume abortion care services next week after a judge ruled a state law from 1849 did not apply to abortion procedures.
    
            On September 18, Planned Parenthood’s Water Street Health Center in Milwaukee and Madison East Health Center in Madison will again offer abortion care, Tanya Atkinson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said in a video posted on social media. 
    
            “A ruling by the Dane County Circuit Court in July made it clear that the 1849 law is not enforceable for voluntary abortions,” Atkinson said. “In consultation with attorneys, physicians, partners and stakeholders, Planned Parenthood Wisconsin is confident in our decision to resume abortion care in Wisconsin.”
    
            Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin suspended abortion care last year after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade due to uncertainty around the enforceability of a 1849 state law that prohibited the procedure. Thirteen other states have banned or severely restricted access to abortion procedures since that 2022 ruling. 
    
            Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion law says, “Any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child is guilty of a Class H felony,” which is punishable by up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. It also says anyone who causes the death of the mother or “intentionally destroys the life” of an “unborn quick child” would face a Class E felony, which is punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The law would not apply to the mother and makes exceptions for abortions necessary for the pregnant person’s life. 
    
            In June 2022, the state’s Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul brought a lawsuit to the Dane County Circuit Court challenging the 173-year-old ban. Defendants, including Republican Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, sought to dismiss the case.
    
            This July, Dane County Circuit Court Judge Diane Schlipper ruled against the motion to dismiss from defendants.
    
            In her ruling, Schlipper wrote that she found the 1849 law only applies to “feticide,” which was defined as an “act or instance of killing a fetus, usually by assaulting and battering.” 
    
            “This pre-Roe statute says nothing about abortion – there is no such thing as an ’1849 Abortion Ban’ in Wisconsin,” Schlipper’s ruling stated. 
    
            The lawsuit could still reach Wisconsin’s Supreme Court, which flipped to a Democratic majority after liberal Janet Protasiewicz defeated former conservative justice Daniel Kelly in April.
    
            Wisconsin’s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers praised Planned Parenthood’s decision in a news release Thursday. 
    
            “I’ve been clear from the beginning that I would fight to restore reproductive freedom in our state with every power and every tool we have, and I’ve spent every day over the last year doing just that,” Evers said.  
    
            “Today’s announcement from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin as a result of our lawsuit regarding Wisconsin’s criminal abortion ban means Wisconsinites will once again be able to access vital reproductive healthcare and abortion services without exception for the first time since June of last year,” he said. 
    
            “This is critically important news for Wisconsin women and patients across our state who, for a year now, have been unable to access the healthcare they need when and where they need it.”

      Mother charged nearly 40 years after her newborn baby was found dead in remote woods

            A woman was charged in her newborn girl’s death nearly 40 years after the abandoned baby was found dead in a remote wooded area in New Jersey, according to the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office.
    
            On Christmas Eve 1984, officers discovered the baby’s body wrapped in a towel inside a plastic bag off a road in Mendham Township after two boys reported finding her that morning, a news release stated.
    
            The baby’s umbilical cord was still attached, according to the release issued Thursday. The medical examiner determined the infant, whose death was ruled a homicide, was alive at birth and died less than 24 hours later.
    
            The girl, whose identity was unknown, was named “Mary” after being baptized by a reverend of St. Joseph Church in Mendham Township, where she was buried, the prosecutor’s office said.
    
            Investigators were recently able to identify Baby Mary’s biological parents using “new technology, law enforcement networking in three states and old-fashioned police work,” the prosecutor’s office said.
    
            Baby Mary’s biological mother, who police did not name because she was a juvenile in 1984, was a South Carolina resident when she gave birth to the child, the prosecutor’s office said.
    
            The biological father died before being identified, and police say there is no evidence he was aware of either the woman’s pregnancy or the baby’s birth and death.
    
            Authorities filed a juvenile delinquency complaint against the mother in April and charged her with one count of manslaughter, an offense which would be a second-degree crime if committed by an adult, according to the release.
    
            “This arrest is the culmination of decades of effort, across multiple generations of law enforcement,” Morris County Prosecutor Robert J. Carroll said.
    
            “The death and abandonment of this baby girl is a tragic loss and even after nearly 40 years, remains just as heartbreaking,” Carroll said. “Justice may not take the form the public has imagined all these years, but we believe with this juvenile delinquency complaint, justice is being served for Baby Mary. Nothing can right this terrible wrong.”
    
            Police said New Jersey’s Safe Haven Infant Protection Act, which did not exist at the time of the child’s abandonment, can help parents and families to give up an infant safely, legally and anonymously.
    
            The act, which allows parents or their representatives to surrender a newborn 30 days old or younger at an emergency room, ambulance, police or fire station, became law in August 2000.
    
            “I want young parents to know that there is help available,” Morris County Sheriff James Gannon said in the release. “The baby will be accepted with no questions asked.”
    
            Every Christmas Eve for the past 35 years, community members and law enforcement have held a remembrance service at the Baby Mary’s grave “to ensure she is never forgotten,” Mendham Township Police Chief Ross Johnson said.

      ‘MeToo’ for mothers: Australian inquiry hears troubling accounts of birth trauma
    ","

    ","
            Sitting before a parliamentary panel in a bare-walled function room of a hotel on the southeastern Australian coast, Naomi Bowden broke down several times as she recounted a series of distressing events after her daughter Stella’s stillbirth in 2009.
    
            “Having to identify her body to the police and being forced to watch the police officer put her in a cold Styrofoam box and transfer her to the coroner.”
    
            “Being kept in the maternity ward overnight, listening to the sounds of other mothers giving birth and then hearing their babies cry.”
    
            “Going into my six-week check-up appointment with the hospital staff and being asked, ‘Where’s your baby’?”
    
            This week, Bowden was among several Australian mothers who gave evidence at a parliamentary inquiry in New South Wales into birth trauma that one expert likened to the “MeToo” of childbirth.
    
            “No means no, except apparently in childbirth, and it’s time to change that,” Hannah Dahlen, a professor of midwifery at Western Sydney University, told the inquiry when it opened on Monday. “This is the MeToo movement of birth.”
    
            The inquiry was called after dozens of women complained about their care in one part of the state, but the deluge of submissions suggests the problem goes far wider.
    
            More than 4,000 submissions were received in just six weeks, mostly from mothers who say they were ignored, belittled, and denied the opportunity to give informed consent.
    
            Some lost their babies, others carried their infants home along with mental and physical trauma – for which many blame themselves.
    
            “Women are telling us that it is basically their fault that it happened to them,” said Dahlen, who co-authored a paper that asked women across Australia if they’d do anything differently with their next birth. Of more than 6,000 replies, more than 85% said yes.
    
            “Women take on a lot of self-blame and they feel a lot of failure and, therefore, they often don’t feel they have a right to complain because they feel it was their fault,” Dahlen said. 
    
            International studies suggest at least one in three women have experienced birth trauma, defined by the inquiry as “inappropriate, disrespectful or abusive treatment before, during and after birth,” that leaves them with emotional or physical scars – and often both.
    
            In medical literature, birth trauma is also referred to as “obstetric violence,” which the Lancet journal says can be interpersonal and structural, “arising from the actions of health-care providers and also from broader political and economic arrangements that disproportionately harm marginalized populations.”
    
            In its submission to the inquiry, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) said it “strongly believes” the term is incorrect as it suggests the obstetrician intended to cause harm “and that is unfair.”
    
            “No-one goes to work to cause trauma,” Jared Watts, RANZCOG Board Director told the inquiry. “If we need to come to the party and actually work out a solution for this, we need to use language that engages the doctors,” he said. 
    
            Birth trauma may not be the intention – and in some cases it’s unavoidable when medical staff intervene to save the life of the mother and child. But in other cases, it’s preventable, say mothers who submitted their stories to the inquiry.
    
            Carly Griffin told the inquiry she felt ready to deliver her son but the process was cut short by an obstetrician. “The OB came in, did an examination and said, ‘No, we’re going for a C-section. This is an emergency, your baby’s in distress, but I’m just going to go for dinner first,’” she said.
    
            “I don’t want to assume, but I feel that they wanted my birthing room,” she said. “I feel like maybe I wouldn’t have as much trauma if I knew 100% that that C-section saved my baby’s life (but) I don’t think it had any effect on him at all.”
    
            Others told of distress that tainted their pregnancy but not the actual birth.
    
            Jessica Holliday said her joy at becoming pregnant turned to shame when she was told that she was high-risk due to her weight. 
    
            “Despite testing negative for gestational diabetes three times in the first 20 weeks, I was encouraged to act as if I had it. I was warned of a big baby due to my size and advised early induction. The birthing pool was off limits because of my BMI (body mass index) as it was considered a workplace health and safety issue,” Holliday said.
    
            At 30 weeks she found a private midwife and had a homebirth, delivering an average-sized baby. Still, she said her journey was “fraught with emotional turmoil, disappointment and frustration.”
    
            Then there’s the heartbreak of losing a baby, as Amanda Macaulay recalled, telling the inquiry that she felt “broken, physically and psychologically,” after her son was stillborn days after she begged a hospital for help for severe pain.
    
            The grief has stayed with her entire family, she said, including her husband, a shift worker who was told she’d been taken to hospital by ambulance. “He arrived and was handed his stillborn son and told that my life was uncertain at that point in time,” she said. 
    
            Afterward, she was sent home with little support. 
    
            “You feel lost, you feel alone, you leave hospital, and you still look pregnant. People ask, ‘when are you due?’ and it’s heartbreaking.”
    
            Committee Chair Emma Hurst says the point of the inquiry isn’t to lay blame on individuals. “It’s about finding out where the system is failing and making sure we can work towards changing those systems so it doesn’t continue to happen to other women,” she told CNN.
    
            NSW is the first Australian state to examine the issue, and there are already calls for a national inquiry because the problems aren’t limited to that one state – or even to Australia. “The research is showing that it’s worldwide,” she said. 
    
            Amy Dawes founded the Australasian Birth Trauma Association (ABTA) after sustaining life-altering injuries during the forceps delivery of her first child in 2015. Since then, thousands of women have approached the group, a charity staffed by volunteers that relies on donations, for support and guidance.
    
            “We are contacted by women across the world who want to start up birth trauma associations, for example, in the US. We know that there are systemic problems, and there’s actually no US-based support services for people who have experienced birth-related trauma. So that’s our second biggest market after Australia,” Dawes told CNN.
    
            She doesn’t think the incidence of birth trauma is increasing, just that more women are starting to talk about it.
    
            “I think that there has just been a shroud of silence, a stigma associated with it. And it’s just simply been accepted as part of becoming a mother,” Dawes said.
    
            However, Fiona Reid, a clinical midwife with more than 36 years of experience who has trained midwives, told the inquiry the increasing intervention by medical staff has increased the risk of birth trauma.
    
            “We are creating the culture that is increasingly medical at the expense of patient satisfaction, and we haven’t improved maternal or infant outcomes. And that is the crux of it,” she told the inquiry.
    
            Australia has a cesarean rate of 38%, according to government figures, higher than many other countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – despite longstanding advice from the World Health Organization that maternal health and newborn mortality rates don’t improve beyond rates of 10-15%. 
    
            The global cesarean rate is currently 21%, up from about 7% in 1990, and predicted to rise closer to 30% in the next few years, according to the WHO. As of 2018, the highest rates were in the Americas at 39%, Europe at 25.7% and Asia at 23.1%.
    
            Reid said medical interventions had been used to make “birth safe,” but for many it’s creating alternative risks.
    
            “We need to look at the quality of care, not the rate of interventions,” Reid said. “We are not improving maternal and infant outcomes. In fact, we are breaking mothers.”
    
            And medical staff are also suffering, she said, a claim supported by the Australian College of Midwives whose submission to the inquiry includes quotes from midwives conveying secondary trauma.
    
            “I’ve seen women berated like children and told they will kill their baby if they don’t do what they’re told. I’ve seen gross omissions of information resulting in a failure to obtain true consent,” wrote one unnamed midwife from regional NSW. 
    
            Some midwives had become so tired and disillusioned they were leaving the industry, putting pressure on other staff who were already overworked, the submission said. 
    
            Reid said birth trauma will never be eliminated – “it’s an impossible request.”
    
            But she said attention should focus on eliminating preventable birth trauma and raising standards so the measure of success isn’t merely survival.
    
            “It’s an act of erasure to be told that the only important part of the birth experience is the end: the live baby and the live mother,” she said. “We know that this is an inadequate measure of outcome.”
    
            The inquiry is expected to take several months with a final report due in February 2024.

      DOJ and Mifepristone maker ask Supreme Court to make ultimate decision on abortion drug in 2024
    ","

    ","
            The Supreme Court is once again being asked to make a major ruling on abortion in an election year.
    
            The Department of Justice and a manufacturer of the widely used abortion drug mifepristone asked the Supreme Court on Friday to reverse a lower court ruling that, if allowed to go into effect, would restrict access to the drug.
    
            The filings mean that the justices could finally decide the long-running abortion-related dispute next summer, putting the court in the middle of US presidential and congressional politics.
    
            As things stand, mifepristone remains available and not subject to restrictions the lower courts have said should be imposed on its use until all legal challenges are resolved because of an order the justices signed in April. Medication abortion makes up the majority of abortions obtained in the United States.
    
            Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the court late Friday night in legal briefs that “more than half of American women who choose to terminate their pregnancies rely on mifepristone to do so” and that “study after study has shown that when mifepristone is taken in accordance with its approved conditions of use, serious adverse events are exceedingly rare.”
    
            Prelogar said that if the lower court decision is allowed to take effect it would “up-end the regulatory regime for mifepristone, with damaging consequences for women seeking lawful abortions and a healthcare system that relies on the availability of the drug under the current conditions of use.”
    
            She said the “unprecedented decision” would also “threaten to severely disrupt the pharmaceutical industry and prevent FDA from fulfilling its statutory responsibilities according to its scientific judgment.”
    
            Jessica L. Ellsworth, a lawyer for Danco laboratories, a manufacturer of the drug and an intervenor in the case told the justices in court papers that “for the women and teenage girls, health care providers and States that depend on FDA’s actions to ensure safe and effective reproductive health care is available, this case matters tremendously.”
    
            She said the court should take up the dispute because it “affects the availability of a drug with lawful uses in States across the country” and “raises questions about whether a single federal court can limit abortion access in the States that protect it.” 
    
            A decision by the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals last month “destabilizes” the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries “by questioning when scientific studies – accepted by FDA – are sufficient to support conditions of use,” Ellsworth added.
    
            The case is the most important abortion related dispute to come before the justices since the landmark decision in 2022 that overturned Roe v. Wade and triggered conservative states across the country to either ban or severely restrict the procedure. The new case could make it harder for women to access abortion even in states that still allow it. 
    
            Central to the dispute is the scope of the Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate mifepristone, a drug that the medical community has deemed safe and effective. It has been used by millions of women across the country in the more than two decades its been on the market.
    
            Last month, a three judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected a claim that the drug should be taken off the market, deciding that a challenge to the FDA’s initial approval in 2000 is barred by the statute of limitations. But the court’s ruling would still make it more difficult to access the drug, holding that changes the FDA undertook in 2016 and 2021 that expanded access to the pills were arbitrary and capricious in violation of federal law.
    
            If the appeals court decision is ultimately allowed to stand, the window to obtain mifepristone will narrow to 7 weeks from 10 weeks – although some prescribers might prescribe off-label beyond 7 weeks. Dosages will change from 200mg to 600mg which the FDA says is higher than necessary. 
    
            It would not be available by mail, and the administration of the mifepristone will have to be done by a doctor instead of others authorized to prescribe drugs under state law, including a midwife, physician assistant or nurse practitioner.
    
            The legal controversy began when a group representing doctors who oppose abortion filed suit arguing that the FDA had not done enough to ensure the safety of the drug some two decades earlier. 
    
            Last year, US District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, issued a broad ruling blocking approval of the drug as well as the changes the FDA made in subsequent years to make the drug more accessible. In a preliminary ruling, the federal appeals court scaled back on the district court ruling but said the drug could be restricted while the appeal process played out. At that juncture in the case, supporters of the drug asked the Supreme Court to freeze the order while the appeals process played out.
    
            The justices agreed to do so, protecting access to the drug as the case went back to the appeals court.
    
            After last month’s ruling, the Biden administration and the manufacturer had several weeks to file their appeal under normal procedures, but chose to file early perhaps to ensure that the justices had the time to add the issue to their calendar this term, meaning a likely ruling in 2024.
    
            In its most recent decision the appeals court endorsed most of the procedural arguments that the challengers made for why it was appropriate for a court to intervene. The opinion also embraced claims about mifepristone’s risks, put forward by anti-abortion doctors challenging the FDA approval, even though those characterizations had been widely rebuked by mainstream medical groups.
    
            In concluding that FDA’s moves to relax the pills’ regulations should be reversed, the court wrote, “the public interest is disserved by a drug that does not afford adequate protections to its users.”
    
            “To be clear, the evidence does not show that mifepristone is unsafe in all applications,” the appeals court said. “But on this record and at this preliminary stage, the Medical Organizations and Doctors have made a substantial showing that the 2016 Amendments and 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision were taken without sufficient consideration of the effects those changes would have on patients.”

      What is mifepristone?
    ","
			By Jen Christensen, CNN

        10:36 AM EDT, Thu June 13, 2024
    ","
            Mifepristone can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor after the US Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit that challenged regulation of the abortion pill.
    
            Mifepristone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration decades ago and has been shown to be safe and effective.
    
            Anti-abortion advocates have claimed that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn’t study it enough to approve it. A lawsuit was brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations alleged that the FDA violated the law in how it regulated mifepristone. If a 5th Circuit ruling had been upheld, it could have ended availability of mifepristone for medication abortion via telehealth, which would have affected abortion access — even in states where it’s legal.
    
            The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. The court’s reasoning could still allow other mifepristone challenges in the future.
    
            Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery.
    
            Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it’s sometimes known as RU-486.
    
            Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus.
    
            Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents.
    
            Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions.
    
            The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period.
    
            This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show.
    
            Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country’s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, that signed an amicus brief in the Texas case.
    
            This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries.
    
            Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the FDA. That means the death rate is 0.0005%.
    
            Mifepristone’s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show.
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra – used to treat erectile dysfunction – is nearly 10 times higher.
    
            Mifepristone usually doesn’t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones.
    
            Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA.
    
            Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are “exceedingly rare,” happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations’ amicus brief.
    
            The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US.
    
            Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, shows that this option has become steadily more common over the two decades it’s been available, rising from less than 10% of all abortions in the US in 2001 to 53% in 2020 and 63% in 2023.
    
            No matter the status of mifepristone, misoprostol would still be available and could be used for a medication abortion on its own.
    
            The only use of misoprostol that’s approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it “off-label” by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor.
    
            Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a “reasonable” option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective.
    
            This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization.
    
            People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, previously told CNN.
    
            “Misoprostol still works very well and is very safe,” Wong said. “Mifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.”

      Biden campaign spotlights abortion as it looks to find its 2024 footing
    ","

    ","
            President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign is making a new digital ad buy highlighting former President Donald Trump and other Republican presidential candidates’ hardline abortion stances, according to a Biden campaign aide, as the campaign looks to find its footing in the 2024 race. 
    
            The latest push to spotlight Republican efforts to restrict abortion nationwide comes amid bad poll numbers for the president. A CNN poll released Thursday showed Biden has broadly negative job ratings overall and there are widespread concerns about his age and decreased confidence among Democratic-aligned voters.  
    
            The abortion-focused ad targeted towards women will run in Florida starting Friday, the same day the state’s Supreme Court is set to consider a challenge to the state’s 15-week abortion ban. It highlights Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signing of one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans, which makes most abortions in the state illegal after six weeks. The six-week ban would go into effect if the 15-week ban is upheld by the high court. 
    
            The ad will also run in two other states that have some of the nation’s most strict abortion restrictions – South Dakota and Iowa, where Trump is scheduled to hold campaign events on Friday and Saturday. The ad, which will run on YouTube and Connected TV, highlights Trump touting his appointment of three US Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, as he regularly does on the campaign trail. It also takes aim at South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who has criticized some of his GOP rivals for not endorsing a 15-week abortion ban.
    
            The digital ad buy is part of a larger 16-week, $25 million campaign. 
    
            The Biden campaign continues to signal protecting abortion access will be a key part of its reelection pitch to voters as Republicans struggle to navigate appealing to a base pushing to restrict abortion access in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade without alienating more moderate voters. 
    
            “As Donald Trump visits states where women are suffering the consequences of his extreme, anti-abortion agenda, this ad reminds voters in states that have passed some of the most extreme abortion bans of Trump’s key role in appointing conservative justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade,” Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a statement to CNN. 
    
            Outside of touting his role in overturning Roe, Trump largely steers clear of abortion on the campaign trail and has privately blamed abortion hard-liners for the party’s lackluster 2022 midterm results. Failed Republican gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon said recently that Trump advised her during her campaign to “talk differently about abortion,” as she took a hardline approach on the issue and said she opposed exceptions for rape or incest during her bid to unseat Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last year. Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. 
    
            Trump and DeSantis both routinely dodge questions from reporters on the campaign trail about whether they would sign a national abortion ban and at how many weeks into a pregnancy they would support such federal legislation. Trump has said he believes the federal government should play a role in restricting abortion but has not specified what kind of federal legislation he would push for or support if he were to be reelected next year. Trump also rankled some anti-abortion activists when he described the six-week Florida ban that DeSantis signed into law as “too harsh.”

      Abortions have increased significantly in states that border those with bans, new analysis finds
    ","

    ","
            Abortions have increased substantially in most states where they remain legal post-Dobbs, according to a new analysis. The increases have been particularly significant in states bordering others with bans, suggesting widespread travel for care.
    
            The Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, launched a new dashboard Thursday that estimates the number of abortions provided in the United States each month. The estimates are based on a regular survey of a core set of providers and broadened to the state level using a model that also factors in historical trends. The latest findings compare the number of abortions provided in the first half of 2023 to a comparable period in 2020.
    
            New Mexico and Wyoming had the largest increase in abortions, with more than three times as many provided in the first half of 2023 compared with 2020. The number of abortions also more than doubled in Kansas and South Carolina in that time.
    
            Overall, the data suggests that there were thousands more abortions in the states where the procedure remained legal in the first half of 2023 than there were nationwide during six months of 2020 — up from about 465,000 to nearly 511,000.
    
            However, the new data is based on a model with a broader margin of error than counts from earlier years, making national estimates less certain. Estimates from the Guttmacher Institute represent abortions provided within formal health care settings, including in-person clinics and telehealth. Estimates do not include data on self-managed abortions, such medication abortion provided by AidAccess.
    
            Caitlin Myers, a professor of economics at Middlebury College, told CNN that she was not particularly surprised by the increase in abortions.
    
            People seeking abortions are “pouring out” of states with restrictions, said Myers, who has researched abortion trends but was not involved in the new analysis. And “there are states where abortion access has actually expanded in the wake of Dobbs as people, in particular, have become more aware of and available to access telehealth.”
    
            “What we know is that many people are managing to get out of ban states, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy,” she said. “We are seeing an increase in abortions, but we expect they would have increased even more if it weren’t for the fact that these bans are trapping some populations, particularly poor populations, in banned states.”
    
            However, not all of the increases can be directly attributed to changes that resulted from the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision last year, said lsaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist with the Guttmacher Institute and lead for the new project. The Covid-19 pandemic may have affected individual attitudes toward pregnancy, and expanded access to medication abortion through telehealth could have affected trends, among other factors.
    
            “The need for abortion does not change because legality has shifted,” said Dr. Jamila Perritt, an ob/gyn and president and CEO of the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health.
    
            “When we talk about these abortion numbers, it can’t be in a vacuum,” said Perritt, who was not involved in the new analysis. “It has to be across this larger arc of understanding the implications of restricting reproductive health care and access to that care for the last several decades.”
    
            Decisions about carrying a pregnancy to term have always been shaped by the resources that are available, she said. Access to family planning resources can play a role, as well as the economy.
    
            “As resources in our communities continue to be diminished and undermined, then carrying a child to term is not is not something that folks can do and are willing to do,” Perritt said.
    
            Earlier data from the Guttmacher Institute shows that abortions had already been on the rise between 2017 and 2020.
    
            However, many states that protected abortion access saw much larger increases in abortions between 2020 and 2023 than they did between 2017 and 2020.
    
            In Illinois, for example, the number of abortions jumped 69% between 2020 and 2023, compared with a 25% increase between 2017 and 2020. Similarly, in South Carolina, abortions increased 124% since 2020, compared with a 4% increase between 2017 and 2020.
    
            As monthly updates continue, estimates may reflect the impact of additional restrictions that been put in place since June, such as the six-week ban that was upheld by the South Carolina Supreme Court in August.
    
            An earlier analysis sponsored by The Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit focused on abortion and contraception, found that there were 25,000 fewer abortions in the US in the nine months after the Dobbs decision.
    
            Tracking abortion trends is difficult, Perritt said, and many unknown factors make it hard to predict what the rest of the year will bring.
    
            “We’re going to continue to see the impact of this policy decision forcing people from their communities to seek abortion care whatever way they can, whether it’s self managing or clinic-based care in neighboring states,” she said.

      Mexico’s Supreme Court decriminalizes abortion

            Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled to federally decriminalize abortion on Wednesday, finding that the current ban on the procedure is unconstitutional.
    
            “The First Chamber of the Court ruled that the legal system that penalizes abortion in the Federal Criminal Code is unconstitutional, since it violates the human rights of women and people with the capacity to gestate,” the Supreme Court said on social media.
    
            Abortion has already been decriminalized in 12 states in Mexico. The most recent ruling, which took place in the central state of Aguascalientes just days ago, was lauded online, Reuters reported, with rights activists posting green hearts on social media. 
    
            The hearts represent the so-called Green Wave, the social movement for reproductive rights that has swept Latin America since the start of this century.
    
            Mexico’s Supreme Court first said that it was unconstitutional to criminalize abortion in 2021, ruling against a law in the state of Coahuila, which threatened women who undergo abortions with up to three years prison and a fine. 
    
            The country has become an unexpected haven for US residents after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
    
            Verónica Cruz, an abortion rights activists, told CNN in 2022 that she was surprised to find Mexico “going forward, and the US is going backward.”

            Jozef and Wiktoria Ulma and their family were murdered by the Nazis in March 1944 for sheltering a Jewish family. 
    
            Pope Francis is not expected to attend the ceremony, which will put the family one step closer to sainthood, according to the Vatican’s saint-making arm, the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints. 
    
            In a statement to the press issued Tuesday, the dicastery said Wiktoria Ulma gave birth at the moment she was killed. 
    
            “At the time of the massacre, Signora Wiktoria Ulma was in an advanced state of pregnancy with her seventh child,” the statement from the dicastery said. 
    
            “This son was born at the moment of his mother’s martyrdom, therefore, was added in the number of children, also martyrs,” it added. The statement went on to say, “In fact, in the martyrdom of his parents he received the baptism of blood.”  
    
            The Ulmas’ other children ranged in age from 18 months to 7 years old, according to the Vatican.  
    
            The Ulma family were killed for sheltering a Jewish family for 18 months, according to the supporting documents accompanying the beatification, which is the final step before sainthood. The Jewish family were also murdered.
    
            This will be the first time an entire family has been elevated toward sainthood, according to the Vatican’s media office. 
    
            It was reported earlier that the seventh child was considered “unborn” and thus the beatification would be the first time an unborn child had been beatified. 
    
            But the Vatican clarified on Tuesday that, in fact, the child was born “at the moment” of his mother’s murder, and, as such, is included in the number of living children.  
    
            The family’s bodies were exhumed for the ceremony and will reburied after their beatification.

      Linda Evangelista reveals long, private battle with breast cancer

    ","
            Linda Evangelista has revealed that she’s been secretly treated for breast cancer over the past year — and that it’s the second time she’s been diagnosed with the illness.
    
            The supermodel told the Wall Street Journal that she first underwent a bilateral mastectomy after an annual mammogram detected the cancer in December 2018. She thought she “was good and set for life,” she explained, but last July she discovered a new lump on her chest. Now, she says, her prognosis is “good” having undergone more surgery, chemo and radiation.
    
            “Only a handful of people knew. And I’m just not one of those people who has to share everything,” Evangelista told WSJ. “I thought to myself, I will share this one day but while I am going through it, absolutely not. I don’t want the ‘Daily Mail’ waiting outside my door like they do every time something happens.”
    
            Evangelista’s disclosure is part of a long, personal interview with the publication ahead of the release of a new book about her career-long professional relationship with photographer Steven Meisel.
    
            For the magazine’s digital cover of the Men’s Style fall issue, Evangelista poses for a romantic set of black-and-white images, lensed by Meisel, showing her in bed. Her hair, she told WSJ, is “all new” after chemo. “It came back very dark. It’s even curlier than it used to be.”
    
            Over the past year, Evangelista has made a comeback in fashion — including a vibrant British Vogue cover by Meisel last August — after a period of reclusion. In 2021, she revealed that she was separately dealing with paradoxical adipose hyperplasia (PAH), a rare side effect of the body-contouring procedure CoolSculpting, which she said left her “brutally disfigured” from the swelling and thickening of fatty tissue.
    
            “I took a drink of the magic potion,” she told WSJ, referring to the 1992 film “Death Becomes Her,” in which a youth-granting potion grants immortality to two women in a love triangle — but with macabre side effects.
    
            Last July, Evangelista announced she had settled a $50 million suit against the firm Zeltiq Aesthetics over the cosmetic procedure gone wrong, but did not reveal the terms of the agreement.
    
            The model has since booked several high-profile gigs, including a recent Vogue cover alongside Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Cindy Crawford (all of whom will star in a forthcoming four-part Apple TV+ series “The Super Models”) and a spot closing out Fendi’s runway show last September in a surprise return to the runway.
    
            Amid all of her health troubles, she’s had to shake off the renewed scrutiny of the Internet and tabloids. The voluminous gown she wore during the Fendi show drew snarky responses, she recalled.
    
            The comments asked, “‘What’s she hiding under that dress?’” she recalled. “If they only knew — my (post-surgical) drainage tubes had just been pulled,” she said.
    
            On her cancer prognosis being “good” but not “great” moving forward, she added: “I know I have one foot in the grave, but I’m totally in celebration mode.”

      Rep. Nancy Mace says Republicans in swing districts are ‘walking the plank’ because of abortion restrictions

    ","
            GOP Rep. Nancy Mace has a warning for her party about some efforts to restrict abortion without exceptions – and how it could affect moderate House Republicans on whom their narrow majority depends.
    
            “I think they’re walking the plank,” the South Carolina Republican told CNN’s Dana Bash in an interview that aired Sunday, when asked if members in moderate districts like hers are doomed.
    
            “I’m pro-life. I have a fantastic pro-life voting record, but I also understand that we cannot be a**holes to women,” said Mace, who has been vocal about including exceptions for rape in measures to restrict the procedure.
    
            The two-term congresswoman went public about her own experience of rape during an abortion debate in the South Carolina state house before coming to Congress. “Being the victim of rape, you don’t ever get over it,” she told Bash, noting how the experience has affected her and her outspoken advocacy for exceptions.
    
            “As a Republican woman in 2023, this is a very lonely place to be,” said Mace, who was first elected to her coastal South Carolina congressional district in 2020. “Because I feel like I’m the only woman on our side of the aisle advocating for things that all women should care about.”
    
            Still, Mace has faced criticism for voting the party line, even on measures where abortion rights are at stake.
    
            “I think I get labeled a flip-flopper unfairly because of that,” Mace said. “I have my own ideology that I believe in. I’ll take the vote. That doesn’t mean I want to take the vote.”
    
            She argues she has tried to secure changes to measures she may not fully agree with. “I have been very effective at trying to push the ball – not always – but doing the best that I can. I’m only one person, and a lot of times I’m doing it alone and by myself.”
    
            In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last year, Mace – the first woman to graduate from the Citadel’s Corps of Cadets – has often said she’s looking for ways to show that the GOP is “pro-women.” In her interview with Bash, she called on lawmakers to address the foster care and child care systems, for example, arguing that having an abortion is a decision no woman wants to make.
    
            In April, the congresswoman urged the Food and Drug Administration to ignore a ruling by a federal judge that suspended the approval of a medication drug used for abortion. (The Supreme Court subsequently said that the drug and regulations that make it accessible would remain in place for the time being.)
    
            “This is an issue that Republicans have been largely on the wrong side of,” Mace told CNN at the time.

      Someone you love attempted suicide. Where do you go from here?

            What if talking about it brings it back up? What if I get uncomfortable and say the wrong thing? What does this mean about me? What if it happens again?
    
            It can be difficult to know how to move forward when someone we love attempts suicide.
    
            The problem is when fear leads loved ones to avoid a survivor of a suicide attempt, said Dr. Christine Yu Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Learning what you can do to provide a support system can help.
    
            “At its core, a suicide attempt is a life-threatening health crisis, and gestures of support that you would use for other types of health crises can be appropriate here too,” Moutier said in an email.
    
            Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with nearly 50,000 deaths in 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            The rate of attempts is many times higher, said Dr. Ken Duckworth, chief medical officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
    
            In the wake of an attempt, it is particularly important that a person get support, Moutier said.
    
            “The first six months after an attempt or hospitalization are especially critical to a person’s recovery, and the risk for suicide remains elevated for the entire first year,” she added.
    
            It may feel like an impossible situation, but there are resources and support available, Moutier said.
    
            “During their mental health crisis, (a survivor) may have perceived themselves as being completely alone, or a burden on those who love them, so one of the most powerful gestures at this time is your ongoing presence and support,” she said.
    
            A survivor once told Duckworth that she felt like an “emotional burn victim” and every part of her was tender and exposed.
    
            “What do you do with that person? You want them to feel better, but it’s going to be very difficult,” he said.
    
            One thing that makes the aftermath particularly hard is the feeling of shame that often accompanies surviving a suicide attempt, Duckworth said.
    
            “If you’ve ever felt shame, you know how tender your emotions are,” he added.
    
            That is why it is important to approach conversations around suicide without judgment, said Dr. Anita Everett, director of the Center for Mental Health Services for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. For example, Instead of chastising loved ones for missing therapy, ask if they need help with transportation.
    
            And if you have a stigma about suicide, investigate that feeling and find a way to resolve it, she added.
    
            Even without any stigma, there might be strong feelings around a suicide attempt such as anger, fear, sadness or confusion, Duckworth said.
    
            While feeling those things are natural, try to avoid going to a survivor with questions such as “Didn’t you love me enough?” or “Aren’t I good enough to stick around for?” he said.
    
            “It’s not a commentary on the strength of your relationship,” Duckworth said. Rather, try to “stay grounded, not get into advice and not be hurt.”
    
            Afraid that you will sweep the conversations under the rug? Or that you will talk about it too much? It can be helpful to have direct conversations with the survivor about how to move forward and follow that person’s lead, Everett said.
    
            “Open the door to talk about what happened but don’t push them through it,” she added. “Don’t force them to talk about it unless and until the person who’s thought about suicide is ready to think about it.”
    
            When it is time to start talking, you and the survivor can set expectations together — either one-on-one or with a therapist, Duckworth said.
    
            Questions that can help include: How would you like me to approach this? What’s the best way I can be helpful? Do you want me to identify when you look like you are struggling?
    
            The person may not know the answers right away, but it is important to communicate that you trust that person to take charge of healing and that you are there to provide support, Duckworth said.
    
            “Do exactly what he or she wants,” he said. “Bring me Band-Aids, bring me Vaseline. Don’t talk about it. Stay away from me for three days.”
    
            It might be hard to give this person space when you feel so uncertain and anxious about the future, he acknowledged.
    
            “The idea is these are people who feel somewhat helpless,” Duckworth said. “You have to remind them that you want to support them in the way they want to be supported.”
    
            As important as it is to keep the dialogue open, it is also key not to let suicide be the only thing you discuss.
    
            “Make sure that simple healthy activities, such as going on walks, playing games, watching television together or partaking in any shared hobby, are part of the routine,” Moutier said.
    
            She recommends resources such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention’s #RealConvo guide or its Talk Away the Dark campaign if you want more specific guidelines to these conversations.
    
            Of course, in hard times, people usually want to be helpful, Everett said.
    
            And while you shouldn’t just jump to solutions, there are ways to “be in there with the person opening up opportunities for them,” she added.
    
            Duckworth recommended taking steps to help expand the survivor’s view of available resources.
    
            For example, 988 has shown to be a helpful resource as an emergency hotline for people with suicidal thoughts, he said. Support groups may be available to allow a person to talk about experiences with those who share similar ones.
    
            Therapy, particularly dialectical behavioral therapy, a kind of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on acceptance of experiences, has been shown to reduce the risk of suicide, Duckworth said. With the survivor’s permission, you can offer to engage in any part of a treatment plan that would be helpful, he said.
    
            There are medications and other treatments that may help as well, he said.
    
            You can also help with a suicide safety plan, Everett said. It is usually a one-page document that people can go over with therapists or family members to list what they can do and what resources they can reach out for when suicidal thoughts come up, she added.
    
            “What I love about it is it does have a pretty good evidence base behind it, and it also starts with a one-pager so it’s simple for families to fill out,” she added.
    
            As much as you may want to be there to support the survivor of a suicide attempt, that person is not the only one who needs care, Moutier said.
    
            “When someone you love attempts suicide, it may feel as though you have also experienced a trauma,” she added. “It is imperative that you take care of yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually, and seek support in taking those steps if you need it.”
    
            You may feel angry or sad — or even surprised at the depth of your loved one’s struggles, Everett said.
    
            And even though you may feel like it, the attempt is not a failure of your love and support, Duckworth said.
    
            If the anger or fear of another attempt is overwhelming, know that loved ones can also use 988 for support. And the National Alliance on Mental Illness offers Family to Family education courses, he said.
    
            But first and foremost, it is important to know you are not alone, Moutier said.
    
            “Remember, you may not be the best person (and don’t need to be) for every single part of their recovery. Lean on others who have a positive impact on their mental health,” she said. “No matter how you process these complex emotions, you should not have to cope alone so be open to letting others help you navigate this experience.”

      Here’s what happens when a parking garage becomes a delivery room
    ","

    ","
            When Dr. Janelle Cooper, an OB/GYN, pulled into the parking garage of the hospital where she works in Annapolis, Maryland, and walked toward the building, she saw a man running and thought, “Oh, that’s unusual.”
    
            She noticed “a truck that was parked in the middle of the street, and the doors were flung open,” Cooper told CNN.
    
            And then, she heard a cry from the backseat that pieced everything together.
    
            “I’d know those screams anywhere,” Cooper said.
    
            The running man was the grandfather of Elsa Antunez. He had rushed her to the Luminis Health Anne Arundel Medical Center.
    
            He stopped the truck in the parking garage by an entrance which would have put Artunez only a few feet from the front desk, where she would have been transported by a wheelchair to the delivery unit.
    
            But by the time the car was in park, it was too late. The baby was coming.
    
            When Cooper reached the truck, the baby’s head was already out. 
    
            “My instinct took over and I just jumped into action and delivered the baby,” Copper said.
    
            Jean Andres, the hospital’s labor and delivery director, arrived at work a few moments later.
    
            Andres heard the “very distinct scream” delivery room teams recognize instantly.
    
            “I put my lunch bag down, called the team to let them know we had a delivery in the garage,” Andres told CNN. “And I proceeded to assist Dr. Cooper with the delivery that she had performed.”
    
            Artunez gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Yesenia Patricia, and surprisingly for a first-time mother, the doctor noted, it went quickly. “She did really well.”
    
            Once Yesenia was born, Andres dried her off and kept her warm until the medical team came and took the family to a maternity room in the hospital.
    
            “The fact that it was in a garage was very unconventional, but it was not chaotic,” Andres said. “It was actually a very beautiful birth,” she recalled.
    
            And although Cooper has delivered thousands of babies, she said this time was different.
    
            “I’ve delivered in different places around the hospital before, but never in the back of a pickup truck,” she said.
    
            Baby Yesenia isn’t the first to be born in the medical center’s parking garage, Andres and Cooper noted, nonplussed.
    
            “We delivered a baby in the elevator this week,” Cooper told CNN.

      Ohio police release video of fatal police shooting of pregnant 21-year-old Ta’Kiya Young

            Newly released police body camera footage shows an officer firing through the windshield of a pregnant woman’s car after she was accused of shoplifting at a grocery store in a Columbus, Ohio, suburb last week. 
    
            The woman, 21-year-old Ta’kiya Young – whose death her family called a “criminal act” and “gross misuse of power and authority” after seeing the footage – was later pronounced dead at a hospital.
    
            The video shows a Blendon Township police officer approaching Young’s driver’s side window outside a Kroger in Westerville and repeatedly telling her to get out of the car.
    
            A second officer, who is also wearing a body camera, then steps in front of the sedan.
    
            “They said you stole something….get out of the car,” the officer at the window says, telling Young not to leave.
    
            “I didn’t steal sh*t,” Young can be heard saying as the two argue back and forth with her window slightly ajar.
    
            Police previously said a grocery store employee had notified officers that a woman who had stolen bottles of alcohol was in a car parked outside the store.
    
            “Get out of the f**king car,” the officer standing in front of the car says, his gun drawn and his left hand braced on the hood of the car, the video shows.
    
            At one point, Young is heard saying, “You gonna shoot me?”
    
            Young can then be seen turning the wheel of the car as the officer next to her window continues to urge her to exit the vehicle.
    
            “Get out of the f**king car,” the officer in front of the car repeats as the vehicle begins to move slowly forward, the video shows.
    
            A few seconds elapse and then the officer standing in front of the hood fires through the windshield.
    
            After the shot, the officers run alongside the car yelling at the driver to stop.
    
            The car rolls onto a sidewalk between two brick columns and into a building.
    
            Officers call for backup and break the window to reach the driver, who appears to be slumped over to one side.
    
            Brian Steel, executive vice president of the Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge #9, said, “A weapon is not just a firearm. A weapon is also a 2000-pound vehicle that somebody puts in gear and is driving at you.”
    
            “I understand why it could be justified but, again, I don’t make that decision,” Steel told reporters Friday, referring to the shooting. He said he assumed the officer believed he could not get out of the way of the vehicle quickly enough. 
    
            The body camera footage released by the Blendon Township Police Department blurred the faces of the officers. The footage is edited and spliced together.
    
            Young was pregnant at the time of her death and the fetus did not survive, the Franklin County Coroner’s Office previously said. Young’s cause of death is pending.
    
            Police say the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is conducting an independent investigation of the shooting.
    
            The BCI probe could take “several weeks or months,” according to Steve Irwin, the press secretary for the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, which includes BCI. Once completed, the investigative findings will be forwarded to the county prosecutor who will make a decision on pursuing any potential charges, he said.
    
            Young’s family and their attorney, in a statement released after viewing the video on Friday, said the footage showed it was “undeniable that Ta’Kiya’s death was not only avoidable, but also a gross misuse of power and authority.”
    
            “After seeing the video footage of her death, this is clearly a criminal act and the family demands a swift indictment of this officer for the killings of both Ta’Kiyah and her unborn daughter,” the statement said.
    
            Police say the officers haven’t “waived their rights as victims” in this incident and are withholding their identities.
    
            “When Ms. Young drove her car directly at Officer #1, striking him, Officer #1 became a victim of attempted vehicular assault,” police said in a news release.
    
            “When Ms. Young pulled away from Officer #2 while his hand and part of his arm was still in the driver’s side window, Officer #2 became a victim of misdemeanor assault,” according to the police. 
    
            Authorities said the officers quickly helped Young after the shooting, adding EMS was called 10 seconds after she was taken out of the car. The officer who fired the shot also grabbed a trauma kit and applied a chest seal to her wound in under two minutes after she was removed from the vehicle.
    
            The officer who fired his weapon is still on administrative leave, but the second officer is back at work. Chief John Belford said, after reviewing the videos, he didn’t see a reason to keep the second officer on leave. 
    
            “I returned him to duty, as our staffing is already very limited,” he said, noting both officers would still be subject to a “full administrative review” after the BCI investigation. 
    
            “Last week, there was a tragedy in our community,” Belford said in a statement. Due to potential litigation, he said, the department is “very limited in what we can say.” 
    
            “We’re being as transparent and forthcoming as we can, given these significant legal constraints.” He cited an ongoing BCI investigation and potential “personnel actions” regarding the officer who opened fire.  
    
            The Blendon Township Police Department’s use of force policy says that when it’s “feasible,” officers should take “reasonable steps” to get out of the way of an approaching vehicle instead of firing a weapon.
    
            “An officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others,” the policy states.
    
            Young’s family, in the statement, said: “Ta’Kiya was a beacon of love, strength, and energy to all who knew her. Her tragic passing has left a void that words can’t describe, especially for her two young sons, who must now grow up without the love and guidance of their mother, and while coming to understand the circumstances that led to her homicide.”
    
            The statement said the shooting “is yet another painful reminder of the urgent need for a thorough re-examination of police training, policies, and procedures.”

            Failed Republican gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon said former President Donald Trump advised her to “talk differently about abortion,” as she took a hardline approach on the issue during her bid to unseat Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last year.
    
            Speaking with Trump on her podcast episode that aired Wednesday, Dixon said: “I’ll tell my viewers that you came to me and you said, ‘You gotta talk differently about abortion.’ And we could not pivot, we could not pivot in time and it really, you were absolutely right, sir.” 
    
            Dixon, a conservative commentator, said to to the former president, “I hope that you are able to navigate that, that issue in ’24 and that we can win those women back because they are already putting out attack ads, and it is not a fair issue for them to attack on.”
    
            Trump said in response that what happened to Dixon “happened to a lot of other people” but “didn’t happen to me because, you know, there’s a way of talking about it.”
    
            Dixon was one of many Republicans who struggled in the midterm elections to navigate the fraught politics of abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Dixon took a hardline approach on the issue and said during her campaign she opposed exceptions for rape or incest.
    
            She ultimately lost to Whitmer, a staunch advocate for abortion rights, by more than 10 points.
    
            Trump, meanwhile, has said he supports exceptions to abortion restrictions for rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. “They’re the radicals, we’re not the radicals, they’re the radicals and you have to explain it,” Trump said of Democrats. “And I think exceptions are very important, I think you need the exceptions, you and I talked about that.”
    
            The former president has privately blamed anti-abortion hard-liners for the party’s lackluster 2022 midterm results and has largely steered clear of the issue on the campaign trail. He has said he believes the federal government should play a role in restricting abortion but has not specified what kind of federal legislation he would push for or support if he were to be reelected next year. 
    
            Trump has specifically described the six-week abortion ban signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a rival for the Republican presidential nomination, as “too harsh,” even as he frequently touts his appointment of three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.

      Alabama attorney general says he has right to prosecute people who facilitate travel for out-of-state abortions

    ","
            Alabama’s Republican attorney general said in a court filing that he has the right to prosecute people who make travel arrangements for pregnant women to have out-of-state abortions. 
    
            In a court filing Monday, attorneys for Attorney General Steve Marshall wrote that providing transportation for women in Alabama to leave the state to get an abortion could amount to a “criminal conspiracy.”
    
            The court filing comes in response to lawsuits against Marshall that was filed in July from two women’s health centers and Yellowhammer Fund, an organization which says it provides “financial and practical support for those who are pregnant and require assistance.” The plaintiffs argue that Marshall violated their constitutional rights by publicly stating that organizations which help pregnant women in Alabama get an abortion out of state could be criminally investigated. 
    
            “Alabama can no more regulate out-of-state abortions than another state can deem its laws legalizing abortions to apply to Alabama,” the Yellowhammer Fund lawsuit argues.
    
            Marshall is now asking Judge Myron Thompson to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that helping a woman avoid Alabama’s restrictions by facilitating an abortion elsewhere is a conspiracy. 
    
            “The conspiracy is what is being punished, even if the final conduct never occurs,” Marshall’s filing states. “That conduct is Alabama-based and is within Alabama’s power to prohibit.”
    
            Alabama has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. In the wake of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision last summer, several Republican-led states passed strict anti-abortion laws, while several others, including Alabama, that had passed so-called trigger laws anticipating an eventual overturn of Roe v. Wade saw their new restrictions go into effect.
    
            The filing got the attention of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who wrote on X Wednesday, “California will NOT cooperate with any state that attempts to prosecute women or doctors for receiving or providing reproductive care.”
    
            Thompson has scheduled a hearing Tuesday to consider Marshall’s motion to dismiss the case.

      Opinion: Why I’m hoping ‘motherhood spectrum’ will be the new ‘sober curious’
    ","

            Editor’s note: Sara Stewart is a film and culture writer who lives in western Pennsylvania. The views expressed here are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
    
            Imagine, if you will, seeing this headline: “Jon Hamm is happy as a man without kids: ‘I’ve had a great sexy-ass life.’” 
    
            Sounds vaguely ridiculous, right? Aside from the fact that Hamm, 52, does seem to have a sexy-ass life, who cares if he has kids? (In a 2016 interview, the “Mad Men” star didn’t seem super into it, but who can say?)
    
            Male actors who choose childlessness almost never get breathless media attention. Patricia Clarkson, on the other hand, who is 63, was mentioned everywhere last week after she gave that exact quote to the “Table for Two With Bruce Bozzi” podcast.
    
            It’s a real marker of how far we haven’t come on the issue of chosen childlessness that an offhand comment from a woman in the public eye still gets so much notice. In an era that’s seen horrendous harm to reproductive rights in this country after the fall of Roe v. Wade last year, it’s unsurprising but still infuriating that a woman publicly saying she doesn’t want kids is a big deal.
    
            Clarkson’s certainly not the only celebrity to talk openly about choosing not to have kids. Other vocally child-free stars — Helen Mirren, Oprah Winfrey, Dolly Parton, Kim Cattrall and many more — have been saying this stuff on the record for decades. And like clockwork, their words nearly always end up in a headline.
    
            Chelsea Handler’s pitch-perfect sketch “A Day in the Life of a Childless Woman” evoked a predictable outcry from conservative male pundits this year. (One childless male star who has gotten attention is Seth Rogen, who told Howard Stern that “I don’t know anyone who gets as much happiness out of their kids as we get out of our non-kids.”)
    
            But something does feel a bit different at this particular moment. If there’s a glimmer of hope in the reaction to Clarkson’s comments, it’s that she’s comfortable saying she always knew she wanted a different path: “I made a big choice. But I knew it when I was young,” she told Bozzi. In another interview, she worded it differently: “I’ve never wanted to marry, I’ve never wanted children — I was born without that gene.”
    
            The idea that some women just don’t have a maternal instinct is gaining traction, especially as younger generations increasingly embrace childlessness. A recent book by British author Ruby Warrington, “Women Without Kids: The Revolutionary Rise of an Unsung Sisterhood,” explores this idea in detail.
    
            She asks: “What if, rather than motherhood being every woman’s natural, God-given role, some of us, regardless of our biology, are simply more suited to the role and the vocation of parenthood than others?” Instead, she argues for a “motherhood spectrum”; the spectrum theory “does away with the notion that not being a mother, or not naturally reveling in the role means that there is something wrong with us.”
    
            Warrington, who’s credited with coining the term “sober curious,” has come up with another that I’m hoping catches on: “areproductive,” used as a less-polarized word than “childless” or “child free” to describe women who simply never had the urge to have children.
    
            The reasons many women cite for not wanting kids are, to be sure, frequently circumstantial: a rapidly downward-spiraling climate, lack of a societal safety net for motherhood, the erosion of reproductive rights. But the majority of Generation Z and millennial respondents who are choosing not to have kids, according to a recent Pew Research Center Survey, report that they “just don’t want to.” That’s reflective of the seismic shift Warrington’s talking about. “What if not all of us are supposed to have kids,” she writes, “and what if this were considered the norm?”
    
            Still, it’s frustrating that even outspoken women such as Clarkson self-flagellate about motherhood, even as they extol the lives they’ve been able to live without being mothers: In her podcast interview, Clarkson also discusses thinking she wouldn’t be a good enough mother.
    
            “I grew up with great parents who sacrificed everything for me,” she said. “And you have to really be committed to having children. You have to be a great parent, and I was afraid I couldn’t be.” The whole enterprise of motherhood seems (to this childless woman, anyway) like it’s never been more stressful, and the idea that there is any way to be a perfect mother is, of course, impossible.
    
            The scale at which more women are opting out of motherhood has given rise to a heated global debate about declining birthrates. On the one hand are arguments about the catastrophic implications for the functioning of society under an aging population; on the other are theories that a shrinking number of humans will actually be good news for the badly damaged planet and even the economy. But so far, I have yet to see a compelling, widespread case being made for a massive overhaul of our treatment of mothers, and child care, as the means to convince skeptical women to sign on.
    
            On the contrary, the anti-choice stance seems to be that the way forward is just to force women into motherhood in a “Handmaid’s Tale”-adjacent way. Given the breathtaking speed with which conservatives are eroding women’s access to reproductive care and family planning, it doesn’t seem hyperbolic to say that the endgame is to compel every woman to be a mother if at all possible — no matter that, increasingly, it’s obvious that a certain percentage of them do not feel it’s right for them.
    
            Supposedly “pro-life” people rarely acknowledge the exhausting, often thankless lives of women who do choose to have children. As one child-free woman told HuffPost in 2021, “I think Americans need to get it through their heads how awful the safety net is here: bad health care, unsafe schools and streets, no child care, minimal parental leaves or sick leaves, nor job security.”
    
            The patriarchal fervor is blatantly at odds with societal trends and those declining birthrates, including the increasing prevalence of women saying they’re just not made for motherhood.That level of obliviousness is not new for conservatives — they’re regularly wildly out of touch with what the majority of Americans want, and that includes the right to an abortion — but there’s a tiny bit of hope that this will come back to bite them in the 2024 election. And that someday soon, it won’t even be news when a woman such as Clarkson shares the joy of non-motherhood.

      Abortion politics take center stage after Biden campaign capitalizes on GOP debate rift
    ","
			By Arit John, CNN

    ","
            More than a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republican candidates remain split over how to move forward on abortion, a political liability Democrats are eager to exploit regardless of who becomes the Republican nominee. 
    
            The GOP divide was laid bare on the debate stage this week, as candidates backed a 15-week abortion ban, deferred to the states or tried to split the difference. President Joe Biden’s campaign responded immediately in a new digital ad, painting the field’s top contenders as extreme on the issue – and signaling what the Democratic campaign is likely to focus on in the coming year.
    
            When it comes to the future of abortion access, Republican candidates are facing pressure on all sides. 
    
            GOP-led state legislatures have passed a wave of complete or near-total abortion bans that go beyond what most Americans support. Voters have supported abortion rights ballot initiatives and candidates in several key elections over the last year. And anti-abortion and evangelical groups are demanding presidential candidates go on the offensive and get as specific as possible. 
    
            “The debate reflected the many different views among Republicans regarding abortion policy: not only what the policy ought to be, but what level of government ought to be making the decisions,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. “There’s no real consensus at this point.”
    
            Biden’s reelection campaign has also homed in on remarks GOP candidates made on abortion during the debate. In talking points sent out to surrogates Wednesday night, the campaign claimed Republicans “spent two hours shouting over each other on … who has the best plan to ban abortion nationwide,” CNN reported Thursday. 
    
            Biden’s team followed up Friday morning with a digital ad, “These Guys,” highlighting comments former President Donald Trump, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have made on abortion, including a clip of DeSantis on the debate stage. The ad, aimed at women in seven battleground states, is part of a $25 million ad campaign CNN first reported earlier this week. 
    
            The ad also reaffirms Biden’s stance on abortion: that the U.S. should maintain the standard set in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which allowed for abortion up until fetal viability, generally viewed as around 24 weeks. 
    
            “This ad is the first of many that will hold all MAGA Republicans accountable for their extreme, losing positions throughout the cycle, while also highlighting the President’s support for women and their fundamental freedoms,” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. 
    
            Polling suggests that Americans support some legal abortion, but with limits. Seventy-three percent of respondents to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released last month said abortion should be allowed during the first six weeks of pregnancy, including 88% of Democrats and 56% of Republicans surveyed. Asked if states should allow abortion at 15 weeks, 51% of those surveyed said yes, including 75% of Democrats and 29% of Republicans. 
    
            Only 27% of those surveyed supported allowing abortion until 24 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            Democrats are hoping that abortion access will continue to be an issue that helps them with voters heading into 2024. Since last year’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturned Roe and left abortion access up to individual states, Democrats and abortion rights activists have racked up a number of wins in special elections and ballot initiatives, and the party overperformed in the 2022 midterm elections. 
    
            Trump – whose handpicked nominees lost key Senate races in Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia – went on to write a January social media post blaming the party’s midterm losses on “the ‘abortion issue,’ poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that insisted on No Exceptions.”
    
            Tom Bonier, chief executive of TargetSmart, a Democratic political targeting firm, said he expects abortion will be an even stronger issue for his party heading into the 2024 election. 
    
            “The evidence that we’re seeing at this point is that abortion rights as a political issue is having an even greater impact than it did last year, which is saying a lot because it had a huge impact on elections in 2022,” he said. 
    
            Bonier cited two causes for abortion’s growing influence. Voters, he said, no longer have to imagine what life would look like after Roe. They’re experiencing it firsthand. At the same time, Republicans have not adopted their message to address the political climate, he said. That dynamic was on display in the ad released by the Biden campaign Friday. 
    
            “It literally speaks for itself as an issue at this point, that Republicans have not moderated, that in some ways they’ve actually got further to the right,” he said. 
    
            Nearly two dozen states have moved to ban or restrict abortion in the wake of Dobbs. Some of the bans have been blocked in court, including the six-week limit DeSantis signed in April. Abortion is currently legal in Florida until 15 weeks of pregnancy. 
    
            Republicans have begun to coalesce around the idea of a federal abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion group, has called on candidates to support the 15-week limit at minimum, with room for states to pass more restrictive measures. 
    
            “A number of GOP officeholders and even presidential aspirants use ‘states’ rights’ as an excuse to tape their mouths shut on abortion,” Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, wrote in a Thursday Washington Post op-ed with former Trump White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway. “This should not, and will not, stand.”
    
            Former UN Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and DeSantis all declined to commit to signing a 15-week ban, while former Vice President Mike Pence and Scott did. The latter two criticized their opponents in post-debate interviews. Scott said in a Thursday Fox News interview that it is “a problem for our nation” that some candidates said they would not commit to a 15-week ban, while Pence also took a jab at Trump. 
    
            “Whether it be with Gov. Desantis or Nikki Haley or others onstage, frankly most of the candidates running, including the one that did not show up tonight, are all trying to relegate the question of abortion as a states-only issue,” he told CNN’s Dana Bash on Wednesday.
    
            Trump has not said whether he would back a 15-week ban and has suggested he would leave it with the states. In May, he criticized the six-week ban DeSantis signed as “too harsh” for the anti-abortion movement but declined to say whether he supported it personally. A month later he told the audience at a Faith and Freedom Coalition conference that while there “remains a vital role for the federal government” to play in abortion policy, people want it to be a state-level issue. 
    
            “I believe the greatest progress for pro-life is now being made in the states, where everyone wanted to be,” Trump said. Pence used his remarks at the same conference to call on every GOP candidate to back a 15-week ban as a national standard.
    
            If a consensus is reached it will likely be whatever the eventual Republican nominee backs, though Ayres would advise candidates to leave the issue to the states — if that’s what they personally believe, he said. 
    
            “Ultimately, a candidate has to look into his or her heart and soul to find a position they’re comfortable with, otherwise, they’ll never be able to articulate it effectively,” he said.

      Federal judge dismisses challenge to West Virginia’s restrictions on abortion drugs
    ","

    ","
            A federal judge ruled in favor of West Virginia’s restrictions on medication abortion Thursday, dismissing part of a lawsuit brought by an abortion drug manufacturer earlier this year. 
    
            District Judge Robert Chambers rejected the manufacturer’s claim that the state’s near-total abortion ban, which took effect last September, conflicted with the US Food and Drug Administration’s regulation and approval of the drugs.
    
            The ban “has limited when an abortion may be performed, without touching how medication abortion is to be performed,” Chambers said in his ruling. Subsequently, he wrote, the court “is compelled to find that federal regulation of medication abortion prescription does not conflict with severe state limitations on abortion.”
    
            The lawsuit is one of many that were filed across the country in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling last summer that overturned federal abortion protections. Many Republican-led states have since moved to curb abortion rights – including outright bans of the procedure – and medication abortion has become a particularly acute flashpoint as it makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US. 
    
            In January, GenBioPro – the manufacturer of a generic version of mifepristone – sued West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Putnam County prosecuting attorney Mark Sorsaia alleging that the state’s abortion ban and a 2021 measure prohibiting the prescription of abortion drugs via telemedicine violate the US Constitution’s Supremacy and Commerce clauses.
    
            The company argued that the restrictions are preempted by federal law that gives the FDA the authority to regulate medication abortion and Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce.
    
            In response, both defendants moved to dismiss the case.
    
            While the judge dismissed GenBioPro’s challenge to the abortion ban Thursday, he allowed its challenge to the state’s restriction on the prescription of abortion drugs via telehealth services to continue.
    
            In his order, Chambers said the restriction “dictates the manner in which” the drug could be prescribed, and Congress has assigned the FDA to make that determination.
    
            Following Thursday’s ruling, Morrisey said that he is “pleased” with the decision and looks forward “to arguing the remaining issue of this lawsuit.”
    
            “While it may not sit well with manufacturers of abortion drugs, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that regulating abortion is a state issue,” Morrisey said in a statement. “I will always stand strong for the life of the unborn.”
    
            GenBioPro said in a statement shared with CNN that the company is “reviewing” the mixed ruling. 
    
            “We are confident in the legal strength of our claims and are considering our next steps in the fight to ensure access for patients who need this essential medication,” GenBioPro CEO Evan Masingill said in the statement. 
    
            Access to medication abortion remains on the line as several other challenges to the drugs play out in court. 
    
            Earlier this month, a federal appeals court wiped away a lower court decision that would’ve taken mifepristone off the market but ruled in favor of limiting access to the drug. The Justice Department has indicated that it will ask the Supreme Court to review the ruling, potentially setting the stage for the high court to weigh in on abortion yet again.

      South Carolina Supreme Court upholds 6-week abortion ban
    ","

            The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday reversed a temporary block on the state’s abortion restrictions, with four justices agreeing and one dissenting in three separate opinions. 
    
            The law, known as the ”Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,” limits most abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo. 
    
            Shortly after Republican Gov. Henry McMaster signed the Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act in May, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and several other medical providers filed a lawsuit in state court to try to stop it.
    
            The state filed an emergency petition asking the South Carolina Supreme Court, which is comprised of five men, to act quickly on the case.
    
            In a statement Wednesday, McMaster said, “With this victory, we protect the lives of countless unborn children and reaffirm South Carolina’s place as one of the most pro-life states in America.”
    
            The law allows for exceptions to save the pregnant woman’s life and for fatal fetal anomalies, as well as limited exceptions up to 12 weeks for victims of rape and incest. Physicians who knowingly violate the law could face felony charges, jail time, fines and would have their license to practice in the state revoked by the State Board of Medical Examiners.
    
            In one of the opinions in Wednesday’s ruling, Justice John Kittredge wrote, “To be sure, the 2023 Act infringes on a woman’s right of privacy and bodily autonomy.”
    
            He then goes on to add that the state legislature “made a policy determination that, at a certain point in the pregnancy, a woman’s interest in autonomy and privacy does not outweigh the interest of the unborn child to live” and that using the “legal and judicial lens under which we must operate, while mindful of the difficult and emotional issue before us, we cannot say as a matter of law that the 2023 Act is unreasonable and thus violates the state constitution.” 
    
            Justice John Few agreed with reversing the ban, but wrote a separate opinion. He said that the new bill promotes “active family planning.”
    
            “Couples who do not want to bring a pregnancy to term and have a baby are enabled by the 2023 Act to make that choice before a pregnancy by the increased availability of contraceptives, and are encouraged through the use of Plan B and early pregnancy testing to meet the statutory deadline of ‘fetal heartbeat’ in the event contraceptive measures are not effective,” he wrote.
    
            “I am certain many will find my analysis unsatisfying. Constitutional analysis, however, is not a team sport,” Few added.
    
            Chief Justice Donald Beatty dissented, warning, “The lack of judicial independence renders a court powerless and places it on the edge of a slippery slope to irrelevance.”
    
            He also said that the law places more responsibility on a woman for an unexpected pregnancy.
    
            “Moreover, the implication is that women are solely responsible for a couple’s unexpected pregnancy, possibly due to the lack of birth control. But what about situations where birth control fails? Or situations where someone does not have regular access to birth control due to circumstances beyond their control, such as a lack of insurance, low income, or an absence of nearby medical facilities? The financial and emotional burdens of repetitive pregnancy testing before a woman even has any reason to suspect a pregnancy, and the adverse effects from the use of hormonal contraceptives, such as Plan B, that are used before a woman can even know that she is pregnant (because it prevents implantation of the fertilized egg) are burdens that a woman will be forced to endure throughout her reproductive years,” he wrote in his opinion.
    
            “The result will essentially force an untold number of affected women to give birth without their consent,” Beatty added.
    
            Planned Parenthood blasted the Supreme Court’s decision, saying it “will cause irreparable harm to the people of South Carolina.”

            About 1 in 5 women were mistreated while receiving maternity care, and nearly a third faced discrimination, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            The negative experiences were even more common for Black, Hispanic and multiracial mothers: About 30% of Black and Hispanic mothers reported mistreatment during maternity care, and about 40% reported discrimination.
    
            “As a healthcare community, we need to do all we can to make sure we are delivering equitable and respectful care to women during pregnancy and delivery,” Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC, said in a statement. “Health systems, hospitals, and providers can take steps to improve care and lower the risk of pregnancy-related complications and death for all women. These data show that we must do better to support moms.”
    
            The findings are based on a survey of more than 2,400 women who have at least one child under the age of 18. The survey was conducted in late April, and women were asked to respond based on the experience they had when delivering their youngest child. That was at least five years ago for most, and the findings may not be nationally representative.
    
            Nearly 10% of women said that health care providers ignored them, refused requests for help or took an unreasonable amount of time to respond to requests, according to the CDC report. Nearly 7% of women – about 1 in 15 – said they were shouted at or scolded by doctors, midwives or nurses, and nearly 4% were threatened by their health care providers. Other experiences of mistreatment included violations of physical privacy and withholding or forcing treatments.
    
            Overall, about 1 in 10 women said they experienced discrimination because of their age or weight. About 1 in 8 Black mothers said they were discriminated against because of their race.
    
            “Our system is broken for all women, but Black women bear the brunt of those inequities,” said Nastassia Harris, a member of the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric & Neonatal Nurses and founding executive director of the Perinatal Health Equity Initiative. “A lot of that has to do with racism, the intersection of sexism and misogynoir, and how that actually impacts how Black women are seen and perceived in the health space.”
    
            The maternal mortality crisis continues to worsen in the US, with rates rising sharply in recent years. And vast disparities persist, as Black women were more two times more likely than average to die from pregnancy or childbirth in 2021.
    
            Experts say that respectful maternity care – including equitable treatment and effective communication – is a key part of improving treatment and reducing pregnancy-related deaths.
    
            “We know that discrimination during prenatal care may be associated with reductions in seeking care,” said Dr. Wanda Barfield, director of the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health. “We do know from this study that women are reluctant to report their concerns. And we do know that as a result of not voicing concerns, there may be an increased risk for pregnancy-related complications for both mom and baby.”
    
            Nearly half (45%) of all women said they didn’t ask questions or discuss concerns with maternity care providers, most often because they thought what they were experiencing might be normal. At least 1 in 5 also said they held back because they felt embarrassed and didn’t want to make the issue into a big deal or because they were worried their maternity care provider might think they were being difficult.
    
            Another CDC report from last year found that more than 84% of women who died during pregnancy, during delivery or up to a year postpartum death could have been avoided.
    
            “Pregnancy is not an illness, and it does not require high-risk care to be delivered,” Harris said. “Had we been listening to these symptoms, had we been paying attention, we could have intervened and stopped a lot of these poor outcomes from happening.”
    
            Despite the mistreatment and discrimination, the vast majority of women said they were satisfied with the care they received while pregnant or delivering their child, according to the new CDC report.
    
            “I liken it to battered women’s syndrome. You’re so used to being mistreated that you don’t often recognize it,” Harris said. “And I think if these women experienced what it looked like to be loved on, to be holistically cared for, they would see a sharp contrast in how they were cared for in these dynamics.”
    
            Reducing mistreatment and discrimination during maternal care and creating safer experiences will require investment across the broader health care system, experts say.
    
            “We know that actions like hiring and retaining a diverse workforce and providing health care provider trainings on unconscious bias and stigma can help improve the quality of care,” Houry said. Doulas and midwives can serve as advocates for new mothers, and health care systems can better support these models, she said.
    
            “The health of moms reflects the health of our nation,” she said. “We can all support women who are pregnant and postpartum and getting the care they need.”

      British nurse to spend rest of her life in prison for murdering seven babies

    ","
            A British nurse was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Monday for the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others at the UK hospital where she worked.
    
            Lucy Letby, 33, was handed a whole life order by Manchester Crown Court in northern England, meaning she will never be released. Letby refused to appear in the dock, prompting calls for laws to be changed so that defendants must attend their sentencing hearings. 
    
            She was found guilty on Friday by a jury, in a case that horrified the country and made her Britain’s most prolific child serial killer of recent times. 
    
            Explaining why he decided Letby must spent the rest of her life in prison, Justice James Goss said: “This was a cruel, calculated and cynical campaign of child murder involving the smallest and most vulnerable of children.”
    
            The judge addressed Letby as if she was in court during the sentencing. He ordered his remarks and the victim impact statements read in court earlier in the day to be handed to the convicted serial killer. 
    
            “There was a deep malevolence bordering on sadism. During the course of this trial you have coldly denied any responsibility for your wrongdoing. You have no remorse. There are no mitigating factors,” he said.
    
            Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday condemned Letby for failing to appear in court. “I think it’s cowardly that people who commit such horrendous crimes do not face their victims and hear first hand the impact that their crimes have had on them and their families and loved ones,” PA Media reported.
    
            “We are looking and have been at changing the law to make sure that that happens and that’s something that we’ll bring forward in due course.”
    
            Letby attacked babies in her care by administering air into their blood and stomachs, overfeeding them with milk, physically assaulting them and poisoning them with insulin, the court heard on Friday. 
    
            The allegations against Letby and her subsequent conviction triggered a government inquiry amid questions over how she was able to escape detection for so long.  
    
            She secretly assaulted 13 babies on the neonatal ward at the Countess of Chester hospital between 2015 and 2016, Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement on Friday.
    
            Prosecutors argued that Letby’s intention was to kill the babies while duping her colleagues into believing there was a natural cause of death. 
    
            The parents of the babies that Letby murdered were given a chance to tell the court about the impact of her horrific acts before Friday’s sentencing. Many have spoken about their lives being forever changed, PA reported. 
    
            The parents of several of the babies that survived Letby’s assaults said their children now require around-the-clock care. 
    
            As with the sentencing, Letby was not in the courtroom when the victim impact statements were read. 
    
            Throughout the trial, the court heard harrowing testimony from parents, including in one case where Letby had tried to kill a baby boy after murdering his twin brother. 
    
            The mother of Child E and Child F said she “completely” trusted Letby’s advice, while giving evidence to the court.
    
            However, she said she “knew there was something wrong” when her baby, Child E, started screaming in the intensive care unit one night.
    
            It emerged that before Letby murdered Child E, he started bleeding when she tried to assault him. That baby’s twin brother, Child F, later survived an attempt by Letby to kill him by insulin poisoning. And it was revealed that police had found a series of handwritten notes by Letby.
    
            “I don’t deserve to live. I killed them on purpose because I’m not good enough to care for them,” she wrote in one memo, adding in another, “I am a horrible evil person” and in capital letters, “I am evil I did this.”
    
            In 2018 and 2019, Letby was arrested twice by police in connection with their investigation, PA said. She was arrested again in November 2020.
    
            Authorities found the notes Letby had written, as well as handover notes she had taken from the hospital during searches of her address.
    
            During the sentencing, the judge said Letby has kept the hospital documents “as morbid records of the events surrounding the collapses” of the babies. 
    
            The UK government issued an independent inquiry into the murders on Friday, including how regulators and Britain’s National Health Service dealt with the concerns raised by consultants.
    
            Doctors at the hospital noticed a spike in the number of babies who were dying or unexpectedly collapsing in the neonatal unit, the court in Manchester heard.
    
            But the hospital’s management initially dismissed concerns raised by clinicians over the increased mortality rate of patients under Letby’s care, PA reported.
    
            Lawyers for the victims’ families have said the inquiry was “not good enough” as it does not have powers to summon witnesses. 
    
            In 2016, Letby won a grievance complaint that she had filed against her employers after learning of their initial allegations. 
    
            She was scheduled to return to the neonatal department in March 2017, but her return did not take place. The hospital trust contacted the police, who opened an investigation.

      ‘I am evil,’ wrote British nurse found guilty of murdering seven babies in her care

            A British nurse has been found guilty of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six others at the hospital where she worked, making her the country’s worst baby serial killer in recent times.
    
            Lucy Letby, 33, harmed babies in her care by injecting air into their blood and stomachs, overfeeding them with milk, physically assaulting them and poisoning them with insulin, Manchester Crown Court in northern England heard.
    
            In one case, Letby murdered a baby boy, identified as Child E, by administering air into his bloodstream, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported. The next day, she attempted to kill his twin brother, Child F, by poisoning him with insulin.
    
            A court order protects the identity of the children involved in the allegations against Letby, including those who died and survived under her care. 
    
            Police found a trove of handwritten notes while searching Letby’s house during their investigation, including one that read: “I am evil I did this.”
    
            She secretly attacked 13 babies on the neonatal ward at the Countess of Chester hospital between 2015 and 2016, Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement. 
    
            Her intention was to kill the babies while duping her colleagues into believing there was a natural cause of death, prosecutors argued. 
    
            Pascale Jones of the CPS called Letby’s actions a “complete betrayal of the trust placed in her.”
    
            “Lucy Letby sought to deceive her colleagues and pass off the harm she caused as nothing more than a worsening of each baby’s existing vulnerability,” she said. 
    
            “In her hands, innocuous substances like air, milk, fluids – or medication like insulin – would become lethal. She perverted her learning and weaponised her craft to inflict harm, grief and death.”  
    
            Victims’ families said they “may never truly know why this happened.”
    
            “To lose a baby is a heartbreaking experience that no parent should ever have to go through,” a joint statement said. 
    
            “But to lose a baby or to have a baby harmed in these particular circumstances is unimaginable,” the statement added.  
    
            In 2018 and 2019, Letby was arrested twice by police in connection with their investigation, PA said. She was arrested again in November 2020.
    
            Authorities found notes Letby had written during searches of her address. 
    
            “I don’t deserve to live. I killed them on purpose because I’m not good enough to care for them,” she wrote in one memo, adding in another, “I am a horrible evil person” and in capital letters “I am evil I did this.”
    
            The mother of Child E and Child F said she “completely” trusted Letby’s advice, while giving evidence to the court, according to PA Media.
    
            However, she said she “knew there was something wrong” when her baby, Child E, started screaming in the intensive care unit one night. 
    
            It emerged that before Letby murdered Child E, he started bleeding when she tried to assault him.
    
            “It was a sound that should not come from a tiny baby,” the mother told the court. “I can’t explain what the sound was. It was horrendous. More of a scream than a cry.”
    
            There was no post-mortem examination following Child E’s death. The mother said she thought he had passed away from natural causes.
    
            Her twin son, Child F, later survived an attempt by Letby to kill him by insulin poisoning.
    
            Doctors at the hospital began to notice a steep rise in the number of babies who were dying or unexpectedly collapsing, the court heard.  
    
            But concerns raised by consultants over the increased mortality rate of patients under Letby’s care were initially dismissed by the hospital’s management, PA Media said.  
    
            In September 2016, Letby filed a grievance against her employers after she was relocated from the hospital’s neonatal ward. She was put back on clerical duties after two male triplets died and a baby boy collapsed on three days in a row in June 2016. 
    
            Later that year, she was notified of the allegations against her by the Royal College of Nursing union, but the complaint was later resolved in her favor. Doctors were asked to formally apologize to Letby in writing. 
    
            She was scheduled to return to the neonatal department in March 2017, but her return did not take place. The hospital trust contacted the police, who opened an investigation.
    
            The UK government has ordered an independent inquiry into the murders, including “how concerns raised by clinicians were dealt with.”
    
            The inquiry will probe into the “circumstances surrounding the deaths and incidents,” the government said in a statement on Friday.
    
            It will also evaluate what actions were taken by regulators and Britain’s National Health Service in response to concerns regarding Letby. 
    
            Health Secretary Steve Barclay pledged the voices of parents of the victims “are heard” throughout the inquiry, acknowledging there are many questions to be answered.
    
            “Justice has been served and the nurse who should have been caring for our babies has been found guilty of harming them,” the victims’ families said in a joint statement on Friday.
    
            “But this justice will not take away from the extreme hurt, anger and distress that we have all had to experience,” the statement added.
    
            “We are heartbroken, devastated, angry and feel numb.”
    
            Letby will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court on August 21.

      Appeals court says abortion pill mifepristone should remain on the market but rules in favor of limiting access
    ","
			By Tierney Sneed

        9:33 PM EDT, Wed August 16, 2023
    ","
            A federal appeals court on Wednesday wiped away a lower court’s ruling that would’ve taken the medication abortion drug mifepristone off the market, but upheld aspects of the ruling that could cut back access to the pills.
    
            The ruling from a conservative three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals will not affect the current availability of mifepristone, as the Supreme Court has already said that the drug and regulations that make it accessible will remain in place for the time being. 
    
            Wednesday’s opinion, by Circuit Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod, said that the statute of limitations likely barred the legal challenge to the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug, mifepristone. 
    
            Circuit Judge James Ho, a Donald Trump appointee, wrote a partial dissent, in which he said he believed the 2000 approval of mifepristone to be unlawful.
    
            The ruling is the latest twist in the dramatic case, which is the most consequential legal battle over abortion since the Supreme Court last summer overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights nationwide. 
    
            While the ruling has no immediate impact on access to medication abortion drugs, it sets the stage for the Supreme Court to yet again weigh in on abortion. The Justice Department said later Wednesday that it will ask the Supreme Court to review the ruling.
    
            Wednesday’s appeals court decision – by ruling in favor of cutbacks to the drug’s access while concluding the pills can remain on the market – lays out the stakes for the case’s return to the justices. And it will likely shape the contours of what both sides will be arguing to the high court.
    
            Medication abortion makes up the majority of abortions obtained in the United States. Since Roe’s reversal, abortion providers in states where abortion remains legal have relied upon the availability of abortion pills to relieve the burdens on clinics that have been flooded with patients from regions of the county where abortion has been severely restricted. 
    
            Mifepristone is exceedingly safe and has a lower death rate than commonly prescribed drugs like penicillin and Viagra.
    
            “Today, generic mifepristone remains lawful and available on the market,” said Evan Masingill, the CEO of GenBioPro, which manufactures the generic version of the drug.
    
            Wednesday’s ruling reversed parts of April’s blockbuster ruling from US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have suspended the federal government’s two-decade old approval of the drug. The appeals court, however, agreed with Kascmaryk that it was likely unlawful for the government to make more recent changes to the drug’s regulations that made it easier to obtain. 
    
            While the appeals court majority did not rule in favor of pulling the mifepristone off the market, as abortion foes were seeking, the appeals court showed itself to be very sympathetic to a large swath of the challengers’ arguments. 
    
            The appeals court endorsed most of the procedural arguments that the challengers made for why it was appropriate for a court to intervene. Elrod’s opinion also embraced claims about mifepristone’s risks, put forward by anti-abortion doctors challenging the FDA approval, even though those characterizations had been widely rebuked by mainstream medical groups.
    
            In concluding that FDA’s moves to relax the pills’ regulations should be reversed, Elrod wrote, “the public interest is disserved by a drug that does not afford adequate protections to its users.”
    
            “To be clear, the evidence does not show that mifepristone is unsafe in all applications,” the appeals court said. “But on this record and at this preliminary stage, the Medical Organizations and Doctors have made a substantial showing that the 2016 Amendments and 2021 Non-Enforcement Decision were taken without sufficient consideration of the effects those changes would have on patients.”
    
            The lawsuit was filed in a Texas federal court in November by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations seeking to pull mifepristone – the first drug in the two-pill regimen for terminating pregnancies – from the market. The challengers argue that the US Food and Drug Administration broke the law in how it approved mifepristone in 2000 and in how it has since relaxed certain restrictions for the drug’s use. 
    
            The case was filed in a remote Texas court division that guaranteed it would be heard by Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump who worked for a conservative religious liberty organization before joining the bench and whose personal hostility toward abortion has been reported by The Washington Post. 
    
            Kacsmaryk embraced whole-heartedly the arguments put forward by the abortion opponents, with an April 7 ruling that would have suspended mifepristone’s approval but that was not allowed to take effect. 
    
            A previous panel of the 5th Circuit – during an earlier, emergency round of litigation – put parts of Kacsmaryk’s ruling on hold, and on April 21, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order that froze the entirety of the judge’s decision while an appeal of it played out. 
    
            In the most recent stage of the proceedings, the 5th Circuit was giving a fuller review of Kacsmaryk’s ruling. The abortion foes drew an extremely friendly panel, made up of three very conservative judges who have ruled against abortion rights in the past, all appointed by Republican presidents.  
    
            Wednesday’s 5th Circuit ruling, if allowed to take effect, would put on hold 2016 FDA regulatory changes that, among other things, allowed women to take the drug later into their pregnancies and allowed non-physicians to prescribe the drug. The ruling would also reverse, while the litigation in the case continued, the FDA’s more recent moves to allow the pills to be dispensed via the mail.
    
            Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that represented the anti-abortion doctors and medical associations that brought the case, said the ruling was a “significant victory.”
    
            “The 5th Circuit rightly required the FDA to do its job and restore crucial safeguards for women and girls, including ending illegal mail-order abortions,” the group’s senior counsel, Erin Hawley, said in the statement.
    
            On a conference call with reporters, Hawley said that they had not made a decision yet whether to appeal the ruling.
    
            Danco, a mifepristone manufacturer that intervened in the case to defend the FDA’s approach to the drug, said in a statement that it will “continue to pursue reversal of this injunction.”
    
            “The Fifth Circuit panel’s decision is inconsistent with established Supreme Court principles governing standing and administrative law challenges,” the company said in a statement.
    
            The 5th Circuit opinion repeatedly noted that its ruling will not take effect while the Supreme Court order maintaining the status quo was in place.
    
            The case is now expected to travel back to the justices. Their previous order will stay in place at least until the justices decide whether to take up the case and possibly longer.
    
            Planned Parenthood called on the Supreme Court to “reject this clearly baseless and political attempt to interfere with our ability to get health care.”
    
            Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in the statement that “the 5th Circuit’s opinion makes it clear that mifepristone’s approval is very much still at risk, as is the FDA’s independence.”
    
            “Pregnant people should be the ones who make decisions about their own health care, and medical professionals should be the ones who make evidence-based decisions about the safety of medications — not judges,” she said.
    
            During May 17 oral arguments in New Orleans, where the 5th Circuit is based, the judges tore into the FDA. 
    
            “We are allowed to look at the FDA just like we’re allowed to look at any agency,” Ho said, while decrying what he described as theme of “the FDA can do no wrong.” 
    
            Elrod, a George W. Bush appointee, railed against the briefs filed by a mifepristone manufacturer that has intervened in the case, with the judge claiming that the briefs amounted to “personally attacking” Kacsmaryk. 
    
            In one line of questioning, Trump-appointed Circuit Judge Cory Wilson zeroed in on the FDA’s moves to allow the pills to be mailed to patients and to lift requirements for an in-person visit with a provider. 
    
            Hinting that he was convinced by the anti-abortion doctors’ arguments that the drug was leading to medical emergencies that were causing them harms, Wilson said that FDA had “made it much more likely that patients are going to go to emergency care or a medical clinic where one of the doctors is a member.”

      New Jersey Supreme Court rules in favor of Catholic school that fired a teacher for having premarital sex

            The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Catholic school that terminated a teacher for having premarital sex, according to court documents.  
    
            Victoria Crisitello began as a caregiver at St. Theresa School in Kenilworth in 2011, and in 2014, the school’s principal, Sister Theresa Lee, approached Crisitello about teaching art full-time, court documents say. 
    
            Crisitello, who was unmarried, told the principal she was pregnant during that meeting, according to the documents. 
    
            Crisitello alleged that a few weeks later, Lee said she violated the school’s Code of Ethics by engaging in premarital sex. Crisitello said her contract was terminated and she was replaced by a teacher who was married and had children, according to court documents. 
    
            Crisitello filed a lawsuit in April 2014 against St. Theresa School, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, court documents say. She argued her firing was a “‘mere pretext’ for pregnancy and marital-status discrimination,” according to the lawsuit.  
    
            On Monday, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school. The court held that religious entities could use religious tenet exceptions of state employment law as an “affirmative defense” in facing claims of employment discrimination, and it was an “uncontroverted fact” that the school followed the Catholic Church’s religious tenets in terminating Crisitello.
    
            “Of course we are disappointed with the decision because it did not go our way,” Crisitello’s attorney, Thomas A. McKinney, said in a statement, “and we don’t think that going forward a pregnant woman will be treated equally based on these policies of the employment.
    
            “We would have liked to see this reminded in court but we understand the decision of the Supreme Court justice and we accept it.”
    
            St. Theresa School argued Crisitello’s pregnancy violated the terms of her employment agreement, which required “employees to adhere to the teachings of the Catholic Church and refrain from premarital sex,” court documents say. 
    
            The school functions under the Roman Catholic administration of the Archdiocese of Newark and follows its code of ethics: Employees are obligated to uphold principles, standards, and teachings of the Catholic Church, according to the documents.
    
            Upon her initial hiring, Crisitello signed a form affirming her compliance with the school’s code of conduct, the documents said. 
    
            “We are pleased that the Supreme Court upheld the rights of religious employers to act consistent with their religious tenets, and that St. Theresa School did so here,” said Peter G. Verniero, the attorney for the St. Theresa School, in a statement to CNN.  
    
            The state attorney general expressed disapproval of the court’s decision. 
    
            “We are disappointed with today’s decision, but we are grateful that its narrow scope will not impact the important protections the Law Against Discrimination provides for the overwhelming majority of New Jerseyans,” a spokesperson for the Office of the Attorney General said in a statement to CNN.
    
             Alexander Shalom, the ACLU’s New Jersey Director of Supreme Court Advocacy, described the ruling as disappointing. 
    
            “While we recognize that the United States Supreme Court’s prior decisions provide broad latitude to religious employers regarding hiring and firing, we believe the NJ Supreme Court could have, and should have, held that a second grade art teacher was entitled to the protections of the Law Against Discrimination,” Shalom said in a statement to CNN. 
    
            Kenilworth is a borough about 10 miles west of Newark.

            A 6-year-old boy was fatally shot in the head this week by a 9-year-old boy who got a hold of a gun inside a Florida home, authorities said.
    
            The younger child was taken Monday to a hospital, where he died, Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office Assistant Chief J.D. Stronko said in a news conference.
    
            An adult at home during the shooting has been questioned by authorities, Stanko said. There is no indication of criminal violence and no one has been charged with a crime, he said, adding the circumstances of the shooting were under investigation.
    
            The incident adds to the growing tally of children up to age 17 killed this year in gun violence: 1,114 as of Wednesday, with another 3,065 injured, Gun Violence Archive data shows.
    
            Children and teens are more likely to die by guns than any other way – a grim cause that surpassed car accidents in 2020. Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of deaths in 2021 of children ages 1 to 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database. 
    
            Nearly 3,600 children died in gun-related incidents that year – about 5 children lost for every 100,000 children in the United States. 
    
            In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to a KFF analysis.
    
            In this week’s fatal shooting in Florida, it’s unclear what the relationship between the two boys and their relationship with the adult at the home are. Authorities will not release that information per Marsy’s Law, a state statute that gives crime victims certain protections and rights. At least 17 states have such laws.

      Meta criticized for making reproductive health an R-rated issue

    ","
            Female reproductive health experts are calling on Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to rethink its restrictions on reproductive health content.
    
            The company has long faced criticism for removing and restricting female reproductive health information with a prominent report from the Center for Intimacy Justice early last year accusing Meta of systematically rejecting many female and gender diverse reproductive health ads. The CIJ report also accused Meta of having bias algorithms, stating that male reproductive health ads were found to be permitted, including ads that referenced male sexual pleasure.
    
            In bid to combat those concerns, Meta tweaked its “adult products or services” advertising policy last October to include clearer guidelines about reproductive health, clarifying that it allows the promotion of “reproductive health products or services” if the content is targeted to “people aged 18 or older.”
    
            Meta
            
                (FB) argues the topic is sensitive, stating that as a global company it needs to take in to account the “wide array of people from different cultures and countries” to “avoid potential negative experiences.” 
    
            However, female reproductive experts tell CNN that the advertising policy is still too restrictive and is creating barriers for how younger people around the world access information about female reproductive health issues, including the menstrual cycle, which can start as early as 8 years old.
    
            They argue that censoring content about normal and natural bodily functions plays into the shame that has long plagued how people learn about the female body and hormone cycle. That can hinder how people with uteruses advocate for their bodies in healthcare settings, including obtaining care for misunderstood and underdiagnosed conditions like endometriosis.
    
            The practice of censoring female reproductive health content is not unique to Meta, with similar issues reported on other social media platforms. However, Meta is under specific scrutiny for failing to adequately address the issue within its policy updates last year.
    
            The founder and CEO of the Center for Intimacy Justice, Jackie Rotman, told CNN that despite the policy update, Meta’s algorithms still seem to have a problem with female reproductive health content.
    
            “The policy says that reproductive health is allowed, but in practice their technology is still rejecting it,” Rotman said, explaining that images of uteruses are often mistakenly flagged as nudity, and words like period, menopause, endometriosis and vagina also commonly triggering sexually inappropriate warnings.
    
            Rotman outlined that while Meta’s reproductive health guidelines are targeted toward advertising content, unpaid posts are also often being impacted by Meta’s algorithms. She says shadow-banning, which refers to content being partially blocked from certain audiences, is common practice for organic content. Several reproductive health content creators told CNN that they experience shadow-banning, explaining that it is time consuming game of trial and error to determine what is considered too taboo.
    
            Dr. Hazel Wallace, author of “The Female Factor” told CNN she wishes she could be more direct in how she speaks about the female body and hormone cycle, including menstrual health. However, said has learned that “to educate people, you almost have to play the game.”
    
            She says she often experiences shadow banning, with her analytics showing less engagement if she uses words like period. She explained that her team experimented with Meta’s algorithm, finding they could often dodge restrictions by mis-spelling the word period as p3riod.
    
            “We found that it increased engagement because it doesn’t flag your content as being inappropriate to certain audiences,” Wallace outlined.
    
            While Meta on several occasions has apologized and re-instated female reproductive health content that it says was mistakenly removed, it still stipulates an age restriction in its policy. Therefore, even if the updated policy was perfectly implemented, Meta would still be green lighting the practise of censoring crucial content from certain audiences.
    
            CNN asked Meta about the reports that it is continuing to remove, restrict, and shadow-ban female reproductive health content. CNN also asked Meta why all female reproductive health, including menstrual health, is classified as an 18+ issue. 
    
            In response, a spokesperson for Meta, Ryan Daniels, said, “We welcome ads for women’s health and sexual wellness products, but we prohibit nudity and have specific rules about how these products can be marketed on our platform.”
    
            In a bid to change the conversation, female reproductive health content creators are not letting Meta’s restrictions silence their voices.
    
            Wallace, a like so many others in her field, says she should not need to self-censor how she speaks about female reproductive health, arguing that censorship perpetuates a “hush hush” narrative about “normal experiences.” 
    
            “Imagine a world where we are teaching young girls and women from puberty - this is what to expect, this is normal, this is not normal, this is when to ask for help. We would feel a lot more empowered,” Wallace stated.
    
            Categorizing reproductive health as an R-rated topic is an issue that extends far beyond Meta advertising policies, reflecting wider societal views, from politics to sex education curriculums.
    
            Tracey Lindeman, the author of “BLEED: Destroying Myths and Misogyny in Endometriosis,” says classifying all female reproductive health issues under the umbrella of sexual health “perpetuates the idea that our sexual organs are to be exploited and used for sexuality, even at a young age.”
    
            “You’re born with a reproductive system. Whether or not you’re having sex, you still have that system in your body, and it’s still affecting your body in different ways,” Lindeman reasoned.
    
            “How about we just teach people about how their bodies work first, before we start teaching them how they work to have sex,” Lindeman stated.

      RFK Jr.’s campaign tries to walk back his support of three-month federal abortion ban

    ","
            Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign on Sunday evening quickly tried to walk back comments the Democratic presidential candidate had made earlier in the day in support of a nationwide abortion restriction after the first three months of pregnancy.
    
            “Mr. Kennedy’s position on abortion is that it is always the woman’s right to choose. He does not support legislation banning abortion,” the campaign said in a statement, attempting to clarify remarks Kennedy had made to an NBC reporter at the Iowa State Fair that had prompted praise from a major anti-abortion rights group. 
    
            Kennedy, who’s waging a long-shot bid for the nomination against President Joe Biden, had said that he believes “a decision to abort a child should be up to the women during the first three months of life,” but that “the state has an interest” in restricting abortions after the first trimester and that he would support a federal law banning abortions after that period.
    
            “Once a child is viable outside the womb, I think then the state has an interest in protecting the child,” Kennedy told NBC. He also added: “I’m for medical freedom. Individuals are able to make their own choices.”
    
            The Kennedy campaign said he misunderstood the question “in a crowded, noisy exhibit hall at the Iowa State Fair.”
    
            According to video of the exchange, the NBC reporter had asked Kennedy, “So three months, you would sign a federal cap on that?” to which he replied, “Yes, I would.”
    
            The campaign’s statement came shortly after Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America praised Kennedy for the position he outlined to NBC, calling it a “stark contrast to the Democratic Party’s radical stance.”
    
            SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser called Kennedy “one of the few prominent Democrats aligned with the consensus of the people today” and used his comment to NBC to criticize Biden on abortion.
    
            In a statement on Monday, Dannenfelser suggested Kennedy’s campaign was forced to walk back his comment by pro-abortion rights groups.
    
            “The voters deserve to hear directly from Kennedy on where he really stands given the conflicting statements from him versus his campaign,” she said in the statement.
    
            “Voters deserve clarity about every candidate’s true position on human life and to know who is really calling the shots in this campaign,” she continued. “Consultants are not the ones running to be president.”
    
            The Kennedy campaign’s statement clarifying his abortion position Sunday evening did not include comments attributable directly to Kennedy. 
    
            Kennedy has a long history of spreading vaccine misinformation and unfounded conspiracy theories, taking stances on some issues that could undermine his Democratic bona fides as he tries to challenge Biden, whom many in his family are backing. CNN’s KFile reported last month, for example, that Kennedy’s campaign paid a litany of prominent activists – which includes some anti-vaccine advocates, public health conspiracy theorists and Republicans, either individually or through their businesses, according to campaign filings.

      How the reversal of Roe continues to win Democrats elections
    ","
			Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN

    ","
            The issue of abortion had, for years, been key to generating enthusiasm among conservatives. It’s one of the reasons a lot of very conservative voters stuck by Donald Trump in the 2016 general election, even after he struggled with the group in that year’s Republican primary.  
    
            But since the overturning of Roe v. Wade a year ago, it’s clear the shoe is on the other foot. Abortion is an issue that energizes Democrats and affects the outcome of elections, including potentially the 2024 presidential race.
    
            A lot has been made over Ohio voters turning down a ballot measure Tuesday that was largely seen as a proxy fight over a proposed constitutional amendment to guarantee abortion rights that will be on the state’s ballot in November. You can read more about that here, but the bottom line is that the “no” side – which was seen as the abortion rights side – won by 14 points in a state Trump won twice by 8 points. 
    
            The Ohio result wasn’t particularly surprising given that three red states that backed Trump by even bigger margins – Kansas, Kentucky and Montana – have also voted for the abortion rights side on ballot measures since the reversal of Roe.
    
            But while these outcomes are notable, it’s entirely possible that voters can separate how they feel on abortion and how they vote for candidates for office. Not every issue has an outsize electoral impact. 
    
            Abortion doesn’t look like one of those issues, though. It most likely does drive votes. Take a look at last month’s CNN/SSRS poll. Nearly a third of voters (31%) said they’d only consider voting for a candidate who shared their position on abortion. Of those, 54% were Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, while 37% were Republicans or Republican-leaning independents. 
    
            Likewise, 65% of the voters who indicated they would only vote for a candidate who shared their view on abortion disapproved of the reversal of Roe, while just 34% approved of it. 
    
            For context, 46% of all poll respondents were Republican or Republican-leaning independent voters, and 45% were Democratic or Democratic-leaning independent voters.
    
            Compare this data with what we saw from a PRRI survey during the 2020 election. 
    
            Republicans (32%) were nearly twice as likely as Democrats (17%) to say they’d only vote for a candidate who shared their position on abortion. Similarly, 29% of Americans who wanted abortion to be illegal would cast a ballot only for those who shared their position on abortion versus 15% of those who wanted abortion to be legal. 
    
            In other words, abortion has gone from an issue more likely to attract votes for Republican and anti-abortion candidates to one more likely to benefit Democrats and candidates who support abortion rights. 
    
            This isn’t something we only see in the polls. It’s been reflected in actual election results.  
    
            We know, for example, that the 2022 midterm election was one of the best on record for the party controlling the White House. Democrats picked up ground in the Senate and governors’ mansions and kept their losses to a minimum in the House. This happened even as President Joe Biden’s approval rating was well south of 50%. 
    
            A likely key driver of this extremely unusual result was abortion. I say this not merely because Democrats got a polling bump following the overturning of Roe (which they did). I say it because election results also started changing following the Supreme Court’s decision. 
    
            After Biden became president but before Roe was reversed, Democrats lagged behind in special elections compared with how well Biden had done in 2020. In US House and state legislative races, Democrats, on average, did 5 points worse than Biden’s margins. 
    
            Since Roe was overturned, Democrats have done 6 points better than Biden’s 2020 margins. That also holds true for special elections held solely in 2023. 
    
            It is not entirely clear how well special election results predict presidential performance. Special elections are often low-turnout affairs, which presidential races are most certainly not. 
    
            What is clear, though, is how different special elections this year have been compared with those in 2019. Back then, Democrats were doing only slightly better in special elections than the baseline set by their 2016 presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. This contrasted sharply with their performance in special elections ahead of the 2018 midterms, when they did significantly better than the 2016 baseline. 
    
            The special election trends in both cases forecast what occurred in the general elections that followed: a blowout Democratic win in 2018 and a close Biden win in 2020.  
    
            What happens in 2024 is, of course, anyone’s guess. Biden and Trump remain very close in the polls of a potential rematch. 
    
            But if Biden does end up securing a second term, his support for abortion rights will have something to do with it.

      Georgia mother who alleges baby was decapitated during delivery files lawsuit

            A mother who alleges her baby was decapitated during delivery at a Georgia hospital last month filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the hospital and others involved in the delivery, according to legal filings. 
    
            The complaint filed in Georgia’s Clayton County alleges the Southern Regional Medical Center attempted to conceal the manner of death of the baby from the family including the mother, 20-year-old Jessica Ross, and her boyfriend, Treveon Isaiah Taylor Sr.
    
            The medical center is in Riverdale, some 13 miles south of downtown Atlanta. The baby, who was named after his father, was delivered at full term, according to the family attorney. 
    
            The county medical examiner’s office has not released the cause of the baby’s death. The office still is working to complete the baby’s autopsy, the office’s director, Brian Byars, told CNN.
    
            According to the lawsuit, Ross went into labor on July 9, and her doctor, “attempted to deliver the baby vaginally using different methods including applying traction to the baby’s head.”  
    
            During the attempted delivery, “the baby did not properly descend due to shoulder dystocia,” a condition when a baby’s shoulders become stuck in the vaginal canal, the lawsuit says. 
    
            The physician “failed to practice according to medical standards,” the complaint reads. The complaint says the doctor “grossly” and “negligently applied excessive traction” on the head and neck of the baby and “failed to do a Cesarean section in a timely and proper manner, resulting in Treveon Isaiah Taylor Jr.’s decapitation and death.” 
    
            In a statement to CNN on Wednesday afternoon, Southern Regional Medical Center said it “denies the allegations in the complaint referencing the hospital.” 
    
            According to a statement from the family’s spokesperson, when Ross and Taylor “demanded to see and hold their baby, hospital staff told them that they were not allowed to touch or hold their child.”
    
            “Hospital staff allowed the young couple to only view their dead child,” the statement from the family’s spokesperson reads. 
    
            “During this viewing, their baby was wrapped tightly in a blanket with his head propped on top of his body in a manner such that those viewing him could not identify that he had been decapitated,” according to the statement.
    
            On Thursday, the Clayton County Medical Examiner told CNN in a statement his office is calling on state officials to investigate the incident. Byars said his office has contacted the Georgia Composite Medical Board “and requested that they also investigate three doctor’s roles in this incident.”
    
            He added the office is in the process of notifying the Georgia Secretary of State Office Board of Nursing, as well, “and will request that they also investigate the nursing staff’s role in this incident.”
    
            The Southern Regional Medical Center said it was “unable to discuss the care and treatment of specific patients” due to patient privacy laws and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA
    
            “Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the family and all those impacted by this tragic event,” the medical center’s statement reads. “Our prayers also remain with the dedicated team of physicians, nurses and staff at Southern Regional Medical Center who cared for this patient. Our commitment is to provide compassionate, quality care to every single patient, and this loss is heartbreaking.”
    
            “Since this matter is in litigation, we are refrained from providing any additional information,” the statement reads.
    
            The physician involved in the delivery is not an employee of the hospital, the statement reads. “The hospital has taken the appropriate steps in response to this unfortunate situation,” the statement reads.
    
            The lawsuit alleges, among other things, negligence by the defendants, who include the medical center and the physician, Dr. Tracey St. Julian. CNN’s attempts to reach St. Julian at her private practice were unsuccessful.
    
            The suit asks for a jury trial, and the plaintiffs are asking for monetary damages, including for the value of the baby’s life such as loss of lifetime earnings, and for funeral and burial costs and expenses. 
    
            The county medical examiner’s office expects to have a statement about its findings Thursday, Byers said.

      Biden plans to make abortion rights a key part of his reelection fight, campaign manager says

            President Joe Biden will lean into protecting abortion rights on the 2024 campaign trail, his campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, told CNN Thursday in her first live television interview.
    
            The strategy encapsulates the sharp evolution Biden has made on abortion rights, which has been a charged issue for a president who has witnessed up close the changing politics of abortion over the half-century span of his career. Long one of the Democratic Party’s most moderate voices on abortion, Biden has reckoned with personal qualms rooted in his Catholic faith.
    
            However, he has changed his view on the issue over the years and has called for codifying Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal constitutional right to abortion, since the 2020 campaign. He has also supported repealing the Hyde Amendment, which blocks using federal funds for abortions, after years of voting in favor of the amendment.
    
            Chavez Rodriguez told Dana Bash on CNN’s “Inside Politics” that Biden will continue to focus on “efforts that are helping motivate and mobilize voters right now” – like abortion access – as the president looks toward reelection. 
    
            “We’re encouraged by what we’re seeing in Ohio, and it’s yet another data point based on what we’ve seen really across the country … that abortion is a potent issue,” she said, speaking on “Inside Politics.” “It’s an issue that is top of mind for many voters across this country.” 
    
            Abortion rights were one of the primary motivators for Democratic voters during the 2022 midterms, helping the party hold on to the US Senate and perform better in many other races around the country than anticipated.
    
            That motivation appears to still be going strong into the 2024 election cycle. Earlier this week, Ohio voters rejected an effort to raise the threshold to amend the state’s constitution ahead of a November referendum on whether to constitutionally guarantee abortion rights there, handing abortion rights advocates a critical victory. 
    
            Chavez Rodriguez called the focus on abortion rights “an indication of the fundamental freedoms that folks want to continue to protect.” 
    
            “When President Biden and Vice President Harris relaunched our campaign, it was really focused on that of protecting the fundamental freedoms that we as Americans have really enjoyed throughout our lifetime,” she said. 
    
            Asked if Biden, who in the past has been uncomfortable talking about the issue, would be fully engaged on the topic, she said the president had been “really forthright and understanding that Roe got it right.” 
    
            “Throughout my lifetime [we] have been afforded that right, and it’s something that needs to be restored,” Chavez Rodriguez said. “When he and Vice President Harris are reelected it’s something that we will continue to ensure, that Roe is codified in this country.” 
    
            Pressed on if Biden would, “lean in” to the issue, Chavez Rodriguez responded: “Yeah, we’ve seen it as a core motivating factor for our coalition of voters in our base of support.”
    
            After the Supreme Court decision last year eliminating the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion, the administration has worked to secure women’s access to abortion, including with an executive order. 
    
            The months after that decision also saw Vice President Kamala Harris become the administration’s foremost voice on reproductive rights, both in public events and behind the scenes in hours of policy discussions and internal White House deliberations. She led intense efforts to marshal outside allies, many of whom were staggered by the ruling itself – and pressing the Biden administration to do more in response.
    
            Asked about other issues on the ballot that could potentially help the president, she said the campaign would “keep an eye on some of the critical efforts that are happening in – especially in our key battleground states and see what are efforts that are helping motivate and mobilize voters right now and to ensure that they get to the polls.” 
    
            Asked about polling showing most Democrats want a candidate other than Biden, Chavez Rodriguez said the campaign was “not taking anything in any vote for granted this election cycle.” 
    
            “We’re excited that we have built an incredible sort of early start for our campaign, the enthusiasm that we’re seeing from a broad coalition of supporters … we’re really excited to see that,” she said. “At the end of the day we know that that’s in stark contrast to the kind of extreme agenda we’re continuing to see from MAGA Republicans throughout the Republican field.”

      Rihanna continues breaking the rules of maternity style with a sultry new line for pregnant people

            When Rihanna was pregnant with her first child in 2022, she subverted many of the conservative social and sartorial boundaries of maternity style — regularly photographed attending events and red carpets in minidresses, heels and baby bump-baring garments with cutouts.
    
            Now, as the singer and businesswoman and her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, expect their second child, she’s expanding upon her pregnancy — and parenthood — aesthetic by designing and releasing a maternity capsule collection through lingerie brand Savage X Fenty.
    
            “The new maternity capsule is about bringing that confidence and comfort to moms at every stage of their journeys,” Rihanna said in a news release. “I want to remind people that you can still channel sexiness and feel-good while being a parent.”
    
            The new line features an oversized graphic tee with the cheeky message “Make More Babies” and three bralettes, all of which were both inspired by (and named after) Savage X Fenty’s most popular silhouettes — Savage X Cotton, Floral Lace and Savage Not Sorry.
    
            The capsule collection is designed to be comfortable and functional for moms and moms-to-be, but is “still giving savage with a little extra support, so every mom can feel like their best selves — whether it’s at home, on the go (or) with or without baby in tow,” according to the release.
    
            Each bra has been created with one-hand functionality for multitasking parents. Other features for comfort and convenience include a full nursing sling with a neckline-to-underarm opening, adjustable front-facing straps and back closures, and a set of nursing clasps that easily click into place.
    
            “When I found out I was pregnant, I thought to myself, ‘There’s no way I’m going to go shopping in no maternity aisle.’ I’m sorry — it’s too much fun to get dressed up,” Rihanna told Vogue for the magazine’s May 2022 cover story. “I’m not going to let that part disappear because my body is changing.”
    
            Savage X Fenty’s foray into maternity wear is the latest example of the brand’s commitment to greater inclusivity — across its clothing, accessories and beauty, sizing, campaigns and branding, and price points. Offered in sizes XS to 4X, the collection, the prices for which range from about $35 to $60, is available now online and in retailers.
    
            “We want to make people look good and feel good,” Rihanna said. “We want you to feel sexy and have fun doing it.”

      Opinion: For Republicans, the Ohio election result should set off a five-alarm fire
    ","

    ","
            The result in Ohio’s vote on a change to its referendum law underscored a political reality that Republicans are still coming to grips with. Pro-life politicians can, and do, rack up resounding victories, even after signing major restrictions on abortion into law. But when the topic of abortion itself is on the ballot — directly, or, in the case of Ohio, indirectly — the side in favor of expanding the right to abortion continues to hold the upper hand.
    
            Nominally, this week’s special election was about whether to raise the threshold for approving amendments to the Buckeye State’s constitution. But the amount of spending and energy around this proposition, known as Issue 1, showed that both sides of the abortion question knew what was at stake. Keeping the threshold for approval to a simple majority means that later this year, Ohio is likely to pass an initiative removing restrictions around the procedure until the point of fetal viability.
    
            That would put Ohio in a similar category to California, Vermont and Michigan, where voters have enshrined an expansive right to reproductive autonomy in their state constitutions. If the trend continues, other states, even those with a reddish hue, may be next.
    
            For the pro-life movement, this outcome should be a five-alarm fire. The disappointing trajectory in Ohio, following unexpected losses last year in Kansas and Kentucky, drives the fact home that no one who fought to see Roe v. Wade overturned, least of all me, had a satisfactory game plan for the battles that would ensue following Roe’s demise.
    
            On the other side of the equation, as Vox’s Rachel Cohen has explored, abortion rights advocates have developed a successful playbook. In red states, supporters of abortion access have not only made their pitch to Democrats, who would be expected to agree with them already, but have successfully appealed to independents and Republicans with qualms about abortion bans that can be painted as extreme or overreaching. That approach will continue to be successful, unless opponents of abortion adopt new strategies.
    
            For the pro-life side, the first action item has to be to stop the bleeding. A continued string of state initiative losses will be demoralizing to rank-and-file advocates and may convince Republican Party officials that the end of Roe was the true victory — and that the party should move on from the issue and stop talking about it publicly. Such an outcome would be disastrous for those who are motivated by the sincerely held belief that abortion is the taking of an unborn human life.
    
            One possibility for racking up a win could look like taking proactive steps in a state where abortion rights are still contested, like Florida. Pro-choice activists there are already gathering signatures to put an expansive reproductive rights amendment on the ballot. A surge of pro-life activism could offer a competing ballot measure that proffered, say, a 10-week abortion ban, when polling suggests there is more openness to restrictions than earlier in pregnancy, coupled with explicit, crystal-clear carveouts for cases of rape, incest or threats to the life of the mother.
    
            This would, of course, be a step back from the six-week ban signed into law by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year. And it may not be the purest version of abortion legislation pro-life forces would like to see. But an imperfect win is better than uncompromising losses. And, given the track record of abortion rights campaigns in even states governed by Republicans, pro-life forces will have to try something new to avoid the same fate.
    
            Their media strategy may need to change as well. As Semafor’s Dave Weigel has pointed out, abortion opponents have adopted a somewhat scattershot approach to their media strategy, running ads warning of “trans ideology” and drag queens in their quest to defeat reproductive rights amendments. That approach has not borne fruit. A more narrowly tailored strategy that allows pro-life leaders to focus on the more controversial abortion cases, like abortions around the point of fetal viability, could give the movement the rhetorical upper ground.
    
            Some national organizations that oppose abortion have focused their attention on trying to get presidential candidates to take a position on a federal ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Such a bill, of course, is politically implausible in the near- to medium-term – it would only be passable if Republicans had a friendly president in the White House, a GOP-controlled House and a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority in the Senate.
    
            Yet, while national organizations have pressed GOP presidential candidates to espouse a federal ban, a popular groundswell behind a federal 15-week ban is a long way off. A new poll, conducted for CNN by SSRS, found that even among voters who approve of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, two-thirds of respondents think politicians should leave decisions on abortion restrictions up to the states. Putting this push to bed, at least until the political winds change, may help focus attention on the need for both substantive policy shifts and rhetorical changes that could win over persuadable voters who aren’t firmly committed to either side of the question.
    
            There is plenty in the sweeping Ohio amendment that pro-life forces could target. As a staff editorial in the conservative magazine National Review pointed out, the amendment doesn’t explicitly say it will require state funds to be used to provide abortions, or wipe Ohio’s laws requiring parental consent for minors to obtain an abortion, off the books. But its sweeping language, eliminating laws that would “indirectly burden, penalize,…interfere with, or discriminate against” the right of an individual (of any age) to seek out an abortion makes those outcomes quite possible.
    
            Focusing on those specific areas of disagreement, rather than wide-ranging ads about drag queens, might make the vote in Ohio this November a little tighter than some observers expect. But like a football team that has found a weak point in the opposing defense, the abortion rights movement will continue to run its successful playbook.
    
            And unless those of us who consider ourselves pro-life make the requisite adjustments, we may be faced with the unwelcome sight of reproductive rights ballot amendments winning again and again.

      Opinion: A crushing loss for Republicans on abortion rights
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler
		","
  Updated
        11:34 AM EDT, Wed August 9, 2023
    ","
            Issue 1 was a trial balloon for the anti-abortion movement, not just in Ohio, but nationwide. If Republicans couldn’t win on abortion, the theory went, they could change the rules to require Democrats to win supermajority support to change state constitutions — a tall order in a country as polarized as this one, and all the more so in conservative states.
    
            Voters’ rejection of Issue 1 will give Republicans in other states second thoughts — especially since similar efforts to make it harder to get issues from medical marijuana to Medicaid expansion on the ballot have also tended to backfire.
    
            On Tuesday, Ohio voters went to the polls to weigh in on abortion, even if it didn’t seem that way. On the surface, the state’s Issue 1 appeared to be a vote on procedure: whether to raise the threshold for state constitutional amendments to a supermajority of 60% (and require that a certain percent of signatures for state ballot initiatives be gathered from different counties).
    
            But anyone paying attention knows that Ohio’s vote was a major proxy battle in the nation’s war on abortion, perhaps the most consequential to date. The Issue 1 vote may well be the biggest victory for abortion rights in the states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe last year. 
    
            There were six previous ballot initiative fights in other states before this one, all of them directly on abortion. And while abortion rights initiatives passed in conservative states before, they asked voters less direct questions: whether they wanted to preserve a status quo created by a state supreme court protecting abortion rights, or allow the state supreme court to decide the question — rather than declaring that the state constitution did not protect abortion.
    
            In a perennial battleground state, Michigan voters, by contrast, actually embraced abortion rights in last year’s midterms. With Issue 1 out of the way, it seems more likely that Ohio voters will do the same, and that’s no small thing.
    
            In recent years, Ohio has been anything but a swing state, with Republicans consistently scoring wins at the state and federal level. Now, Ohio voters have overwhelmingly rejected Issue 1. And with that off the table, abortion rights supporters seem set up for an even bigger win in the state in later this fall.
    
            This vote underscores just how potent abortion rights can be as an issue heading into the 2024 presidential election. The outcome in Ohio reinforces what the latest CNN poll shows: A record low of just 16% of voters don’t see abortion as a major issue.
    
            If anything, the poll shows a slight uptick in the importance of the abortion issue to voters since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade, a change that seems likely to help Democrats. Liberals are 14 percentage points more likely than conservatives to treat a candidate’s position on abortion as a litmus test, up from a four-point difference last January.
    
            But there are clear obstacles for Democrats to translate popular support for abortion rights into wins on Election Day.
    
            First, there are the structural disadvantages consistently plaguing the party. The Senate is structured to overrepresent small states where Republicans have an advantage. And another is that Republicans have an edge in the Electoral College — so much so that one team of economists estimated that Republicans would win one of six presidential races where they lost the popular vote.
    
            Democrats have to consistently translate support for abortion rights into votes for candidates, not just ballot measures. CNN’s recent poll found a high level of frustration among pro-choice voters with current party leadership. Nearly 80% of those who disapproved of the Supreme Court’s decision to reverse Roe felt that politicians at the federal level weren’t doing enough to protect abortion access (the figure at the state level, 60%, was also strikingly high).
    
            Simply invoking support for Roe — or promising to pass a federal law, like the Women’s Health Protection Act, to codify protection for abortion, may not be enough to motivate voters to turn out for Democrats. It’s one thing to turn voters out for abortion when a single initiative will decide a great deal about access in a state. It’s another to be motivated to vote for a candidate when it’s unclear what kind of tangible difference they could make, and there are other issues at play.
    
            That means Democrats have to think hard about how to message the abortion issue. That will require focus not just on what Democrats would like to do in an ideal world — steps that are unlikely to work given the Senate map in 2024 favors the GOP and the structural disadvantages the party faces.
    
            It will require Democrats to lay out what Republican control could mean for abortion access — federally and in the states. Republican presidential nominees are asked consistently about whether they support a national ban at 15 weeks, six weeks or even earlier in pregnancy. But none of those bans are likely to pass.
    
            Democrats should press them on more practical questions. Anti-abortion activists claim that the Comstock Act, a 19th century anti-vice law, is a de facto national ban on abortion. That’s because the statute, they say, prohibits the mailing of any item intended, designed or adapted for abortion. No clinic makes their own pills or surgical tools — every abortion in the US relies on some item put in the mail, and that’s why the Comstock Act, or at least abortion foes’ interpretation of it, could pose such a threat.
    
            Democrats should ask GOP hopefuls and congressional candidates whether they would enforce the Comstock Act and how — and should make clear that Democrats might stand a better chance at repealing Comstock than they do at passing robust protections for abortion rights.
    
            Democrats can warn about how access to the abortion pill mifepristone might change if a Republican president reshaped the US Food and Drug Administration. Republican attorneys general are backing a suit seeking to remove mifepristone from the market. They can also remind voters that a Republican might adopt the suggestion of some anti-abortion groups to sign an executive order recognizing limited forms of fetal personhood.
    
            Progressives believe that Democrats could do more on abortion, and they aren’t wrong. But political caution and possible losses in court make big, bold steps unlikely in the near term —and even potentially less likely to work.
    
            Still, the Ohio vote is a reminder that Democrats can do a lot with the abortion issue if they play their cards right: Even if Democrats can’t get rid of Dobbs, the ruling that overturned abortion rights, in the near term, they can remind America’s pro-choice majority just how much worse things can get.

      Opinion: America’s child care crisis is about to get a lot worse
    ","
			Opinion by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Tina Smith
		","
  Updated
        11:14 AM EDT, Wed August 9, 2023
    ","
            In the early weeks of the pandemic, as a surging virus shuttered child care centers across the country, the two of us got together and outlined a vision for $50 billion in emergency funding to keep centers afloat and preserve a vital safety net for parents. We fought to secure that funding, and we won.
    
            Now, a new crisis looms for working families: Federal child care funding is about to take a nose dive off a cliff as much of that pandemic relief expires at the end of September, and Republicans refuse to make any new investments in early education funding.
    
            If the Republicans have their way, more than 3 million babies will lose their child care — at a minimum — and millions of parents will be forced to scramble for other arrangements or leave the workforce altogether.
    
            But there is a glimmer of light. Some members of Congress have indicated they may support increased funding for a few federal programs, including disaster relief and aid for Ukraine. President Joe Biden and Democrats should use this opening and insist that emergency child care funding be part of any supplemental spending package.
    
            For decades, the economics of child care in America have been badly broken. Care is hard to find — especially for babies too young to enter kindergarten. And even when families are lucky enough to score a spot, the costs are crushing. In fact, Care.com’s annual Cost of Care Report found that, on average, American families are spending more than a quarter of their income on child care in 2023. At the same time, child care providers struggle to make ends meet, and workers make poverty-level wages for their powerfully important and difficult work in most states.
    
            The Covid-19 pandemic was the latest blow to the industry, but it was also a wake-up call. In normal years, the federal government spends just $13 billion on child care, compared to $712 billion on defense. In fact, the US is 33rd out of the 37 richest nations in child care investments — behind Mexico and Romania. But emergency funding reached more than eight out of every 10 child care providers nationwide, providing them with enough money to raise wages temporarily for workers without raising costs for parents. That support also meant millions more parents could go to work knowing their children were in good hands.
    
            As the pandemic relief expires, a bad problem will get worse. The child care industry is still short nearly 50,000 child care workers. Child care directors are already preparing to face impossible choices: slashing salaries for child care workers or raising costs on parents. Child care analysts estimate that 70,000 child care programs will close if emergency child care funding expires. That means nearly a quarter of a million child care workers could lose their jobs, and 3.2 million children could lose child care.
    
            One way to address this crisis would be for Congress to increase the annual appropriations for child care and early education, but thanks to MAGA Republicans’ use of the debt ceiling to hold the US economy hostage, Congress is restricted by spending caps. But there’s one last sliver of opportunity: Congress is now considering additional emergency funding outside of annual appropriations for disaster relief, the military and Ukraine. Why not address the child care emergency, too?
    
            Reporting indicates the Biden administration is preparing a supplemental request for emergency funding. If the president is serious about his commitment to America’s families — and his strong track record indicates that he is — then that request should include additional funding to address the child care emergency, just the same as for disaster relief, the military and Ukraine. And Congress should approve it quickly.
    
            Experts estimate that $16 billion would prevent the child care sector from falling off the pandemic funding cliff, giving child care providers support to retain their staffs and keep open the classrooms that parents rely on. And we know other leaders in the fight for child care funding — like our Senate colleagues Tim Kaine and Patty Murray — are ready to help get this done.
    
            In the longer term, Congress needs to pass the big structural reforms and long-term funding that will permanently fix our broken child care system. This will help to ensure that all families can find high-quality, reliable and affordable child care, and that child care workers are paid the wages they deserve.

      9-year-old girl fatally shot by neighbor in front of her father after buying ice cream and riding her scooter, prosecutors allege

    ","
            A 9-year-old girl was fatally shot in front of her Chicago home by a neighbor, who allegedly fired the gun at her before her father ran toward the shooter and tackled him to the ground, according to a legal document CNN obtained Tuesday.
    
            Michael Goodman, 43, is charged with first-degree murder in the killing of the child, who rode her scooter to buy ice cream from a nearby ice cream truck before the shooting Saturday evening, according to the document.
    
            The shooting comes as the US continues to grapple with widespread gun violence, which is the leading cause of death in children and teenagers in the country.
    
            Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. Nearly 3,600 children died in gun-related incidents that year.
    
            Before Saturday’s shooting, the girl’s father was talking to friends who were in a vehicle in front of his Portage Park residence while his daughter, identified as “V,” was riding her scooter, according to the document, known as a bond proffer. 
    
            The father heard a gunshot and told his daughter to take her scooter back to the apartment. 
    
            “As V approached the front door of her apartment building, D (shooter) emerged from his apartment building across the street holding a firearm,” the document states.
    
            The father and other witnesses saw the neighbor – identified as Michael Goodman – across the street as he approached the child, and the father shouted at the neighbor “what he was doing,” according to the document.
    
            “While V’s father ran to his daughter, he observed D raise the firearm, point it at the V, and shoot the V in the head. V’s father tackled D into the vestibule and as they both fell to the ground the gun discharged, striking D in the eye,” the document said.  
    
            The child was taken to a hospital where she was pronounced dead. The suspect was arrested and taken to a hospital.  
    
            Police swabbed the suspect’s hands while he was in the hospital, and they tested positive for gunshot residue, the document said.  A 9 mm Canik firearm was recovered outside the apartment. 
    
            Goodman is being held without bail at authorities’ request. 
    
            “The defendant is responsible for the death of a person and the defendant was armed with a firearm and that he personally discharged that firearm and it proximately caused death to another individual,” the document states. 
    
            The gun violence epidemic in the United States was deadlier than ever in 2021, according to a report released this year by the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.
    
            Both gun-related homicides and suicides reached record levels in 2021, leading to nearly 49,000 total firearm deaths.
    
            Firearm-related deaths soared during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and spiked again in the second year. The 8% jump – leading to about 3,600 more deaths in 2021 than in 2020 – was the largest single-year increase in four decades.
    
            “Our country is breaking records for all the wrong reasons – record gun sales combined with increasingly permissive gun laws are making gun violence a pervasive part of life in our country, leading to a sharp increase in gun deaths,” Ari Davis, policy adviser at the center and lead author of the report, said in a statement.
    
            More than half of all firearm deaths, as well as most of the year-over-year increase, were suicides, the report found.

      4 takeaways from abortion rights advocates’ Ohio win
    ","
			By Eric Bradner, CNN

  Published
        12:11 AM EDT, Wed August 9, 2023
    ","
            Abortion rights advocates on Tuesday won a critical victory in Ohio, beating back a measure that would have made their push to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution more difficult.
    
            CNN projected that voters in the state rejected a proposal known as Issue 1. Placed on the ballot during what’s ordinarily a sleepy August by Ohio’s Republican-controlled legislature, at the urging of Secretary of State and GOP Senate hopeful Frank LaRose, the proposal would have raised the threshold to pass constitutional amendments from a simple majority to a 60% vote. It was widely seen as a proxy battle over the proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights that will be on Ohio’s ballots in November. 
    
            That effort backfired spectacularly on Tuesday, demonstrating that – even in red states – Republicans are at odds with the electorate on the issue of abortion rights. 
    
            Their victory on Issue 1 is certain to energize supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment as the state begins what’s likely to be an expensive and acrimonious three-month sprint to the November vote. 
    
            Here are four takeaways from Ohio’s election: 
    
            Ohio’s August election would ordinarily have been a sleepy, low-turnout affair. In fact, the Republican-led state government had just enacted a law that effectively ended August special elections there. Then they backtracked and scheduled Tuesday’s contest. 
    
            Mail-in and early voting for this election had already surpassed 2022 primary voting before Election Day even began. And strong turnout across the state on Tuesday had sent the overall turnout far beyond typical August elections, toward gubernatorial election territory with many more votes to count. 
    
            The results underscore the new political reality, one that’s been repeatedly demonstrated in both blue and red states: Since the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, abortion rights are a major, driving force. GOP efforts to deliver long-promised abortion bans to the conservative base are triggering the sort of electoral backlash the party was able to escape while Roe v. Wade was in force. 
    
            Last summer, deep-red Kansas kicked off a wave of victories for abortion rights advocates and setbacks for the anti-abortion movement that had just celebrated the moment it sought for nearly five decades. Since then, voters in Kentucky and Montana have also rejected anti-abortion measures in statewide votes (though abortion remains banned in Kentucky). And the electorates in Michigan, California and Vermont have approved constitutional amendments protecting abortion rights. 
    
            Perhaps the most politically revealing battles have come in swing states. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made her support for that measure the centerpiece of her reelection bid in the crucial swing state in last year’s midterms. And this spring in Wisconsin, the progressive candidate won a state Supreme Court race after she centered her campaign on abortion rights – and is now the swing vote on a court that will likely decide the future of the state’s 1849 abortion ban.
    
            The November vote on the proposed constitutional amendment will decide the future of abortion rights in Ohio – the state from where a 10-year-old rape victim traveled to Indiana for an abortion last year, days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
    
            If it is approved, the amendment would trump Ohio’s 2019 law that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy without exceptions for rape or incest. It is currently the subject of a court battle.
    
            Ohio was once the most important presidential bellwether state on the map. In recent elections, it has shifted right – with former President Donald Trump carrying the Buckeye State twice and Republicans controlling the state government. 
    
            Tuesday’s outcome demonstrated that despite the state’s rightward drift, Republicans’ opposition to abortion rights continues to hamstring the party – and legislative pushes such as Issue 1 could shift the focus of elections in key states onto politically problematic ground for the GOP. 
    
            A CNN poll conducted by SSRS released Tuesday showed that Americans’ discontent with the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade remains as potent as it was a year ago, with a record-high share of the public saying that they’re likely to take a candidate’s position on abortion into consideration when voting. 
    
            A 64% majority of US adults say they disapprove of last year’s Supreme Court ruling that women do not have a constitutional right to an abortion, with half strongly disapproving – an assessment that’s almost entirely unchanged from CNN’s poll last July in the immediate wake of the decision. 
    
            The new poll suggests that the issue’s importance as an electoral litmus test hasn’t diminished. In May 2022, immediately after the leaked draft of the Dobbs decision, 26% of Americans said they would only vote for a candidate who shared their views on abortion. In the latest poll, that number stands at 29%. Another 55% say they’d consider a candidate’s position on abortion as one of many important factors, for a combined total of 84% who say they’re likely to pay attention to candidate’s position on abortion when voting. Just 16% say they don’t see abortion as a major issue, a record low in CNN polling dating back to 1996. 
    
            Beyond the November referendum – which will dominate political headlines in Ohio and nationally in the coming months – a key question is whether the battle over abortion rights will carry over into Ohio’s 2024 Senate race. 
    
            The incumbent, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, is one of the top Republican targets as they seek to retake the Senate majority. 
    
            LaRose, who was the most vocal advocate for Issue 1, is among the GOP contenders seeking to take Brown on – something Democrats would be sure to make a focal point of their attacks on the secretary of state should he win the GOP nomination. 
    
            However, the November vote could settle the issue of abortion rights in Ohio for good, raising questions about how effective those Democratic attacks would be a year later.

      CNN Projection: Ohio voters reject effort that would make it harder to amend state constitution
    ","

    ","
            Ohio voters rejected Tuesday an effort to raise the threshold to amend the state’s constitution ahead of a November referendum on whether to constitutionally guarantee abortion rights there, handing abortion rights advocates a critical victory.
    
            Known as Issue 1, the measure would have changed Ohio’s referendum law – lifting the threshold to amend the state’s constitution from a simple majority to 60% of the vote.
    
            Its passage would have effectively raised new obstacles to direct democracy, making it harder for citizens to bypass the Ohio legislature with referendums. 
    
            The measure was a GOP-led effort targeting an upcoming November referendum in which voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution. 
    
            A broad coalition that rallied Ohioans to “Vote No” on Issue 1 declared victory on Tuesday night in downtown Columbus and vowed to mount an aggressive campaign to protect abortion rights on the November ballot.
    
            “Ohio, we did it. Tonight is a major victory for democracy in Ohio,” said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for the coalition One Person, One Vote. “The majority still rules for democracy in Ohio. The people’s power has been preserved.”
    
            Effectively, Tuesday was the first of a two-step process, determining whether November’s referendum would be able to pass with a simple majority – 50% plus one vote – or need to meet the higher threshold of 60% plus one vote.
    
            If the abortion measure is approved by voters in that November election, the amendment would trump Ohio’s 2019 law that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy without exceptions for rape or incest. It is currently the subject of a court battle.
    
            Dr. Marcela Azevedo, the leader of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, thanked voters for rejecting Issue 1.
    
            “Together, we’ve delivered this unbelievable and amazing, but absolutely true result of what Ohioans really want,” Azevedo said. “The energy and enthusiasm we witnessed in the last few weeks has been both overwhelming and inspiring.” 
    
            The sprint to November’s referendum has made Ohio the next major battleground in the fight over abortion rights after the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade last year. 
    
            Already, voters in two deep-red states, Kansas and Kentucky, have rejected efforts to limit abortion rights (though abortion is still banned in Kentucky). The Democratic push to enshrine abortion rights in Michigan’s constitution played a key role in the party’s victories there in the 2022 midterm elections. 
    
            President Joe Biden and his reelection campaign heralded the election results Tuesday night.
    
            The president criticized what he called Ohio Republican lawmakers’ “blatant attempt to weaken voters’ voices and further erode the freedom of women to make their own health care decisions.” He added in his statement, “Ohioans spoke loud and clear, and tonight democracy won.”
    
            The leaders of the coalition in Ohio made clear that Tuesday’s victory was the beginning – not the end – of the campaign to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. They said the work on that effort begins Wednesday.
    
            Tuesday’s referendum was broadly opposed by Democrats and progressive groups. Republicans and conservative interests were split on the measure. GOP Gov. Mike DeWine supported Issue 1, as did the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, Ohio Right to Life, the Buckeye Firearms Association and more. 
    
            “The concern is that people can come in, outside forces, outside the state of Ohio and spend a ton of money to try to impact that. The better process is frankly, through the legislative process,” DeWine told Ohio reporters in May.
    
            But two GOP former governors, John Kasich and Bob Taft, opposed it. Kasich, who suffered a political setback when voters overturned a controversial anti-union law in 2011, said on Twitter in April that seeking to limit voters’ say on public policy measures is wrong.
    
            “I’ve experienced that firsthand, having policies backed by myself and a majority of the legislature’s members overturned at the ballot box, and it never occurred to me to try to limit Ohioans’ right to do that,” he said. “It wouldn’t have been right then, and it isn’t right now.”
    
            Outside groups poured more than $26 million into advertising on both sides. Protect Our Constitution, a group focused on passing Issue 1, had spent almost $2.7 million on advertising, according to AdImpact data. Protect Women Ohio, a group focused on fighting new protections for abortion in November, had spent $7 million ahead of the Tuesday vote.
    
            Even ahead of Tuesday’s vote, there were indications of strong voter interest in the measure. About 696,000 Ohioans had voted before Election Day, either early or by mail – a number that exceeded the 638,000-voter turnout in the August 2022 primary and special election. 
    
            The November referendum will also set the stage for a crucial 2024 election: Ohio’s Senate race. The incumbent, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, is among the GOP’s top targets as the party seeks to retake the Senate majority. 
    
            Among his Republican challengers is Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the state’s elections chief and the highest-profile proponent of Issue 1. In a video posted Tuesday on Twitter, LaRose touted holding 76 events in favor of the measure.

      6-year-old boy who shot teacher later boasted about it, affidavit says

    ","
            A 6-year-old who shot his teacher in January later boasted in a conversation with a school employee that “I shot that b[ ] dead,” according to unsealed redacted search warrants.
    
            The documents obtained from CNN affiliate WTKR describe what happened after first grade teacher Abigail Zwerner was shot on January 6 at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia.
    
            “I did it,” the boy told school officials, according to police in an affidavit. “I got my mom’s gun last night.”
    
            Unsealed records of Zwerner’s statement to police at the hospital said that when the boy drew the weapon from his pocket and pointed it at her, she asked, “What are you doing with that?”
    
            Zwerner told authorities the boy paused, “then fired one shot that struck Zwerner in her left hand and upper torso,” the affidavit obtained by affiliate WTKR said. Zwerner fled the classroom to the school office, according to the affidavit.
    
            The teacher suffered gunshot wounds to her hand and chest but survived.
    
            A lawyer for the child’s family told CNN Tuesday, “The child had extreme emotional issues, and we are all working to see that he improves every day.”
    
            James Ellenson, the attorney, also said the child is in therapy and has shown improvement. Representatives for the family had previously said the student suffers from an “acute disability.”
    
            The documents also included more information about a previous incident in kindergarten where the same child apparently choked a different teacher. 
    
            Authorities spoke to that teacher, who described that the student “walked behind her while she was sitting in her chair and placed both of his arms around her neck pulling down, choking her to the point she could not breathe,” according to the documents.
    
            A teacher’s assistant forcibly removed the student from the classroom, according to the documents. 
    
            Police said they worked to obtain limited school records pertaining to the child from Child Protective Services, records on the choking incident, and other information, but those records were not readily provided by Newport News Public Schools.
    
            Newport News Public Schools, in a statement Tuesday, said: “Since the tragedy at Richneck Elementary School in January, Newport News Public Schools has worked cooperatively with the Newport News Police Department and other authorities in support of the investigation. While the school division cannot comment on legal actions, NNPS remains committed to ensuring the well-being and care of all students and staff.
    
            The mother of the student pleaded guilty to federal gun charges in connection with the incident as part of a plea deal, and will be sentenced in October.
    
            Deja Taylor will plead guilty to a state charge of child neglect on August 15, Ellenson told CNN.
    
            A state charge for recklessly handling a firearm will be dropped at the time of the plea, according to Ellenson. “The cap for sentencing on the child neglect charge is six months,” the attorney said.
    
            Sentencing on the federal charges will be October 18. A separate sentencing on the state charge will take place October 27.

      CNN Poll: Abortion’s role as an electoral litmus test hasn’t faded a year after Supreme Court decision overturning Roe
    ","

    ","
            Americans’ discontent with the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade remains as potent as it was a year ago, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, with a record-high share of the public saying that they’re likely to take a candidate’s position on abortion into consideration when voting.
    
            A 64% majority of US adults say they disapprove of last year’s Supreme Court ruling that women do not have a constitutional right to an abortion, with half strongly disapproving – an assessment that’s almost entirely unchanged from CNN’s poll last July in the immediate wake of the decision. 
    
            The new poll suggests that the issue’s importance as an electoral litmus test hasn’t diminished. In May 2022, immediately after the leaked draft of the Dobbs decisions, 26% of Americans said they would only vote for a candidate who shared their views on abortion. In the latest poll, that number stands at 29%. Another 55% say they’d consider a candidate’s position on abortion as one of many important factors, for a combined total of 84% who say they’re likely to pay attention to candidate’s position on abortion when voting. Just 16% say they don’t see abortion as a major issue, a record low in CNN polling dating back to 1996.
    
            “Female friends and I don’t feel safe in this country as a whole,” Jenna Boggess, a 31-year-old Ohio resident who participated in the poll, said via email. “My life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness is constantly under attack in my own state and country.”
    
            She planned to vote this week against Issue 1, a measure that would raise the threshold of support needed to change the Ohio constitution, ahead of a November ballot measure on abortion, calling it “one of the most important votes I’ll participate in.” At the same time, she said, she was “disheartened that abortion is on the political platform at all” at a time when global issues also demand attention.
    
            About one-third of Americans who approve of the Supreme Court’s ruling, 34%, now say they’d like to see anti-abortion politicians attempt to implement nationwide abortion bans, rather than leaving the issue up to individual states. While that remains the minority opinion, it’s an increase from just 20% who felt that way last year. Support for additional restrictions is particularly concentrated among abortion opponents who are younger than 45, or born-again or evangelical Christians.
    
            “The saddest part for me, personally, is the fact that you have decided to take religion, and God, and Jesus out of the country,” said Tony Stamper, a 53-year-old who also participated in the poll and said he was happy to see abortion banned in his state of Kentucky. Overturning Roe, he said, “was a good move, but we’ve got a long way to go.” 
    
            Most of those who opposed the ruling, meanwhile, remain dissatisfied with their side’s political response. Among those who disapprove of the Dobbs decision, a 78% majority say that politicians in the federal government who support legalizing abortion aren’t doing enough to ensure abortion access, with 60% saying that politicians in their state’s government are similarly doing too little. 
    
            President Joe Biden’s approval rating on abortion policy stands at 40% among the full public, similar to his overall 41% job approval rating.
    
            While the importance of abortion has risen across ideological lines, the change is particularly sharp on the left. Self-described liberals are now 14 percentage points likelier than self-described conservatives to say that they’d treat a candidate’s views on abortion as a litmus test, up from a 4-point difference last January.
    
            Across the federal, state and personal levels, Americans as a whole say that the effects of overturning Roe have been more negative than positive. A 64% majority say the decision has had a negative effect on the country, 54% that’s it’s negatively affected women in their state, and 21% that it’s negatively affected their own family. Only one-quarter see the decision as a positive for the country, with even fewer seeing it as beneficial on the state or individual level. 
    
            Americans are more likely to see the decision as impactful nationally than personally: 69% say the ruling hasn’t personally affected them or their family, while just 25% say it’s had no effect on women in their state, and only 10% that it’s had no effect nationally. 
    
            Results from the same poll released last week showed that when asked to name the most important issue facing the country, 6% of Americans mention abortion or reproductive rights and 2% mention women’s rights or women’s health. That’s far below the 44% naming economic issues, but an elevated level of concern compared with summer 2021, when fewer than 1% mentioned abortion as their top priority.  
    
            Reactions to the Supreme Court’s ruling and views of America’s post-Roe era often diverge significantly along partisan, demographic and regional lines. Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans to say that overturning Roe has negatively affected the country, and roughly four times as likely to say it had a major negative effect on the US. A 62% majority of women younger than 45 say they strongly disapprove of the Dobbs decision, and 34% say that overturning Roe has negatively affected them and their family, both higher than the figures among older women or men of any age.
    
            While just 26% of Americans in states where abortion remains legal find their state’s laws too restrictive, that rises in states where abortion is banned (45%) and those where it is legal but with gestational limits of 6 to 18 weeks (47%). More than half of women and Americans younger than 45 living in states with abortion bans call their state’s laws too restrictive, as do more than 80% of Democratic-aligned residents in those states.
    
            And among those who opposed the Dobbs decision, majorities of those living in states where abortion is banned (76%) or limited (78%) say that politicians in their state are not doing enough to ensure abortion access, a view shared by a smaller 48% of those living in states where abortion is currently legal. 
    
            The view that abortion is a key voting issue is most common among partisans whose views on the topic align with their party – meaning that it might be more likely to further entrench polarized voters than to help swing wavering ones. Thirty-six percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who disapprove of overturning Roe say they’d only vote for a politician who shared their views on abortion, as do 30% of Republicans and Republican-leaners who approve of the decision. By contrast, just 12% of Republican-aligned Americans who disapprove of overturning Roe say they consider it a crucial voting issue.
    
            Women as a whole are 8 percentage points likelier than men to say they consider abortion a significant voting issue, with that modest gender divide concentrated among Democrats and independents. Four in 10 White, college-educated women – a crucial part of the Democratic base – say a candidate must share their views on the topic.
    
            The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from July 1 through July 31 among a random national sample of 1,279 adults initially reached by mail. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

      How Ohio’s ballot vote could preview the 2024 politics of abortion
    ","
			Analysis by Ronald Brownstein

        10:17 AM EDT, Tue August 8, 2023
    ","
            The ballot initiative Ohio voters will decide Tuesday is likely to demonstrate again the continuing public resistance to last year’s Supreme Court decision ending the nationwide constitutional right to abortion – while also offering an early indication about how broadly that backlash may benefit Democrats in the 2024 election. 
    
            Ohio voters are facing a measure placed on the ballot by state Republicans that would require future initiatives to change the state Constitution to receive 60% of the vote to be approved. The change would apply to amendments on all subjects, but the campaign has become a proxy test of attitudes about abortion in the state. Almost everyone agrees Republicans and their allies in the anti-abortion movement have advanced this proposal to end majority rule on ballot initiatives because they fear that a majority of Ohio voters will support a separate ballot initiative in November to overturn the six-week abortion ban approved by the GOP-controlled state legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.
    
            Abortion rights advocates are feeling confident about winning both today’s vote and the follow-on election in November to restore abortion rights in the state. “If I were on the ground in Ohio, I’d be feeling very good about the work I was doing,” said Angela Vasquez-Giroux vice president of communications and research at NARAL Pro-Choice America, a leading abortion rights group. 
    
            If Ohio voters on Tuesday reject the measure, known as Issue 1, to require super-majorities for future initiatives, it would underscore the broad public support for maintaining legal access to abortion, even in most states that now lean strongly toward Republicans. A massive 2022 polling project by the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute found that a majority of voters in 43 states said they believe abortion should remain legal in all or most circumstances. 
    
            Those attitudes have translated into results at the ballot box. Since the Republican-appointed US Supreme Court majority overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, abortion rights supporters have triumphed each time voters have had the opportunity in a ballot initiative to directly decide whether abortion should remain legal in their state. That pattern has extended through red states (including Kansas, Kentucky and Montana) and blue (such as California and Vermont). Another victory on Tuesday in Ohio, a state former President Donald Trump won comfortably in both 2016 and 2020, will encourage advocates to press ballot initiatives restoring abortion rights next year in other traditionally Republican-leaning states where GOP governors and legislators have restricted or banned the procedure, including Florida, South Dakota, Missouri and possibly Arizona.
    
            But while an Ohio victory may generate momentum for abortion rights advocates, it could also demonstrate the big political challenge still confronting them. While the abortion rights’ side has consistently won ballot initiatives, the issue’s impact on electoral campaigns has been much more uneven.
    
            In 2022, promises to defend abortion rights proved a powerful weapon for Democratic candidates in Democratic-leaning and swing states, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – places where abortion primarily remains legal. But in more red-leaning states, such as Florida, Texas, Iowa and Ohio itself, Democrats in 2022 were unable to generate any meaningful backlash against Republican state officials who imposed severe abortion bans-even though polls, including both the PRRI project and local surveys, showed most voters in those places supported maintaining legal abortion. That was especially true in Ohio, where DeWine cruised to a landslide reelection after signing the restrictive abortion ban that voters appear poised to repeal this year.
    
            “Ballot measures can win in very hard places that Democrats will struggle to win because it’s just an up or down [vote] on where you are about abortion,” said Molly Murphy, a Democratic pollster. But, she added, “in red states voters may use other issues” such as crime or immigration “more heavily than abortion” in deciding which candidate shares their values most.
    
            Ohio will present a critical test of whether Democrats in 2024 can more effectively convert support for abortion rights into votes against red state Republicans who oppose those rights. It is one of the three states most likely to determine which party controls the next Senate. Democratic senators in those three states – Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Jon Tester in Montana and Joe Manchin in West Virginia – are the last three Democrats holding any of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Trump in 2020. All three of those seats will be on the ballot next November. “What’s really going to be important for folks in these Senate races is to underscore for voters, your rights are important to me, I’m here to protect and restore your rights,” said Vasquez-Giroux. “We need candidates to be out front.”
    
            In a conference call with Democratic activists earlier this month, Brown portrayed Tuesday’s vote as the start of a chain reaction that could help him defy the state’s rightward drift. “If we get our people to the polls, we win this overwhelmingly,” Brown said about Issue 1. “That will give us momentum for the November vote on protecting women’s rights, and it will give us momentum then for our elections next year.”
    
            That could happen. But it would require Brown and abortion-rights advocates to break the pattern from 2022, when the issue, somewhat paradoxically, benefited Democrats more in places where the procedure remained legal than in places where it was banned.
    
            On a national basis, support for abortion rights clearly helped Democrats hold down their losses in the House of Representatives: more than three-fifths of voters said they supported legal abortion and almost three-fourths of them backed Democratic candidates for the House, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. And, the exit polls found, in most key swing states abortion likewise benefited Democrats running in gubernatorial and US Senate races against Republicans who opposed abortion rights.
    
            A remarkably similar 62% to 63% of voters supported legal abortion in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona, the exit polls found, and Democrats won the governorships in all four – carrying over four-fifths of those pro-choice voters in the first two states and almost exactly three-fourths of them in the latter two. Huge margins among voters who supported abortion rights also keyed Democratic Senate wins last year in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Arizona and Nevada. And abortion rights was the critical issue that powered a landslide Democratic victory in a Wisconsin state Supreme Court election last spring.
    
            But in more solidly Republican-leaning states, Democrats faced, as I wrote last November, a “double whammy.” While most voters in those states also supported abortion rights, the majorities recorded in the exit polls were in the range of 53% to 58%, narrower than in the purple (much less blue) states. As important, compared to the swing states, Republican candidates in the red states frequently won a higher percentage of voters who said they supported abortion rights. In Florida, for instance, both Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio carried almost exactly one-third of voters who backed legal abortion, the exit polls found; in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp, who signed a six-week abortion ban, carried nearly 3 in 10 voters who supported legal abortion, and strikingly won nearly three-fourths of all White women. Apart from Arizona, which has been trending away from the GOP, Democrats didn’t flip the governor’s seat in any state that restricted or banned abortion; Democrats didn’t dislodge a GOP state legislative majority in any state that retrenched abortion rights.
    
            Jim Henson, executive director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, said in that state Republicans were able to overcome majority public opposition to their sweeping abortion ban mostly by convincing voters to focus more on other issues. That success reflected both Democratic weakness and Republican strength. In Texas, as in other red states, Henson notes, the Democratic party is too weak to shape what issues define the public debate. “You lose influence over the public discussion,” Henson said. Rather than abortion, which split even their supporters, Texas Republicans like Gov. Greg Abbott were able to keep voters in their coalition focused on the issues where they agree with the party, particularly border security. “It’s about agenda management and the salience of issues,” Henson said.
    
            In Ohio, a six-week abortion ban without exceptions for rape or incest signed by DeWine in 2019 went into effect after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe last summer. The policy immediately generated enormous controversy when a 10-year-old rape victim had to travel to neighboring Indiana to obtain an abortion. But the issue proved barely a speed bump for Ohio Republicans in the November election, even though the exit poll found 58% of voters there wanted abortion to remain mostly legal (and the PRRI survey put support for legal abortion even higher).
    
            Republicans in the state legislature were insulated from any backlash by a severe partisan gerrymander. DeWine scored a landslide reelection victory, and Republican J.D. Vance notched a solid win over Democrat Tim Ryan in the US Senate race. Exit polls found that nearly one-third of voters who supported legal abortion backed Vance, and that DeWine carried 43% of voters who favored abortion rights – much more than any other Republican governor in the states where exit polls were conducted.
    
            Operatives in both parties cite multiple reasons why opposition to the abortion ban didn’t hurt Ohio Republicans more. One reason is that the law’s impact was muffled when a state court blocked implementation of it before the election. In the Senate race, another factor was that Ryan, in his intent focus on recapturing blue-collar White workers, downplayed the issue. And DeWine benefited not only from a massive funding advantage over his Democratic opponent, former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, but also from good grades for his handling of the pandemic among many of the college-educated voters most dubious of abortion bans.
    
            Jeff Rusnak, a long-time Ohio-based Democratic consultant, says that while abortion mostly fizzled in the statewide contests, it was an effective issue for Democrats in several of their surprising Ohio congressional wins last year. And he echoes many Democrats there who believe that support for legal abortion could prove a more powerful asset for Brown next year.
    
            A key reason for the Democrats’ decline in Ohio, Rusnak noted, is that they haven’t matched the party’s performance with female voters in other states across the region, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. But increased focus on abortion, he maintains, could reverse that. “This is the kind of issue that touches everybody,” he said. “There are large numbers of people who feel very strongly about this, whether you are in an urban, suburban or rural area of this state. They don’t want government interfering, they don’t want government making these decisions for them.”
    
            The abortion-related ballot initiative votes on Tuesday and in November will keep the issue front and center for voters. And if Ohio votes to restore abortion rights in November, that could make voters there particularly sensitive to the risk that Republicans might override that decision by passing a nationwide abortion ban if they win unified control of Congress and the White House next year. (Conversely, a Republican victory on either Issue 1 or the November ballot measure about abortion would signal that receptivity to GOP arguments has reached a level in Ohio that will be extremely difficult for Brown to surmount.)
    
            Both of the leading GOP contenders to oppose Brown have taken strongly anti-abortion positions, with Secretary of State Frank LaRose, probably the slight front-runner for the nomination, positioning himself as the leading advocate of Issue 1 and a staunch backer of the state’s six-week abortion ban. LaRose’s main rival, the Trump-allied business owner Bernie Moreno, has described himself as “100 percent pro-life with no exceptions.”
    
            LaRose recently frustrated other Republicans when he directly linked Tuesday’s vote to the abortion ban. Republicans have focused their campaign for Issue 1 on the argument that the current rules will allow out of state interests to flood the state with money and engrave a wide-ranging wish list of liberal priorities into the Ohio Constitution. (Ads supporting the initiative have referenced drag shows, gender-affirming care for transgender minors, and parental rights, hot button issues for GOP voters.) But at a May GOP dinner, LaRose was recorded saying: “Some people say this is all about abortion. Well, you know what? It’s 100% about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment out of our Constitution.”
    
            David Pepper, the former Democratic state party chair, said on a podcast last week that while polling and early vote results are promising for opponents, a late turnout surge of culturally conservative GOP voters could still pass Issue 1. And anti-abortion groups are pushing hard on its behalf. “Issue 1…safeguards Ohio’s constitution against outside groups pushing extreme amendments,” said Sue Liebel, director of state affairs and Midwest regional director for SBA Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, in a statement.
    
            But the measure has drawn broad bipartisan opposition, including from multiple former Ohio Republican governors and attorneys general. One long-time GOP operative in the state closely following the debate told me he anticipates the state will reject Issue 1 and then approve the November measure to override the state’s abortion ban, perhaps resoundingly in each case. 
    
            “I am as confident as I can be that it’s going to pass in November, based on everything I’ve seen over and over again,” said the GOP operative, who asked for anonymity while discussing the state of the contests. “The abortion law that was passed … was way out of kilter with what people think in Ohio.”
    
            Banning abortion appears equally “out of kilter” with majority public sentiment in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – all swing states where Democrats must defend Senate seats next year. And in all those places, Democratic Senate candidates are likely to stress the possibility that Republicans will seek a nationwide abortion ban if they win control of the chamber. Democratic polls have found that most voters expect the GOP to pursue such a national prohibition if it captures the majority. “Abortion is going to be one of the defining issues of the cycle,” said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “Voters are as angry about the overturn of Roe and what it means to them today as when it happened.”
    
            But even if abortion helps Democrats hold all of those precarious seats, they would still likely lose their Senate majority unless they can win two of the three races in the more reliably Republican terrain of West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. Democrats can afford a net loss of only one Senate seat, even if they retain the White House next year, and with it the tie-breaking Senate vote of Vice President Kamala Harris.
    
            If Manchin seeks reelection, he’s unlikely to stress the issue in West Virginia (he was the lone Senate Democrat last year to vote to uphold a Republican filibuster on a bill to restore the nationwide right to abortion). But abortion almost certainly will need to play a leading role if Brown in Ohio and Tester in Montana are to survive the Republican current in their state-particularly in a presidential election year. Control of the Senate may pivot on whether support for legal abortion proves decisive for more voters in red America next year than it did in 2022.

      Ohio special election becomes proxy for abortion rights fight
    ","

    ","
            A Tuesday special election in Ohio puts the state at the center of the abortion rights debate – even though the issue isn’t technically on the ballot. 
    
            At stake are the rules for amending the state constitution in the future. The question on the ballot, known as Issue 1, asks whether Ohio voters should be able to change the constitution with a simple majority vote or whether it should take a higher, 60% majority threshold. If Issue 1 passes (it needs only a simple majority of “yes” voters), it will be in place when a separate measure to enshrine new abortion rights into the constitution is on the ballot in November.
    
            To put it more simply: Abortion rights advocates want Issue 1 to fail and anti-abortion advocates want it to pass. 
    
            “For me, as an old-fashioned conservative, should it be hard to amend the constitution? Yes, I think it should be hard to amend the constitution. But of course, there’s these other things going on too, let’s all face it. This is about the November election. This is about abortion. And this is about a lot of things in addition to the philosophical approach to amending the constitution,” said Doug Preisse, a veteran GOP strategist and emeritus state Republican Party chairman. 
    
            Amy Fogel, a volunteer with Red Wine and Blue, a liberal-leaning grassroots activist group, said Republican lawmakers in Ohio made the matter intentionally confusing and called it a “blatant power grab.”
    
            “The legislature made August elections illegal just earlier this year because they knew it was unpopular, with very low voter turnout, and it costs Ohio voters tens of millions of dollars,” Fogel told CNN. “They brought it back because time and time again when voters are asked to vote on reproductive freedom, it usually almost always passes.”
    
            Critics of Issue 1 point to the fact that Republicans in the Ohio state assembly voted to hold the single-measure election, a reversal of a prior vote ending August special elections. They say this is a thinly veiled push to tighten abortion restrictions. 
    
            “The entire reason we’re putting Issue 1 on the August ballot was to prevent abortion from being on the November ballot,” said Ohio-based Democratic strategist Aaron Pickrell.
    
            The elections – both Tuesday’s and the one in November – come more than a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, returning the abortion debate to the states. Ohio is the only state to have abortion rights on the ballot this year, as pro-abortion rights activists in the Buckeye State gathered more than 700,000 signatures in support of the ballot initiative this year. 
    
            It’s rare that singular ballot initiatives garner so much local and national attention. Strategists and advocates point to long lines of early voters, the outsized spending and ramped up television ads in the last week before the vote as indicators that this election is garnering unusually high attention. According to state early vote tallies on Monday, almost 700,000 people had voted early on Issue 1 – a sign of high turnout for a single ballot initiative. 
    
            Outside groups have poured more than $26 million into advertising on both sides, escalating a potentially sleepy summer election into a bitter, hard-fought contest about abortion and far more. Well-known donors have thrown in cash as well. Republican megadonor Richard Uihlein from Illinois has poured $4 million into the “yes” vote Save Our Constitution group. The pro-“no” vote group One Person One Vote has raised $14.8 million.
    
            Protect Our Constitution, a group focused on passing Issue 1, has spent almost $2.7 million on advertising, according to AdImpact data. Protect Women Ohio, a group focused on fighting new protections for abortion in November, had spent $7 million ahead of the Tuesday vote.
    
            The pitch for the “yes” proponents is that, officially, this is about a number of topics important to varying advocacy groups.  
    
            “What we are saying is this isn’t just about abortion. No, for Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio [Right To Life], it’s 100% about abortion, but for my next door neighbor who’s a police officer, this all about his ability to do his job because this is an organization called Ohioans For Qualified Immunity, the legal shield police officers and firefighters have,” Gonidakis said.
    
            “They’re voting ‘yes’ to protect our qualified immunity, their way of life and pensions to not get sued. They don’t care about the abortion issue. My other neighbor: Second Amendment fan. And that’s why the NRA is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ohio Right To Life.” 
    
            Gonidakis added: “This isn’t a proxy vote on abortion. … It’s the greatest stakes of the pro-life movement and Ohio Right To Life’s history, but that’s our reason. The NRA doesn’t care. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce could give two hoots.”
    
            Former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat, bristled at that argument in an interview on Monday. 
    
            “The anti-abortion folks want to have this both ways. They want to say this because this is all about the November abortion vote coming but they’ve made it even bigger than that. They are correct it’s even bigger about abortion because it’s a state’s one person one vote,” Whaley said. 
    
            Abortion rights advocates have reason to be optimistic. Just weeks after the Dobbs ruling threw out national abortion rights protections last summer, voters in deep-red Kansas decisively voted against changing the state constitution that would have allowed the state legislature to install new abortion restrictions. Majorities of voters have backed abortions rights in every state ballot initiative – in both blue states and red states – ever since
    
            The victories for abortion rights advocates haven’t ended there. In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – with the help of the state’s Democratic legislative majorities secured during the 2022 midterms – repealed a 1931 law banning abortion in April. And in Wisconsin, a high-stakes election for the nonpartisan state Supreme Court resulted in the victory of the liberal-aligned candidate, who put abortion at the center of her campaign.
    
            Opponents of Ohio’s Tuesday ballot measure see signs of high turnout as especially promising. 
    
            “The public is getting up,” a Democratic strategist familiar with the efforts to block the Tuesday measure said. “We believe that people are paying attention and that is accruing to our benefit. The people who need to know it’s about abortion know it’s about abortion and are coming out to vote.”     
    
            Of course, the Issue 1 vote is only part of the battle. Whatever the outcome Tuesday, there will be another vote in November on whether to enshrine new abortion protections into the state constitution. 
    
            Still, opponents of abortion rights believe Ohio will be different. Gonidakis said after the events in Kansas and Michigan, his group did post-mortems to see what worked and what didn’t. They found that their sister anti-abortion organizations had started too late. 
    
            “We started back in December before they even started because we just knew it was coming,” Gonidakis said. “We got way ahead of the curve based on Michigan and Kansas.” 
    
            US Sen. J.D. Vance, one of the most high-profile Ohio Republicans who supports passing Issue 1, predicted Friday that it would likely be a “super close” outcome. 
    
            “You could have 1.5 million, 2 million votes,” Vance said, according to Cleveland.com. “It’s probably going to be decided by a few thousand people.”
    
            Whaley argued that the “yes” on Issue 1 advocates want to have it “both ways”: they want this portrayed both as an issue paramount to the anti-abortion rights movement but also one equally as important to other interest groups. 
    
            If the Issue 1 advocates don’t get their outcome Tuesday night, that will just raise the stakes for November. 
    
            “We work harder and try to win in November,” Gonidakis said.

      The anti-abortion movement is fractured over what it wants from its first post-Roe GOP presidential nominee
    ","

    ","
            Bernie Hayes has spent most Mondays since the overturning of Roe v. Wade meeting with friends outside of an Iowa Planned Parenthood trying to stop abortions one at a time. He huddles monthly with other like-minded activists plotting more wholesale paths to halting the procedure.
    
            Lately, Hayes, an elder at Noelridge Park Church in Cedar Rapids, has observed more dissent among anti-abortion allies who once worked in harmony. Some see the fall of Roe as a one-time chance to ban abortion entirely while others are worried about the political consequences of pushing too hard too quickly.
    
            “Sadly, it becomes divisive to the point where we just get fractured,” Hayes said. “I can only imagine what the division looks like on a national scale.”
    
            Those divisions are spilling out into the 2024 Republican presidential primary, as leading anti-abortion organizations are offering candidates conflicting guidance on an issue that has galvanized the political right for half a century. Recent polling shows Republican voters aren’t providing candidates much more clarity. 
    
            Lynda Bell, the president of Florida Right to Life, bristled at the suggestion that Republican candidates must back a federal abortion ban.
    
            “There’s nothing in the Constitution that talks about abortion and this issue should be decided by the states,” she said. 
    
            But other leaders of anti-abortion groups want GOP candidates to be unflinching in their support for more hardline policies.
    
            “Anyone in the pro-life movement is looking very carefully at the current candidates that are running for president, and those who are not advocating strongly on this issue are going to be the ones that are not going to get the confidence and get the vote of the pro-life movement,” said Maggie DeWitte, the executive director of the Iowa anti-abortion group Pulse Life Advocates.
    
            Candidates are cautiously navigating the unclear expectations of conservative voters as they search for their first presidential nominee in a post-Roe America. Former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the two highest-polling candidates for the GOP nomination, have routinely dodged questions on the trail about whether they would sign a national abortion ban and at how many weeks into a pregnancy they would support such federal legislation. 
    
            Meanwhile, candidates who have expressed more defined views on the topic – like former Vice President Mike Pence, a backer of a federal ban, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who said the federal government “should not be involved” in the abortion debate – have yet to gain traction with Republican voters. 
    
            Whoever is the GOP nominee will face an electorate that has so far handed anti-abortion advocates a series of stinging defeats since the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson last summer. In the immediate aftermath of the court’s ruling, Kansans voted overwhelmingly to keep abortion legal in the state. In November, Michiganders at the ballot box enshrined abortion access in the state constitution. This week in Wisconsin, liberal justice Janet Protasiewicz started her term on the state Supreme Court after winning a spring race, during which she campaigned on protecting abortion access.
    
            The enthusiasm displayed by abortion-rights activists in the past 12 months will be tested again on Tuesday when Ohioans will decide whether to raise the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment, a referendum that would have significant implications for a fall ballot question ensure “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s reproductive decisions.”
    
            “We need to start winning hearts and minds,” Hayes said. “I don’t think we can worry about a federal ban until you can do that.”
    
            Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a national anti-abortion group, has clashed with the GOP contenders for the nomination as the organization enforces its own red line for presidential candidates: a 15-week federal ban. 
    
            When Trump’s campaign suggested in April that abortion should be decided at the state level, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the organization’s president, called it “a morally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate to hold.” It was a stunning break between one of the country’s most influential anti-abortion groups and the president who nominated the three Supreme Court justices that helped secure the movement’s watershed victory. Trump and Dannenfelser later met to clear the air, though Trump has still evaded outlining his views on the issue. 
    
            Dannenfelser similarly said it was “not acceptable” when another candidate, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stated “it’s not realistic” to expect a gridlocked Congress to find consensus on federal abortion legislation.
    
            And, in a blistering rebuke this week, Dannenfelser questioned DeSantis’ leadership after he once again declined to back a federal abortion.
    
            “A pro-life president has a duty to protect the lives of all Americans,” she said. “He should be the National Defender of Life.”
    
            DeSantis dismissed the criticism during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, where he noticeably drops references to his state’s new abortion law – which bans most abortions after six weeks – from his stump speech.
    
            “Different groups, you know, are gonna have different agendas, but I can tell you this: Nobody running has actually delivered pro-life protections,” DeSantis said. “I have done that.”
    
            South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott seized on the fissure between DeSantis and the leading abortion group, writing in a social media post that, “Republicans should not be retreating on life.” He added, “We need a national 15-week limit to stop blue states from pushing abortion on demand.”
    
            Scott, though, also struggled to define the federal role in the next frontier for the anti-abortion movement after he entered the presidential race in May.
    
            The anti-abortion movement is not totally aligned behind Dannenfelser. Carol Tobias, the president of the National Right to Life Committee, said she thought it was a mistake to have a political litmus test for Republican presidential candidates on abortion and argued doing so would only serve to splinter the party ahead of the general election. It “doesn’t help” for SBA Pro-Life America to set a 15-week national ban as its standard for GOP candidates, Tobias said, arguing that there were more realistic goals to work towards, like ensuring zero tax dollars are used to fund abortions
    
            “If we’re not going to get a national law on abortion through Congress, why focus on it?” Tobias told CNN. 
    
            Republican voters appear similarly divided. A New York Times/Siena College national survey released this week found more Republicans favored some exceptions (33%) than a total ban (22%). Meanwhile, one-third said they believed abortion should be mostly or always legal. 
    
            But among White evangelical Republican voters – whose influence is especially pronounced in the early nominating contests in Iowa and South Carolina – opposition is higher. More than three-fourths responded that abortion should be always or mostly illegal. 
    
            Further complicating the calculus for the Republican field is that the GOP voters least likely to vote for Trump are among the most likely to support at least some protections for abortion. For those Republicans who said they are not open to voting for Trump, only 11% support a total ban while more than half said they want abortion to be legal in most situations. 
    
            The clashing opinions underscore the political tightrope Republican candidates are walking after their party underperformed in the 2022 midterms in an election held just months after Roe v. Wade was overturned. Some Republicans – including Trump – have blamed it for the party’s losses, pointing to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham’s failed attempt to push a federal ban through Congress last year as strategically unsound. 
    
            “I thought, ‘What is Lindsey Graham doing?’” Bell said. “The Supreme Court just said it was a state decision. I was baffled.”
    
            But there are also fears within the anti-abortion movement that Republicans won’t act to preserve their chances at the ballot box. 
    
            “Some say, ‘Let’s just ignore it,’” Hayes, the Cedar Rapids church elder, said. “For me the worst thing can happen is that it’s either very diluted or taken out of the platform all together. I hope we won’t go there. But if we’re going to talk about it, we need to do it in a smart way.”
    
            In Hayes’ state, Republicans that control Iowa’s government moved to ban most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the measure into law at last month’s Family Leadership Summit, where most of the GOP field had assembled to speak directly to the state’s evangelical and Christian voters. Many Republican candidates heaped praise on Reynolds for signing the law, though most have not advocated for similar legislation at the federal level. 
    
            Trump, who has notably not weighed in on Iowa’s law, did not attend the summit and has privately said he considers abortion a losing issue for Republicans. Publicly, he called Florida’s six-week abortion ban “too harsh,” testing conservatives who once celebrated Trump’s place in ending Roe. 
    
            “I think many in the pro-life movement were disappointed to hear him talk about life not being a winning issue, and sort of attacking the heartbeat bill and some of the other legislation that’s coming down as being ‘too harsh,’” DeWitte said. “I think that really turned off people in the pro-life movement.”
    
            Joni Lupis, a pastor and president and director of March For Life New York, said she is wary of candidates who aren’t taking a stance on the issue or offering realistic answers. 
    
            “Let’s be honest: The president can’t just declare no more abortion in the whole world,” Lupis said. “They can say they will but it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen. That’s politics and we’ll have to wait and see what they have to do. I like a person that says what they believe. If you believe something, you should stand behind and declare it.”

      Texas judge halts state abortion bans in cases of ‘emergent medical conditions’ threatening pregnant patients
    ","

    ","
            A Texas judge issued an order late Friday temporarily barring the state from enforcing its ban on abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy in cases where a patient’s life or health could be endangered by an “emergent medical condition.”
    
            District Judge Jessica Mangrum ruled the law is ambiguous enough to make it difficult for women to obtain abortions, even when facing serious medical complications. 
    
            The law “has created an imminent risk that Physician Plaintiffs and other physicians throughout Texas will have no choice but to bar or delay the provision of abortion care to pregnant persons in Texas for whom an abortion would prevent or alleviate a risk of death or risk to their health (including their fertility) for fear of liability under Texas’s abortion bans,” the ruling reads. 
    
            The order comes after the judge heard several days of testimony last month from women who say Texas law forced them to continue with high-risk pregnancies. 
    
            One plaintiff, Samantha Casiano, said she was forced to give birth to her daughter despite a diagnosis of anencephaly, a rare birth defect where parts of a baby’s skull and brain are missing. Casiano’s child died four hours after birth.
    
            “All she could do was fight to try to get air,” Casiano testified in court. “I had to watch my daughter go from being pink to red to purple.”
    
            Lawyers for the state argued in court there was already an adequate exception in the statute for life-threatening pregnancies and blamed doctors for misinterpreting the law. 
    
            First Assistant Attorney General Brent Webster said in a statement the state filed an appeal that “stays an activist Austin judge’s attempt to override Texas abortion laws pending a ruling by the Texas Supreme Court.”
    
            Texas has one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, and access was curtailed even further following the US Supreme Court’s landmark decision to overturn the federal right to abortion last summer. After the high court’s ruling, a trigger law in Texas banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother. Before the ruling, Texas banned abortions in 2021 beyond six weeks of pregnancy.
    
            The lawsuit was filed by Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of two doctors and 13 women who suffered complications in pregnancy. 
    
            “Today’s ruling should prevent other Texans from suffering the unthinkable trauma our plaintiffs endured,” said Nancy Northup, President and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights.

      Pittsburgh synagogue shooter is formally sentenced to death after victims’ families call him ‘vile’ and ‘worthless’

    ","
            Andrea Wedner, whose 97-year-old mother was killed, called the mass shooter “worthless” and a “pathetic human being.”
    
            Carol Black cried out the name of her brother, Richard Gottfried, and said she feels guilt that somehow she survived, hidden in a dark closet, but her brother did not.
    
            And Mark Simon, whose parents were killed, said he remains haunted by his mother’s blood-stained wedding pearls – but can’t bear to part with them.
    
            “Your sick, vile, despicable actions have totally erased you from humanity and society forever,” Simon said.
    
            Wedner, Black and Simon were three of the nearly two dozen people who spoke in federal court Thursday about the impact of the 2018 mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, the deadliest ever attack on Jews in the United States.
    
            The gunman, Robert Bowers, 50, did not look up from a piece of paper for any of their statements. Afterward, Judge Robert Colville formally sentenced him to death on 22 capital counts, 37 life sentences and 20 years each on four additional counts.
    
            The hearing came a day after a federal jury unanimously agreed to sentence Bowers to death. It’s the first federal death sentence under the Biden administration, which has imposed a moratorium on executions.
    
            The sentencing represents the capstone of a horrific saga that began on October 27, 2018, when Bowers burst into the Tree of Life synagogue and shot people with an AR-15-style rifle. Eleven people were killed and six others, including four responding police officers, were wounded.
    
            The people killed were Gottfried, 65; Simon’s parents, Bernice and Sylvan Simon, 84 and 86; Irving Younger, 69; Melvin Wax, 87; Rose Mallinger, 97; Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Joyce Fienberg, 75; Daniel Stein, 71; and the brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal, 59 and 54.
    
            Prosecutors argued the targeted, well-planned shooting was motivated by Bowers’ hatred toward Jews, immigrants and particularly the non-profit organization Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society His defense argued that he suffered from mental illness and delusions, but the jury rejected those arguments in delivering the sentence.
    
            In recognition of the gunman’s hateful ideology, Michele Rosenthal, the sister of the Rosenthal brothers, pledged on Thursday that every October 27 her family will make a donation to the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. The donation will be made in Bowers’ name, and she planned to mail him the receipt, she said.
    
            The first of the victim impact statements was from Peg Durachko, Gottfried’s wife. She said she was “repulsed” by the gunman’s “callous disregard” for her husband.
    
            “Rich was the most important person in my life, my whole family. Your hateful act took my soulmate away from me (and) left me totally alone,” she said.
    
            Alan Mallinger, Mallinger’s son, said they should have been planning a 100th birthday party but instead were forced to plan her funeral.
    
            “You may think you took away our fight and determination, but you only fueled it,” he said. “Because of my mother, Rose, we will continue to thrive as Jewish people.”
    
            Officer Michael Smidga, one of the officers injured in the attack, said he had “a hard time handling the rage and the sadness for these victims and families.”
    
            “For him to just do what he did it just doesn’t make sense,” he added.
    
            Rabbi Doris Dyen, a survivor of the shooting, said the gunman had challenged her opposition to the death penalty.
    
            “In my opinion he has forfeited the privilege of living because his actions have shown he doesn’t appreciate life,” she said. “He not only killed 11 people of blessed memory and severely injured others, but he also took a sense of safety.”
    
            Dan Leger, who was wounded in the shooting, thanked the law enforcement officers who ran toward the danger and the government prosecutors who took on the case. He even thanked the defense lawyers “for valuing the sanctity of life, even if their client doesn’t,” he said.
    
            “I can only wish Mr. Bowers would look at me while I’m talking instead of scribbling on his page,” he said.
    
            Michael Hirt, the brother-in-law of the Rosenthals, challenged Bowers to make eye contact and paused for about 30 seconds. Bowers did not look up.
    
            “I wonder now if you’re man enough now to look at us,” he said. “I didn’t think so.”
    
            During trial last month, some of the victims’ family members took the stand and shared heart-wrenching impact statements, with some breaking down in tears as they spoke about their loved ones. 
    
            Wedner, Mallinger’s daughter, said Wednesday the sentencing gave her a “great sense of relief.”
    
            “People need to know if they’re going to harm somebody that they’re going to get punished for it, and this is telling the world that we’re not going to stand for this,” Wedner told CNN.
    
            Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, a survivor of the attack at his Tree of Life congregation, said the jury decision represents the end of one chapter and the start of another.
    
            “Now that the trial is nearly over and the jury has recommended a death sentence, it is my hope that we can begin to heal and move forward,” he said in a statement. “As we do, I have my faith, bolstered by the embrace and respect with which my community has been treated by our government and our fellow citizens. For this and the seriousness with which the jury took its duty, I remain forever grateful.”
    
            Meanwhile, leaders of the New Light Congregation acknowledged many of their members preferred the gunman spend the rest of his life in prison rather than receive the death penalty. However, co-presidents Stephen Cohen and Barbara Caplan agreed with prosecutors’ move.
    
            “Life in prison without parole would allow the shooter to celebrate his deed for many years,” they wrote. “New Light Congregation accepts the jury’s decision and believes that, as a society, we need to take a stand that this act requires the ultimate penalty under the law.”
    
            Squirrel Hill Stands Against Gun Violence, a gun safety advocacy group founded by three members of Dor Hadash after the shooting, issued a statement on gun laws in the US. 
    
            “We hold responsible, not simply the shooter, a damaged and angry man who should never have had access to deadly weapons, but those politicians and legislators who have fought against common sense gun laws, having seen the overwhelming evidence that they would save lives, but too cowardly or too financially vested with the gun lobby to do the right thing,” the group said.
    
            “We hold responsible every legislator and politician who has uttered hateful white nationalist rhetoric or has shared memes or other social media content amplifying the ‘great replacement theory,’ the unfounded conspiracy theory that a flood of non-white immigrants, organized by Jews, are coming to replace the white race. And we hold responsible those who continue to vote for such political candidates.”

      Rabbi: The shooter at my Pittsburgh synagogue has been sentenced to death. Closure is still hard for my community
    ","
			Opinion by Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers

        4:56 PM EDT, Thu July 13, 2023
    ","
            Jurors have decided that the man convicted in the mass shooting five years ago at the Pittsburgh synagogue I lead should be put to death. The decision, marks the final chapter of an emotional, months-long trial, that should bring closure to members of my congregation and two other congregations affected by the attack.
    
            And yet, I still wonder: What is justice, when 11 souls have been stolen from their loved ones and community? I pose that question to myself often. I know the entire American Jewish community is asking along with me.
    
            The shooting took place on a day when the synagogue was hosting three congregations: Tree of Life, Dor Hadash and New Light, for Shabbat services. As a survivor of the massacre and the rabbi of those we lost from the Tree of Life congregation, the guilty verdict itself was a long-awaited cathartic moment. I’m grateful for the compassion of those who have continued sending their love, asking how I’m doing and how the community’s doing.
    
            Permit me to try to verbalize the emotions of a survivor of a mass shooting. The impact of the events of October 27, 2018 — or simply, 10/27 — and other attacks on Jewish communities around the world is far broader and deeper than many recognize. It’s rare today to find a Jewish institution without armed security. It’s not uncommon to walk through scanning equipment on your way in.
    
            A woman I know always looks for an exit door to pray next to. A business owner I know no longer hangs Chanukah decorations at her store, out of concern for her employees. There are people who lost their faith and no longer pray. They’re all victims of antisemitism in America.
    
            Personally, I thought I was doing a relatively good job of integrating the horror, learning how to live with it and utilizing the newly discovered tools in my toolbox. Then came the trial.
    
            Like other survivors, I’ve had to relive the nightmare. Once again, I heard my own, 56-minute 911 call. I heard myself whispering the final Jewish confessional recited before death, which I expected would be my fate. Once again, I heard the gunfire, heard the cries and screams of my congregants as they were slaughtered. I have survivor’s remorse, regret caused by surviving when others around me died.
    
            Reason tells me there was nothing I could have done to help the members of my congregation or the other congregations who were killed that terrible day. Even so, I desperately wanted superpowers to save them. I could not, and am forced again to process my guilt.
    
            The anguish I feel isn’t the same kind felt every day by the two injured survivors. Nor is it like the pain felt by the five police officers who were injured after rushing to the scene of the shooting. It is different, but it is potent. I taught myself once how to integrate these feelings into my being and I know I’ll be able to do so again. Right now though, it’s just plain hard.
    
            I also know how it feels to look at that day in the context of our people’s history. Jews carry with us everywhere the knowledge of what it’s like to be targeted for being Jewish. The shooting came just two weeks shy of the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht, a horrific example of state-sponsored terrorism, a pogrom unleashed upon the Jewish communities of Germany and Austria.
    
            On that night, police took part in the violence, cordoning off the Aryan public to keep them safe while their Jewish fellow citizens were arrested, assaulted and murdered as synagogues went up in flames. Some 48 hours later, 30,000 Jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps and the Jewish community was ordered to pay a fine of one billion Reichsmarks.
    
            In 2018, in Pittsburgh, police kept bystanders at a safe distance as first responders ran towards the gunfire, bravely breaching the building to save us. A SWAT team found and surrounded me, guiding me to an exit door. One officer who was among my rescuers ordered: “Rabbi, run your ass off!”
    
            Later that day, the FBI brought in several teams that meticulously gathered and recorded evidence that the government would use to make its case at trial. We waited four years and eight months for one word that resonated firmly 63 times: guilty.
    
            I shared the differences between Kristallnacht and 10/27 with Amy Hahn, the US attorney who delivered in her powerful closing arguments during the guilt or innocence phase of the trial. I wanted her to understand that throughout the 4,000-year history of my people, we’ve been unaccustomed to police rushing towards danger to save us or governments demanding justice for us.
    
            I wanted her to recognize what a powerful and historic moment this was for the entire Jewish community. And I wanted her to know that we will be forever grateful to her and the entire team of US attorneys for prosecuting this case.
    
            When then-US Attorney General William Barr decided to pursue the death penalty in this trial, I asked our congregation for their thoughts. It soon became clear that there was no clear consensus: many supported the death penalty, and many did not.
    
            Therefore, my position and that of the Tree of Life Congregation has been, and will continue to be, complete confidence in the judicial process. The juror in the case now have made their decision.
    
            In the years we have spent waiting for this trial to take place, many of us have been stuck in neutral. It was a challenge to move forward with the looming specter of a murder trial. But as rabbi of this congregation, God has been with me throughout this ordeal, and I am confident that God will continue to guide me.
    
            We are left to ask whether this outcome will bring closure. And what does closure even look like? How do we heal after this re-traumatization? How does a faith community like ours move forward after such a tragedy?
    
            My congregation will return to worship at the corner of Shady and Wilkins. We’ve also begun to reimagine what we can be, and last year, a wholly new Tree of Life was launched as a national nonprofit organization dedicated to uprooting antisemitism.
    
            Even with our plans for the future, I still have more questions than answers. But I also have my faith, bolstered by the respect and concern with which my community has been treated by our government and our fellow citizens. For this, I remain forever grateful.

      Missouri executes Johnny Johnson, convicted of murdering a 6-year-old girl, despite his claim he was mentally ill
    ","

  Published
        1:53 PM EDT, Wed August 2, 2023
    ","
            Missouri has executed a death row inmate for the 2002 murder of a young girl over the objections of his attorneys, who argued he was mentally incompetent and thus ineligible to be put to death.
    
            Johnny Johnson, 45, was sentenced to die for murdering 6-year-old Casey Williamson after abducting and trying to rape her, court records show. Republican Gov. Mike Parson denied a clemency request Monday, calling the crime “one of the most horrific” ever to cross his desk. 
    
            Johnson was put to death Tuesday evening by lethal injection, reported the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, a CNN affiliate. He was pronounced dead at 6:33 p.m. CT, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Corrections confirmed to CNN.
    
            He was the fourth inmate executed this year in Missouri and the 16th across the United States, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. 
    
            Johnson apologized to his victim’s family in a final statement released by corrections officials: “God Bless(.) Sorry to the people and family I hurt,” he wrote.
    
            Casey’s family did not make a statement after Johnson’s execution, according to the Post-Dispatch. Family members had mixed feelings about the execution, the paper reported, but Casey’s mother was ready to put it behind her. 
    
            “I’ve been looking forward to putting this part of it to rest,” Angie Wideman said last week. CNN has reached out to her.
    
            Johnson’s lethal injection was carried out after the US Supreme Court denied his request for a stay of execution, with the three liberal justices dissenting. 
    
            “The Court today paves the way to execute a man with documented mental illness before any court meaningfully investigates his competency to be executed,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, citing in part Ford v. Wainwright, in which the court ruled the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of a person who can’t understand what’s happening. Also dissenting were Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.
    
            A neuropsychiatrist who evaluated Johnson in February determined he long had “suffered from severe mental illness,” including schizophrenia, according to the inmate’s petition for a writ of certiorari.
    
            Johnson understood he was sentenced to die for murdering a child, the doctor found, but he lacked a “rational understanding of the reasons for his execution” and believed that “Satan is using the State of Missouri to execute (him) to bring about the end of the world,” the petition said. Ultimately, the doctor found Johnson incompetent to be executed.
    
            The state opposed Johnson’s petition, citing the findings of his prison’s head of mental health, who reported Johnson had never “expressed these kinds of hallucinations or delusional beliefs.”
    
            Sotomayor wrote the Supreme Court of Missouri and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals both had erred in denying Johnson the opportunity to argue his case.
    
            The state Supreme Court first denied Johnson’s request for a competency hearing because it found he had not demonstrated the threshold showing of insanity required; a federal district court then denied relief. 
    
            Then, a three-judge panel of the Eight Circuit Court issued Johnson a stay and certificate of appealability, giving him the chance to have his case heard. But the full Eighth Circuit subsequently vacated the stay and declined to issue the certificate. 
    
            Johnson “deserves a hearing where a court can finally determine whether his execution violates the Eight Amendment,” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. “Instead, this Court rushes to finality, bypassing fundamental procedural and substantive protections.”

      The Pittsburgh synagogue shooter faces the death penalty despite a pause on federal executions. Here’s what those who mourn the slain have said about it
    ","

        11:31 AM EDT, Wed August 2, 2023
    ","
            Federal jurors in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting trial will soon decide whether to sentence the convicted gunman to death or life in prison – two potential avenues for justice that in the years since the deadliest antisemitic attack in US history have found varying levels of support in an otherwise unified community.
    
            As expected, shooter Robert Bowers was found guilty this month of all 63 counts he faced stemming from the Sabbath morning massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue that left 11 worshipers dead as three congregations gathered to pray. Eleven counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence were capital counts, making Bowers eligible for the death penalty.
    
            The 50-year-old shooter’s attorneys never contested he committed the 2018 attack, and so the case’s main focus is the issue now at hand: whether he is sentenced to death – for which the jury must be unanimous – or life in prison without the possibility of parole.
    
            The punishment remains an option even amid a federal moratorium on carrying out executions after Democratic President Joe Biden’s attorney general stayed the course set by his predecessor, an appointee of GOP President Donald Trump. 
    
            But even in a community united – not only its grief but in its hope justice will be done – unanimity around the death penalty is elusive: In the years since the massacre, the victims’ families and congregations have expressed differing views about whether the shooter should be put to death. Some are convinced so egregious an attack warrants capital punishment, while others fear a death sentence could retraumatize their community or a life sentence would better honor the victims, they’ve said.
    
            The divergence reflects a broader national split on capital punishment. Recent high-profile cases, too, have shown juries don’t always send mass killers to death row, with the gunman who killed 17 people at a Parkland, Florida, high school and the terrorist who killed eight on a New York City bike path sentenced to life in prison after their juries declined to unanimously opt for death. 
    
            Most of the families of those killed at the Pittsburgh synagogue want the shooter sentenced to die, according to a letter to the editor of the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle published in November and signed by seven of the nine families whose relatives were murdered.
    
            “We are not a ruthless, uncompassionate people; we, as a persecuted people, understand when there is a time for compassion and when there is a time to stand up and say enough is enough – such violent hatred will not be tolerated on this earth,” reads the letter written to counter unspecified opinion pieces opposing the US Justice Department’s decision to seek a death sentence. 
    
            “Please don’t tell us how we should feel, what is best for us, what will comfort us and what will bring closure for the victims’ families. You can not and will not speak for us,” it reads. “The massacre of our loved ones was a clear violation of American law – mass murder of Jews for simply being Jewish and practicing Judaism, driven by sheer antisemitism – which the law rightfully deems is a capital offense.”
    
            Others have offered a different view. The targeted Dor Hadash Congregation previously voiced its opposition to the death penalty in this case, as did the rabbi of New Light Congregation, who narrowly escaped the shooting in which his faith community lost three worshipers. CNN reached out to Rabbi Jonathan Perlman for comment on his prior position.
    
            “I would like the Pittsburgh killer to be incarcerated for the rest of his life without parole,” Perlman wrote in an August 2019 letter to then-Attorney General William Barr before the decision to seek a death sentence was made. “He should meditate on whether taking action on some white separatist fantasy against the Jewish people was really worth it. Let him live with it forever.” 
    
            Perlman’s focus, he wrote, was “not letting this thug cause my community any further pain.”
    
            “We are still attending to our wounds, both physical and emotional, and I don’t want to see them reopened any more. Many of us are healing but many of us (have) been re-traumatized multiple times,” Perlman said. “A drawn out and difficult death penalty trial would be a disaster with witnesses and attorneys dredging up horrifying drama and giving this killer the media attention he does not deserve.” 
    
            While the Torah “unambiguously” allows for capital punishment, rabbis in the first and second centuries were hesitant to support its implementation, said David Kraemer, professor of Talmud and rabbinics at the Jewish Theological Seminary. 
    
            They feared the flaws of a human court system out of concern innocents could be inadvertently punished, he told CNN. Those rabbis believed it best to err on the side of letting a guilty person go free in part because they believed the guilty would receive an appropriate punishment after death.
    
            “I think the reason they were comfortable with that is because they believed that there was a divine court,” Kraemer said, “that would correct the error that the human court may have made.”
    
            The Justice Department under Barr, Trump appointee, initially chose to try the Pittsburgh shooting as a capital case, even as the US government at that time had not executed a federal death row inmate in almost 20 years. That changed in the Trump administration’s waning days, when 13 federal inmates were put to death over six months ending in January 2021. 
    
            The Dor Hadash Congregation lamented the Barr-era decision, writing afterward in late August 2019 it was “saddened and disappointed” the agency chose to push forward with a capital case, despite a letter the congregation said it had sent that same month asking both sides to agree to a plea deal giving the gunman life in prison without parole. 
    
            “A deal would have honored the memory of Dor Hadash congregant Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz, who was firmly and unequivocally opposed to the death penalty,” its statement read. “It would have prevented the attacker from getting the attention and publicity that will inevitably come with a trial, and eliminated any possibility of further trauma that could result from a trial and protracted appeals.”
    
            The congregation did not feel commenting on the death penalty was appropriate now that the trial has moved on from the guilt phase, its spokesperson told CNN. “We remain very grateful to the Department of Justice and the US Attorney’s office for their work in this matter over the course of the past 4 1/2 years,” Pamina Ewing of Dor Hadash said.  
    
            Then in July 2021 – a day after he issued a moratorium on federal executions – Biden’s Attorney General Merrick Garland was sent a letter from seven of the nine families of those slain in the Pittsburgh synagogue attack, urging him to continue to pursue a death sentence in the case, according to Diane and Michele Rosenthal, the sisters of victims David and Cecil Rosenthal.
    
            The letter said the “vast majority of the immediate victim-family members” had not wavered in their desire for the death penalty. “As such, we respectfully beseech you to uphold the prior DOJ decision on the death-penalty qualification of this Capital Murder case and permit it to proceed as originally decided.”
    
            The letter aimed to “reflect … our support in seeking the death penalty in this particular tragedy,” the sisters told reporters in April, weeks before the trial began. They spoke only for their own family, they said, adding the other signatories had agreed to let them share the letter.
    
            The Justice Department under Garland is prosecuting the case, making it the second federal death penalty trial in the era of Biden, who’d campaigned on a promise to abolish the punishment at the federal level but has taken few substantive steps toward doing so.
    
            Since his appointment two years ago, Garland has not authorized the department to seek the death penalty in any new cases, a Justice Department spokesman said, and he continues to assess new requests for authorization to seek or withdraw the death penalty on a case-by-case basis, consistent with federal law and the Justice Manual.
    
            Americans overall remain divided nearly down the middle on the death penalty, as they have been for years following precipitous drops in support for it over recent decades. About 55% of Americans say they are in favor of the death penalty for convicted murderers, a split that’s been relatively unchanged for at least six consecutive years, polling from Gallup shows.
    
            And like in Pittsburgh – where community members have supported each other before the trial and during it – victims of violent crime and their families are no monolith. While some express opposition to capital punishment, others look to it for some semblance of closure or justice.
    
            The Pittsburgh synagogue “massacre was not just a mass murder of innocent citizens during the service in a house of worship. It was an antisemitic hate crime,” Diane Rosenthal said in April. “The death penalty must apply to vindicate justice and to offer some measure of deterrence from horrific hate crimes happening again and again.”
    
            “We don’t want to be here,” she said, “and we know the emotional toll this trial potentially brings. But we owe it to our brothers, Cecil and David.” 
    
            Added Michele Rosenthal: “The suggestions published or reported that family members be relieved of the stress of a trial or that a cost-benefit analysis dictates a plea are offensive to our family,” she said. “Our family has suffered long and hard over the last four and a half years. … We don’t want to have to continue to defend ourselves and our position. 
    
            “We want justice.” 
    
            Beyond the families, many simply are bracing for the Pittsburgh synagogue trial’s penalty phase and how it may impact those touched by the wider ripples of the attack. After the gunman’s conviction, the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh opted to “take no position on what justice is,” its president and CEO told reporters. 
    
            “We trust the justice process,” Brian Schreiber said.
    
            Whatever comes of the penalty phase, it will be “gut wrenching,” and “reopen wounds,” said Jeff Finkelstein, president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. 
    
            “They keep getting reopened for us here in our Pittsburgh community,” he said, “not just the Jewish community but this greater Pittsburgh region.”

      Opinion: American women have an alcohol problem. It’s critical to understand why
    ","

    ","
            American women have a problem with booze. A new study from The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) shows that alcohol-related deaths are rising generally, but are rising more quickly among women than among men.
    
            According to this research, from 2018 to 2020, women saw a 14.7% increase in alcohol-related deaths, compared to a 12.5% increase among men. And the shift was also pronounced among individuals 65 and older, where there was a 6.7% increase in alcohol-related deaths among women, compared to a 5.2% increase among men.
    
            These findings go hand-in-hand with other indicators of physical and social decline for women and men: a decrease in life expectancy more broadly, and particularly among working-class White Americans; elevated rates of suicide and drug overdoses; and upticks in depression and anxiety.
    
            More Americans than ever are living alone, and while that could be a potent social shift with benefits for some, for a lot of other people it means less empowered singlehood and more isolation, including the depression that can come from feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
    
            For women in particular, feminist successes have given us many more years of singlehood, and made marriage and parenthood far less compulsory — and as a result, fewer women are having children, and those who do are entering parenthood later and later. As I have recently written, these developments are often positive, even if society has yet to catch up.
    
            Those longer single and childless years also mean, for many Americans, many more social years: years during which young people are gathering together, dating and hanging out with friends, away from parental or spousal supervision. These activities often involve drinking, sometimes heavily, and can set patterns that last for life — or at the very least put significant stress on a person’s body, and lead to health complications later.
    
            Coupled with the American way of eating (fast, hyper-processed and heavy on the fat, sugar and salt) and our general sedentariness, this kind of sustained, and often heavy alcohol use can have devastating effects.
    
            There is also the simple fact that Americans have long had a deeply dysfunctional relationship with booze, and as women have moved toward greater equality with men — and lived lives that look more like men’s — women are engaging in more alcohol-related dysfunction.
    
            As with many other pleasures — sex, food — American culture can be at once puritanical and prurient. Conservatives demand the teaching of abstinence in schools while seeking to scale back reproductive rights; at the same time, nearly all Americans have sex before marriage and online porn is both ubiquitous and often made in America.
    
            When it comes to alcohol, many conservative churches discourage its use, many states and localities retain vice laws that limit its sale and we allow young people to enroll in the military before they can legally get a drink at a bar, while we also glorify dangerous binge drinking as almost a rite of passage.
    
            Our culture treats alcohol-saturated fraternities as a normal part of the college experience, black-out drinking as entertaining comedy fodder and now, for women, getting white-wine wasted as a way to cope with the stress of raising children.
    
            The messaging around women and drinking has reflected women’s shift toward the dysfunctional, which may then create a vicious cycle as more women see problem drinking cast as cheeky, fun or normal. From “mommy juice” wine glasses to the category of middle-aged White women now known as the “wine mom” to exercise-and-wine classes targeted at women, the marketing, not just of booze but of all-day drinking to women, has been ascendant over the last decade or so. And more women may now be paying the price for this normalization of alcohol abuse.
    
            Alcohol can be a really delightful part of life. It is true that even moderate drinking can pose risks to your health. But I suspect many of us would choose to be on earth for a slightly shorter period of time if it means we can enjoy a great glass of wine at dinner, or sip on a beer during a baseball game or have an indulgent cocktail out with friends — the same way we may trade a health benefit for the occasional steak dinner or slice of birthday cake. The problem isn’t the very existence of booze. It’s the widespread overuse of it, and a culture that does not seem to embrace pleasure, health and moderation.
    
            The US remains an outlier among prosperous and developed nations in our lack of a national health insurance scheme and its failure to properly prioritize primary care prevention, which leaves millions of Americans without access to decent health care. Without good care, many Americans are simply not getting sustained and accurate messages about what it actually means to make healthy choices, from the medical care we seek to the food we eat to what and how much we drink.
    
            Many people also turn to drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism — when they’re stressed or lonely or sad. And American life has become extraordinarily stressful and isolating. A pandemic sent many of us home for week or months at a time, severing the low-stakes interactions and connections with acquaintances, colleagues and even strangers that are all a key part of human socialization.
    
            Even before the pandemic hit, Americans were reporting elevated rates of loneliness. The way many Americans live, in suburbs or rural areas or even in many cities, is lonely by literal design: homes built for a nuclear family, with a car to transport you to and from work, to and from the store and to and from wherever else you might go, without the kind of public transportation and walkable town centers that are standard across much of Europe.
    
            This is tremendously isolating, and as fewer Americans pair up romantically, fewer have children and the traditional pillars of civic and social life fall away or find themselves less populated (such as in churches, schools, local social organizations), more Americans are alone and struggling to cope. I suspect many of them are turning to alcohol as one way to dull the painful reality of isolation.
    
            It doesn’t have to be like this. Our culture-makers should, of course, take greater care to not glorify alcohol abuse, and individuals have a responsibility to take care of their own health. But when we see what we’re currently seeing in the US — declining mental health, declining life expectancy, declining happiness and wellbeing — the problem is bigger than predatory advertising or bad personal choices.
    
            This is a society-wide problem, and we need society-wide solutions, including political policies that incentivize health: wider access to health care, reasonable work hours so people can find the time to exercise and cook for themselves, paid sick and vacation days that let people care for their bodies and remind them that they deserve to be well. We also need a culture shift away from puritanism and toward pleasure — not pleasure as a guilt-inducing act of hedonism that must be atoned for, but part of a good, balanced, healthy life.
    
            And finally, we need to understand that this rise of alcohol-related deaths among women in particular tells us something about modern womanhood: namely, that a lot of women are badly struggling, and need vastly more support.
    
            None of that will end alcohol abuse, which has been a centuries-long problem. But it could radically decrease it, and make for a nation where many more of us are happier, healthier, and can better enjoy our lives — with and without libations.

      Hospitals in a 10th of US counties have lost childbirth units over the past five years, according to a new analysis

            Hundreds of hospitals have lost their childbirth units over the past five years, according to a new analysis, affecting about a tenth of US counties and contributing to increasing limitations to access maternity care nationwide.
    
            March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on infant and maternal health, on Tuesday published a series of reports exploring access to family planning and maternity care.
    
            Nationwide, they found more than a third of US counties to be maternity care deserts, without a hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and without any obstetric providers. About 300 birthing units have closed in the US since March of Dimes first started tracking in 2018, including about 70 losses in the past year.
    
            Eight counties in Texas were among those newly designated as maternity care deserts. And earlier research suggests that a strict abortion law that took effect in the state in 2021 may have led to increased demand for care, with nearly 10,000 more births than expected in the last nine months of 2022.
    
            Overall, nearly 1 in 10 women who gave birth in the past year lived more than 30 minutes away from the closest birthing hospital, according to the new March of Dimes analysis.
    
            The burden is particularly high for those living in rural areas. The average distance to a birthing hospital was highest in North Dakota, at more than 32 miles away. And the gap is stark in Alabama, where women living in rural areas have to travel more than twice as far as the state average to get to the nearest hospital with maternity care. About 90% of women living in rural areas of the Alabama have no maternity care hospitals within 30 minutes.
    
            “A person’s ability to have a healthy pregnancy and healthy birth should not be dictated by where they live and their ability to access consistent, quality care but these reports shows that, today, these factors make it dangerous to be pregnant and give birth for millions of women in the United States,” said Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, president and chief executive officer for March of Dimes.
    
            Other research has found that maternity care deserts are linked to a lack of adequate prenatal care or treatment for pregnancy complications and even an increased risk of maternal death for a year after giving birth.
    
            People with chronic health conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, have an increased risk of poor pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth. Overall, lack of access to reproductive health care services such as family planning clinics leaves more than 32 million women of reproductive age vulnerable to poor outcomes, according to the new analysis from March of Dimes.
    
            And those risk factors are more common among those living in maternity care deserts. For example, about 47% of Black women have at least one chronic health condition – but about 56% of Black women living in maternity care deserts do. And the preterm birth rate for Black women is 15% higher for those living in maternity care deserts.
    
            “Every baby deserves the healthiest start to life, and every family should expect equitable, available, quality maternal care,” Cherot said. “These new reports show that the system is failing families today but paints a clear picture of the unique challenges facing mothers and babies at the local level—the first step in our work to put solutions in place, and build a better future for all families.”

      DeSantis defends record on abortion following rebuke from leading anti-abortion group
    ","

    ","
            Ron DeSantis on Tuesday defended his record delivering “pro-life protections” as Florida governor following criticism from the Susan B. Anthony anti-abortion group over his reluctance to embrace a national ban.
    
            DeSantis, who sought to burnish his conservative bona fides earlier this year when he signed a six-week ban in Florida, cast doubt on the possibility of passing federal abortion restrictions and instead said the focus should be on state efforts, a position that has put him at odds with several of his 2024 GOP presidential primary competitors.
    
            “Different groups, you know, are gonna have different agendas, but I can tell you this: Nobody running has actually delivered pro-life protections. I have done that. I’ve stood up. I’ve said that I would stand for life, and we have done that, and we have delivered, and we’re proud of that,” DeSantis told CNN, gaggling with reporters at the Windmill Restaurant in Concord, New Hampshire. 
    
            In an interview with Megyn Kelly last week, DeSantis said he lacked confidence Congress would “do anything meaningful” toward a national abortion ban, and he has not committed to signing a national ban at any number of weeks as president.
    
            “I’ve been a pro-life governor. I’ll be a pro-life president, and I will come down on the side of life,” DeSantis told Kelly. “We are running on doing things that I know I can accomplish.”
    
            “I think the states have the primary jurisdiction over it,” DeSantis told Kelly. “I think there is a federal interest but I think the reality is that, you know, the country is divided on it.”  
    
            “You have different opinions, and that stuff gets filtered out. But clearly, right now, you are going to see different states go in different directions and I understand that,” DeSantis added.   
    
            His comments drew a rebuke from Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who on Monday said the remarks “expressed a lack of will to enact national protections for unborn children.”
    
            “Gov. DeSantis’s dismissal of this task is unacceptable to prolife voters. A consensus is already formed. Intensity for it is palpable and measurable. There are many pressing legislative issues for which Congress does not have the votes at the moment, but that is not a reason for a strong leader to back away from the fight. This is where presidential leadership matters most,” Dannenfelser said in a statement.
    
            Abortion has been a sticking point for GOP presidential candidates who have walked a fine line between appeasing conservative primary voters while not alienating moderates. Former President Donald Trump, the clear front-runner for the nomination, has told allies and advisers that abortion isn’t a winning campaign issue for Republicans and has yet to say whether he supports a federal ban.
    
            But others, including former Vice President Mike Pence and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, have called for national legislation in the wake of DeSantis’ comments to Kelly.
    
            “Republicans should not be retreating on life. We need a national 15-week limit to stop blue states from pushing abortion on demand. @sbaprolife defends the most fundamental right: life. Without life, nothing else matters. It’s not a special interest. It’s the only interest,” Scott tweeted Monday.
    
            DeSantis – whose campaign has signaled internal concerns about its financial position, cut staff and is significantly trailing Trump in the polls – has at times used abortion to draw a contrast with Trump, whose three Supreme Court nominees voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            In mid-June, DeSantis said he was “surprised” that the former president called Florida’s six-week ban “harsh” in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network’s David Brody.
    
            “We were able to deliver the Heartbeat Bill, which was a big, big deal,” DeSantis said. “While I appreciate what the former president has done in a variety of realms, he opposes that bill. He said it was quote ‘harsh’ to protect an unborn child when there’s a detectable heartbeat. I think that’s humane to do.”
    
            Asked if he thought Trump has gone “soft on abortion a little bit,” DeSantis said, “Well, I think so.”

      Pittsburgh synagogue shooting trial reaches closing arguments on potential death penalty
    ","

    ","
            The gunman who killed 11 people at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue in 2018 should be sentenced to death, federal prosecutors argued to a jury on Monday, specifically noting his hatred for Jews and ongoing lack of remorse.
    
            “He turned an ordinary Jewish Sabbath into the worst antisemitic mass shooting in US history, and he is proud of it,” US Attorney Eric Olshan said of the defendant, Robert Bowers.
    
            “This is a case that calls for the most severe punishment under the law – the death penalty,” he said.
    
            In contrast, defense attorney Judy Clarke argued his unstable childhood and mental health issues played a role in his “delusional” beliefs. She encouraged the jury to make their own personal moral decisions about the punishment.
    
            “You’ve held Rob Bowers accountable. You’ve convicted him of 63 counts, you’ve found him eligible for jury sentencing. Now we ask you to choose life and not death,” she said.
    
            The closing arguments took place Monday in the federal death penalty trial of Bowers, 50, who was found guilty on June 16 of all 63 charges against him for carrying out the deadliest ever attack on Jewish people in the US. Twenty-two of those counts were capital offenses.
    
            The jury further found he was eligible for the death penalty on July 13, moving the trial to a final sentencing stage.
    
            This third and final phase of the trial has focused on aggravating and mitigating factors that potentially apply to Bowers. The prosecution highlighted testimony from victims’ family members talking about their loved ones, as well as Bowers’ continued hatred toward Jews and lack of remorse about his actions.
    
            Meanwhile, the defense emphasized Bowers’ difficult childhood and mental health issues, including what they say is a delusional belief system and diagnoses of schizophrenia and epilepsy.
    
            A decision to sentence the gunman to death must be unanimous among the jury. Otherwise, he will be sentenced to life in prison without parole.
    
            Judge Robert Colville instructed the jury on the law prior to closing arguments on Monday, telling them the decision on life in prison or death is “a uniquely individual moral judgment.”
    
            “Whether or not the circumstances in this case justify a sentence of death rather than a sentence of life imprisonment without release is a decision that the law leaves entirely to you,” he said.
    
            In their closing argument, prosecutors detailed five aggravating factors they say apply to every count the jury is considering: the defendant’s hatred of Jews, selection of the synagogue as a target, injuries to surviving victims, lack of remorse and victim impact.
    
            “Eleven people, 11 full lives, 11 people who loved their families, 11 people who loved their friends, 11 people who were loved,” Olshan said. “Eight-hundred-and-thirteen years of life gone in less time than it took me to give you even the briefest window into how unique these people were. This man murdered every single one of them.”
    
            Olshan also disputed the defense mental health diagnoses.
    
            “He is just a man who subscribes to common antisemitic, extremist beliefs and was very effective at using his very high IQ to plan and carry out a mass shooting against Jews,” he said.
    
            The defense acknowledged the horror of the attack but said the question for the jury is what to do next.
    
            “What has happened cannot be undone,” Clarke said. “We can’t rewind the clock and make it such that this senseless crime never happened. All we can really do is make the right decision going forward. And we are asking you to make the right decision, and that is life.”
    
            Clarke further spoke about Bowers’ unstable childhood and mental health problems that by the mid-2010s left him isolated and living alone.
    
            “He succumbed to his mental illness, to his delusional beliefs, and brought us where we are today,” she said.
    
            The antisemitic mass killing began on a rainy Saturday morning when Bowers burst into the synagogue and began shooting people using an AR-15-style rifle. The synagogue was hosting three congregations that day, Tree of Life, Dor Hadash and New Light, for weekly Shabbat services.
    
            The victims included a 97-year-old great-grandmother, an 87-year-old accountant and a couple married at the synagogue more than 60 years earlier.
    
            Prior to the attack, the gunman spent years posting hateful comments about immigrants and Jewish people on Gab, a small social media platform then used by far-right extremists. He criticized migrants as “invaders” and repeatedly disparaged the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a nonprofit organization providing support to refugees that had recently held an event with the Dor Hadash congregation.
    
            Bowers further expressed his hatred for immigrants and Jews as he was being arrested and continued to defend his antisemitic beliefs in jailhouse evaluations earlier this year, witnesses testified in the trial.
    
            This is the second federal death penalty case to be prosecuted under the administration of President Joe Biden, who had criticized the death penalty on the campaign trail. In the first such case, concerning a terrorist who drove a U-Haul truck into cyclists and pedestrians on a New York City bike path, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision, leading to a sentence of life without parole. Both cases were holdovers from the Trump administration.
    
            At the same time, the Biden administration has put a moratorium on federal executions.

      Most states received a D or F grade on maternal mental health. It could get worse.

    ","
            Nearly every state in the United States is neglecting access to maternal mental health care, according to a recent report, and experts fear the situation could get worse as more states severely restrict or ban abortion.
    
            All but 10 US states received either a D or F grade on a number of key measures of maternal mental health risk policies and access to care — including access to therapists, psychiatrists or mental health treatment programs, according to a May report released by the nonprofit Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, in partnership with researchers from George Washington University. This is the group’s first report grading states on maternal mental health resources and policies.
    
            Forty states and the District of Columbia received grades of a D or F, while just one state – California – earned a grade higher than a C. No state where abortion was banned or severely restricted received a grade higher than a D+.
    
            More than a dozen states have banned abortion access in the year since the Supreme Court’s landmark decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which has had severe consequences for maternal mental health, some providers told CNN. Other states continue to restrict abortion – most recently, Iowa legislators passed a six-week ban that has since been temporarily blocked by the courts. A 12-week ban went into effect in North Carolina on July 1.
    
            “The truth is that access to mental care in this country – specifically in states where abortion has been restricted – has been abysmal for a very long time,” said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, the chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri.
    
            The Policy Center report found that most states lack specialized care for pregnant and postpartum women. For instance, only five states — California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey and Oklahoma — require ob/gyns to conduct maternal mental health screening during prenatal and postpartum visits, Caitlin Murphy, research scientist at the George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, told CNN.
    
            Alabama and Mississippi – two states that banned abortion almost immediately after the Supreme Court reversed Roe vs. Wade – already had among the lowest numbers of certified perinatal mental health providers relative to the expected number of births, according to data from the report. Both states received an F on the report cards.
    
            About 4 million babies are born every year in the country, and roughly 600,000 (20%) of US mothers may experience challenges with their mental well-being every year, according to the Policy Center. Black women are twice as likely as White women to experience maternal mental health conditions but half as likely to receive treatment, according to the Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance.
    
            “What we see is that the areas where there is the most need are actually the areas with the fewest resources and providers available,” Murphy said.
    
            Texas is among the 15 states that received an F. Before the Dobbs decision, it banned abortions after six weeks of gestational age – before many people realize they are pregnant.
    
            Elaine Cavazos, the chief clinical officer at a reproductive mental health care clinic in Austin, said that abortion bans have worsened an already-poor state of access to reproductive and mental health care in the state. She told CNN fears over prosecution for aiding and abetting an abortion have created a barrier between patients and providers to speak openly about their reproductive experiences, from pregnancy termination in another state to pregnancy loss.
    
            “Mental health is already tricky as it is, but when you add in a layer of ‘We can’t even talk about these things openly for fear that some negative repercussion could happen to our client,’ it just adds a layer of oppression,” Cavazos said.
    
            Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco found in an ongoing study that when people are denied abortion and are forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy, their mental health suffers, increasing the risk of perinatal mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.
    
            The UCSF researchers found that people who were denied an abortion experienced more symptoms of anxiety and low self-esteem than people who received one, according to their Turnaway Study.
    
            For people who are able to obtain an abortion out of state, bans have introduced major practical and financial barriers, McNicholas said.
    
            “Seeking an abortion in this country at this time – particularly if you live in the Midwest and the South, and most certainly if you live in a ban state – is a moment of incredible anxiety,” she said. “Not necessarily because you need an abortion but because it is so difficult to do so.”
    
            McNicholas said she has often encountered people seeking abortions due to pre-existing mental health conditions that could be exacerbated by a pregnancy. This includes people in recovery from addiction or who already experienced a case of postpartum depression from a previous pregnancy.
    
            “Abortion has been a really critical tool for them to continue to manage mental health crises in their lives and to keep them healthy and safe,” McNicholas said.
    
            Maternal health professionals are also moving away from abortion-restricted states which experts said may result in even less capacity to screen for and detect maternal mental health conditions.
    
            Most states have low access to maternal mental health care professionals already. The report cards allocated points for any state that had at least 5 certified perinatal mental health providers per 1,000 annual births. Just two states – Vermont and Montana – met that threshold. Those two states had fewer than 20,000 births combined in 2022, according to provisional CDC data
    
            Residency applications decreased slightly last year nationally, but those decreases were larger in states with total abortion bans, particularly for ob/gyns, according to research from the Association of American Medical Colleges.
    
            Although there is no systemic process to measure how many women receive maternal mental health screening and diagnosis in the United States, the CDC estimates that more than half of pregnant women suffering from depression don’t receive treatment.
    
            “Providers are already leaving the states with abortion restrictions because they feel like they really can’t do their job properly,” Murphy said. “They feel they can’t provide high-quality care to patients, whether that’s through counseling or to ensure that a birthing person who needs to terminate their pregnancy for health reasons can do it.”
    
            More providers fear also being held responsible for facilitating an abortion if their patient miscarries, which is especially common early in pregnancy, Murphy told CNN.
    
            “This is a big risk for the mother and the baby, both in terms of mental health and general health,” Murphy said.
    
            While experts told CNN they are most concerned about states where abortion bans were enacted — and where bans may still be introduced —  the state of maternal mental health is poor nationally, and bans stand to affect patients beyond a state’s boundaries.
    
            Providers in states with access to abortions are seeing an increase in patient loads, as well as misinformation and mistrust – all of which create barriers to care, said Anna King, a perinatal counselor and training director of the LA-based non-profit Maternal Mental Health NOW.
    
            “Providers and communities across the board are feeling really impacted in terms of their ability to proceed in the way that they were,” King said.

            There’s nothing a new mother likes more than being told how to please her husband – right?
    
            A Japanese city learned the hard way this week how very wrong they were, after prompting national outrage over flyers that tried to do just that. 
    
            Onomichi city, in Japan’s Hiroshima prefecture, conducted a public survey in 2017 that was used to create flyers for pregnant women later distributed to local residents, according to the city government’s website.
    
            “There are differences in the way men and women feel and think,” one flyer reads. “One of the reasons for this is the structural difference in the brains of men and women. It is known that men act based on theories, while women act based on emotions.”
    
            “The important thing is to understand each others’ differences and divide roles well,” it added, before stating that husbands and new fathers like to be thanked for carrying out basic tasks such as washing the dishes, changing diapers, and holding their child. 
    
            Wives may irritate their husbands if they are “busy taking care of the baby and not doing chores” the flyer said, advising women not to “get frustrated for no reason.”
    
            It concluded that there are many things new mothers can do to please their husbands, including giving them massages, preparing their lunch every day, handling the childcare and housework, greeting them with a “welcome home,” and always having “a smile on her face.”
    
            Local media reports this week drew attention to the flyers, with social media promptly erupting in anger and disbelief.
    
            “It’s bad enough that local authorities are transmitting the idea that childcare is the mother’s job and that a third-party father’s assistance will help the mother,” one person wrote on Twitter, recently rebranded as X. “I would like local authorities to raise awareness that fathers are also main actors in childcare.”
    
            “Stress is the enemy during pregnancy, so why exactly are they only attacking women?” another person wrote, pointing out that childbirth takes a heavy toll on women’s bodies. “A letter from an experienced mum to a new dad would probably be a hundred million times more helpful.”
    
            The city’s mayor, Yukihiro Hiratani, published an apology on the local government website on Tuesday, saying the flyers “were not in line with the sentiments of pregnant women, childbearing mothers, and others involved in child rearing, and caused unpleasant feelings for many people.”
    
            He added that the government had stopped distributing the flyers because they “contain expressions that promote attitudes and practices that stereotype gender roles.”
    
            Some online users have pointed out that as stunningly misogynistic as the flyers are, they represent the reality of Japan’s outdated gender norms and the unequal burden placed on women – one reason that has been cited for the country’s continuously falling birth rate. 
    
            The flyers, and the public survey it was based on, “mean that this is what men really think,” one person wrote on X. “Most men think that childcare is someone else’s business, wives are supposed to do the housework, don’t neglect looking after their husbands, don’t upset their husbands … You’d better not get married.”
    
            Japan remains a largely patriarchal, conservative society that was ranked 125th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum’s latest Global Gender Gap Index.
    
            Japan’s gender equality in politics is “one of the lowest in the world,” with women making up only 10% of parliament seats, according to the report. And while the number of women in the workforce has increased in recent years, they make up only 12.9% of senior or managerial positions – compared to 41% in the United States and 43% in Sweden, according to the report.
    
            Meanwhile, structural issues still prevent many working men and women from balancing careers with family life, with mothers often sacrificing their jobs to care for their children. 
    
            Even those who go back to work may face lower wages or get stuck on the career ladder, experts say. Authorities have tried to push fathers to take a more active role in childcare – but experts say many men are too scared to take paternity leave due to potential repercussions from employers.
    
            All this has contributed to the country’s falling birth rate, with authorities so far failing to encourage young couples to have more children – despite launching a slew of initiatives over the years aimed at boosting childbirth, such as expanding childcare services and some towns offering cash payments for births. 
    
            The problem is so bad that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned this year that Japan is “on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.” In 2022, Japan recorded fewer than 800,000 births for the first time since records began in 1899.

      Families of transgender children and advocacy groups sue to block a Missouri law banning most gender-affirming care for minors
    ","

    ","
            Three families with transgender children have filed a lawsuit asking a judge to block a new Missouri law that would ban gender-affirming care for most minors in the state starting next month. 
    
            The law, dubbed the “Missouri Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act,” is scheduled to go into effect August 28 and will ban health care providers from performing gender transition surgeries for those under 18 years old. Puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors will also be banned, but the legislation makes an exception for those who begin receiving treatment before the law goes into effect. 
    
            Two of the children named in the lawsuit say they have begun puberty-delaying medical treatment, but have not yet begun hormone therapy, which would be prohibited until the age of 18 unless it starts before the law goes into effect. The children, identified only by their initials, include C.J., a 13-year-old transgender boy, and A.K., a 14-year-old transgender girl.
    
            Another child, identified as Nicholas Noe, is a 10-year-old who identifies as male. 
    
            “We are frightened and outraged at Missouri’s assault on our rights as parents to seek necessary health care for our children,” the families said in a written statement released by their legal team. “It places the health and well-being of our children at great risk. It must be stopped.”
    
            “The Minor Plaintiffs will be prevented from obtaining medically necessary and evidence-based care in coordination with their families and doctors,” states the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in Cole County Circuit Court by Lambda Legal, the ACLU of Missouri and the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner on behalf of the families and advocacy groups. 
    
            The lawsuit asks a judge to block the law to “to avoid the permanent and potentially extremely serious negative health consequences for the Minor Plaintiffs and for transgender adolescents across Missouri.” 
    
            Gender-affirming care consists of medical, surgical and mental health services. Major medical organizations believe it is medically necessary for transgender and nonbinary people to help them transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender, the gender by which one wants to be known. 
    
            At least 19 states have passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for children and teenagers, including several enacted this year as the country faces a record-shattering wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation.
    
            While some states have enacted laws that can punish health care professionals who provide gender-affirming treatment to minors with prison time, others have built in limited exceptions for minors to continue medication-based or nonsurgical forms of care, according to a CNN analysis of data from the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that advocates for equal opportunity for all.
    
            The Missouri law could put health care providers at risk of losing their license if they provide the treatment to minors.
    
            “The performance of a gender transition surgery or the prescription or administration of cross-sex hormones or puberty-blocking drugs to an individual under eighteen years of age … shall be considered unprofessional conduct and any health care provider doing so shall have his or her license to practice revoked by the appropriate licensing entity or disciplinary review board with competent jurisdiction in this state,” the law states. 
    
            “There are zero FDA approvals of puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones that treat gender dysphoria in children,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, one of the defendants in the lawsuit, said in a statement on social media. “We’re not going to let left-wing ideologues experiment on children here in the state of Missouri,” he added.
    
            Bailey filed an emergency rule in April seeking to impose severe restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors and most adults in the state. He later withdrew the emergency rule after state lawmakers passed their own ban.

      Abortion rights amendment qualifies for November ballot in Ohio
    ","

    ","
            Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced Tuesday that organizers submitted enough valid signatures to put an amendment on the November ballot to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution.
    
            “I hereby certify that petitioners submitted 495,938 total valid signatures on behalf of the proposed statewide initiative,” LaRose wrote in a letter to petitioners, clearing the hurdle of roughly 414,000 signatures required to be placed on the ballot this fall.
    
            The proposed amendment in Ohio would ensure “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s reproductive decisions.” The statewide vote would come a year after two of Ohio’s neighboring states – deep-red Kentucky and the political battleground of Michigan – supported abortion rights in their own ballot measures.
    
            After the announcement, Ohio Democratic Party Chair Elizabeth Walters called it an “important victory for Ohio women.”
    
            “Out-of-touch politicians are relentlessly attacking women’s fundamental rights, inserting themselves into women’s personal, medical decisions and laying the groundwork for a total abortion ban in Ohio. In the days and weeks ahead, we look forward to telling these corrupt politicians: we won’t go back,” Walters said in statement.
    
            Ahead of the November election, Ohio voters face another key vote: an August 8 special election set by the Republican-controlled legislature, in which voters will decide whether to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution from the current simple majority to 60%.
    
            Opponents of such a special election include abortion rights activists and two of Ohio’s former Republican governors, Bob Taft and John Kasich, who all point out the session is set to happen during a slow summer season where turnout is expected to be low.
    
            Taft, at a forum in Dayton last month, called it a “major mistake,” adding, “This is a kind of change that really needs to be considered by all the people who go out and vote in a presidential election.”
    
            Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, which collected the signatures and submitted the petition, said in a statement Tuesday that sponsors of the August special election “have admitted it was placed on the ballot for one reason: to silence the voices of the vast majority of Ohioans who support reproductive rights and abortion access.”
    
            While the vote on the abortion amendment plays out, the procedure in Ohio remains legal up to 22 weeks into a pregnancy after a Cincinnati judge last year temporarily blocked a “fetal heartbeat” bill that would have banned most abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That ban was a trigger law passed in 2019, which took effect when the US Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade with its decision last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
    
            “Every person deserves respect, dignity, and the right to make reproductive health care decisions, including those related to their own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion free from government interference,” Lauren Blauvelt and Lauren Beene, executive committee board members for Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, said in the organization’s statement.
    
            “Now that the petition drive is complete, we’re eager to continue the campaign to enshrine those rights in Ohio’s Constitution and ensure that Ohioans will never again be subject to draconian reproductive health care policies imposed by extremists,” they added. 
    
            With the petition recognized, LaRose will send it to the Ohio Ballot Board, where language on the amendment will be drafted for its inclusion on the November general election ballot, according to Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights – who, in the meantime, said they “will actively participate” in the effort to defeat the measure up for a vote in August.

      Third person charged in firebombing of California Planned Parenthood

    ","
            The Justice Department announced charges Monday against a third person who allegedly participated in a firebombing attack on a California Planned Parenthood last spring.
    
            Xavier Batten, 21, of Brooksville, Florida, was arrested Friday and is being held in custody, according to prosecutors. He is charged alongside Chance Brannon, a 23-year-old active-duty Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton, and Tibet Ergul, 21, of Irvine, California.
    
            All three men are charged with conspiracy and malicious destruction of property by fire and explosion, each of which carries between five and 20 years in prison. Brannon and Ergul are facing additional charges for possession of an unregistered destructive device and intentional damage to a reproductive health services facility.
    
            Brannon has pleaded not guilty, according to his lawyer Kate Corrigan. Ergul’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment but was also scheduled to be arraigned Monday. Batten has not entered a formal plea, and a lawyer is not yet listed on his docket.
    
            According to prosecutors, the men worked together to attack the Planned Parenthood. Brannon and Ergul allegedly identified which building they wanted to attack and bought materials to assemble a Molotov cocktail. Brannon and Ergul allegedly put the Molotov cocktail together, while Batten “advised and directed” Brannon on the process, according to prosecutors.
    
            On March 13, prosecutors said, the two threw the Molotov cocktail at the door of the clinic.
    
            “Security videos described in court documents show that two men wearing hooded sweatshirts and face masks approached the Planned Parenthood facility at approximately 1 a.m. the day of the attack, ignited a device, and threw the flaming device at the front door of the building,” the Justice Department said in a news release Monday.
    
            The release quotes court documents, saying that “the device landed against a southern wall next to the glass door and erupted into a fire, which spread up the wall and across the ceiling above the glass door.”
    
            The Planned Parenthood was forced to close the next morning and cancel around 30 appointments. CNN previously reported that nobody was injured in the attack.
    
            The US Marine Corps previously declined to comment to CNN, citing the ongoing legal matter.

      Medical professionals describe a world of uncertainty a year after the Roe v. Wade reversal
    ","

    ","
            It’s been over a year since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the US Supreme Court, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion nationwide. The opinion was one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions in decades and paved the way for states to pass laws to limit or ban access to the procedure.  
    
            Abortion has already become one of the defining issues of the 2024 campaign and is expected to continue to be a key topic as candidates face questions about whether they support banning the procedure on the local and national level.  
    
            CNN spoke with doctors and medical professionals who responded to a request for stories about how people’s lives have changed in the wake of the ruling. Those who responded all shared stories of their professional lives being disrupted by abortion bans and severe restrictions — including in Idaho and Arizona.  
    
            Some no longer want to practice in states with limitations on the procedure. Others worry about the safety of their patients as more bans loom in the future. 
    
            Below we share the stories of three medical professionals who agreed to give us full interviews about their experiences.   
    
            Idaho native Katie A. had plans of returning to her home state to practice as an obstetrician/gynecologist, but after Roe v. Wade was reversed and the state passed a near-total abortion ban, she is unsure of where she will go when she completes her residency in Michigan. 
    
            Katie, who asked CNN not to use her full name due to safety concerns, was born and raised in Boise, Idaho, and went to medical school in Washington state to specialize in rural patient care.  
    
            “As I was doing my clinical rotations in Idaho, I could really see myself working with the population there,” she told CNN. “Idaho is a state that for a long time has had a shortage of physicians. There’s a huge centralization of medicine in Idaho, most of the hospitals and specialists are in Boise.” Because of this, Katie said many people outside of the city do not have easy access to care. 
    
            The medical resident told CNN that she envisioned making a difference in the state, especially by specializing in gynecological and obstetrics care.  
    
            “I was really excited about the idea that I get to move home with this population that I grew up with — I could make a difference,” she said. 
    
            When Roe v. Wade was overturned, Katie’s plans to practice in her native state quickly changed as she witnessed the medical landscape transform there. 
    
            “I really felt called, like I felt that was where I could still make the most difference and it was really important to me to continue to pursue obstetrics and gynecology — whatever that might look like,” she said.   
    
            “But for my safety and for my ability to really treat my patients, I knew as soon as Idaho started passing laws, criminalizing transportation across state lines and all that sort of thing that it would not be a hospitable place for me to practice medicine. And that you know is sort of heartbreaking, right?” the medical resident added.  
    
            Idaho made abortions illegal last August — with only two exceptions: if the mother’s life is in danger, and in the case of rape or incest, but only after a police report has been filed and provided to the doctor. Since then, doctors who care for pregnant people and perform abortions have been fleeing the state due to new abortion restrictions.  
    
            In April, health care providers sued the state’s attorney general after he wrote in a legal opinion that the state’s abortion ban prohibits medical providers from referring patients out-of-state for abortion services. Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, also approved legislation that makes it much harder for minors in the state to obtain out-of-state abortions without parental consent. The law creates an “abortion trafficking” crime that makes it illegal for adults in the state to assist a minor with obtaining an abortion without informing the pregnant person’s parents or guardians.  
    
            Katie hopes that once she finishes her residency in four years, the situation will have evolved, helping her to more easily decide where she could eventually practice.   
    
            “I think wherever I practice; it might be Michigan, it might be Washington — I don’t know, it could be anywhere — will really depend on what local politics are and what protections are in place for physicians and patients,” she told CNN.  
    
            For the time being, she feels a sense of relief for matching with a program in a state without restrictive abortion laws. 
    
            Katie’s decision is on trend with new data which suggests that these restrictions are having an impact on where — and what — future doctors plan to practice. 
    
            The number of medical school seniors who applied to residency training programs went down by nearly 2% last year, and applications to programs in states with abortion bans dropped the most, dipping by 3%, according to an analysis in April from the Association of American Medical Colleges.   
    
            Interest in the Ob-Gyn specialty took a notable dip, according to the analysis, with applications dropping 5% nationwide and twice as much in states where abortion is banned.   
    
            Dr. Robert A., a doctor specializing in interventional radiology in Washington state, told CNN that he has turned down job offers in states with abortion bans and restrictions. 
    
            Robert, who asked CNN not to use his full name due to safety concerns, explained that his work involves image-guided surgery, including using ultrasounds and computerized tomography (CT) scans for lesions and balloons and catheters to treat blocked blood vessels.  
    
            He said he became involved in pregnancy-related cases when treating bleeding in ectopic pregnancies.  
    
            The doctor said the procedure to handle the ectopic pregnancy complication would “get the bleeding under control and allow the patient to have definitive treatment, but it would also kill the embryo.”  
    
            Ectopic pregnancies are not viable and if left untreated can be life-threatening. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, these types of pregnancies occur when a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus. The organization says most ectopic pregnancies occur in a fallopian tube and when the pregnancy progresses, it can cause the tube to rupture, leading to major internal bleeding that “can be a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate surgery.” 
    
            Robert told CNN he has declined opportunities to assist in practices in states with abortion limitations — despite there being a shortage of doctors nationwide in his specialty.  
    
            “When I’ve been contacted about opportunities in other places, I’ve flatly rejected them, I wouldn’t even consider doing moonlighting in Idaho, even though I could drive there. Just wouldn’t consider it,” he said.  
    
            “But I just flat out told the recruiters, you know, just look at the map, figure out whether the state has restrictions against abortion, and if so, don’t, don’t contact me because I wouldn’t consider it,” he added.  
    
            Asked what states he specifically would not consider practicing in, Robert said most states in the southeast and Texas. “I wouldn’t go to any place really in the southeast… I wouldn’t even go to Florida on vacation right now,” he said.  
    
            Robert has two teenage daughters and said that he refuses to pay for tuition if they decide to go to college in a state with abortion restrictions or bans. He fears for their reproductive safety, especially in the states he mentioned. He said that the risk of not being treated for miscarriages and other pregnancy-related complications is too high.  
    
            “My older daughter is 18, and you know, you go somewhere on vacation, and you find out, you’re having a miscarriage, and you could potentially die, because they won’t treat it and they won’t let you leave because you might treat it,” he said.  
    
            “My daughter is getting ready to go to college and thank goodness she doesn’t want to go to Idaho or Texas, or any of those places,” he said. 
    
            Dr. Pratima Gupta, an Ob-Gyn who provides abortions in San Diego, California, said that the Roe v. Wade reversal has caused a lot of confusion for patients who now must travel for care.  
    
            The doctor, who allowed CNN to use her full name, said she has had to take steps to ensure her patients’ protection after providing care, despite practicing in a state with protective laws surrounding abortion and contraception. 
    
            “What we’re still seeing is a lot of patients who are traveling for care. And there’s a lot of confusion and chaos out there. And that’s really, exactly what was intended when the Dobbs (decision) came down,” she said.  
    
            She added that while the reversal was devastating, “It was not a surprise, and abortion care was already under attack.”  
    
            The doctor said that because she practices in one of the major cities closest to Arizona — which implemented a 15-week abortion ban — she’s seen the state’s laws leave many gray areas and patients are unclear about where they can go.  
    
            Several patients that Gupta sees are going through not only the hurdles of bypassing their home state laws, but also having to figure out travel and post-care plans.  
    
            Trying to help patients deal with the uncertainty of care and helping them navigate a flurry of laws and restrictions has left some clinic workers exhausted, she said.   
    
            Gupta told CNN that patients are scared about their data being monitored when they return to their home state.  
    
            “Now, we have people who are worried about their medical records being subpoenaed or anybody having access to their electronic medical record too… So it’s, you know, kind of created this culture of fear as well,” she added.  
    
            On a personal level, Gupta said that she has had to deal with people questioning her choices given that she provides abortions.  
    
            “I have had to, you know cross many picket lines going to work simply just to do my job,” she said. “Because of that, I have had to make personal choices for my safety.”  
    
            These measures include protecting the identity of family members, checking her car before driving home and taking different routes home.  
    
            “And I think almost every one of my colleagues has some level of, you know, other things that they have had to endure — personal attacks, attacks on their home,” she said. “But we all deserve better.” 
    
            Gupta said these challenges have not lessened her determination. She told CNN that if doctors like her stop providing abortion care, “then the anti-abortion community, they’ve won.”  
    
            “It’s not the care that any of us would ever want for ourselves, or our sisters, our family members,” she said. “So, I will continue — I do continue and will continue to provide care to support patients during some of their most vulnerable moments in their life,” the doctor added.

      Supreme Court draft opinion would overturn Roe v. Wade

            Our live coverage has ended. Read more about the draft opinion in the posts below. 
    
            When Chief Justice John Roberts announced Tuesday that the Supreme Court will investigate the release of a draft opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade, he kicked off what will likely be one of Washington’s most unusual leak investigations in recent years.
    
            According to the draft authored by Justice Samuel Alito, the court would overturn Roe’s holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            Roberts called the release “a singular and egregious breach” of trust and said he’s “directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.”
    
            It’s unclear, however, how much experience that office has in conducting a probe such as this.
    
            Here’s what we know so far about the draft opinion and the investigation:
    
            When was the draft opinion published and what does it say? The draft opinion was published Monday evening by Politico and was later authenticated by the court. In it, Alito says Roe was “egregiously wrong from the start” and “must be overruled.” 
    
            It appears that five justices would be voting to overturn Roe. Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito’s draft opinion, sources tell CNN. That would mean that the five conservative justices who would make up the majority overturning Roe are Alito and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
    
            What did Roberts say? Roberts, who has long tried to preserve the court’s independence and reputation, said in a statement that the court “will not be affected in any way” by the leak.
    
            “Court employees have an exemplary and important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process and upholding the trust of the Court.” 
    
            “I have directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak,” he said.
    
            Who is the marshal of the Supreme Court? The marshal of the Supreme Court oversees about 260 employees, including the court’s police department, which has the power to arrest people on the grounds of the court. The current marshal is Col. Gail A. Curley, who began serving as the court’s 11th marshal in 2021. 
    
            It’s unclear what investigative resources the court’s marshal has and how much experience employees have in finding the source of a leak. If the marshal finds evidence of a possible crime, the court can ask the Justice Department to prosecute someone. 
    
            Who had access to the draft opinion? Typically, the people with access to such a document would be the nine justices and the people working in their chambers, including their clerks and staff — nearly 50 people in all. 
    
            Why didn’t Roberts ask the Justice Department to investigate the leak? 
    
            Roberts has long guarded the independence of the third branch of government, keeping the legislative and executive branches, which include the Justice Department and the FBI, out of the court’s affairs. His decision to have the matter handled — at least initially — internally by a force he controls underscores that desire. 
    
            A former leader of the US Marshals Service, the agency responsible for judicial security beyond the confines of the Supreme Court, told CNN it would be unlikely that Roberts would ask an executive branch law enforcement agency to investigate the leak, noting the court is not an organization that enjoys outsiders peering in.
    
            The source also described the marshal of the Supreme Court as differing from traditional law enforcement, describing that role as more like a chief administrative officer with oversight of a police department. 
    
            What crime is at play? It’s unclear what crime could be investigated and whether the FBI and the Justice Department have the authority to look into a leak that doesn’t have to do with classified or sensitive information. 
    
            Moreover, after leading politically sensitive investigations of presidential candidates and a sitting president in recent years, Justice Department and FBI officials are loath to get the bureau involved in what may end up being a political effort to try to affect the outcome of the court’s final opinion in the case. 
    
            “Leaks of government information, by themselves, are not crimes,” said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst who’s a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “Usually, leakers are prosecuted for leaking classified information, which this isn’t, or for offenses related to how they obtained the information they leaked.” 
    
            “But without one of those hooks, or some kind of financial harm to the government arising from the leak, there’s no federal criminal statute that makes leaking of simply confidential governmental information unlawful,” Vladeck added.

            Vice President Harris said if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, it will be a “direct assault on freedom.”
    
            “Those Republican leaders who are trying to weaponize the use of the law against women… Well, we say, how dare they? How dare they tell a woman what she can do and cannot do with her own body?” Harris said during remarks at Emily List’s Gala Tuesday about the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion. “How dare they try to stop her from determining her own future?” 
    
            She received raucous applause.
    
            Harris dedicated a majority of her remarks to the issue, reminding the crowd about a back and forth she had with then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while Harris was a senator during his confirmation hearing. Harris mocked his answer when she asked if he can think of a law that governs men’s bodies.
    
            Harris then echoed President Biden, when she called for Emily’s List to help the administration elect pro-choice Democrats to Congress.
    
            “If there was ever any doubt about why Emily’s List is important, last night makes the point,” Harris said. “There is nothing hypothetical about this moment. Let me be clear. This fight requires the work of this very organization, Emily’s List, to elect pro-choice Democrats to Congress.”
    
            Harris said it was clear that there is one party working to expand rights and another working to limit them.
    
            “They want to take us back to a time before Roe v. Wade, back to a time before Obergefell v. Hodges, back to a time before Grunewald v. United States but we’re not going back! We are not going back!”
    
            In a rallying call towards the end, Harris said now is the time to enter a “new phase” of the fight that women have already been on the front lines for.
    
            “Democracy cannot be strong if the rights of women are under attack. So to all here, I say, let us fight for our country and for the principles upon which it was founded and let us fight with everything we have got,” she added. 
    
            In a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico obtained what it called a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade.
    
            The draft was circulated in early February, according to Politico. The final opinion has not been released and votes and language can change before opinions are formally released. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.
    
            The court confirmed the authenticity of the document Tuesday. It also stressed it was not the final decision.
    
            News of the draft opinion sparked reactions across the country. Demonstrators for and against Roe v. Wade gathered in front of the Supreme Court. 
    
            Here’s a look at some scenes from outside the court today: 
    
            “Compelling.” “Comprehensive.” “A tour de force.”
    
            Abortion opponents saw everything they have hoped for in their decades-long partnership with the broader legal conservative movement in a draft Supreme Court majority opinion disclosed Monday that, if ultimately adopted by the court, would end nationwide abortion rights protections for Americans.
    
            With all the caveats that the draft is not final and the vote count of a majority willing to overturn Roe v. Wade could always change, prominent members of the conservative legal world were thrilled with the approach that Justice Samuel Alito took in the document obtained by Politico after it apparently had been circulated among the justices in February.
    
            Politico published the draft opinion Monday night in a stunning breach of the norms of secrecy that surround the Supreme Court’s inner workings. Assuming the court was following its typical protocols, the justices would have privately taken a vote on their views on the abortion case in question — a lawsuit, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization challenging Mississippi’s 15-week ban — after its December oral arguments. Then a justice in the majority would have been assigned to take an initial stab at an opinion.
    
            Until a formal opinion is released — likely in June — it will remain unknown how many more edits and changes to Alito’s reasoning will have been made to shore up a majority, or even if a majority will remain behind overruling Roe.
    
            But longtime leaders of the anti-abortion movement gave full-throated approval of where Alito apparently wanted to take the court.
    
            “If this is the opinion of the Court, it will be one of the greatest opinions in Supreme Court history,” Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley tweeted.
    
            The 98-page document, which included 30 page appendix of 19th-century state abortion laws, was “compelling,” according to prominent anti-abortion lawyer Jim Bopp, and “seems to have hit every possible issue.”
    
            “There are various parts that will … appeal to certain justices or people,” Bopp, who has served as the National Right to Life Committee’s chief lawyer since 1978, told CNN.
    
            Alito called the Supreme Court’s 1973 holding in Roe — which, coupled with a 1992 decision affirming it, protects abortion rights nationwide up into fetal viability — ” egregiously wrong from the start,” of “exceptionally weak” reasoning and a decision that has “had damaging consequences.”
    
            That biting language against Roe comes after Chief Justice John Roberts had floated, during December oral arguments, a compromise route that upheld the Mississippi law while somehow avoiding reversing Roe outright. (Lawyers for both sides in the case rejected the idea that the court could rule in Mississippi’s favor without dismantling Roe.)
    
            “Roberts at oral argument at least was … open to the idea of a middle ground. And Justice Alito’s draft definitely draws a line short of that,” said Adam White, a Roe critic and legal scholar at the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute.

            As developments surrounding the Supreme Court’s draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade continue to unfold, in Oklahoma, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a new law Tuesday to restrict abortions in the state. The legislation is modeled after the Texas law that allows private citizens to bring civil suits against people providing abortion services, the governor tweeted Tuesday. 
    
            Under Senate Bill 1503, civil lawsuits can be brought against abortion providers for up to $10,000. Abortions would be banned from the point of detectable fetal activity, which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. Abortion would be allowed to protect the life of the mother.
    
            The bill was passed with an emergency provision, meaning it goes into effect immediately.
    
            Stitt already signed Senate Bill 612, which would ban nearly all abortions and is set to go into effect in August. It would make performing an abortion a felony punishable with up to 10 years in prison. Neither law would provide exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
    
            The bill comes as people around the country are reacting to a leaked draft opinion on Roe v. Wade from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. 
    
            According to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade’s holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion. This would be the most consequential abortion decision in decades and transform women’s reproductive health in America.
    
            The final opinion has not been released, and votes and language can change before release. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.

            New York Attorney General Letitia James Tuesday responded to the draft Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade, calling the decision an “egregious attempt to overturn abortion rights.”
    
            James continued: “I have long fought and will keep fighting for reproductive freedom in New York and states across the country because our democracy is strongest when every voice is heard and protected. I will never quit fighting for equality, justice, and the right for all people across the country to have full control over their own bodies.”
    
            Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have released a joint statement on the draft Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade, stating that if it becomes final “it will relegate the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues.”
    
            The statement continued; “Few, if any, women make the decision to terminate a pregnancy casually — and people of goodwill, across the political spectrum, can hold different views on the subject. But what Roe recognized is that the freedom enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution requires all of us to enjoy a sphere of our lives that isn’t subject to meddling from the state — a sphere that includes personal decisions involving who we sleep with, who we marry, whether or not to use contraception, and whether or not to bear children.” 
    
            Democrats had been struggling to find their midterm footing amid bad polls and rising inflation — but now are rallying around an issue they hope will turn around their fortunes: Abortion.
    
            With no chance of successfully passing a bill, they are pleading with voters to send them more senators to change filibuster rules and codify a woman’s abortion rights.  
    
            But they face a daunting environment nonetheless.
    
            “We will vote to protect a woman’s right to choose,” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer promised on the Senate floor Tuesday despite the fact Democrats don’t have the votes to pass such a law.
    
            But in the wake of the stunning Supreme Court leak that showed a majority of justices voting to overturn the landmark abortion decision, Democrats are grappling with the tenuous reality of their 50-50 Senate: a fractured majority that leaves them no options to enshrining abortion rights in law and instead gives them only the power to keep it in the spotlight ahead of the November elections.
    
            While some Democratic candidates are calling on senators to expand the Supreme Court or gut the filibuster to protect Roe v. Wade, neither of those options stands a chance of passing in the 50-50 Senate.
    
            “The 50-50 Senate sucks,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, lamented Tuesday, adding it was her goal to try and get more Democrats elected that would back abortion rights in the future.
    
            For now, leaders are looking to force votes on abortion rights that will put members on the record and keep the issue in the headlines. It may be the best – and only – path forward for a Democratic Party that has struggled to keep voters enthusiastic ahead of the midterms.
    
            “We are discussing this point what our next move is,” said Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois. “There is no decision about expanding the court in the early stages here, but there is a discussion about floor action.”
    
            But floor action will also expose long-established rifts in Democratic ranks. Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, doesn’t back a law that codifies abortion rights for women. 
    
            In February, he voted with Republicans against advancing the Women’s Health Protection Act, which protects the rights of women to access abortion in the US. And both Manchin and Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema reiterated Tuesday they would not back any action to gut the filibuster for abortion or any other issue.
    
            Democrats still see a path, however, to use the Supreme Court decision to turn out their base at the polls. Democrats are hopeful it could be a swift turn of fate for a party that has been struggling to rally behind a singular and cohesive message ever since efforts to pass the President’s sweeping social agenda plan faltered in December.
    
            “The simple fact is that poll after poll show that Americans do not want to overturn Roe v. Wade,” said Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. “I think it will spark outrage, anger, astonishment and a lot of votes.”

            CNN’s Morgan Rimmer and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report.
    
            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer railed against Republicans for refusing to “own up” to how their actions may now contribute to overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            “I cannot tell you the outrage I feel at this decision and the outrage I feel that Republicans who did it won’t own up to it and duck it. It’s despicable,” Schumer said at his weekly policy presser on Tuesday.
    
            The New York Democrat responded to GOP Leader Mitch McConnell being asked at his weekly policy presser by CNN’s Manu Raju whether he takes personal credit for getting Roe repealed, “and he wouldn’t even answer yes or no,” he said.
    
            Raju asked Schumer whether he regrets the decision of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg not to step aside from the Supreme Court and Democrats not urging her to do so, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett is likely in the majority to strike down Roe. “I’m not going to second guess Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” he said. 
    
            Schumer reiterated his intention to hold a vote “very soon” on legislation to codify the right to an abortion, which currently has no path forward in the 50-50 split chamber. 
    
            The majority leader declined to comment on the legislation of GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine to codify Roe, saying he hasn’t seen it.
    
            Asked about his statement accusing some Supreme Court justices of being liars, Schumer said: “When asked about Roe v. Wade, they said they follow precedent and on issue after issue they are no longer following precedent that was misleading the American people and we are many instances in the private interviews when they talk to people just the same. They were true misleading.” 
    
            Schumer dodged the question of whether Democrats should look more seriously at expanding the Supreme Court.
    
            “Our first step is to have the vote that we’re going to have next week,” he said. “And the bottom line is that we’re going to look to these elections in November and I think it’s going to be the American people (that) are going to speak loudly and clearly that we need some change. We cannot have a right wing court run America. How that changes we’ll have to see.” 
    
            Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said that abortion access in the state will remain “legal and safe” as long as he is governor. 
    
            Wolf added that he will continue to veto any legislation that threatens access to abortion in the state.
    
            “Any decision to overturn Roe v. Wade is an assault on the right to access safe, legal abortion services,” Wolf said in a news release on Tuesday. 
    
            Wolf is expected to hold a news conference Wednesday to further discuss the impact of the draft US Supreme Court decision might have on the state.
    
            President Biden, his chief of staff Ron Klain and other senior advisers huddled this morning at the White House before the President left for Alabama to discuss the extraordinary news that broke overnight of the Supreme Court draft opinion on Roe v. Wade and to craft the statement that Biden ultimately released in the morning.
    
            And now, Biden’s team is already looking ahead to what this news will mean for Democrats heading into the midterms, with one Biden adviser telling CNN that they expect and hope the news will result in many people channeling their “energy and rage” into voting for candidates who are supporters of ​legal abortion rights in November.
    
            The adviser pointed to young people, people of color, women, independents and suburban women as groups that they expect the opinion draft to galvanize. If social issues have largely been “abstract” so far, “this is no longer going to be abstract,” the adviser said. “This is going to be real.”
    
            The adviser cautioned that the development doesn’t change the fact that Democrats face significant “headwinds” heading into November. But this Supreme Court draft opinion will now be one of the several issues that Biden and other top officials discuss publicly, as they attempt to draw a contrast between Democrats and “the MAGA Republicans,” the adviser said.
    
            When Biden met with his top advisers this morning, one concern they discussed was what the draft opinion might signal about the ultimate final ruling’s reach, beyond just the issue of abortion. “It is far reaching,” the adviser said.
    
            Biden signaled as much when he spoke to reporters this morning, saying: “If the rationale of the decision as released were to be sustained, a whole range of rights would be question.”
    
            After the draft of a majority opinion on a Supreme Court case was leaked, revealing the court would strike down Roe v. Wade, Jim Obergefell says he is worried that his landmark US Supreme Court case that legalized gay marriage across America could also be in danger.
    
            While his immediate reaction to the draft opinion was that “this is a dark day for women in our nation,” he said it was quickly followed by the worry that “marriage equality is next.” 
    
            “Many of the rights we enjoy, especially the LGBTQ+ community, are based on unenumerated rights under the 14th Amendment — the right to privacy,” he explained. “If the Constitution doesn’t specifically, in writing, outline that right to privacy, then all of those rights that have been affirmed for us that are based on the right to privacy under the 14th Amendment are at risk.”
    
            He told CNN he hoped the bombshell leak spurs people on the sidelines to vote.
    
            In a statement released Tuesday, Obergefell also said that the most basic human rights are “under siege.”
    
            Earlier today, Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, also said she fears that if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it might lead to the overturning of other key privacy decisions including Obergefell, which legalized same-sex marriage.
    
            CNN’s Lauren Fox and Sarah Fortinsky contributed reporting to this post. 
    
            A draft opinion published by Politico on Monday and written by Justice Samuel Alito appears to have the support of four other Republican-appointed justices. Things could still change, but the draft eviscerates Roe v. Wade and would overturn decades of law founded on privacy rights. 
    
            If Roe is overturned, it might come as a complete shock if all you’ve watched is Supreme Court confirmation hearings for the past generation, when obfuscation by nominees on the issue of abortion was elevated to an art form.
    
            Justice Alito: At his confirmation hearing in 2006, Alito promised to respect precedent and keep an open mind on abortion cases and to respect stare decisis, the legal principle by which precedent takes on increasing importance.
    
            He tried to separate himself from a memo he wrote in 1985 as a lawyer in the Reagan administration, in which he said the Constitution did not protect a right to an abortion. He may now hand down that decision as a Supreme Court justice.
    
            Justice Thomas: Years earlier, in 1991, then-nominee Clarence Thomas told senators he hadn’t given the issue of Roe v. Wade much thought. As a confirmed justice, he pretty quickly turned into a major critic of the decision and has long pushed for it to be overturned.
    
            Justice Gorsuch: He said Roe was the “law of the land,” saying the decision held that “a fetus is not a person for purposes of the 14th Amendment.”
    
            Sen. Dick Durbin asked Gorsuch if he accepted that.
    
            “That’s the law of the land. I accept the law of the land, senator, yes,” Gorsuch said.
    
            Justice Kavanaugh: Like Alito, Kavanaugh had also written a memo as a government lawyer in which he expressed doubt about the precedent of Roe. But at his confirmation hearing, he said he understood it.
    
            Justice Coney Barrett: At her confirmation hearing to take over for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said she would set aside her personal opposition to abortion in order to follow the law as a judge. 
    
            Barrett would not say if she felt that Roe was correctly decided, according to CNN’s analysis at the time, but she did acknowledge that Roe “held that the Constitution protected a woman’s right to terminate pregnancy.”
    
            Chief Justice Roberts: He may not vote with other Republican-appointed justices to fully overturn Roe v. Wade, but he has appeared open to affirming a Mississippi law that would restrict abortion in that state to 15 weeks of gestation. 
    
            At his 2005 confirmation hearing, he said Roe was entitled to respect as a precedent. Unlike Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch, Roberts has not pushed as a justice to reconsider Roe.
    
            Read the full analysis here.
    
            The White House didn’t weigh in directly on whether the President would support getting rid of the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade, instead pointing to the last vote on legislation that would ensure the legality of abortion. 
    
            “The President’s position is that we need to codify Roe, and that is what he has long called on Congress to act on,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.
    
            “What is also true,” she continued, “is that there has been a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would do exactly that, and there were not even enough votes, even if there was no filibuster, to get that done.”
    
            That vote came before there was a renewed push to pass the act in light of the leaked Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            President Biden was asked about getting rid of the filibuster himself earlier on Tuesday but declined to say one way or the other.
    
            “I’m not prepared to make those judgments now,” Biden said, as CNN’s Jasmine Wright reported. “You know, I think the codification of Roe makes a lot of sense.”
    
            The leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion “raises eyebrows” among many, including individuals in the White House, Psaki said.
    
            “Because this is unprecedented – or almost unprecedented, depending on what historian you speak to — there’s no question that that raises eyebrows for many in the country, including those of us in the White House,” Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Alabama.
    
            “But what our focus is on right now, beyond the leak, is how we’re going to protect a woman’s right to make choices about her health care with her doctor – a right that is supported by the vast majority of the American public. And some call it a political issue. It is not. It is supported by the majority of the American public,” she continued.
    
            Vice President Kamala Harris said that now is the time to “fight for women and for our country with everything we have” in her first statement since news of the draft opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade leaked.
    
            President Biden earlier told reporters that he thinks codification of Roe v. Wade “makes a lot of sense.” While Harris did not address the issue in her statement, she said it’s clear that those who oppose the law “want to punish women” and take away their rights.
    
            Harris, the first female vice president of the United States, also echoed statements from Biden that with this draft opinion, “the rights of all Americans are at risk.”
    
            “If the right to privacy is weakened, every person could face a future in which the government can potentially interfere in the personal decisions you make about your life. This is the time to fight for women and for our country with everything we have,” Harris added.
    
            GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters on Tuesday that if a draft opinion by the Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade is accurate, “it was not the direction that I believed that the court would take”
    
            Asked how this impacts her thinking about future nominations, Murkowski said: “I haven’t processed that yet.”
    
            Murkowski later added that if the Supreme Court draft ruling striking down Roe v. Wade is accurate, “it rocks my confidence in the court.”
    
            “The comment that I made earlier was if in fact this draft is where the court ends up being … the words that I used is it has rocked my confidence in the court and that is because I think there was some representations made with regards to precedent,” Murkowski said to reporters, noting she’s specifically referring to the comments that “were made to me and to others about Roe being settled and being precedent.”
    
            What we know: The Supreme Court in a statement confirmed the authenticity of the leaked document but noted that it does not represent a decision in the case.
    
            Chief Justice Roberts called the leak a “singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here.” 
    
            The Supreme Court confirmed the authenticity of a draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade Tuesday, stressing that it was not the final decision.
    
            An official Supreme Court opinion striking down Roe v. Wade in the United States would reverberate around the world. It would firmly counter a global trend towards freer access to abortion and place the US in a very small club of countries that have moved to restrict access in recent years.
    
            Several states have already chipped away at the availability of the procedure; if swathes of the US are allowed to end it entirely, the country would become home to some of the strictest abortion laws in the Western world.
    
            Currently, the US is one of 56 countries where abortion is legal at the request at a woman’s request, with no requirement for justification, according to the World Health Organization.
    
            It is generally in the company of other Western nations, since few developed countries ban or heavily restrict access to abortions. Of the 36 countries the United Nations’ Department of Economic and Social Affairs defines as developed economies, all but two — Poland and Malta — allow abortions on request or on broad health and socio-economic grounds, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), which campaigns for improved access to abortion and monitors laws worldwide.
    
            But an end to federal protection of abortion would see parts of the US join that list. It would also push against a global tide that has seen many nations, including those on the United States’ doorstep, liberalize abortion laws in recent years.
    
            Last year, Mexico’s Supreme Court unanimously ruled that penalizing abortion is unconstitutional, in a decision impacting precedent for the legal status of abortion nationwide.
    
            The US’ northern neighbor, Canada, is one of the few countries which allows abortion at any point during pregnancy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticized moves in US states to make abortions more difficult to access.
    
            Most European Union nations — including those in the G7 — allow abortion with gestation limits, the most common being 12 weeks, according to monitoring charities including CRR. Exceptions after that period are usually permitted on certain grounds, such as if the pregnancy or birth poses a risk to the mother’s health.
    
            Japan, alongside countries like Finland and India, makes provisions for abortion in cases of rape or risk to the woman’s health, but also on wider socioeconomic grounds.
    
            Among comparative democracies to the US, Australia’s laws have been among the most similar. As in the US, access to abortion varies in each Australian state and territory — and until recently, some regions criminalized the procedure.

            Sen. Joe Manchin defended his vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, telling CNN this morning “I based it on the facts I had in front of me,” adding, “He was not – I did not see – the claims that were made against him were not substantiated in anything I saw, so I thought it was unfair. He was very well qualified.”
    
            Asked if he’d vote for him again today, the West Virginia Democrat added, “I vote for people that basically, I think, have the qualifications that they’re asked to do.”
    
            Pressed on if his support for the Senate filibuster was unchanged, Manchin replied, “The filibuster is a protection of democracy.”
    
            The US Supreme Court’s legitimacy has been deeply pierced, and it may never recover its stature in the eyes of America.
    
            For Chief Justice John Roberts, whose concern for the institution’s reputation is manifest in nearly every opinion he writes and every public speech he makes, the developments are a disaster of the highest order.
    
            Not only does it appear that the five most conservative members of the court, including the three new appointees of former President Donald Trump, are ready to overturn a half century of constitutionally grounded abortion rights. It further appears that Politico, which published the first draft of the opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, had surmounted the court’s longstanding protocols of secrecy and security.
    
            Such a breach of an opinion at this early stage of drafting is unprecedented. And that it occurred in a case of seismic importance to American life, a case that could affect so many women and their families, and in a case that could reorder the political landscape, only makes the entire episode more startling.

            President Biden spoke further on the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on Roe v. Wade, saying it concerns him “a great deal.” 
    
            “It doesn’t represent who’s going to vote for it yet. I hope there are not enough votes for it,” Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
    
            According to the draft document, the Court found there’s no inherent right to abortion because it is not covered under privacy protections derived from the Constitution. 
    
            “The Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,” Alito wrote. He said that Roe was “egregiously wrong from the start” and that its reasoning was “exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.”
    
            Biden said “a whole range of rights” would be questioned if the draft reflects a final opinion, he said. 
    
            “And the idea we’re letting the states make those decisions … would be a fundamental shift in what we’ve done. So it goes far beyond, in my view —  if it becomes a law and if what is written is what remains, it goes far beyond the concern of whether or not there is the right to choose. It goes to other basic rights: the right to marry, the right to determine a whole range of things, because one of the issues that this court and many members of the court, or a number of members of the court, have not acknowledged that there is a right to privacy in our Constitution. I strongly believe there is,” he said. 
    
            “If this decision holds, it’s really quite a radical decision,” Biden added.
    
            When asked if he would do away with the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade, Biden said “I’m not prepared to make those judgments now … but you know, I think the codification of Roe makes a lot of sense.”

            The Supreme Court confirmed the authenticity of the leaked document in a statement Tuesday.
    
            “Yesterday, a news organization published a copy of a draft opinion in a pending case. Justices circulate draft opinions internally as a routine and essential part of the Court’s confidential deliberative work. Although the document described in yesterday’s reports is authentic, it does not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case,” the statement said.
    
            Chief Justice Roberts called the leak a “singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here.” 
    
            Roberts said he asked the Marshal of the Court to investigate.
    
            Read Roberts’ statement:
    
            The United States Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police Department, and Supreme Court Police are adding security measures in response to demonstrations surrounding the leaked draft opinion that would overturn Roe V. Wade.  
    
            Protesters descended on areas outside the Supreme Court overnight after the draft opinion was released, and have remained throughout the morning. 
    
            A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department told CNN the department is activating its Civil Disturbance Unit to manage protests, but declined to specific how many officers or where they’d be deployed.  
    
            The United States Capitol Police said it is working with other agencies and adding additional officers to areas around the Supreme Court.  
    
            Demonstrations are planned throughout the day after hundreds turned out at the steps of the building.
    
            Shut Down DC has advertised an event in the area to begin around 5 p.m. Other groups from New York to Houston have advertised protests via social media at municipal buildings, parks and other highly visible locations, such as the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. 
    
            Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said it’s “a dark and disturbing morning for America,” in the wake of the draft Supreme Court opinion obtained by Politico that would strike down Roe v. Wade. 
    
            He said, “The Republican-appointed justices reported votes to overturn Roe v. Wade will go down as an abomination. One of the worst, most damaging decisions in modern history.”
    
            Schumer argued the blame for this reported decision falls on “every Republican senator who’s supported Sen. [Mitch] McConnell and voted for Trump justices pretending that this day would never come.” He said they will now “have to explain themselves to the American people.” 
    
            Schumer said while this day has come, “we will fight it all the way.” 
    
            As the Supreme Court “is poised to strike down Roe,” Schumer said it’s his intention that the Senate will vote to codify the right to abortion into law. But in the split 50-50 Senate, there is currently no path forward to do that. 
    
            “A vote on this legislation is not an abstract exercise,” he added. “This is as urgent and real as it gets. We will vote to protect a woman’s right to choose and every American is going to see which side every senator stands. Every American is going to see on which side every senator stands.”
    
            House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, along with House Whip Steve Scalise and Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, wrote in a statement Tuesday morning that the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on Roe v. Wade was “an attempt to severely damage the Supreme Court.” 
    
            They added that it was designed to “intimidate and obstruct” the court’s work. 
    
            The lawmakers also call for an investigation into the leak and said House Republicans are “committed to upholding the sanctity of life, and we will continue to fight to be a voice for the truly voiceless.”
    
            Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell released a statement focused on the leak of the SCOTUS draft opinion saying, the “stunning breach was an attack on the independence of the Supreme Court” and that the action should be “investigated and punished.”
    
            “All nine Justices should tune out the bad-faith noise and feel totally free to do their jobs, following the facts and the law where they lead,” he said.
    
            Speaking on the Senate floor shortly after releasing the statement, McConnell called the leak “shocking” and said that “judicial independence is vital.”
    
            Read McConnell’s complete statement:
    
            Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, called out Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in a statement Tuesday after Politico published what it said is a draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,” Collins said.
    
            Asked on Tuesday by CNN’s Manu Raju if she was misled by Kavanaugh, Collins says: “My statement speaks for itself.”
    
            Some more context: Collins, a supporter of abortion rights who cast a critical vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh, said in an interview with CNN in 2019 that despite his vote in a recent abortion access case, she did not believe Kavanaugh would ultimately vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            “I have always been concerned about preserving Roe v. Wade,” Collins said, adding that Kavanaugh had given her assurances during his confirmation process that the landmark opinion was safe.
    
            “He said under oath many times, as well as to me personally many times, that he considers Roe to be ‘precedent upon precedent’ because it had been reaffirmed in the Casey v Planned Parenthood case,” Collins added, dismissing any criticism of her as partisan politics.
    
            Here’s a look at the US Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade.
    
            Case: 1971 — The case is filed by Norma McCorvey, known in court documents as Jane Roe, against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, who enforced a Texas law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman’s life.
    
            Decision: January 22, 1973 — The US Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, affirms the legality of a woman’s right to have an abortion under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. The court held that a woman’s right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy (recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut) protected by the 14th Amendment. The decision gave a woman the right to an abortion during the entirety of the pregnancy and defined different levels of state interest for regulating abortion in the second and third trimesters. The ruling affected laws in 46 states.

            A reversal of Roe v. Wade would leave abortion policy up to individual states and would likely produce a patchwork system where the procedure would remain largely available in Democratic-led states, while Republican-led states would pass extreme limits or outright bans on it.
    
            Here’s how some governors reacted to Politico publishing what it called a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade. 
    
            Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, North Dakota: 
    
            Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, Washington: 
    
            Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, New Hampshire: 
    
            “As a pro-choice governor, I am committed to upholding Roe v. Wade, which is why I am proud of the bipartisan bill headed to my desk this year that expands access. So long as I am governor, these health care services for women will remain safe and legal.”
    
            Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, Minnesota:
    
            Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, Alabama: 
    
            Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, New York: 
    
            “I am horrified by the apparent draft Supreme Court opinion leaked this evening that would overturn the right to abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. For the sake of women across the country, this should not be the Supreme Court’s final opinion when it comes to abortion rights.”
    
            “We have been fighting this battle for too long. I refuse to go backwards. I refuse to let my new granddaughter have to fight for the rights generations have fought for and won, rights that she should be guaranteed.”
    
            “For anyone who needs access to care, our state will welcome you with open arms. New York will always be a place where abortion rights are protected and where abortion is safe and accessible. Just as the Statue of Liberty lifts her lamp tall in our harbor, New York will never stop fighting for what’s right — unafraid and undeterred.”
    
            Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas:
    
            President Biden said a woman’s right to have an abortion is “fundamental” in a statement after Politico published what it said is a draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            In a statement released Tuesday morning, Biden said that while “we do not know whether this draft is genuine, or whether it reflects the final decision of the Court,” he wanted to make clear his administration’s stance on the cases before the Supreme Court. 
    
            Biden wrote his administration “argued strongly before the Court in defense of Roe v. Wade.”
    
            Here’s his full statement:
    
            Biden has a complicated history with abortion, CNN’s Kevin Liptak reported earlier Tuesday, going from a moderate position as a senator to more fully embracing the Democratic Party position when he ran for president. He has yet to say the word “abortion” during his presidency, a review of his public comments found.
    
            This draft was circulated in early February, according to Politico. The final opinion has not been released and votes and language can change before opinions are formally released. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.
    
            CNN has not independently confirmed the document’s authenticity. Politico says it has authenticated the draft. A Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment to CNN.
    
            Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade.
    
            The draft was circulated in early February, according to Politico. 
    
            But remember — this is a draft: The final opinion has not been released and votes and language can change before opinions are formally released. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.
    
            Here’s how the process works: Oral arguments in the case were held on December 1.
    
            Under normal procedure, by the end of that week the justices would have met in their private conference to take a preliminary vote on the issue. They would have gone around the table in order of seniority discussing their take on the case. Chief Justice John Roberts would have gone first, with Amy Coney Barrett, the newest member of the court, last.
    
            After that initial tally, if Roberts was in the majority, he would assign the majority opinion. Otherwise the most senior justice would have taken that responsibility. After that, draft opinions would go between chambers. In the past, justices have changed their votes and sometimes a majority opinion ultimately becomes a dissent.
    
            Americans United for Life responded to Politico publishing what it called a draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, with the group saying it “applauds the Supreme Court’s courage in abolishing its abortion precedents.”
    
            “We encourage the Court not to waver despite the politically-motivated leaking of this draft opinion. The implicit intent of this leak is to pressure and manipulate members of the Court to alter their votes or otherwise water down the language of the final opinion—if the Court is truly the nonpolitical body that Chief Justice John Roberts has said that it is, the Court cannot now bow to partisan pressure to change course for the sake of an illusory detente,” the AUL said in a statement. 
    
            The draft was circulated in early February, according to Politico. The final opinion has not been released and votes and language can change before opinions are formally released. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.
    
            Katie Glenn, government affairs counsel at AUL, said if the draft opinion is ultimately handed down, “then it means state lawmakers have to get to work to enact strong state law and policy to protect life.” 
    
            “Americans United for Life calls on state lawmakers to meet in special session the moment the Dobbs decision is officially released to enact the strongest possible pro-life laws,” she said. 
    
            In the draft majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito also addresses the notion that if the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, it could lead the court to overturn other cases like Obergefell v. Hodges that upheld the right to same sex marriage.
    
            What “sharply distinguishes” Roe from other cases is that “abortion destroys” potential life, Alito said. 
    
            The decision should be decided by the states, he said, and added that the Court was not able to end the debate nearly a half century ago when the Roe came down.
    
            “This court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on,” he said.
    
            Roe v. Wade has been on the books for almost 50 years and although the court is loath to overturn precedent, Alito says it must do so.
    
            The notion of “stare decisis” does not “compel unending adherence to Roe’s abuse of judicial authority,” he said, adding that instead of “bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue,” Roe and a follow-on decision “have enflamed debate and deepened division. “ 
    
            “The inescapable conclusion,” Alito wrote, according to the draft, “is that a right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions.”
    
            He added, the decision was on a “collision course” with the Constitution “from the day it was decided.”
    
            After Politico obtained what it said is a draft of a majority opinion written by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade, Planned Parenthood called it “horrifying and unprecedented.”
    
            “It confirms our worst fears: that the Supreme Court is prepared to end the constitutional right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade. While we have seen the writing on the wall for decades, it is no less devastating, and comes just as anti-abortion rights groups unveil their ultimate plan to ban abortion nationwide,” according to a statement. 
    
            Planned Parenthood CEO and President Alexis McGill Johnson also told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Monday night that “we believe this is a road map for how they will take Roe down, and we have already seen it over these last nine months in Texas.”
    
            The American Civil Liberties Union also weighed in on the draft opinion, saying that “if the Supreme Court does indeed issue a majority opinion along the lines of the leaked draft authored by Justice Alito, the shift in the tectonic plates of abortion rights will be as significant as any opinion the Court has ever issued.” 
    
            “It would deprive half the nation of a fundamental, constitutional right that has been enjoyed by millions of women for over 50 years. The breach in protocol at the Court pales in comparison to the breach in constitutional freedoms that the Court is charged with upholding. However the decision ultimately comes down, the ACLU will never stop fighting for a person’s right to choose when and if to have a child,” ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said. 
    
            CNN’s Amanda Musa contributed reporting to this post. 
    
            Since the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which established the legal right to abortion in the United States, nominees to the highest court have been asked about their views on abortion during their confirmation hearings. 
    
            They’ve also been asked about Casey v. Planned Parenthood, a 1991 decision that established the “undue burden test” by which abortion regulations are judged.
    
            Watch this rundown of what they said.
    
            Even as activists have warned about the likelihood the Supreme Court could overturn Roe v. Wade, President Biden has yet to say the word “abortion” during his presidency, a review of his public comments finds. 
    
            He has used the word in written statements and a tweet, but in public remarks he has tended to use euphemisms like “access to health care” and “protecting the rights of women.” 
    
            That has drawn some criticism from abortion rights advocates, who say avoiding the word creates a stigma around abortion and speaks to an issue they say fell off his priority list.
    
            Biden has a complicated history with abortion, going from a moderate position as a senator to more fully embracing the Democratic Party position when he ran for president. 
    
            Senate Democratic candidates immediately pushed for Senate Democrats to eliminate the filibuster and pass legislation to protect abortion rights after Politico reported that the Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in an initial draft majority opinion written by conservative Justice Samuel Alito.
    
            Democrats control the 50-50 Senate, but would need to strike down the chamber’s rules requiring 60 votes to advance most legislation to pass such a law.
    
            “Democrats need to act NOW—end the filibuster, codify Roe, and defend reproductive freedom,” tweeted Wisconsin Treasurer Sarah Godlewski. “This fight is too urgent.”
    
            “Democrats have to act quickly — get rid of the filibuster to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act + finally codify Roe into law,” tweeted Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. “We cannot afford to wait.”
    
            “Control of the Senate has never been more important: it’s time to end the filibuster, pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, and fight like hell to make sure all Ohio families are free to make these critical decisions without interference from politicians in Columbus or Washington,” added Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. 
    
            Republican Senate candidates touted the reported decision as a long-awaited victory, 49 years after Roe v. Wade granted a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            “A victory for human life,” said Arizona Senate GOP candidate Jim Lamon. Another Arizona Senate GOP candidate, Blake Masters, tweeted, “bye bye Roe.”
    
            Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks said that the leaked decision aimed to “intimidate” justices before the final ruling.
    
            “They are only leaking this in order to put pressure on and intimidate the Court before the decision officially comes down,” tweeted Brooks. “Pray for life and that justice is done.”
    
            The case in question is Dobbs v. Jackson. It concerns a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week ban on abortion, and oral arguments were heard on Dec. 1. The release of a final opinion in the case is expected later this Spring or early summer.
    
            Under normal procedure, by the end of that week the justices would have met in their private conference to take a preliminary vote on the issue. They would have gone around the table in order of seniority discussing their take on the case. Roberts would have gone first, with Barrett last.
    
            After that initial tally, if Roberts was in the majority he would assign the majority opinion. Otherwise the most senior justice would have taken that responsibility. After that, draft opinions would go between chambers. In the past, justices have changed their votes and sometimes a majority opinion ultimately becomes a dissent.
    
            A reversal of Roe v. Wade would leave abortion policy up to individual states and would likely produce a patchwork system where the procedure would remain largely available in Democratic-led states, while Republican-led states would pass extreme limits or outright bans on it.
    
            The Dobbs case was perhaps the most anticipated case of the court’s term, and most court observers expected that the conservative majority was likely to scale back or outright overturn Roe’s holding. At oral arguments, Roberts was the only one of the six Republican appointees who signaled interest in exploring a narrower opinion that would have upheld Mississippi’s law but preserved some protections for abortion rights.
    
            Because it is one of the court’s most high-stakes and contentious decisions, the anticipation was that the opinion would be among the final ones the court released at the end of its term in late June.
    
            Roe is the law of the land until the court formally issues its opinion.
    
            “Let’s be clear: This is a draft opinion. It’s outrageous, it’s unprecedented, but it’s not final. Abortion is your right — and it is STILL LEGAL,” Planned Parenthood said in a tweet following Politico’s reporting.
    
            For their midterm election fight, Democrats have already been poised to seize on the possibility that the landmark decision to legalize abortion could be overturned, but the leaked opinion Monday night accelerates those plan. 
    
            With their control of the House and Senate already at risk this fall, Democrats have been hoping to use the anticipated decision to energize and galvanize their voters — something the party has struggled to do, compared to the motivating force the issue has long been for conservatives.
    
            Party advisers from Congress to the White House are studying the leaked decision, unwilling to publicly weigh in tonight. But look for the argument to start on Tuesday — “we can’t wait for this decision to be official.”
    
            California leaders have announced a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would protect the right to abortion in California after a draft of a majority Supreme Court opinion circulated that would overturn Roe v. Wade Monday.
    
            “California is proposing an amendment to enshrine the right to choose in our state constitution so that there is no doubt as to the right to abortion in this state. We know we can’t trust the Supreme Court to protect reproductive rights, so California will build a firewall around this right in our state constitution. Women will remain protected here.”
    
            It appears that five justices would be voting to overturn Roe. Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court’s three liberals.
    
            That would mean that the five conservative justices that would make up the majority overturning Roe are Alito and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
    
            Roberts is willing, however, to uphold the Mississippi law that would ban abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, CNN has learned. Under current law, government cannot interfere with a women’s choice to terminate a pregnancy before about 23 weeks, when a fetus could live outside the womb.
    
            In a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade.
    
            In the draft opinion, Alito writes that Roe “must be overruled.”
    
            He added, “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s representatives.”
    
            “That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand,” he said, according to the draft.
    
            CNN has not independently confirmed the document’s authenticity. Politico says it has authenticated the draft.
    
            It appears that five justices would be voting to overturn Roe. Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito’s draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court’s three liberals.
    
            That would mean that the five conservative justices that would make up the majority overturning Roe are Alito and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
    
            Things to remember: The final opinion has not been released and votes and language can change before opinions are formally released. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.
    
            According to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade’s holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion. The opinion would be the most consequential abortion decision in decades and transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.

    ","
            Follow the latest news on the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling here and read more about today’s developments in the posts below.
    
            On Friday, from Washington Square Park up to Union Square, past Madison Square Park and the outdoor diners in the Flatiron — some whooping encouragement; some gazing in bafflement — New Yorkers marched. 
    
            The air was filled with chants of “Illegitimate Court” and “Pro-Life? It’s a lie, people die!” Cyclists dressed in black blocked off the cross streets, frustrating some drivers. 
    
            Watching from the sidewalk, cheering on the protesters, were 17-year-old Eden Kaplan and 16-year-old Sophie Kirk. The two high school students had found out about the Supreme Court’s decision this morning, through a barrage of posts on friends’ Instagram stories. 
    
            “I would want to say I was surprised, but I don’t really feel like I was,” Kaplan said. “My (20-year-old) sister also came in the room screaming and crying about what was happening.”
    
            Already, the future looks more limited. A rising senior, Kaplan has yet to settle on a college, and is pondering which state to spend the next years of her life. After today, the range of options has been severely curtailed, she said. 
    
            “That’s really upsetting to think about that.”
    
            As they spoke, Kaplan and Kirk passed a hand-drawn sign back and forth: “My body is not a political battleground.” 
    
            They saw it — for real, for the first time, on Instagram and on Twitter, in emails and from links and texts from family. 
    
            They knew it was coming, but for many of the women protesting in New York City on Friday afternoon and evening, some sitting and watching, others marching, prepared with scrawled-over t-shirts — “Bans off my body” — and an array of furious, witty and acerbic signs, the simple fact of it was almost too much to bear: Roe v. Wade had been overturned. Abortion, safe and legal, is now or will imminently be banned for millions across the country.
    
            Kaluta was in Washington Square Park as the city’s protest hub filled up a little before 6:30 p.m. No one was quite sure where the march was heading — they just wanted to be there, to be together. Even if it changed nothing. Hoping it would change something, if only a little, for someone who could not be there. 
    
            Mia Khatcherian, 32, felt a pang of guilt at her first reaction to the court’s decision: She was happy to live in New York state, where abortion is expected to remain a protected right under state law. “It felt selfish,” she said.
    
            The daughter of a Filipina mother and Armenian father, Khatcherian knew that people would be watching. “Knowing that women of color are going to bear the brunt of this decision” made sitting home, raging on social media, an impossibility, she said — so she joined those on the street.
    
            Protests outside the Supreme Court on Friday have been peaceful so far, according to CNN correspondents on the scene. People are speaking out against the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            The opinion is the most consequential Supreme Court decision in decades and will transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.
    
            Going forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.
    
            Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue are outside the building in Washington, DC, to make their voices heard. CNN Correspondent Donie O’Sullivan said some are activists who have been working on this issue while others are tourists from states who are already implementing abortion restrictions.
    
            Many of the protesters are expressing concern not just about abortion, but also about what comes next — including possible changes to other issues like same-sex marriage that also hinge on the right to privacy, O’Sullivan reported.
    
            CNN Law Enforcement Correspondent Whitney Wild said demonstrations at the Supreme Court have been peaceful. There has not been a reason for Capitol Police or any other agencies to intervene with the crowd, Wild said, and there have not been any arrests. She said law enforcement is still concerned about domestic violent extremists who may see the large crowds as an opportunity for violence.
    
            Groups like Planned Parenthood, Bans Off Our Bodies, and Women’s March are among the activist groups organizing the events across the country, including in Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, and Houston.
    
            After news broke that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, activist groups began organizing protests for Friday. 
    
            CNN has found that at least 70 protests have been planned.
    
            Groups like Planned Parenthood, Bans Off Our Bodies, and Women’s March are among the activist groups organizing the events.
    
            Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Houston are among the cities where protests will occur or are already underway. 
    
            An abortion rights advocate climbed to the top of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge in Washington, DC, Friday to protest the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            The bridge is currently shut down, according to the District’s Department of Transportation, who said in a statement the closure is due to “safety concerns involved with protest activity and will remain in effect until further notice.”
    
            Guido Reichstadter posted videos and photos of himself on social media from the top of the bridge where he unfurled a large green banner. Green is recognized as a symbol of abortion rights. Reichstadter also planted a flag on the bridge that reads: “Don’t tread on my uterus.”
    
            Reichstadter told CNN on the phone that he intends to stay on top of the bridge for as long as he physically can. Reichstadter is without water after his bottle fell out of his bag when he arrived to the top, he said.
    
            He told CNN that while many people in the US oppose the Supreme Court’s decision, their support is largely passive, which he says is not enough to ensure that women have access to abortions across the country. 
    
            WATCH: 
    
            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine urged Ohioans on Friday to have a “civil debate” in a message that was both televised and posted on the governor’s Twitter account, in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
    
            DeWine said he would be working with the General Assembly and local communities to improve the quality of pre- and post-natal care, mental care for mothers and children, among other measures. 
    
            “I believe that all Ohioans want this state to be the most pro-family, pro-child state in the country, and we are making great progress in creating an environment here in Ohio where families and children can thrive and live up to their full potential,” DeWine said.
    
            Some context: Republican Ohio Attorney General David Yost filed an “emergency” motion in federal court on Friday to dissolve the injunction against the state’s Heartbeat Law, he said in a post on his Twitter account. The bill would have banned abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy.
    
            Paxton Smith, the Texas teen who went viral after changing her valedictorian speech to speak out against the state’s abortion law last year, told CNN the energy at the Supreme Court Friday “was high and it was angry,” following the Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            Smith has been in Washington, DC, since last Friday in anticipation of the decision, she told CNN. 
    
            “A lot of people are just really, really angry and kind of coping with this feeling of disbelief that in America, the so-called ‘land of the free’ and ‘land of the equal,’ a human right has been taken away from so many people,” she said. 
    
            “I’m feeling fairly disappointed, and I guess, I mean, the main feeling is fear,” she described. 
    
            Smith, who is now 19 years old and just finished her first year at the University of Texas at Austin, has been advocating for abortion access since her viral speech last year. She is on the board of an abortion fund and abortion advocacy organization and just attended a human rights conference in Switzerland, she said. 
    
            “Don’t let that fear kind of just sit on the side. Use it and use it as motivation for your work,” Smith said.
    
            California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new law strengthening abortion rights in the state, following the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            As he signed the bill, Newsom described feeling “pissed, resolved and angry.”  
    
            California’s new law, passed by the state legislature on Thursday, will create a protective shield against any potential civil action originating outside the state for anyone performing, assisting, or receiving an abortion in the state. AB 1666 will protect not just California residents but anyone visiting the state seeking reproductive health care.
    
            The new law is just one of more than a dozen bills making their way through the legislature, aiming to strengthen and protect abortion access. Other proposed bills would seek to focus on root causes of reproductive health inequities, enhance privacy protections, and allow qualified nurse practitioners to provide first-trimester abortions.
    
            Anger over the court’s opinion was not limited to Newsom.
    
            Bonta and Newsom were joined by other lawmakers determined to strengthen the state’s laws and ensure women in other states with more restrictive laws know they can come to California to seek health care.
    
            “California is a safe haven for those who seek abortion care. Abortion remains fully legal in California. Today’s decision does not impact our state’s laws. You have the right to an abortion here,” Bonta said. “In California, we refuse to turn back the clock and let radical ideologies exert control over your body.”
    
            California has also introduced an amendment adding reproductive health care as a fundamental right to the state’s constitution, which will go before voters in November.
    
            The amendment reads: “The state shall not deny or interfere with an individual’s reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions, which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives. This section is intended to further the constitutional right to privacy guaranteed by Section 1, and the constitutional right to not be denied equal protection guaranteed by Section 7. Nothing herein narrows or limits the right to privacy or equal protection.”
    
            “This is not just about choice, it is not just about reproductive freedom,” Newsom insisted, mentioning marriage equality, interracial marriage, and transgender rights. “They’re coming after you next,” he warned.
    
            Performing abortions in Kentucky is now considered a felony after the state’s Human Life Protection Act, which prohibits the willful “termination of the life of an unborn human being,” went into effect Friday, Attorney General Daniel Cameron said.
    
            “Today is a day that many have hoped for — the issue of abortion has been returned to the people and to the states, where it belongs,” Cameron said in a statement. “This moment deserves to be celebrated, but it also calls for renewed commitment. Renewed commitment to life-affirming care for the unborn, for mothers, and for Kentucky families.”
    
            The ACLU of Kentucky said it is prepared to file a lawsuit in state court arguing against SCOTUS’s opinion citing that “the Kentucky Constitution allows for the legal right to access abortion.”
    
            They issued a statement Friday saying that their clients have stopped providing care while their legal team assesses the court’s opinion in how it relates to laws in Kentucky. 
    
            “We will aggressively litigate this claim on behalf of our Louisville-based client, EMW Women’s Surgical Center, seeking relief from the courts that will allow all providers to resume providing abortions as soon as possible,” the statement said.
    
            With the Supreme Court deciding there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion, the baby formula shortage and effects of the pandemic on careers and home life, women are carrying the weight of the world.
    
            At the same time, online hatred is running rampant and some fear the impact an Elon Musk-run Twitter and his push for free, less-moderated speech could have on women, especially women of color. Life can be mentally exhausting, especially in 2022.
    
            What struggles are you facing and what do you want the world to know? Women are always juggling, but this moment seems uniquely hard with new challenges piling up. How are you handling 2022? What do you hope for? Share your thoughts with us and we may follow up for a CNN story.
    
            Many Americans don’t remember what it was like before 1973, when the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade — but California Rep. Barbara Lee does.
    
            She said she remembers the fear of getting an abortion at that time: Terrified she might die, and terrified because she knew the abortion she was getting in Mexico was illegal.
    
            “Coming back across the border, I didn’t know if I was going to get stopped. I didn’t know, getting into California, if I was going to get stopped and arrested — Back in the days now where abortions and abortion providers are going to be criminalized. That is horrific,” Lee said.
    
            “We cannot let this happen,” she added. “We cannot go back.”
    
            She said one of her main concerns is that the restriction on abortion rights will disproportionately impact people of color and people living in rural and low-income areas. These people don’t have the money or resources to be able to travel for services like she did or pay for child care, she said. 
    
            “The ballot box — we have got to elect state and local officials who trust women and who know that a personal decision about their own reproductive decisions is personal, it’s private, just like it was with me,” Lee said.
    
            WATCH:
    
            Dr. Janet Cathey, physician provider at the Little Rock Planned Parenthood office, told CNN that they had to cancel between “60 and 100” appointments for people who had abortion procedures scheduled or were in the process of scheduling. 
    
            The total includes about “30 patients today, another 20 tomorrow and then there were patients next week,” Cathey said.
    
            Cathey told CNN that in Arkansas, patients seeking abortion procedures must wait 72 hours before being able to receive medications for termination, which is why those appointments that were canceled for “some who were doing first-day consultation, and some were following up to get their medications.”
    
            Cathey said all  patients were given contact information to the Planned Parenthood office in Overland Park, Kansas, office to get help with their abortion procedures there. She said that the Little Rock office “made arrangements for some to be transferred there.” 
    
            Little Rock is roughly seven hours from Overland Park, but for those patients in southern Arkansas, the travel time is closer to 10 hours, Cathey said. 
    
            Speaking about the impact on Arkansas by today’s SCOTUS ruling, Cathey said it’s not just local residents who will be impacted. 
    
            “We were seeing people from Louisiana and Texas who came to see us too. Some called from Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. They’re going to be impacted as well,” she added.
    
            Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge earlier on Friday signed a certification that prohibits abortions in the state.
    
            Media giants have become the latest corporate titans to reaffirm financial support for abortion-seekers following Friday’s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            The entertainment goliath Disney assured employees Friday they would be able to afford a similar level of health care outside of their home area if they needed to travel to access health services, including family planning and pregnancy-related services, a Disney spokesperson told CNN.
    
            Meanwhile, the cable and media giant Comcast said Friday that travel for abortion services is covered under a company-wide employee benefit. Under the policy, Comcast may pay each employee up to $4,000 per trip if the employee needs to travel to access a covered health care service. The coverage is capped at three trips and $10,000 per year, whichever comes first, but the benefit resets each year, meaning that employees who require follow-up health visits out-of-state could benefit substantially from the policy over multiple years, Comcast told CNN. The benefit applies to all Comcast and NBCUniversal employees, the company said, and the amount paid typically depends on the type of expense incurred.
    
            And Warner Bros. Discovery — which owns CNN — said in a statement that it “immediately” expanded its benefits program on Friday following the court’s ruling to cover abortion-related travel expenses. 
    
            “Warner Bros. Discovery is committed to offering our employees across the country access to consistent and comprehensive healthcare services,” a company spokesperson told CNN. “In light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision, we immediately expanded our healthcare benefits options to cover transportation expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortion and reproductive care.”
    
            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she is trying to stop a nearly-century-old law that restricts abortions from going into effect, now that the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade.
    
            If the proposed law does go into effect, it would make Michigan one of the most restrictive states on abortion access.
    
            The 1931 law that’s still included in Michigan’s penal code states: “Any person who shall wilfully (sic) administer to any pregnant woman any medicine, drug, substance or thing whatever, or shall employ any instrument or other means whatever, with intent thereby to procure the miscarriage of any such woman” … is guilty of a felony.
    
            It has an exception to “preserve the life” of the woman, but it does not exclude for rape or incest. The law also threatens abortion providers with prison time, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan.
    
            In response, Whitmer filed a lawsuit to try to block it from going into effect, before Roe was overturned. Now, she said she is hoping the court takes action soon.
    
            “I filed this lawsuit a couple of months ago. People thought that it was too early, or maybe it wasn’t going to be necessary, obviously, it was both timely and absolutely necessary,” Whitmer told CNN on Friday.
    
            The lawsuit argues that under the Michigan constitution, “women have due process and equal protection right to privacy and bodily autonomy and I’m hoping that our judges move swiftly to recognize that right here,” she said.
    
            Whitmer said restricting abortion rights in Michigan would not just hurt those who live in the state, but would also restrict care for women who come from neighboring states like Indiana and Ohio — both states whose legislatures are poised to ban abortion.
    
            CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.
    
            Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor has certified banning abortion in the state, according to Gov. Kevin Stitt, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday.
    
            “John O’Connor wasted no time. His swift action to certify section 861 banned abortion in our state immediately,” Stitt said. “It is my hope that the rest of America will follow Oklahoma’s lead.” 
    
            O’Connor said during a Friday news conference with the governor that “the people of Oklahoma have decided through their elected leaders, and the governor signed legislation making abortion illegal in the state of Oklahoma from the moment of conception, except in the instance of saving the life of the mother.”
    
            “And remember that in the Oklahoma law, there is no punishment for the mother. There is no criminal punishment. There is no civil exposure for the mother. It is for the people who aid or abet or solicit abortion,” he added.  
    
            “Oklahoma’s law is very clear now. And so, law enforcement is now activated with respect to any efforts to aid, abet or solicit abortions,” he added. 
    
            Some background: Stitt signed a bill last month that would make performing abortions illegal in the state, only allowing exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person. The measure makes performing an abortion or attempting to perform one a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both.
    
            A second bill signed into law last week set a timeline for provisions to go into effect, and it was dependent on how the Supreme Court ruled.
    
            A coalition of 83 prosecutors collectively representing 87 million people from 28 states and territories have publicly vowed not to prosecute those seeking and performing abortions in the wake of the Supreme Court’s opinion clearing the way for bans and legal action.
    
            The joint statement asserts that criminalizing abortion will not end the practice, but will inhibit safe procedures and inhibit those needing medical, social, and law enforcement help from seeking it.
    
            “We are horrified that some states have failed to carve out exceptions for victims of sexual violence and incest in their abortion restrictions; this is unconscionable,” the statement said. “And, even where such exceptions do exist, abortion bans still threaten the autonomy, dignity, and safety of survivors, forcing them to choose between reporting their abuse or being connected to their abuser for life.”
    
            The prosecutors are comprised from states that plan to protect reproductive rights like California and Illinois, but also include those from 11 states that plan to implement stricter restrictions like Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama.
    
            “This is a sad day in America,” said Gascón, who is one of the 83 elected prosecutors who signed the pledge. “The Supreme Court has told half the population that it has no right to bodily autonomy. One Justice said out loud that we should reconsider even more rights, including the right of everyone to love and marry who they choose. I grieve for all those women who have lost so much today, and for all those people who live in fear that they will lose more tomorrow.”
    
            The represented states and territories include Georgia, California, Missouri, Virginia, New York, Maryland, Alabama, Colorado, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Mississippi, Texas, Vermont, Oregon, Illinois, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Maine, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Hawaii, Indiana, Illinois, Washington, Mississippi, New Mexico, Kansas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands.
    
            Republican Ohio Attorney General David Yost filed an “emergency” motion in federal court on Friday to dissolve the injunction against the state’s Heartbeat Law, he said in a post on his Twitter account.
    
            “We filed a motion in federal court moments ago to dissolve the injunction against Ohio’s Heartbeat Law, which had been based on the now-overruled precedents of Roe and Casey,” he said in the tweet.
    
            The injunction was filed on July 2019 according to the motion.
    
            In Georgia, Attorney General Chris Carr has filed notice with the 11th Circuit requesting it reverse the District Court’s decision and allow the state’s Heartbeat Law to take effect, according to a press release from his office.
    
            “I believe in the dignity, value and worth of every human being, both born and unborn. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs is constitutionally correct and rightfully returns the issue of abortion to the states and to the people – where it belongs,” Carr said. 
    
            Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed a restrictive abortion bill into law in 2019, but it was blocked by a federal judge later that year.
    
            Sisters Jeanne, a Florida Republican, and Joni, a Minnesota Democrat, are divided by geography and political party. 
    
            But when they landed — together — on a flight into New York this morning, getting the news from their seatback televisions, they shared the same “disappointment” with the court’s decision. 
    
            Jeanne, who did not want to give her last name, described herself as a “financial conservative” and said she was puzzled by the intense focus on abortion by some in her party. 
    
            Joni, who also did not want to provide her surname, is a Democrat and practicing nurse. She said she expected her home state to become a magnet for women seeking legal abortions. 
    
            “I never advocate for someone to use abortion as a form of birth control,” she said. “But everyone should be able to decide for themselves. … I don’t walk in someone else’s shoes. How do I know — maybe (giving birth) is going to be tough on their mental health? It’s not such a black-and-white issue.”
    
            Another point they agreed on: Decision-makers in Washington — from the Supreme Court to Capitol Hill — were the last people they wanted rendering such a convulsive judgment.
    
            Despite their shared frustration with the ruling and “big gridlock” in federal government, neither sister said the overturning of Roe v. Wade was going to set them on a new path of activism. 
    
            They won’t be attending any protests tonight — instead, it’s on to Broadway with tickets to see “Company,” the award-winning revival of a production that debuted in 1970, three years before Roe v. Wade was decided. 
    
            The five-justice Supreme Court bloc that overturned a half century of women’s abortion rights on Friday had coalesced less than two years. But they had found their moment and they seized it.
    
            This is America’s new Supreme Court, moving swiftly, rejecting the incrementalism of Chief Justice John Roberts, and upsetting individual privacy rights in an epic decision that will reverberate for decades.
    
            No matter how much of a preview the country received when an early draft was leaked in May, the sweep and audacious tone of the final ruling still breathtaking.
    
            The court rejected that landmark and a series of abortion rights decisions that followed, including the 1992 decision that reaffirmed Roe as key justices then in the majority declared they might not have voted for Roe but accepted the decision that had become ingrained in society.
    
            Their sentiment and that of most of the justices who have joined the high court since 1973 was that neither the country nor the court itself could go backward. Institutional integrity and the revered principle of stare decisis, adherence to precedent, demanded that.
    
            But that is not this court. Today’s justices on the right wing are unlike the Republican-appointed conservatives who first voted for Roe and then upheld it, joined by justices on the left. The three Donald Trump appointees, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the bench in October 2020 and anchored the Friday decision, have not hedged on abortion rights.

            The Department of Homeland Security intelligence branch notified law enforcement, first responders and private sector partners nationwide Friday of potential domestic violence extremist activity in response to the Supreme Court’s decision on abortion, according to a memo obtained by CNN.
    
            The memo, from the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, says federal and state government officials, including judges “probably are at most risk for violence in response to the decision.” 
    
            It also includes warnings about “First Amendment protected events,” reproductive and “family advocacy health care facilities,” and faith-based organizations being targets for violence or criminal incidents. 
    
            DHS previously released a National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin warning of potential violence surrounding the Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights.
    
            The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion. Going forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. 
    
            Here are the answers to some of the most common questions about what this ruling means.
    
            Will women get arrested for having an abortion?
    
            An abortion-seeker’s criminal liability will depend on the abortion policies that her state put into place. 
    
            Leaders of the anti-abortion movement have said in the past that women shouldn’t be prosecuted for obtaining an abortion and that criminal laws prohibiting it should be aimed at abortion providers or others who facilitate the procedure. Several states with abortion prohibitions that could go into effect with Roe’s reversal have language exempting from prosecution the woman who obtained the abortion.
    
            There’s also nothing to stop lawmakers from passing the laws calling for the prosecution of the people who sought the abortion. 
    
            In the event of rape or incest or even underage pregnancy, where does the law lie for these individuals?
    
            Exemptions in abortion bans for rape, incest or the health of the mother will now vary state by state. In the wave of abortion limits that have been passed by state legislatures recently in anticipation of the Supreme Court’s ruling, only a few of the proposals included exemptions for rape and incest.
    
            It’s a question lawmakers will likely revisit now that the opinion has been handed down. While previewing plans to call a special legislative session once the opinion is issued, Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he opposed rape or incest exemptions. On the flip side, Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN this May that he supported adding rape and incest exemptions in the trigger law currently on the books in the state.
    
            How are in vitro fertilizations defined? If a state defines the fertilized egg as a human with rights, then if a doctor fertilizes four eggs, but does [not] implant all four in a woman, is that homicide?
    
            What this opinion means for fertility treatments is still uncertain. Some state laws have language that would appear to exempt the disposal of unused embryos created for IVF, but that language doesn’t necessarily exempt the process of selective reduction — when a woman whose fertility treatments lead to multiple pregnancies has one or more of those fetuses terminated to protect the viability of the other fetuses and/or the health of the mother. More broadly, fertility law experts raise concerns about how Roe’s reversal will embolden lawmakers to regulate IVF procedures — which have been largely shielded from the abortion debate because of the protections of Roe.
    
            Why does the currently Democrat-controlled legislature not pass a federal law making abortion legal?
    
            Democrats currently lack the votes to dismantle the Senate filibuster, a 60-vote procedural mechanism that Republicans can use to block federal abortion rights legislation — so as long as 40 senators oppose abortion rights. But it’s worth noting that the Women’s Health Protection Act — a bill that would codify and expand upon Roe — failed 49-51 when it was voted on in May in the Senate, meaning that, even without the filibuster, it would have not become law.
    
            There are also legal questions about whether it would be constitutional for federal lawmakers to enact a nationwide ban. The late Justice Antonin Scalia stressed in his legal writings about abortion that the policy decisions belonged in the hands of individual states, while expressing skepticism that Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate the procedure.

            Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Friday signed a certification that prohibits abortions in the state.
    
            Rutledge certified Act 180, which passed in the state in 2019.
    
            Through tears, Rutledge said, “I will always recall where I was when the Dobbs decision came down. As the first woman ever elected attorney general, as someone who it took a long time for God to decide it was time for me to be a mom, I can’t wait for other women across Arkansas to have that same joy of seeing their child’s face that maybe they would not have seen had it not been for today’s decision.”
    
            Rutledge earlier said, “none of us thought today would come in our lifetimes,” adding, “Roe was wrong on that day and it has been wrong every day since.”
    
            Rutledge said the Supreme Court decision puts Arkansas’ anti-abortion laws in place and allows the state to ban abortions — with the only exception being to save the life of a mother in a medical emergency.
    
            During the news conference, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the decision is “a turning point for our nation.”
    
            Hutchinson said he will be directing the Arkansas Department of Health to enforce the new law in the state and make sure any abortion provider is in compliance and understand the penalties. 
    
            “This does not put at risk access to contraceptives or other issues that are tangentially related,” he said. 
    
            The state regulation of abortions can still be challenged, he said. But that challenge cannot be based on a constitutional right. 
    
            “We need as a state and a nation to continue to support women who have unwanted pregnancies, and for some they see abortion as an only solution,” Hutchinson added.
    
            CNN spoke with a number of young women in favor of abortion access on Friday who expressed fear and anger following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            “I’m torn and scared for the future,” said Nisa Ortiz, a 25-year-old mother of a four-year-old daughter.
    
            “This is scary. I’m scared for my friends who have had pregnancy complications before, and the younger generation of 13-to-21-year-olds will face the brunt of it,” she said.
    
            Nicolette Carrion, a 19-year-old from New York, pointed to the impact this decision could have on women of color. 
    
            “As a woman of color, it’s obvious there is a racial wealth gap that exists,” Carrion said, adding that she worries about less access for sexual health resources depending on one’s socioeconomic background.
    
            “As a result of this decision, women are deemed to just be this vessel for having children,” she said, pointing to the reality that it was mostly men who made the decision. “Now we’re just objects, where our reproductive abilities are controlled by the state we live in.”
    
            Celeste Lintz, a 21-year-old student at University of Pittsburgh, said she was studying abroad in South Africa when the draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked earlier this year.
    
            At the time, Lintz said, “I was very, very scared to come back to the United States to see what was going to happen.”
    
            “My initial reaction is disgust. I felt physically ill. But my most pressing feeling was anger and rage,” said Olivia Julianna, a 19-year-old political strategy specialist for the group Gen-Z for Change, a collective of online creators and activists.
    
            The Texan expressed her anger with Texas’ Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, adding that she is working to ensure he is not elected again.
    
            “Although I may not work on the ground or in a clinic, I use digital advocacy and the power of social media to share information and resources to people across the country and rally them behind calls to action concerning reproductive healthcare,” she said.
    
            Celestina Sunny, a 23-year-old from Dallas, said she believes that if lawmakers want to prevent abortion, they should consider investments into sex education.
    
            “What’s most heartbreaking to me is that this decision is really going to affect women who are already marginalized and whose socioeconomic position already predicates safe abortion access. I’m really thinking about them today,” she said.
    
            Vice President Kamala Harris slammed the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade in remarks in Illinois on Friday. Harris was initially supposed to unveil a new administration strategy to improve maternal health, but said “this is a health care crisis.” 
    
            “For nearly 50 years, we have talked about what Roe v. Wade protects,” Harris said in a speech. “Today … we can only talk about what Roe v. Wade protected. Past tense. This is a health care crisis.”
    
            The vice president, the first woman elected to the office in the US, said millions of women will go to bed tonight without access to the same healthcare protections that they had just this morning. And that their mothers and grandmothers had as well.
    
            Harris said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade today could also affect other “rights that we thought were settled” — including same-sex marriage.
    
            “This opinion also says when you read it, that abortion is not deeply rooted in our nation’s history. They offer that in the opinion as a foundation for the decision they rendered today. In holding that it is not deeply rooted in our history, today’s decision on that theory, then, calls into question other rights that we thought were settled, such as the right to use birth control, the right to same-sex marriage, the right to interracial marriage,” the vice president said, speaking in Illinois. 
    
            “You have the power to elect leaders who will defend and protect your rights. And as the president said earlier today, with your vote, you can act, and you have the final word. So this is not over,” she said. 
    
            WATCH: 
    
            Now that the Supreme Court has given the green light for lawmakers to prohibit abortion, several states, most of them Republican-led, have taken quick steps to do so. In at least seven states, state officials say that abortion bans can now be enforced.
    
            Three states — Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota — have so-called “trigger bans” that went into effect automatically with the Supreme Court’s reversal Friday of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that had established a constitutional right to an abortion. Ten other states have trigger bans with implementation mechanisms that occur after a set period or after a step taken by a state government entity.
    
            Among the trigger-ban states in the latter category, Missouri has already made the move required to implement its ban on abortion, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt announcing Friday that he had taken the step of certification laid out by Missouri law.
    
            Oklahoma, which had recently put in place a law banning most abortions, has also taken the step of implementing its trigger ban, according to a certification letter from the attorney general tweeted by a state Senate leader on Friday. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge also certified the state’s trigger ban, allowing it take effect on Friday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced.
    
            In Texas, where the trigger ban is to be implemented on the 30th day after the Supreme Court ruling, Attorney General Ken Paxton has announced that local prosecutors may now begin enforcing an abortion ban passed by the state before the Roe ruling. Several other states have similar pre-Roe bans, but it’s not clear yet whether they’ll now seek to enforce them and whether such maneuvers will be challenged in court.
    
            Other states have prohibitions on abortion that had been blocked by courts that had cited Roe’s guarantee of a right to abortion. Those states may act quickly to have those court orders lifted so that those restrictions can go into effect. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey referenced a court order that had halted the state’s 2019 abortion ban and said in a statement that Alabama “will immediately ask the court to strike down any legal barriers to enforcing this law.”
    
            It’s likely that elsewhere in the country, state legislatures will soon be called back into session to pass strict abortion laws that previously would have run afoul of Roe.
    
            Indiana’s Republican Gov. Eric J. Holcomb is calling for a return of the General Assembly on July 6 so that legislators can consider anti-abortion legislation.
    
            CNN’s Tami Luhby and Avery Lotz contributed to this report.
    
            Linda Coffee, who was the lead attorney for Norma McCorvey — known in court documents as Jane Roe — in the 1973 case Roe v. Wade, said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn it “flies in the face of American freedom.”   
    
            “In addition, the decision will set up years of litigation over the commerce clause and a woman’s inability to receive acceptable health care state-to-state. The added cost and inconvenience of a woman seeking needed health care, and facing the lack of services in her state, is a direct attack on the right to privacy, as well as equality expected when it is violation of the commerce clause of federal law and the US Constitution. The litigation will be endless, and chaos will ensure for American women, as a class of citizens.”
    
            Some background: McCorvey was a Texas resident who sought to obtain an abortion. Texas law prohibited abortions except to save the pregnant mother’s life. McCorvey was pregnant when she became the lead plaintiff in the case. She gave up the baby for adoption.
    
            McCorvey has since come forward and spoken against abortion. In 1997, McCorvey started Roe No More, an anti-abortion outreach organization that was dissolved in 2008. McCorvey died on February 18, 2017. In the 2020 documentary “AKA Jane Roe,” prior to her death in 2017, McCorvey told the film’s director that she hadn’t changed her mind about abortion but became an anti-abortion activist because she was being paid. 
    
            Dozens of House Republicans gathered for a news conference Friday to celebrate the Supreme Court decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            With women lawmakers at the front of the stage, they hailed the ruling overturning Roe v Wade as a victory for the pro-life moment and vowed to keep fighting for anti-abortion causes. 
    
            “Today’s historic Supreme Court decision is a victory for the sanctity of life. It will save countless innocent children. House Republicans are incredibly grateful for the pro-life movement’s tireless efforts for decades, leading to this day to give a voice to the voiceless and protect our most vulnerable unborn babies,” said House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik. “As a new mom, I know there is nothing more extraordinary than the miracle of life. Hearing Sam’s heartbeat for the first time – I’m gonna cry – was the greatest blessing and gift for our family.”
    
            “Hallelujah. I woke up this morning praying for this,” said freshman Rep. Mayra Flores, who was just sworn in this week and also delivered remarks in Spanish. “If we want to see real change in bringing crime down, we need to raise a generation to respect life in the womb.”
    
            “This is certainly a day that pro-lifers have been waiting for for 49 years,” said Rep. Michelle Fischbach.
    
            Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the House Energy and Committee, railed against a House-passed bill to codify Roe and other Democratic policies, accusing Democrats of “forcing an extreme agenda on America.”
    
            Rep. Chris Smith, one of the leading anti-abortion voices in the GOP who is the sponsor of a 20-week nationwide abortion ban, called it a “brand new opportunity to defend the weakest and most vulnerable from the violence of abortion.”
    
            “While this is a major step forward … we’re in an area where we’ve got to fight even harder to defend these innocent children,” Smith said.
    
            House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy called for a “peaceful reaction” to the ruling and said the Department of Justice “must step up to protect our justices, their family, churches and pro-life pregnancy centers from unprovoked violence.”
    
            When asked by CNN about what bills he would put on the floor if the GOP recaptures the majority, McCarthy did not commit to putting any specific pieces of anti-abortion legislation on the House floor.
    
            “We will continue to look wherever we can go to save as many lives as possible,” McCarthy said. 
    
            But after the presser, Rep. Ann Wagner told CNN that she has reassurance that one of the very first bills a GOP-led House would vote on is her “Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act”, which requires medical care to be given to an infant that survives an attempted abortion, even though medical care would already be required under such a scenario.
    
            Vice President Kamala Harris will address the Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade in remarks Friday in Illinois, ahead of scheduled remarks on maternal health.
    
            A White House official said Harris watched President Biden’s speech from a classroom at the CW Avery Family YMCA in Plainfield, Illinois. 
    
            “She was joined by Senator Durbin, Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson, and staff,” the official added in a statement to reporters traveling.
    
            “The Vice President did not go on a scheduled tour at the YMCA. She is conferring with staff and will address the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade while at the YMCA,” the official added.
    
            Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights groups condemned threats of destruction and violence Friday ahead of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  
    
            The statement came amid calls from a group known as “Jane’s Revenge” which has claimed responsibility for attacks on a number of anti-abortion rights centers across the country in recent weeks.
    
            “Jane’s Revenge” is calling for a “Night of Rage” after the historic Supreme Court ruling is released. The calls have prompted United States Capitol Police to warn officers about the group, according to an internal memo that was issued last week and seen by CNN.
    
            “The group’s attacks are likely to continue in the near future and increase in intensity if the decision as written stands,” the USCP memo read, adding the group is “cellular” in nature and lacks a formal leadership structure. 
    
            “We reject the tactics and threats of groups that use destruction and violence as a means to an end,” a joint statement from Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the Liberate Abortion Campaign read. 
    
            “They do not speak for us, our supporters, our communities, or our movement. We are committed to protecting and expanding access to abortion and reproductive freedoms through peaceful, non-violent organizing and activism,” it added.
    
            French President Emmanuel Macron pledged “solidarity” with women in the United States on Friday after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
    
            French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna also said on Friday the decision was “appalling.”
    
            She wrote on Twitter: “Appalling: the overturning by the US Supreme Court of the right to abort is a major setback for fundamental rights.”
    
            “France will continue to defend them,” she added.
    
            Celebrities are voicing their opinions after the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Here’s what some of them are saying on social media:
    
            Taylor Swift
    
            Superstar Taylor Swift, quote-tweeting former first lady Michelle Obama’s statement, said on Twitter: “I’m absolutely terrified that this is where we are - that after so many decades of people fighting for women’s rights to their own bodies, today’s decision has stripped us of that.”
    
            Julianne Hough
    
            On Instagram, dancer and actress Julianne Hough wrote that “Women’s rights are human rights. We must keep fighting,” along with a clip of her from the Broadway show “POTUS.” 
    
            Mark Ruffalo 
    
            Actor Mark Ruffalo on Twitter said the Supreme Court has been “turned into a political organ of the religious right.” 
    
            Jamie Lee Curtis
    
            Actress Jamie Lee Curtis posted a pink square on Instagram, writing: “As a MOTHER of two children born from other women who CHOSE to carry them to full-term which allowed me to be a mother, at this MOMENT, more than ever before, I will do EVERYTHING in my power to protect the RIGHTS of my daughters to make any CHOICE that involves THEIR bodies with THEIR own minds and without ANY governmental influence or restriction.”
    
            Padma Lakshmi
    
            “People will still get abortions. These procedures won’t stop just because Roe v. Wade is overturned. This will only prevent safe, legal abortions from taking place,” model and TV host Padma Lakshmi said in a Twitter thread, calling the ruling a “catalyst for a public health crisis.”
    
            Danny DeVito
    
            Here’s how the actor succinctly summed up his feelings about the decision. 
    
            Friday’s Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion, brought reaction from both sides of the issue.
    
            Here’s what it looked like at the Supreme Court immediately following the decision:
    
            Levi Strauss & Co — the 169-year-old jean company — stands strongly against restricting access to abortion, the company said in a statement Friday, after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
    
            “We stand strongly against any actions that hinder the health and well-being of our employees, which means opposing any steps to restrict access to the full range of reproductive health care, including abortion,” the company said in a statement. 
    
            The company said it will continue to protect employees — making sure they have access to the care they need regardless of where they live.  
    
            The company said through the Levi Strauss Foundation it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights, Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast, which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care.
    
            Kristen Day, the executive director of Democrats For Life of America, said the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade gives them an opportunity to “go back to the states and see how we can really do more to focus on what women really need.”
    
            Some context: CNN’s most recent poll conducted by SSRS showed that 66% of people did not want Roe v. Wade it to be overturned. This closely matches a recent CBS News/YouGov poll, which indicated that 64% of Americans want to keep the Constitutional right to abortion as it is.
    
            Additionally, about 60% of Americans are in favor of keeping first-trimester abortions legal, the poll shows.
    
            aier Becerra, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, on Friday called the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade “unconscionable,” saying abortion is a basic and essential part of health care.
    
            “Today’s decision is unconscionable,” Becerra said in a statement released by the agency. “Abortion is a basic and essential part of health care – and patients must have the right to make decisions about their health care and autonomy over their own bodies.”
    
            Becerra said that he has supported reproductive rights both as a member of Congress and as California’s attorney general. 
    
            The US Food and Drug Administration has not yet formally commented on the Supreme Court’s decision. 
    
            FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf did not give a reaction when asked during an Aspen Ideas Health panel on Friday. 
    
            “I’m not going to react to the decision. I’m not going to talk about the decision,” Califf said when asked for his reaction as a physician and public health official. “What I will say is that the science and the medicine haven’t changed. We have a big Supreme Court decision and we have to digest that and look into it further before I’m going to react.” 
    
            omer President Donald Trump praised the Supreme Court’s undoing of national abortion protections, calling it “the biggest win for life in a generation” in a statement hours after the decision was handed down on Friday. 
    
            “Today’s decision… along with other decisions that have been announced recently, were only made possible because I delivered everything as promised, including nominating and getting three highly respected and strong Constitutionalists confirmed to the United States Supreme Court,” Trump said. 
    
            This is a far cry from an interview he gave to The New York Times last month where he declined to take credit for Roe v. Wade’s reversal following the leak of a draft opinion in the Dobbs case. 
    
            “I never like to take credit for anything,” Trump said at the time. 
    
            In his Friday statement, Trump instead touted his administration’s appointment of conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. 
    
            “It was my great honor to do so!” he said, attacking Democrats, the media and so-called RINO Republicans. 
    
            Here’s how some governors are responding after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade:
    
            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul
    
            Hochul tweeted in response to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade: “Today the Supreme Court rolled back the rights of millions of Americans, disregarding their interests and — more importantly — their lives. Access to abortion is a fundamental human right, and it remains safe, accessible, and legal in New York.”
    
            Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds
    
            “As Governor, I won’t rest until every unborn Iowan is protected and respected,” she said. 
    
            New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu
    
            Sununu issued the following statement after the United States Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade:
    
            “Regardless of this Supreme Court decision, access to these services will continue to remain safe, accessible, and legal in New Hampshire.”
    
            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
    
            Whitmer pledged to “fight like hell” after the Supreme Court decision. 
    
            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott
    
            “Texas will always fight for the innocent unborn, and I will continue working with the Texas legislature and all Texans to save every child from the ravages of abortion and help our expectant mothers in need,” he said.
    
            Florida Gov. Ron. DeSantis
    
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis released a statement on Twitter Friday, saying, “By properly interpreting the Constitution, the Supreme Court has answered the prayers of millions upon millions of Americans.” 
    
            “The prayers of millions have been answered. For nearly fifty years, the U.S. Supreme Court has prohibited virtually any meaningful pro-life protection, but this was not grounded in the text, history or structure of the Constitution. By properly interpreting the Constitution, the Dobbs majority has restored the people’s role in our republic and a sense of hope that every life counts.”
    
            The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade Friday “represents a major setback after five decades of protection for sexual and reproductive health and rights.” 
    
            “It is a huge blow to women’s human rights and gender equality,” she added.
    
            Bachelet said more than 50 countries with previously restrictive laws have liberalized their abortion legislation over the past 25 years.  
    
            “With today’s ruling, the US is regrettably moving away from this progressive trend,” she said.
    
            aadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacted to the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the US Supreme Court, calling the news of the ruling “horrific.”
    
            “My heart goes out to the millions of American women who are now set to lose their legal right to an abortion,” Trudeau said in a tweet. “I can’t imagine the fear and anger you are feeling right now.”
    
            Trudeau went on to express his support for Canadian women to have the right to choose. 
    
            In a tweet, Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly called today a dark day for women around the world. 
    
            “This reversal of decades of hard fought gains will endanger the lives of women across the United States and jeopardize further rights,” Joly said. “We must remember that no country is immune: Your voice matters. Your vote matters.”
    
            See Trudeau’s tweet:
    
            South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and leaders in the South Dakota State Legislature, in response to the US Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, jointly announced plans for a special session later this year “to save lives and help mothers impacted by the decision.” 
    
            According to a release from the governor’s office, the exact dates of the special session will be decided after discussion with legislative leadership. 
    
            “The Legislature intends to take the time to make sure South Dakota law protects the unborn and helps mothers,” the release said.
    
            South Dakota’s trigger law provides that as of today, all abortions are illegal in South Dakota “unless there is appropriate and reasonable medical judgment that performance of an abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant female,” according to the release.
    
            In the wake of the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, the Congressional Black Caucus, led by Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty, is calling on President Biden to declare a national emergency.
    
            The statement said the decision to restrict access to abortion care “will disproportionately endanger the lives of Black Americans.”
    
            “We have seen what life was like pre-Roe v. Wade, and America cannot afford to go back,” the statement added.
    
            Who gets abortions: Black women are three times more likely than White women to die of pregnancy-related complications, encounter racism from health care providers at higher rates, face unequal pay and are more likely than their White counterparts to lack health insurance. 
    
            Abortion rights advocates say the pay disparity alone hampers Black women’s ability to secure affordable childcare and housing. And there are no federal laws that mandate paid maternity leave. Activists also argue that there has been little movement on federal police reform that they say would create safer environments for Black women to raise their children.
    
            Some context: CNN has previously reported that Biden’s administration has been working for months in preparation for the expected decision by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. 
    
            Options for moves Biden could take include executive action that could make it easier for women to travel to receive abortions in states where the procedure is still legal or expanding access to medication abortion through the mail. Some advocates have also suggested leasing federal land for abortion clinics, bypassing state laws that restrict them.
    
            CNN’s Nicquel Terry Ellis contributed to this report 
    
            She knew it was coming, but when word of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade popped up on Emma Green’s phone this morning, the 19-year-old from West Virginia was stunned.
    
            “I felt sick to my stomach,” Green said. “My heart dropped because it felt more real. When (the draft court opinion leaked) there was still hope. Now it’s more real.”
    
            Green, a marketing student at West Virginia University in Charleston, said she fully expected her home state to implement full prohibition. 
    
            West Virginia has a so-called “zombie law” on the books banning abortion dating back more than a century that could snap back into effect with the high court’s ruling — a step that Republican Gov. Jim Justice appears prepared to push forward. 
    
            “I will not hesitate to call a special session after consulting with the Legislature and my legal team if clarification in our laws needs to be made,” Justice said in a statement.
    
            Tonight, Green will join friends at a protest. For a Democrat who follows the news closely, but has never been an activist, she said, “It’ll be a good start.” 
    
            President Biden said the Supreme Court’s decision to end the Constitutional right to abortion “cannot be the final word” as he urged Congress to act and voters to take their frustrations to the polls.
    
            “My administration will use all of its appropriate lawful powers. Congress must act, and with your vote, you can act,” Biden said.
    
            The President said the decision has made the US an “outlier among developed nations in the world,” but it “is not over.”
    
            Biden also called on those protesting the decision to remain peaceful.
    
            “I call on everyone no matter how deeply they care about this decision to keep all protests peaceful — peaceful, peaceful, peaceful. No intimidation. Violence is never acceptable,” he said, adding that “threats and intimidation are not speech.”
    
            President Biden said his administration will protect the “bedrock right” of women to travel from states that ban abortion to those that allow it, also pledging to protect women’s access to medications.
    
            “If any state or local official — high or low — tries to interfere with a woman exercising her basic right to travel, I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un-American attack,” he added. 
    
            He also vowed to protect women’s access to medications approved by the FDA and contraception. 
    
            Some states are saying that “they’ll try to ban or severely restrict access to these medications,” Biden said, adding that “extremist governors and state legislators are looking to block the mail or search a person’s medicine cabinet” are “wrong and extreme and out of touch with the majority of Americans.”
    
            Biden said health organizations have said that “by limiting access to these medicines, maternal mortality will climb in America.”
    
            He adde the Department of Health and Human Services will ensure medications are available “to the fullest extent possible.” 
    
            Friday’s Supreme Court ruling that overturns Roe v. Wade is “literally taking America back 150 years,” said President Biden.
    
            Biden looked ahead to the elections in November and said voters must vote for representatives who will restore abortion rights.
    
            “Let me be very clear and unambiguous. The only way we can secure a woman’s right to choose … is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law. No executive action from the President can do that,” he said.
    
            “And if Congress, as it appears, lacks the votes to do that now, voters need to make their voices heard. This fall, you must elect more senators and representatives who will codify a woman’s right to choose into federal law once again,” Biden added.
    
            WATCH:
    
            President Biden said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade marks a “sad day for the court and for the country.”
    
            Biden said with the Constitutional protection gone, “the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk.”
    
            The President said as the vice president and now as President, he has studied this case carefully to inform decisions about who to nominate to sit on the Supreme Court.
    
            “I believe Roe v. Wade was the correct decision,” he said.
    
            President Biden, speaking after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, placed the ruling on the three justices named by former President Trump, adding that “it’s a realization of an extreme ideology.” 
    
            “It was three justices named by one president, Donald Trump, who were the core of today’s decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country. Make no mistake, this decision is a culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law,” Biden said.  
    
            “The court has done what it’s never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans that had already been recognized. The court’s decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences,” he said.  
    
            The White House joined a call following the Supreme Court’s ruling on Roe v. Wade Friday with key stakeholders, a source familiar with the call tells CNN, previewing forthcoming announcements on administrative actions on women’s reproductive health. 
    
            The Biden administration is expected to make three announcements, the source said, made by President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Attorney General Merrick Garland. The administration will enforce protection for medication-induced abortion and the Department of Health and Human Services will increase access to those medications. Women will have the right to travel to other states for abortion care and the Department of Justice will protect them if they choose to do so. And the Justice Department will also protect providers to advise women on abortions.  
    
            The President is also expected to call on Americans to elect candidates who support abortion rights and to call on Congress to codify the protections in Roe. 
    
            Representatives from NARAL, Planned Parenthood and Emily’s List were among those on the call. 
    
            President Biden is delivering remarks on the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion, according to the White House.
    
            “It’s a sad day for the court and for the country,” Biden said, speaking from the White House.
    
            The White House has been bracing for the ruling from the nation’s highest court, which was announced Friday morning, and has been planning next steps for months.
    
            While there is little the President can do through executive action to fully mitigate the decision — and virtually nothing he can do to restore the nationwide right to an abortion — there are a number of steps Biden has been weighing in consultation with policy aides, political advisers and lawyers.
    
            Some of the options the President has been considering include eliminating barriers to accessing medication abortion and challenging state laws that criminalize out-of-state travel to receive an abortion, CNN has reported. The President could also declare a public health emergency, which could shield doctors from legal liability if they treat patients in states where they are not licensed.
    
            The President has also called for Congress to pass legislation codifying Roe v. Wade, but Democrats currently don’t have the votes in the Senate to send such legislation to Biden’s desk.
    
            Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the US Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage, responded to Justice Clarence Thomas writing separately to call explicitly for the court to reconsider its rulings striking down state restrictions on contraceptives, state sodomy bans and state prohibitions on same-sex marriage.
    
            In their dissent, the liberal justices wrote “no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.” 
    
            “The right Roe and Casey recognized does not stand alone,” they wrote. “To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage.” 
    
            Obergefell called the overturning of Roe v. Wade “a sad day” for women’s rights. 
    
            “The reality is that women today will have less rights than their own mothers. We are going backwards and it’s both enraging and terrifying to see the excessive government overreach that this court is imposing on our country,” he said. 
    
            GOP Sen. Susan Collins said the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was “inconsistent” with what Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh said in their testimonies and meetings with her.
    
            “This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon,” Collins said in a statement on Friday.
    
            The Republican senator said the Justices indicated they believed in the importance of “supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon.”
    
            Collins said earlier this year she introduced legislation with GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski to “codify the abortion rights established by Roe v. Wade and affirmed by Planned Parenthood v. Casey.” The statement said the bill would reinforce the importance of abortion protections.
    
            “Our goal with this legislation is to do what the Court should have done — provide the consistency in our abortion laws that Americans have relied upon for 50 years,” Collins said.
    
            Liberal justices in their dissent of Friday’s Supreme Court ruling said it will impact “countless life decisions,” including “whether and how to invest in education or careers, how to allocate financial resources and how to approach intimate family relationships.”
    
            “Taking away the right to abortion, as the majority does today, destroys all those individual plans and expectations,” the dissent said and emphasized “in so doing, it diminishes women’s opportunities to participate fully and equally in the Nation’s political, social, and economic life.”  
    
            The language of the dissent mirrored a “friend of the court brief” filed by economists that targeted the societal and economic effects abortion access has had on women over the last century.  
    
            The economists pointed to studies that show that expansion of abortion access ushered in by Roe reduced teen motherhood by 34% and teen marriage by 20%.
    
            “There is a substantial body of well- developed and credible research that shows that abortion legalization and access in the United States has had—and continues to have—a significant effect on birth rates as well as broad downstream social and economic effects, including on women’s educational attainment and job opportunities,” they concluded.   
    
            Mississippi and others, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett at oral arguments, had suggested that abortion access is no longer as relevant to women and their families in the modern day due to improvements in health care and adoption laws.  
    
            Ann Marie Staff, a 59-year-old registered nurse from outside Chicago, got news of the court’s decision on her walk from a New York City hotel to Washington Square Park.
    
            Sitting on a park bench amid vendors, other tourists and students from nearby New York University, she quietly described the moment as “overwhelming.”
    
            Her partner, Staff said, was an OB-GYN before Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 and “he told me multiple stories of death attributed to infection and things like that from trying to obtain an abortion.”
    
            Staff said she expected women from neighboring states to begin traveling to Illinois to seek abortion procedures, but worried for those who could not afford the trip.
    
            As she spoke, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced plans to call the state assembly into special season in the coming weeks to “more firmly protect women’s reproductive rights in Illinois” and “address the challenges posed” by Roe’s reversal.
    
            A Democrat, Staff seemed pessimistic that lawmakers in Washington would take act in response to the decision.
    
            “I don’t know there’s a lot they can do,” she said. “But they need to pass legislation.”
    
            Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said he was “deeply disappointed that the Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade,” and he was “alarmed” that justices pulled back from their testimonies that it was settled law.  
    
            “As a Catholic, I was raised pro-life and will always consider myself pro-life. But I have come to accept that my definition of pro-life may not be someone else’s definition of pro-life. I believe that exceptions should be made in instances of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. But let me be clear, I support legislation that would codify the rights Roe v. Wade previously protected. I am hopeful Democrats and Republicans will come together to put forward a piece of legislation that would do just that,” he added. 
    
            Over in the House of Representatives, Rep. Henry Cuellar, a rare Democrat who opposes abortion rights and narrowly survived his primary against a progressive challenger, was positive on Friday’s ruling. 
    
            Cuellar had the backing of Democratic leadership, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in his primary. 
    
            Cuellar said he still has the “same position I’ve had. I’m pro-life.” 
    
            When CNN’s Manu Raju pointed out that he is in the minority of his caucus on this issue, he replied, “in my district I’m not.” 
    
            Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department disagrees with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            “The Supreme Court has eliminated an established right that has been an essential component of women’s liberty for half a century – a right that has safeguarded women’s ability to participate fully and equally in society. And in renouncing this fundamental right, which it had repeatedly recognized and reaffirmed, the Court has upended the doctrine of stare decisis, a key pillar of the rule of law,” according to the statement from Garland. 
    
            Garland reiterated that the decision today does not ban states to keep abortion legal within their borders.
    
            “We recognize that traveling to obtain reproductive care may not be feasible in many circumstances. But under bedrock constitutional principles, women who reside in states that have banned access to comprehensive reproductive care must remain free to seek that care in states where it is legal. Moreover, under fundamental First Amendment principles, individuals must remain free to inform and counsel each other about the reproductive care that is available in other states,” he said. 
    
            The DOJ “will work tirelessly to protect and advance reproductive freedom” and “strongly supports efforts by Congress to codify Americans’ reproductive rights,” according to his statement. 
    
            Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson said that supporters of abortion access will not back down. In a statement on Friday, McGill said “anyone today who is scared, or angry, or determined” following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade that “we will rebuild and reclaim the freedom that is ours.”
    
            “To anyone today who is scared, or angry, or determined, know this — 17 million Planned Parenthood supporters proudly stand with you. We will rebuild and reclaim the freedom that is ours. We won’t go back. And we won’t back down,” she said. 
    
            Planned Parenthood Action Fund on Friday emphasized that abortion is “still legal in most of the country” and directed “people who need care” to abortionfinder.org, a website that lists abortion service providers.
    
            Sen. Elizabeth Warren said there are ways now to “fight back” against the ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, accusing Supreme Court justices of not staying true to their words when they were nominees. 
    
            “I am spitting mad over this. We have six extremist justices on the United States Supreme Court who have decided that their moral and religious views should be imposed on the rest of America. This is not what America wants,” Warren told CNN’s Erica Hill. 
    
            “And in a democracy on this issue, the Supreme Court does not get the last word, the people do. We are going to fight back. We’ve got tools. We’re going to use them and in November, we’re going to make sure that we elect enough people who believe in that democracy that we can pass Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land again — only this time we’ll do it by statute and enforce it,” Warren said. 
    
            She said justices, when they were appointees, promised to follow the law “but wink, wink, nod, nod, were cleared in order to get where they got today.”
    
            Warren also said that the midterm elections in November will have a focus on abortion. 
    
            “It looks like getting two more Democrats in the United States Senate who are willing to support both filibuster reform and making Roe v. Wade the law of the land. It means hanging onto the House of Representatives and it means passing Roe into law. That’s what November will be all about,” she said. 
    
            Warren said that she and Sen. Patty Murray led a letter with more than half of Democratic senators calling on President Biden to take immediate federal action to strengthen abortion rights. 
    
            “He can make medicated abortion more widely available. He can help with money and time off for people to be able to move across state lines. He can consider using federal lands as a place where we can set up abortion clinics,” she said. 
    
            Watch Sen. Warren here:
    
            JPMorgan Chase is clarifying its health care benefits in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade on Friday, saying that abortion has long been a covered service for the bank and starting in July will be included under the company’s health care travel benefit.  
    
            “As always, we’re focused on the health and well-being of our employees, and want to ensure equitable access to all benefits,” JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Joseph Evangelisti told CNN on Friday. 
    
            In a memo sent to all US JP Morgan employees on June 1, the investment bank noted that it will expand its existing health care travel benefit for any covered service “that can only be obtained far away from your home,” including abortion. 
    
            It previously only covered services such as organ transplants and bariatric surgery under that travel benefit. 
    
            Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey – one of the GOP’s leading anti-abortion voices who said the issue is what inspired him to run for office – said he’s planning to lower his proposed 20-week abortion ban down to 15 weeks in light of the Supreme Court eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. 
    
            Smith is the chief sponsor of “The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,” which would ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. The bill has previously passed the House when Republicans were in power, and the GOP has pointed to that measure as a piece of legislation they would like to again put on the floor if they regain control of the chamber next year.
    
            But Smith said he’s planning to make the ban stricter.
    
            “We’re working on something along those lines,” Smith said, when asked by CNN about a nationwide abortion ban. “I have the Pain Capable at 20 weeks. We’re going to lower it to 15. There are all kinds of ideas there.”
    
            “But we don’t have at this point the ability to overcome a veto or a filibuster,” he added.
    
            In anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v Wade, House Republicans have started discussing what anti-abortion bills they would put on the floor if they win the majority and have used recent closed-door party meetings to discuss their messaging and strategy on abortion. 
    
            CNN reported that earlier this month, the head of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List addressed a House GOP conference meeting, where she talked to members about how to message on the issue and encouraged members to take incremental steps toward banning abortion if they win the majority. 
    
            Besides the 20-week ban bill, there is also a stricter measure in the House that would prohibit abortions once cardiac activity is detected, which has more than 100 Republican co-sponsors in the House. 
    
            Top House Republicans, however, have been wary to push for stricter, nationwide abortion bans and are instead expected to focus their messaging on calling for bans on so-called late term abortions, which are rare. But Republicans feel like it’s a more popular message and that polling is on their side when it comes to late term abortions.
    
            Dozens of civil and reproductive rights groups are denouncing the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
    
            The National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda released a statement calling it a “devastating blow against women’s civil and human rights.” 
    
            The NAACP also rejected the move by the Supreme Court with one leader saying it sets the country back to a “dangerous era where basic constitutional rights only exist for a select few.”
    
            Leaders from Movement for Black Lives say the decision further guts reproductive health care access for millions of Black women, girls, transgender and gender nonconforming people. 
    
            The Lilith Fund, which provides financial assistance and emotional support for people who need abortions in Texas, responded to the decision with a tweet saying “Another #SCOTUS day and we are struggling.” 
    
            Lupe M. Rodríguez, executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, said the court’s decision will “directly and disproportionately” harm Latinas and all communities of color. For many, she added, it is a matter of life and death.

            With states now free to ban the procedure, Friday’s ruling sets up the next anticipated abortion fight in court: what states can do to hinder abortions obtained outside their borders.
    
            The liberal justices noted this in their dissent.
    
            As they expressed concerns about the financial and logistical challenges women will face to travel out of state to obtain abortion, the liberals alluded to effort to prevent “interstate travel to obtain an abortion.”
    
            In a concurrence, Justice Brett Kavanaugh tried to quell some of those concerns, as he tried to play down the other legal questions the Friday ruling raises. 
    
            Still, even before Friday’s opinion, some red states were testing the waters around how fair they could reach to regulate outside their borders. A proposal in Missouri sought to apply the state’s criminal abortion laws to abortions obtained in other states by its residents. The proposal would even extend to cases where “sexual intercourse occurred within this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.”
    
            In Texas, some state lawmakers have vowed to punish companies that pay for the out of state travel of their employees who seek abortions. Medication abortion — and the way that women can order the two-pill regimen over the internet and be delivered it via the mail — is further complicating the legal questions around states efforts to eradicate the procedure. Blue states have proactively sought to protect their providers from extradition and other legal risks if red states try to prosecute them for facilitating an abortion.
    
            As the liberal justices see it, the questions over interstate abortion access is also shaping up to the next big court battle that Friday’s ruling will prompt. They wrote that “the majority’s ruling today invites a host of questions about interstate conflicts.”
    
            At the annual National Right to Life Convention in Atlanta, which is being held this weekend, cheers erupted when someone shouted “Roe’s been overturned!” at 10:10 a.m. ET.
    
            Attendees hugged one another, and some were visibly emotional.
    
            But, Tobias acknowledged: “We have a long battle ahead of us. Abortion is not going to be illegal because of this decision. The elected officials are now going to have to determine what the laws will be – federal and state levels. There’s a lot of work to do. And we need to build a culture that’s pro-mom, pro-baby, pro-life. We certainly know this is not the end.”
    
            Lynda Bell, the chair of the board of NRLC and President of Florida Right to Life, teared up as she described what she was feeling.
    
            “I can barely talk,” she said. “We have waited for this for 49 years, and finally, the court has recognized their egregious decision that stripped the states of the ability to protect life,” she said, calling Friday’s ruling the “correction of a terrible, terrible decision.”
    
            “When you fight for something for decades and it comes to fruition, it is just stunning,” she told CNN.
    
            Friday’s Supreme Court ruling that overturns Roe v. Wade will most affect poor women across the United States, CNN senior political analyst Nia-Malika Henderson said.
    
            Poor or low-income woman represent 75% of abortion patients, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.
    
            “If you think about the primary reason why women choose to get an abortion is financial … they can’t afford to have a child,” Henderson said. “A lot of these women already have children. The extra financial burden would be just too much for them to bear.”
    
            Looking at the policies in states that are intent on banning abortions, the question is whether they will expand the social safety net for women who are forced to carry their babies to term, Henderson explained.
    
            “They will have to get all sorts of medical care. Will there be paid family leave at these jobs? We know this is going to fall disproportionately on women who are poor of all races — White, Black, Latino, Asian,” she said. “They can’t afford to go to another state where they can get an abortion.”
    
            There are also legal implications to face if they do manage to travel to another state, and additionally, a lot of questions surround the father of the child in question.
    
            “Think about also the partners of these women. If they’re not together, not living in the same household, now does a man have to start paying child support earlier than they would at this point?” Henderson asked.
    
            The Supreme Court ruling that leaves states to determine their respective abortion rights has now created two Americas, Henderson said.
    
            According to updated guidance from the White House, President Biden will address the Supreme Court decision at 12:30 p.m. ET from the White House. 
    
            Abortion rights advocates had long warned about the implications of overturning Roe v. Wade, and liberal justices said in their dissent on Friday that the decision will impact “countless life decisions,” including “whether and how to invest in education or careers, how to allocate financial resources and how to approach intimate family relationships.” 
    
            The language of the dissent mirrored a “friend of the court brief” filed by economists that focused on the societal and economic effects abortion access has had on women over the last 50 years.  
    
            The economists pointed to studies that show that expansion of abortion access ushered in by Roe reduced teen motherhood by 34% and teen marriage by 20%. “Studies also demonstrate that for women experiencing unintended pregnancies, access to abortion has increased the probability that they attend college and enter professional occupations,” they wrote.  
    
            “There is a substantial body of well-developed and credible research that shows that abortion legalization and access in the United States has had — and continues to have — a significant effect on birth rates as well as broad downstream social and economic effects, including on women’s educational attainment and job opportunities,” they concluded.   
    
            Attorneys for Mississippi as well as Justice Amy Coney Barrett at oral arguments had suggested that abortion access is no longer as relevant to women and their families in the modern day due to improvements in health care and adoption laws.  
    
            Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in his statement on the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade announced the statewide closure of his agency’s offices Friday “in honor of the nearly 70 million unborn babies killed in the womb since 1973,” according to a release from the attorney general’s office. 
    
             “Further,” Paxton added, “we cannot forget the extraordinary violence that Roe and Casey unleashed on our nation. Because of those decisions, almost 70 million babies have been killed in the womb. And so, today at noon, I am closing all my offices as a memorial to these babies. Our hearts and prayers go out to all of them. Never again should something like this happen in America.” 
    
            The Supreme Court on Friday overturned Roe v. Wade, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            Going forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. 
    
            Legislators in 13 states have passed so-called “trigger laws,” meaning that abortion will almost immediately be banned with Roe no longer in effect. In some cases, the law requires an official such as an attorney general to certify that Roe has been struck down before the law can take effect.
    
            Here’s a look at where abortion rights stand across the US:
    
            Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry issued a statement on the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Louisiana is one of 13 states with trigger laws that take effect after the court’s decision. 
    
            “As noted in both my legal brief to the Supreme Court and the majority’s opinion: the Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,” according to his statement. 
    
            “Because of the Court’s ruling in this case about a Mississippi law limiting abortions after 15 weeks of gestation with exceptions for health emergencies and fetal abnormalities, Louisiana’s trigger law banning abortion is now in effect,” he said. 
    
            “My office and I will do everything in our power to ensure the laws of Louisiana that have been passed to protect the unborn are enforceable, even if we have to go back to court,” his statement continued. 
    
            The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            Five justices signed onto the majority opinion, striking down the landmark decision. They are:
    
            And three justices dissented:
    
            Chief Justice John Roberts did not join the majority, writing in a concurring opinion that he would not have overturned Roe but instead would have only upheld Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks.
    
            The Supreme Court’s opinion on abortion Friday could open the door for courts to overturn same-sex marriage, contraception and other rights. 
    
            It’s already set off a debate among justices over whether overturning Roe puts those precedents in danger. 
    
            The majority opinion attempted to wall of its holding in Friday’s abortion case from those other rulings, but Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to call explicitly for those other rulings to be revisited – a concurrence that the liberals seized upon to argue that those rulings are now at risk. 
    
            In their dissent, the liberal justices wrote “no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.” 
    
            “The right Roe and Casey recognized does not stand alone,” they wrote. “To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage.” 
    
            Justice Samuel Alito, in a new section of the opinion that was not present in the leaked draft, responded to the dissenters’ warnings. 
    
            He emphasized a line the majority opinion that said “[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.” 
    
            Alito’s assertions were undercut by a concurrence by Justice Thomas, who explicitly called for the court to reconsider its rulings striking down state restrictions on contraceptives, state sodomy bans and state prohibitions on same sex marriage. 
    
            “Because any substantive due process decision is ‘demonstrably erroneous,’” Thomas wrote, “we have a duty to ‘correct the error’ established in those precedents.” 
    
            The liberal dissenters used Thomas’ concurrence to go after Alito’s assurances that the court was not putting those precedent at risks by overturning Roe. 
    
            “The first problem with the majority’s account comes from JUSTICE THOMAS’s concurrence — which makes clear he is not with the program. In saying that nothing in today’s opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, JUSTICE THOMAS explains, he means only that they are not at issue,” the liberals wrote, as they quoted from Thomas’ concurrence. 
    
            “So at least one Justice is planning to use the ticket of today’s decision again and again and again,” they said.
    
            House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called Friday’s Supreme Court ruling a hypocrisy that will cause endless harm.
    
            “The hypocrisy is raging, but the harm is endless. What this means to women is such an insult. It’s a slap in face to women about using their own judgment to make their own decisions about their reproductive freedom,” she said Friday.
    
            She again criticized the Republicans for supporting pregnancy but opposing “any family planning.”
    
            “I always have said: determination of a pregnancy is just their opening act. It’s just their front game. Behind it and for years, I have seen in this Congress, opposition to any family planning domestic or global.”
    
            Looking ahead to the November elections, she said, reproductive freedom will be on the ballot.
    
            “This is deadly serious,” she said. “A woman’s right to choose, reproductive freedom is on the ballot in November. We cannot allow them to take charge so that they can institute their goal which is to criminalize reproductive freedom.”
    
            Speaking after the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Republicans are “plotting a nationwide abortion ban.”
    
            “They cannot be allowed to have majority in the Congress to do that. But that’s their goal,” she said Friday. 
    
            Juxtaposing the Friday ruling against Thursday’s ruling on guns, Pelosi criticized the court’s stance.
    
            “Such a contradiction. Yesterday, to say the states cannot make laws governing the constitutional right to bear arms. And today, they’re saying the exact reverse that the states can overturn a constitutional right — for 50 years a constitutional right for women having the right to choose.”
    
            “The hypocrisy is raging, but the harm is endless,” she added.
    
            A broad majority of Americans did not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned, polling taken before the Supreme Court’s decision shows. Here’s a recap of the latest data on the public’s views of abortion, from CNN and elsewhere:
    
            Views on overturning Roe vs. Wade 
    
            In a May CNN poll conducted immediately after the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft opinion, Americans said, 66% to 34%, that they did not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn its decision. In CNN’s polling dating back to 1989, the share of the public in favor of completely overturning Roe has never risen above 36%.
    
            Just 17% of Americans in the CNN poll said they’d be happy to see Roe vs. Wade overturned, with 12% saying they’d be satisfied, 21% that they’d be dissatisfied, 36% that they’d be angry, and 14% that they wouldn’t care. Most Democrats (59%) and nearly half of adults younger than 35 (48%) said they’d be angry. And a 59% majority of Americans said they’d support Congress passing a law to establish a nationwide right to abortion, with just 41% opposed.
    
            In a May CBS/YouGov poll, 63% of Americans said they expected that overturning Roe would make abortion access harder for poor women, with 58% saying it would make abortion access more difficult for women of color. Fewer expected similar difficulties for White women (35%) or wealthy women (19%). And a majority of women (54%) said that generally, overturning Roe would make life worse for most American women. 
    
            Views on state abortion laws
    
            In the CNN poll, 58% of US adults said that, if Roe were overturned, they’d want their state to set abortion laws that were more permissive than restrictive. About half (51%) said they’d like to see their state become a safe haven for women who wanted abortions but couldn’t get them where they lived. 
    
            But not everyone was aware in advance how their own state would be affected. Of Americans living in states with trigger laws to immediately ban abortion after the overturn of Roe, only 45% realized that was the case, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in May. Another 42% living in those states were unsure what the impact of the ruling would be where they live.
    
            Political implications
    
            It’s still too soon to know how views on abortion might shift in the wake of the Court’s decision, or to forecast how the aftermath of the decision might affect the upcoming election. There are some early signs that the blow to abortion access could be particularly motivational to abortion rights supporters. A significant share of core Democratic backers such as young people and women said they would be angry in the wake of the ruling, and several surveys this spring found Democratic voters more likely than Republican voters to see abortion as a highly relevant issue to this year’s election. But it’s less clear how that motivation might manifest itself, or to what extent it’ll alter the overall political landscape. 
    
            A May poll from Monmouth University found that 48% of Democrats considered a candidate’s alignment with their views on abortion to be extremely important to their vote, up from 31% in 2018; among Republicans, the number was 29%, down from 36% four years ago.
    
            CNN polling conducted immediately before and after the leak of a draft Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade found a 7-point rise in the share of Americans who said their views on abortion align more with Democrats than Republicans. But there was little immediate evidence of a sea change in any of the Republicans’ early advantages heading into the midterms.
    
            Views of the Supreme Court
    
            The decision could also affect Americans’ views of the Supreme Court. Following the leak of the draft opinion, Marquette Law School polling found, public approval of the Court fell, from 54% in March to 44% in May. The change was largely due to a shift among Democrats: while 49% of Democrats approved of the Supreme Court in March, just 26% felt the same in May. Marquette’s May poll also found that 23% of Americans viewed the Supreme Court as “very conservative,” an uptick from 15% in March.
    
            Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan issued a dissenting opinion to the Supreme Court’s decision that strikes down Roe v. Wade.
    
            In their joint opinion, the three justices heavily criticized the majority, closing: 
    
            House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Supreme Court’s “cruel ruling” overturning Roe v. Wade is “outrageous and heart-wrenching.”  
    
            Pelosi vowed that Democrats will keep fighting to “enshrine Roe v. Wade into law.” 
    
            “A woman’s fundamental health decisions are her own to make, in consultation with her doctor and her loved ones – not to be dictated by far-right politicians,” she said. 
    
            “This cruel ruling is outrageous and heart-wrenching.  But make no mistake: the rights of women and all Americans are on the ballot this November,” her statement continued. 
    
            The final opinion released by the Supreme Court on Friday is strikingly similar to the draft written by Justice Samuel Alito that was leaked earlier this year. It repeats Alito’s scornful language towards the original Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined abortion rights. 
    
            “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” both the formal and draft said. “Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”  
    
            Like the draft opinion, Alito included a list of cases that also rested on a right to privacy, as Alito asserted that Roe was distinct from those cases. 
    
            “What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call ‘potential life’ and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an ‘unborn human being,’” Alito wrote, in a line that was also present in the draft. 
    
            So what’s new? Alito’s response to the dissent, jointly written by the three liberal justices. The dissent would not have been written at the time that the ultimately leaked draft was circulated around the court. 
    
            “The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a ‘deeply rooted’ one, ‘in this Nation’s history and tradition.’” Alito wrote. “The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a right — no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise.” 
    
            In that four-page section, Alito said that the dissent’s failure “engage with this long tradition is devastating to its position.” 
    
            Former President Barack Obama criticized Friday’s ruling by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, saying the court “not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent, it relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues—attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.”
    
            Read his statement:
    
            Former first lady Michelle Obama also issued a statement Friday saying she was “heartbroken” over the Supreme Court’s decision.
    
            “I am heartbroken for people around this country who just lost the fundamental right to make informed decisions about their own bodies,” Obama wrote.
    
            She wrote that the decision “must be a wake-up call, especially to the young people who will bear its burden.”
    
            The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.   
    
            Here are key lines from the majority opinion: 
    
            New York Attorney General Letitia James has responded to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, a decision that holds that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            “I will work tirelessly to ensure our most vulnerable and people from hostile states have access to this lifesaving care. Everyone in this nation deserves the right to make their own decisions about their bodies,” she added.
    
            Groups of protesters are demonstrating outside the Supreme Court after the court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
    
            Video footage showed them holding signs and chanting through megaphones. 
    
            “It’s a heartbreaking betrayal of half of the country,” former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers said on CNN, choking up a bit while seeing the protesters. “I’m getting — watching the women there — it’s emotional.”
    
            The opinion is the most consequential Supreme Court decision in decades and will transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.
    
            Going forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts.
    
            A team of senior White House officials has been preparing for months to respond to a Supreme Court decision stripping nationwide abortion rights.
    
            President Biden has been weighing a number of steps to respond to the ruling, but has been constrained by the law and limits on his executive authority.
    
            The options have been under examination by lawyers, policy aides and political advisers since a draft opinion leaked in May.
    
            But aides have been clear that nothing the President can do would restore the nationwide right to abortion.
    
            Among the options the President is considering:
    
            The US Supreme Court just overturned Roe v. Wade, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion. 
    
            Here’s a look at the details of the now-overturned case:
    
            Case
    
            1971 - The case is filed by Norma McCorvey, known in court documents as Jane Roe, against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, who enforced a Texas law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman’s life.
    
            Decision
    
            Jan. 22, 1973 - The US Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, affirms the legality of a woman’s right to have an abortion under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The court held that a woman’s right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy (recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut) protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision gave a woman the right to an abortion during the entirety of the pregnancy and defined different levels of state interest for regulating abortion in the second and third trimesters.
    
            The ruling affected laws in 46 states. Full-text opinions by the justices can be viewed here.
    
            Legal Timeline
    
            The Players
    
            McCorvey - Texas resident who sought to obtain an abortion. Texas law prohibited abortions except to save the pregnant mother’s life. McCorvey was pregnant when she became the lead plaintiff in the case. She gave up the baby for adoption.
    
            McCorvey has since come forward and spoken against abortion. In 1997, McCorvey started Roe No More, an anti-abortion outreach organization that was dissolved in 2008. McCorvey died on February 18, 2017. In the 2020 documentary “AKA Jane Roe,” prior to her death in 2017, McCorvey told the film’s director that she hadn’t changed her mind about abortion but became an anti-abortion activist because she was being paid.
    
            Henry Wade - District attorney of Dallas County from 1951 to 1987. McCorvey sued him because he enforced a law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman’s life. He died on March 1, 2001.

            The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, with the opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, is “very similar to that draft opinion that we saw leak”in May, according to CNN’s Jessica Schneider.  
    
            “This will have immediate effects here. By all estimates, about half of the states are expected to eliminate the right to abortion. We’ve got about a half-dozen states that have so-called ‘trigger laws’ that their abortion bans will go into effect immediately or within the next 30 days or next few months,” she said. 
    
            Schneider said she and other reporters will be digging into the opinion further. 
    
            The Supreme Court on Friday ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case centered on a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a standard that violates Roe v. Wade.
    
            Read the court’s opinion here.
    
            The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.   
    
            The opinion is the most consequential Supreme Court decision in decades and will transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.   
    
            Going forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.

      Pittsburgh synagogue shooter’s troubled upbringing put him at risk for severe mental illness, psychologist says

    ","
            A clinical psychologist called by the defense Thursday in the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman’s death penalty trial highlighted the defendant’s troubled childhood, noting the impact of trauma that put him at risk for mental illness.
    
            Dr. Katherine Porterfield testified in detail about Robert Bowers’ early years to adulthood, signaling he moved through various treatment centers amid concern for his emotional well-being from teachers and others. She also described multiple suicide attempts. 
    
            By age 10, Bowers was a suicidal child, Porterfield said, calling it “remarkable and unusual.”  
    
            “He’s telling people, ‘I don’t want to live,’” she said.
    
            Porterfield’s testimony comes as defense attorneys make the case to the federal jury that Bowers had significant mental health issues that should lead to a sentence of life in prison rather than the death penalty. The prosecution, meanwhile, has argued the mass shooting showed extensive planning and a clear intent that, in his own words, “All Jews had to die.”
    
            Bowers, 50, was found guilty in June of 63 charges against him for killing 11 worshippers and wounding six others at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, the deadliest ever attack on Jewish people in the United States. Twenty-two of those counts were capital offenses, so he is eligible for the death penalty at this second phase of the trial.
    
            Teachers from Bowers’ first and fourth grade classes were concerned about his emotional behavior, Porterfield testified on Thursday. They noted his troubles socializing and that attempts at interventions were ignored or rejected by Bowers’ mother, Barbara, according to Porterfield.
    
            In a chaotic incidence during the eighth grade, a “crisis point” for Bowers, according Porterfield, he chased his mother with a flammable liquid and attempted to light the liquid. After that incident Bowers was admitted to the adult psychiatric ward at McKeesport Hospital, something that Porterfield said was “pretty unusual for a 13, just turned 13-year-old.”
    
            “He’s out of control, he’s a completely out of control child,” Porterfield said.  “What we’re seeing here is just poor emotional regulation. He cannot handle his feelings.”
    
            At another psychiatric center, according to Porterfield, doctors described Bowers as depressed and oppositional with bizarre behavior, along with poor social skills and few friends.
    
            Porterfield said Bowers faced extraordinary neglect from caregivers during adolescence and experienced severe depression. He acted out with self-destruction, she said, failed in school and had at least four suicide attempts. Two of those suicide attempts were between the ages of 16 and 17, according to Porterfield. In one instance, he overdosed on aspirin. In the other, Bowers drank grain alcohol in his car and lit himself on fire with a cigarette, resulting in severe burns, Porterfield said.
    
            Bowers’ instability continued through adulthood with no meaningful ongoing intervention to address his decades of mental illness and minimal functionality, she testified. 
    
            Bowers was also financially unstable and worked inconsistently, holding jobs “on and off,”  and only sticking to one job at a bakery for 15 years, Porterfield said. He was eventually fired in 2004 for stealing money.
    
            Porterfield said Bowers’ family’s own deep-rooted issues of substance abuse, violence and instability led to a lack of attention toward Robert’s issues. Bowers had several traumatic life events and circumstances that put him at risk for the development of severe mental illness and problems, Porterfield concluded.
    
            Federal prosecutor Nicole Vasquez Schmitt cross-examined Porterfield and asked her if she interviewed Bowers for her analysis. Porterfield said, “No.”  She said a substantial source of her information came from the defendant’s mother. 
    
            Schmitt pressed Porterfield regarding her notes on his mother, which said she is “impaired emotionally, cognitively, and socially.” Schmitt then questioned the accuracy of the mother’s accounts and stories. She also asked Porterfield if they were possibly exaggerated because of the love for her son. Porterfield said she believed the mother’s accounts were honest and truthful.
    
            Porterfield testified that Bowers’ parents, Barbara Jenkins and Randall Bowers, had provided an unstable family environment for him through his infancy and early childhood.
    
            She said the “dose” of trauma really matters when a caregiver, instead of providing a caring environment, is a source of horror, sadness and fear. It’s called betrayal trauma, she said.
    
            Randall Bowers, himself, had an unstable childhood, according to Porterfield. 
    
            While serving in the Navy, he was placed in a psychiatric ward, and later jumped off a ship into Guantanamo Bay in a suicide attempt, she said.
    
            Porterfield testified that both parents threatened to kill their son. 
    
            At one point, Jenkins threatened to throw Robert out the window of their apartment from the third floor, she said. Randall Bowers also threatened to kill himself by turning on the gas in the apartment. They were “young parents that were clearly out of control,” she said.
    
            Eventually the parents separated, and Jenkins married Robert Saiter and moved to a trailer park in Florida with her son, Porterfield said. Saiter, who was in the Air Force, was later hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital at an Air Force base and deemed unfit for service, according to Air Force records.
    
            Porterfield testified Saiter was later arrested and convicted of child molestation and sentenced to 17 years. Jenkins, Porterfield said, returned to cutting herself in front of Robert Bowers and was hospitalized for depression and anxiety.
    
            He was surrounded by unstable grandparents as well, Dr. Porterfield testified.
    
            By age 3, Bowers had lived with two men who were “very mentally ill, violent men.” Both were charged with sexual offenses, Porterfield said.
    
            Bowers had chronic traumatic experiences and chronic traumatic stress that wasn’t just a one-time event, Porterfield testified. Every negative event in a child’s life piles up, worsening their outcomes, she said.
    
            An aunt of Bowers also testified on Thursday, his first family member to take the stand on his behalf.
    
            Deanna Bowers was married to Wendell Bowers, the defendant’s uncle on his father’s side. 
    
            She lives in California, and said she and her husband had little contact with his brother, Randall, but she was aware he had a son, Robert. 
    
            She met the defendant once, when he was 8. Deanna Bowers said she has not been in touch with him since then.
    
            Her husband died in 2019. She testified he told her he had a difficult childhood with an abusive father, the defendant’s paternal grandfather.
    
            When asked by defense attorney Elisa Long if the rest of the family treated Robert Bowers like a relative, Deanna said only his paternal grandmother, Ann Bowers, stayed in regular contact with him.
    
            “She cares about him very much,” she said. 
    
            Under cross-examination from the prosecution, Deanna Bowers said despite her husband’s difficult childhood, Wendell became a beloved member of their community in California.

      Alabama death row inmate James Barber is executed following scrutiny over state’s lethal injection process
    ","

    ","
            Alabama death row inmate James Barber was executed early Friday morning after the US Supreme Court denied his request for a stay, despite his claim that lethal injection could result in cruel and unusual punishment.
    
            Barber was sentenced to death for the 2001 murder of 75-year-old Dorothy Epps. His time of death was 1:56 a.m. CT Friday at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, according to a statement from Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall. 
    
            “Justice has been served. This morning, James Barber was put to death for the terrible crime he committed over two decades ago: the especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel murder of Dorothy Epps,” Marshall said. “I ask the people of Alabama to join me in praying for the victim’s family and friends, that they might now be able to find some sense of peace and closure.”
    
            During his appeals process, Barber asked a US District Court to prevent the state from executing him by any method other than nitrogen hypoxia, an alternative to lethal injection that is allowed under Alabama law but has yet to be used. 
    
            Barber argued an execution by lethal injection would violate his rights under the Eighth Amendment, according to his initial complaint, which pointed to three allegedly botched executions in Alabama last year, in which Barber’s attorneys said Department of Corrections officials struggled to set intravenous lines in the condemned inmates’ veins to deliver the fatal drugs. 
    
            One of those executions ultimately resulted in the death of the inmate while the two others were called off, with the state citing time constraints due to late-night court battles that prevented the executions from being carried out before the inmates’ execution warrants expired. Taken together, they prompted heightened scrutiny of Alabama’s lethal injection process and led Gov. Kay Ivey last November to ask Marshall to halt executions for a “top-to-bottom review” of its protocol.
    
            In February, Ivey said executions could resume after the Department of Corrections completed its review and said it would take several steps to address issues with the lethal injection protocol, including expanding the pool of personnel available for the execution team and conducting rehearsals to ensure staff were well-trained, among other steps. 
    
            Barber’s execution early Friday came after the US Supreme Court sided with the decisions of two lower courts to proceed with carrying out his death. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the denial of application for stay, documents show.
    
            Barber – who was the first inmate executed since the state’s review – had argued Alabama had “not made any meaningful improvements to their lethal injection protocol,” according to his motion for a preliminary injunction, other than by expanding the window in which officials could carry out an execution. 
    
            In his appeal, Barber’s attorneys argued he faces a “substantial risk of severe harm” due to his elevated body mass index, which they said makes it more difficult to access his veins. This complication makes him vulnerable to suffering a failed lethal injection, they said.
    
            Instead, Barber had asked to be put to death by nitrogen gas. The state legislature has approved this alternative execution method, but the state has said it hasn’t finalized its protocols.
    
            The US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama denied Barber’s motion, prompting his attorneys to appeal earlier this week to the 11th Circuit. That court, however, similarly rejected Barber’s argument by upholding the district court’s decision in an opinion Wednesday. The judges wrote, in part, that the inmate’s claim he would suffer the same problems as the inmates before him was “purely speculative” in light of the Department of Corrections’ newly implemented changes.

      Doctor emotionally describes terminating pregnancy out of state during hearing over Texas abortion bans
    ","

    ","
            On the second day of hearings addressing the emergency medical exception for abortion restrictions in Texas, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist gave emotional testimony about getting an abortion out of state last year after learning her fetus had a life-threatening condition. 
    
            Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB/GYN from Dallas and a plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking clarity in the state’s abortion exceptions, testified Thursday her fetus was diagnosed with anencephaly, a condition where the brain and skull of a fetus don’t completely form. 
    
            The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, is asking the court to clarify what situations fall under the exception in the state’s abortion restrictions. Plaintiffs also want the court to immediately block the state’s abortion bans, as it applies to situations involving medical emergencies. 
    
            Texas in 2021 banned abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. When the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother.
    
            The state defines a “medical emergency” as a “life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that, as certified by a physician, places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.”
    
            Dennard said the diagnosis of anencephaly poses a significant threat to pregnant patients and would be incompatible with life for the fetus. 
    
            “They essentially just gasp for air until they pass away,” Dennard said, saying babies typically live for seconds, minutes, or maybe a day once born with this condition.
    
            Dennard said continuing with pregnancy would have put herself at “significant risk,” but she did not feel confident a medical provider would give her an abortion in Texas over the diagnosis, given what she described as the confusing and vague parameters of the state’s medical emergency exception.
    
            “It was just heart-breaking to think about how being pregnant and carrying to term would affect (my children),” she said. “But more importantly my health and staying healthy so that I can be their mother and be a wife and be a physician and take care of my patients was my number one priority.”
    
            Dennard, who is now 34 weeks pregnant, previously received a separate abortion in Texas after learning her fetus had a rare genetic disorder known as Noonan Syndrome. But Dennard is part of the suit against Texas for a more recent pregnancy, which occurred last year, when stricter abortion laws had gone into effect.
    
            “It’s really hard to describe in words what that feels like,” she said, growing emotional when recalling the harder path she faced in getting an abortion. “I felt like my pregnancy was not my own – that it belonged to the state, because I no longer had a choice of what I could do. I felt abandoned.”
    
            Legal counsel for the state questioned Dennard, asking if Texas officials told her she could not have an abortion. Dennard said she never asked anyone in state government about her pregnancy. 
    
            Asked if she felt she qualified for an abortion after learning about the diagnosis at 11 weeks, Dennard said the emergency medical exception is “extremely nebulous and confusing.” 
    
            “I recognized that day in that moment that I was not critically ill,” she said. “I was not hemorrhaging, I was not septic. I was pregnant with a lethal anomaly, and I did not believe that I would be able to receive an abortion in my state at that time for the sole purpose of my lethal anomaly.”
    
            Dr. Ali Raja, an emergency medicine specialist, also testified as an expert witness at the hearing, saying the language as written in the Texas code creates a confusing gray zone for doctors that discourages them from providing abortions.   
    
            “For patients for whom it’s unclear as to whether or not they have an emergent medical conditions, physicians are understandably going to err on the side of not treatment given those consequences,” he said, citing punitive measures that physicians could face if they provide abortions to women who don’t qualify for the exemptions under Texas law.
    
            Dr. Ingrid Skop, director of Medical Affairs for Charlotte Lozier Institute, testified as an expert witness for the State of Texas. The Charlotte Lozier Institute is a think tank made up of anti-abortion scholars and medical experts. 
    
            Skop said the current language of Texas abortion laws is clear and offers objective guidelines on how doctors should treat pregnant patients. Skop said the confusion and fear medical providers have in providing abortion when a woman’s life is in danger or a fetus is not viable is because they don’t understand the law and are misinformed.
    
            “It appears their doctors did not understand what the law allowed and did not offer appropriate intervention,” Skop said.
    
            At the end of the two-day hearing on Thursday, the judge said she would weigh the arguments for several weeks before issuing a decision.

      Nebraska woman charged with disposing of fetus following illegal abortion sentenced to 90 days in jail

    ","
            A woman accused of having an illegal abortion in Nebraska when she was 17 and disposing of the fetus was sentenced Thursday to 90 days in jail following a plea agreement. 
    
            Celeste Burgess, 19, of Norfolk, had entered a guilty plea in May to a felony charge of removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body. 
    
            Misdemeanor charges of false reporting and concealing a death were dismissed under the agreement, according to documents filed in district court in Nebraska’s Madison County.
    
            In addition to the jail term, Burgess was sentenced to serve two years of probation.
    
            Norfolk police began investigating Celeste Burgess and her mother, Jessica Burgess, in late April 2022 following concerns Celeste had delivered a stillborn fetus, according to court documents. 
    
            Authorities used Facebook messages between Celeste and Jessica Burgess to establish that the two discussed obtaining abortion pills and burning “the evidence,” court documents showed. Police claimed the body of the fetus, which was exhumed, appeared to have injuries indicating it may have been burned after the pregnancy was terminated, according to court documents.
    
            Celeste Burgess initially told investigators that the fetus was delivered stillborn, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant.
    
            Authorities alleged Celeste Burgess had a medication abortion, and that it violated the state’s prohibition of abortion after 20 weeks. Celeste Burgess was around 28 weeks pregnant when her pregnancy ended, court documents allege. 
    
            Earlier this year, Nebraska’s governor signed a bill into law that bans most abortions in the state after 12 weeks, with exceptions for sexual assault, incest and medical emergencies. 
    
            Jessica Burgess, 42, was charged with the same offenses as her daughter, plus a felony count of performing an abortion beyond 20 weeks and a felony count of performing an abortion as someone other than a licensed physician.
    
            In a plea bargain earlier this month, Jessica Burgess pleaded guilty to two felonies – removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body; and performing an abortion beyond 20 weeks – and the misdemeanor charge of false reporting.
    
            The other charges against Jessica Burgess – the felony count of performing an abortion while not being a physician; and the misdemeanor count of concealing the death of another person – were dismissed.
    
            Jessica Burgess’ attorney requested a psychological examination for her client. She is scheduled to be sentenced September 22.
    
            CNN sought comment Wednesday from prosecutors and attorneys for Celeste and Jessica Burgess.

      Wisconsin mother and her boyfriend are charged in child neglect case that prosecutor calls ‘like something out of a horror movie’

    ","
            A Milwaukee mother and her boyfriend were charged with chronic neglect of a child and false imprisonment after authorities found them allegedly holding two children in their home against their will. 
    
            Katie Koch, 34, and Joel Manke, 38, both face four felony charges in the case. 
    
            Koch is also charged with two misdemeanors, for which her public defender entered a not guilty plea on her behalf in court, according to online court records. Manke and Koch did not enter pleas for their felony charges, the records show.
    
            The alleged victims are Koch’s sons, ages 9 and 7. Neighbors called police after they saw the children walking around naked outside their home on July 13. 
    
            Witness Christine Eder told CNN affiliate WDJT that the children looked as though “they had never been outside before. If they have been, it’s been a very long time.”
    
            According to the charging documents obtained by CNN, the children were kept in a filthy room that was locked from the outside. 
    
            Koch acknowledged to police that the children had not been enrolled in organized schooling or medical attention in years, according to the documents dated July 16. Manke said “he knew how the children were living was not right” but tried not to discuss it with Koch to avoid an argument.
    
            “It’s really terrible. Like something out of a horror movie,” Milwaukee County assistant district attorney Mallory Davis said in court Monday.
    
            The criminal complaint said human waste was on the walls and there was so much garbage piled up, officers couldn’t see the floor. The children’s heads had so much “matted feces,” the complaint said, that their hair had to be shaved off.
    
            Manke was released from jail Wednesday on $6,500 bond, according to court records. Koch remained in jail in lieu of $30,000 bond. CNN was not able to reach attorneys for the defendants Wednesday. The pair’s preliminary hearings are set for July 26.

      Nearly two years after Texas’ six-week abortion ban, more infants are dying
    ","

    ","
            Texas’ abortion restrictions – some of the strictest in the country – may be fueling a sudden spike in infant mortality as women are forced to carry nonviable pregnancies to term.  
    
            Some 2,200 infants died in Texas in 2022 – an increase of 227 deaths, or 11.5%, over the previous year, according to preliminary infant mortality data from the Texas Department of State Health Services that CNN obtained through a public records request. Infant deaths caused by severe genetic and birth defects rose by 21.6%. That spike reversed a nearly decade-long decline. Between 2014 and 2021, infant deaths had fallen by nearly 15%. 
    
            In 2021, Texas banned abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. When the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother. 
    
            The increase in deaths could partly be explained by the fact that more babies are being born in Texas. One recent report found that in the final nine months of 2022, the state saw nearly 10,000 more births than expected prior to its abortion ban – an estimated 3% increase. 
    
            But multiple obstetrician-gynecologists who focus on high-risk pregnancies told CNN that Texas’ strict abortion laws likely contributed to the uptick in infant deaths.  
    
            “We all knew the infant mortality rate would go up, because many of these terminations were for pregnancies that don’t turn into healthy normal kids,” said Dr. Erika Werner, the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center. “It’s exactly what we all were concerned about.”  
    
            The issue of forcing women to carry out terminal and often high-risk pregnancies is at the core of a lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, with several women – who suffered difficult pregnancies or infant deaths shortly after giving birth – testifying in Travis County court this week. 
    
            One witness became so emotional while testifying Wednesday that she began to vomit on the stand. 
    
            After the court called a recess she explained that the reaction is a response to the emotional trauma she endured: “I vomit when there’s certain parts that happen that kind of just makes my body remember.”
    
            Another sobbed as she described feeling afraid to visit a Texas doctor after receiving an abortion out of state. A third spoke tearfully about waiting for her baby’s heart to stop beating so her doctors could provide an abortion she desperately needed.
    
            Prior to the recent abortion restrictions, Texas banned the procedure after 20 weeks. This law gave parents more time to learn crucial information about a fetus’s brain formation and organ development, which doctors begin to test for at around 15 weeks. 
    
            Samantha Casiano, a plaintiff in the suit filed against Texas, wished she’d had more time to make the decision.
    
            “If I was able to get the abortion with that time, I think it would have meant a lot to me because my daughter wouldn’t have suffered,” Casiano told CNN after testifying Wednesday.
    
            When Casiano was 20 weeks pregnant, a routine scan came back with devastating news: Her baby would be stillborn or die shortly after birth.
    
            The fetus had anencephaly, a rare birth defect that keeps the brain and skull from developing during pregnancy. Babies with this condition are often stillborn, though they sometimes live a few hours or days. Many women around the country who face the prospect choose abortion,  two obstetrician-gynecologists told CNN. 
    
            But Casiano lived in Texas, where state legislators had recently banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. She couldn’t afford to travel out of the state for the procedure.  
    
            “You have no options. You will have to go through with your pregnancy,” Casiano’s doctor told her, she claimed in the lawsuit. 
    
            In March, Casiano gave birth to her daughter Halo. After gasping for air for four hours, the baby died, Casiano said during her testimony on Wednesday. 
    
            “All she could do was fight to try to get air. I had to watch my daughter go from being pink to red to purple. From being warm to cold,” said Casiano. “I just kept telling myself and my baby that I’m so sorry that this had to happen to you.”  
    
            Casiano and 14 others – including two doctors – are plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They allege the abortion ban has denied them or their patients access to necessary obstetrical care. The plaintiffs are asking the courts to clarify when doctors can make medical exceptions to the state’s ban.
    
            Casiano and two other plaintiffs testified Wednesday about hoping to deliver healthy babies but instead learning their lives or pregnancies were in danger. 
    
            “This was just supposed to be a scan day,” Casiano told the court. “It escalated to me finding out my daughter was going to die.”  
    
            Lawyers representing the state argued Wednesday that the plaintiffs’ doctors were to blame, saying they misinterpreted the law and failed to provide adequate care for such high-risk pregnancies. 
    
            “Plaintiffs will not and cannot provide any evidence of any medical provider in the state of Texas being prosecuted or otherwise penalized for performance of an abortion using the emergency medical exemption,” a lawyer said during the state’s opening statement. 
    
            Kylie Beaton, another plaintiff, also had to watch her baby die. Beaton, who didn’t testify this week, learned during a 20-week scan that something was wrong with her baby’s brain, according to the suit. 
    
            The doctor diagnosed the fetus with alobar holoprosencephaly, a condition where the two hemispheres of the brain don’t properly divide. Babies with this condition are often stillborn or die soon after birth.  
    
            Beaton’s doctor told her he couldn’t provide an abortion unless she was severely ill, or the fetus’s heart stopped. Beaton and her husband sought to obtain an abortion out of state. However, the fetus’s head was enlarged due to its condition, and the only clinic that would perform an abortion charged up to $15,000. Beaton and her husband couldn’t afford it.  
    
            Instead, Beaton gave birth to a son she named Grant. The baby cried constantly, wouldn’t eat, and couldn’t be held upright for fear it would put too much pressure on his head, according to the suit. Four days later, Grant died.  
    
            Experts say that abortion bans in states like Texas lead to increased risk for both babies and mothers. 
    
            Maternal mortality has long been a top concern for doctors and health-rights activists. Even before the Supreme Court decision, the United States had the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations, one study found. 
    
            Amanda Zurawski, the lawsuit’s lead plaintiff, testified Wednesday that her water broke 18 weeks into her pregnancy, putting her at high risk for a life-threatening infection. Zurawski’s baby likely wouldn’t survive.  
    
            But the fetus still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said they were unable to terminate the pregnancy. She received an emergency abortion only after her condition worsened and she went into septic shock. 
    
            Zurawski described during Wednesday’s hearing how her family visited the hospital, fearing it would be the last time they would see her. Zurawski has argued that had she been able to obtain an abortion, her life wouldn’t have been in jeopardy in the same way. 
    
            “I blame the people who support these bans,” Zurawski said.  
    
            Zurawski previously said the language in Texas’ abortion laws is “incredibly vague, and it leaves doctors grappling with what they can and cannot do, what health care they can and cannot provide.” 
    
            Pregnancy is dangerous, and forcing a woman to carry a non-viable pregnancy to term is unnecessarily risky when it’s clear the baby will not survive, argued Dr. Mae-Lan Winchester, an Ohio maternal-fetal medicine specialist.  
    
            “Pregnancy is one of the most dangerous things a person will ever go through,” Winchester said. “Putting yourself through that risk without any benefit of taking a baby home at the end, it’s … risking maternal morbidity and mortality for nothing.”

      Opinion: Over-the-counter birth control pill could make a huge difference
    ","
			Opinion by Megan L. Ranney and Monique Rainford
		","
  Updated
        9:59 AM EDT, Thu July 20, 2023
    ","
            As practicing physicians and public health leaders, we applaud the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of Opill as an over-the-counter (OTC) birth control pill — the first of its kind in the US.
    
            This approval is a big win for Americans’ ability to have planned and healthy pregnancies. Opill is eminently safe and effective — more so than many other OTC drugs. Indeed, outside of the US, similar pills have been available OTC in many countries for decades without issue.
    
            This approval is, in fact, overdue. In health care, we sometimes refer to oral contraceptives like Opill as a “mini-pill,” because it only contains progestin, a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone, whereas other kinds of oral contraceptives contain analogues of both progesterone and estrogen.
    
            Decades of evidence show that mini-pills avoid the potential risks of estrogen-progestin combination pills, such as blood clots, and are safe for almost all people — removing the argument that a doctor’s visit is necessary prior to starting the pill. (As doctors, we do remind readers that people who are pregnant, have breast cancer, liver tumors or who have unexplained vaginal bleeding should still avoid the Opill.) Moreover, progestin-only contraceptives like Opill can be up to 98% effective when used exactly as directed.
    
            Improving access to contraceptives is a critically important part of our toolbox in trying to reduce the US’ abysmal maternal mortality rates. Contraceptive use may have decreased maternal mortality by as much as 44% worldwide, and increased use could reduce deaths by another 29%, according to an analysis of 172 countries by researchers at Johns Hopkins University.
    
            Yet more than 19 million women in the US live in “contraceptive deserts.” According to a survey conducted by researchers a decade ago, nearly one-third of American women who tried to get a prescription for a birth control pill reported difficulty doing so. Access has only become more difficult in recent years, as barriers to reproductive health care have increased for women. Black and Hispanic women often face greater difficulty accessing contraceptive services.
    
            In a post-Dobbs world, when post-pregnancy care and abortion services are increasingly challenging to find, preventing unwanted or unsafe pregnancies becomes even more important.
    
            An OTC birth control pill will make a huge difference. Common obstacles to getting a birth control pill prescription — such as lack of a primary physician, lack of time for or transportation to a physician visit or lack of trust in health care providers – are eliminated when a pill becomes available OTC. Providing teens with good, non-prescription options to prevent pregnancy (in addition to condoms) matters particularly deeply.
    
            Unfortunately, though, Opill’s approval as an OTC medication is not a magic wand. Problems with accessing reproductive health care extend beyond a single medication’s prescription status, and they are increasing nationwide.
    
            For example, we have seen that despite continued FDA approval of mifepristone (the first of a two-part abortion pill), some pharmacies may not make this medication available in states with restrictive abortion laws. We worry that, similarly, pharmacies in some states will be hesitant to stock Opill.
    
            There may be economic barriers, too. We are still waiting to learn how Opill will be priced. The requirement for insurance companies to cover the full cost of contraceptive services seems to apply only to those that have been prescribed. OTC contraceptives like Opill will most likely require people to pay out-of-pocket. Offering vouchers for low-income people, providing the medication for free or at a reduced cost in easily accessible locations, pricing Opill appropriately or clarifying insurance regulations could mitigate cost concerns.
    
            Despite Opill’s terrific efficacy in clinical studies, we know that the real world differs from a clinical trial. It is tremendously important for people to learn how to take Opill correctly — at the same time, every day, every month. It is also important to understand that the medication is not a “morning after” pill, so it will not prevent pregnancy if taken after unprotected sex.
    
            We hope that community organizations will partner with health care providers, pharmacists and public health experts to ensure people have accurate information from sources they trust. Community health workers could potentially play a valuable role in these efforts. Attention to disparities in access to information (or confidence in the people who provide that information) matters deeply.
    
            Opill will not solve all the difficulties that women have in accessing safe and effective contraception. It does not eliminate all the negative effects of state policies that limit women’s reproductive rights. It cannot eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in women’s reproductive choice. And although Opill is better than no pill at all, there are more effective methods of contraception that require a less strict commitment to taking a pill at the same time, every day.
    
            Nonetheless, we celebrate this news. Our job as health care practitioners and leaders is to ensure that women regardless of their racial, ethnic, geographic or economic background have all the information to use this tool effectively and can access it and afford to use it without difficulty.
    
            Opill’s OTC availability provides another valuable tool that women can use to take control of their reproductive rights — something that matters now, more than ever.

      Alabama death row inmate asks appeals court to block this week’s scheduled execution
    ","
			By Emma Tucker and Rebekah Riess, CNN
		;Emma Tucker;Rebekah Riess","

        9:29 PM EDT, Tue July 18, 2023
    ","
            An Alabama death row inmate has asked a federal appeals court to stop his execution scheduled for this week, arguing the state hasn’t made sufficient changes to its capital punishment system after problems relating to several other scheduled lethal injections prompted a three-month pause on executions. 
    
            Attorneys for James Barber filed the motion to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on his behalf on Friday after a district court judge denied his request for a preliminary injunction to stop his execution by lethal injection, which is scheduled to take place at any time during a 30-hour period starting Thursday morning after midnight, court documents show.  
    
            They argued the state has “not made any meaningful improvements to their lethal injection protocol and practices since” an execution and two called-off executions in 2022 – three cases in which they say the Alabama Department of Corrections had trouble properly establishing intravenous lines. 
    
            Barber is set to be the first person executed since Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey asked Attorney General Steve Marshall in November to halt all executions and requested a “top-to-bottom review of the state’s execution process.”
    
            The request for the review came after problems with the three other cases came into the national spotlight:
    
            • In November, corrections officials halted the scheduled execution of Kenneth Smith after administrators faced issues finding a vein to set an intravenous line, and after officials said they faced time restraints caused by a late-night court battle.
    
            • In September, officials called off Alan Miller’s scheduled execution, citing an inability to meet protocols before a midnight deadline. AL.com reported that after the US Supreme Court ruled the execution by lethal injection could happen, state officials couldn’t access Miller’s veins within time limits. 
    
            • In July 2022, Alabama executed Joe Nathan James Jr. by lethal injection. The Death Penalty Information Center has said the execution was delayed for three hours because of difficulties establishing an intravenous line.
    
            Ivey said in November she did not believe Department of Corrections officials or law enforcement were at fault for recent problems, but that “legal tactics and criminals hijacking the system are at play here.” 
    
            In February, she said executions would resume after the Department of Corrections said it completed its review. Among other things, the department said it would add to its pool of available medical personnel for executions, and that it conducted rehearsals to ensure staff were well trained and prepared to carry out their duties during the execution process. 
    
            That month, Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm also cited a recent change in the Supreme Court of Alabama rule for scheduling executions, at the governor’s request. The new rule allows the governor to set a “time frame” for the execution to take place, which Hamm said would “make it harder for inmates to ‘run out the clock’ with last-minute appeals and requests for stays of execution.” 
    
            In Barber’s appeal, his attorneys argued he faces a “substantial risk of severe harm” due to his elevated body mass index, which they say makes it more difficult to access his veins. They said this complication makes him vulnerable to suffering a failed lethal injection.
    
            Barber – just like Smith and Miller – has asked to be executed by nitrogen gas rather than lethal injection, which would avoid injection into his veins. The Alabama state legislature has approved the use of nitrogen gas, but the state has said it hasn’t yet finalized the protocols.
    
            The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing to listen to oral arguments in the case on Monday, court records show. It is unclear when a ruling will be made. 
    
            A jury convicted Barber in 2003 of murder in the 2001 death of 75-year-old Dorothy Epps in Harvest, Alabama, court documents show. He was sentenced to death in 2004.

      Louisiana legislature overrides governor’s veto of ban on gender-affirming care for minors
    ","
			By Jack Forrest, CNN
		;Jack Forrest","
  Updated
        8:53 PM EDT, Tue July 18, 2023
    ","
            Louisiana’s legislature utilized its Republican supermajority Tuesday to enact a ban on gender-affirming care for most minors, overriding its Democratic governor who had vetoed the bill.
    
            The law will take effect January 1, 2024.
    
            Gov. John Bel Edwards, who vetoed House Bill 648 last month, said in a statement that he expected the courts to overturn the legislation, describing it as “a bill that needlessly harms a very small population of vulnerable children, their families, and their health care professionals.”
    
            The state House and Senate voted 76-23 and 28-11, succeeding in blocking Edwards’ move with the two-thirds majority in each chamber needed to overpower the governor.
    
            The law will bar those under 18 in Louisiana from receiving gender-affirming surgeries, puberty blocking medications and hormone treatments, and punishes health care professionals that provide them with the revocation of their license for a minimum of two years.
    
            Doctors who began providing such drug or hormone therapy to a minor before January 1, 2024, are allowed to continue providing care through December 1, 2024, if they determine that “immediately terminating the minor’s use of the drug or hormone would cause harm to the minor.”
    
            Gender-affirming care spans a range of evidence-based treatments and approaches that benefit transgender and nonbinary people. The types of care vary by the age and goals of the recipient, and are considered the standard of care by many mainstream medical associations.
    
            Though the care is highly individualized, some children and parents may decide to use reversible puberty suppression therapy. This part of the process may also include hormone therapy that can lead to gender-affirming physical change. Surgical procedures prohibited under the measure, however, are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors.
    
            No such surgeries were performed on Louisiana minors enrolled in Medicaid from 2017 to 2021, according to a report from the state Department of Health, which found that few minors, between 21 and 57 each year, received chemical treatment during the same time period.
    
            Proponents of the legislation have expressed concern over long-term outcomes of the treatments. But major medical associations say that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria – a psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align, according to the American Psychiatric Association.
    
            Republicans gained strong enough majorities in the state’s House and Senate to override vetoes from the governor after Louisiana’s longest-serving legislator switched in March from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.
    
            But not all Republicans have supported HB 648. For the third time Tuesday, GOP state Sen. Fred Mills cast his vote in opposition to the bill – the only Republican in the state Senate to do so.
    
            “I’ve always in my heart of hearts, believed that a decision should be made by a patient and a physician,” he said last month, when he voted against the bill in committee.
    
            The American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana condemned the legislature’s override, saying in a statement that lawmakers who voted to override have chosen to sacrifice the health and safety of Louisiana’s transgender children and undermine the rights of their parents.
    
            “This is extreme government overreach and a direct threat to the civil liberties and constitutional rights of all Louisianans. We condemn today’s override of HB648, and we will never stop fighting to protect the rights of transgender youth and their families,” the statement added.
    
            Laws restricting the procedures for minors have spread across the country, with 17 states besides Louisiana so far this year placing their own laws on the books – though the legality of such bans is under intense scrutiny as federal judges last month temporary blocked laws in Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky, while a 2021 law in Arkansas was struck down outright and deemed unconstitutional.
    
            Democratic governors have pushed back on Republican-led efforts to restrict the treatments with varying degrees of success – Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly successfully blocked a ban while state lawmakers overrode Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.
    
            The Louisiana legislature most recently used its veto override powers in 2022 to pass a law Edwards had opposed that created a map retaining Republicans’ advantage in five of the state’s six congressional districts. The map kept the Second District – which stretches from Baton Rouge to New Orleans – the only majority Black district, and the only district to favor Democrats. A federal judge blocked that map and instructed the legislature to create a new one with a second majority-Black district – a ruling upheld by the US Supreme Court last month.
    
            “The first time I was overridden, on the Congressional district map, I said the bill was illegal and I expected the courts would throw it out. The courts have done so,” Edwards said in his statement Tuesday. “Today, I was overridden for the second time… I expect the courts to throw out this unconstitutional bill, as well.”
    
            This story has been updated with additional information.

      Woman jailed for taking abortion pill after UK legal limit will be released from prison

            A British woman jailed under Victorian-era legislation for terminating her pregnancy after the United Kingdom’s legal limit has won her appeal and will be released from prison, in a case that reignited the campaign to decriminalize abortion in the country.
    
            A judge in England’s Court of Appeal on Tuesday reduced the sentence of Carla Foster, a 45-year-old mother-of three, ordering that she should be released immediately from prison and serve a suspended sentence instead, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency.   
    
            In June, the Crown Court in Stoke-on-Trent, central England, gave Foster a 28-month prison sentence after she admitted using medication to terminate a pregnancy during a Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, when she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant. 
    
            The original sentence required her to serve 14 months of her sentence in prison, sparking outrage from lawmakers and abortion rights campaigners alike. 
    
            Foster was sentenced under the Offences Against the Person Act, which dates back to 1861. 
    
            Abortion is currently legal in the UK up to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, and the law stipulates that a person may be able to have a procedure at home if they are less than 10 weeks pregnant, according to the National Health Service.
    
            On Tuesday, Judge Dame Victoria Sharp called Foster’s situation a “very sad case,” making particular reference to the “length of gestation” when the offence was committed.  
    
            “It is a case that calls for compassion, not punishment, and where no useful purpose is served by detaining Ms. Foster in custody,” Sharp stressed.  
    
            The judge pointed towards the “exceptionally strong mitigation” in Foster’s case, ruling that she should be released from prison “immediately,” according to PA.  
    
            The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), an abortion care facility that provided the woman with the medication in 2020 believing that she was about seven weeks pregnant, said on Tuesday it is “delighted with the decision.”
    
            “We echo the judges’ statements that this is a case that calls for compassion, not punishment,” Clare Murphy, the chief executive of BPAS, said in a statement.
    
            “The Court of Appeal has recognised that this cruel, antiquated law does not reflect the values of society today. Now is the time to reform abortion law so that no more women are unjustly criminalised for taking desperate actions at a desperate time in their lives.
    
            “We urge Parliament to take action and decriminalise abortion as a matter of urgency so that no more women have to endure the threat of prosecution and imprisonment.”
    
            Barrister Charlotte Proudman, who advocates justice for women facing prosecution for terminating a pregnancy in the UK, reiterated calls on Tuesday to “de-criminalise abortion full stop,” on Twitter. 
    
            Proudman told CNN in June that the Offences Against the Person Act is “ancient,” emphasizing that it was “written at a time when women didn’t even have the right to vote” in the UK.

      Tuberville’s gamble pits abortion and the military at odds in ruby red Alabama
    ","

    ","
            Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s military holds are testing Republican support back home as the months-long standoff with the Biden administration over abortion drags on.
    
            “When you start politicizing how to promote, I think we’re stepping into the wrong territory,” said Greg Black, who served in the Air Force for 25 years.
    
            Black voted for Tuberville in 2020, but says he can’t back him again if he keeps it up.
    
            “I have to say no,” Black said.
    
            There are now more than 250 military nominations being slow-walked in the Senate, a tactic that has drawn condemnation from colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Washington and is also leading some Republicans in the state who strongly back Tuberville’s position on abortion to wonder whether the fight could be too much of a gamble in a state with five military bases and 100,000 active duty military members.
    
            “I am pro-life and I’m a conservative, but I really don’t believe he should hold up military promotions,” said Bobby Sparks. “I think there has to be a better way to change that policy.”
    
            Gary Counts, another former service member who considers himself a Republican, argued, “I just don’t think that you would hold the national security hostage over an abortion issue.”
    
            Alabama voted for Donald Trump by 26 points in the 2020 election and overwhelmingly elected Tuberville just a little over two years ago. But Tuberville’s fight is pitting two pillars of Republican orthodoxy right up against one another: abortion and the military, and in Alabama, the effect of Tuberville’s holds are still having a personal impact.
    
            Redstone Arsenal, an army base in Huntsville, is awaiting the confirmation of a leader to head the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, but the confirmation of the nominee is among those being slow walked.
    
            “Someone has given him bad advice. It affects everyone. It affects the nation, it affects every community like this,” said retired Military General Jim Rogers, who served as Redstone’s Senior Commander overseeing installation issues and coordinating with tenant organizations. “I am very concerned our senator is getting led down a path that he does not understand the full impact for the military, and I just recommend that he reconsider that.”
    
            There’s nothing that Tuberville can do to block a nomination from ultimately getting approved if there is widespread support, but getting around Tuberville’s holds would require Senate leaders to burn up to months in the Senate to clear all the nominations.
    
            Rogers also said the ricochet goes far beyond just the officers who are awaiting confirmation. Without promotions in the higher ranks, lower ranking officials are also caught up in the fray.
    
            “He needs to step back now and say ‘I understand the implications,’ and we need to go forward,” Rogers said. “And we need to get these people in the right positions, because it’s a huge domino all the way down.”
    
            Quan, who grew up in a military family, told CNN that her own brother is affected now because of the holds. She declined to give her full name out of concern that doing so could have an impact on her brother’s military career, but she said the uncertainty is daunting for men and women who are already sacrificing a lot to be in the military.
    
            “He is very proud of his career in the military. But he was telling me that he’s still in limbo. He doesn’t know where he is going next. And so I can kind of hear in his voice that he would like to know more about where he is going,” she said. “Nobody wants that stress and that pressure of not knowing if you’re going to within the next couple of months.”
    
            Kerry and Alex Anton moved more than a dozen times over the course of Kerry’s two decades in the army. They recently moved back to Alabama and while they don’t consider themselves Republicans, they argue Tuberville just doesn’t understand the nuanced experience of service men and women.
    
            “I can’t figure out what his reasoning would be to essentially punish people that have no dog in the fight for his own agenda,” Kerry said. “I just retired from the army in March. I served 20 years so, yeah, it kind of rings close to home for me.”
    
            But so far the Republican Party in the state is fully behind their senator. The state party is expected to vote in coming weeks on a resolution expressing support for Tuberville’s actions, and GOP State Chairman John Wahl told CNN he expects it will pass overwhelmingly.
    
            “I’m looking at a US senator who wants to do a good job representing his constituents, who sees a flawed policy and is standing against it,” Wahl said of Tuberville’s fight.
    
            Retired Col. James Henderson is introducing the resolution, saying it’s a thank you to the senator for representing the state’s values on abortion.
    
            “I wanted him and the people of Alabama to know that we appreciate what he’s doing,” Henderson said.
    
            Pushed on the fact that many Republicans in Washington want Tuberville to compromise, Henderson argued, “I’m certain that he would not compromise and nor do I think he should.”
    
            Alabama has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country, outlawing the procedure except in cases where the life of the mother is in danger, and many Republican voters in the state relish Tuberville’s fight with the Biden administration over the Pentagon’s policy to reimburse travel for service men and women who leave the state to seek a procedure if it’s not allowed where they live.
    
            “I think he’s doing what the state of Alabama voters want him to do,” said Kerry Holcombe, a GOP voter in the state. “I think that it’s one way that he can make the voice, his voice known and the voice of the people who are pro-life and don’t want their tax dollars going toward the funding of abortion.”
    
            But not everyone is sure Tuberville’s gamble is going to pay off.
    
            “So what does he hope to accomplish by doing that? He’s going to not support the advancements of the military until he achieves what end? I don’t know,” said Counts.

      State judge temporarily blocks Iowa’s 6-week abortion ban

            Abortions in Iowa will for now remain legal up to 22 weeks into a pregnancy after a judge on Monday temporarily blocked the state’s newly signed law that would ban the procedure as early as six weeks.
    
            The suit was filed last week by Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, the Emma Goldman Clinic and the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, who jumped into action hours after the bill was sent to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk to block the measure from immediately going into effect with her signature.
    
            The law will now be placed on hold until the court can issue a final decision, according to the ruling.
    
            Polk County District Judge Joseph Seidlin will, however, allow Iowa’s board of medicine to begin drafting its guidelines on how physicians would be punished for violating the law: “Should the injunction entered today ultimately be dissolved, it would only benefit all involved, patients and providers alike, to have rules in place to administer the law.”
    
            The law, which was signed by Reynolds on Friday, moved through Iowa’s legislature after Reynolds called a special legislative session with the sole purpose of restricting the procedure in the state.
    
            In a statement after the ruling, Reynolds promised to take the case to the state Supreme Court, adding, “While Life was protected for a few days, now even more innocent babies will be lost.”
    
            Senate File 579 would prohibit physicians from providing most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.
    
            It includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant’s death. It also includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days.
    
            While the bill language makes clear it is “not to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division,” guidelines on how physicians would be punished for violating the law are left up to Iowa’s board of medicine to decide – leaving the potential for some vagueness in how the law ought to be enforced in the interim.
    
            The temporary injunction is the latest roadblock in Republican efforts to enact restrictions on abortion in the state. Last month, Iowa’s Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the state’s 2018 six-week abortion ban, deadlocking in a 3-3 vote whether to overturn a lower court decision that had deemed the law unconstitutional.
    
            The new bill and its 2018 predecessor are nearly identical, though the latter was not enacted immediately, granting the board of medicine time to flesh out how it planned to administer the law.
    
            Seidlin in his decision leaned heavily on a legal test that considers whether a regulation puts an “undue burden” on a woman seeking an abortion – which the state Supreme Court had upheld as Iowa’s governing standard for regulating abortion the week before Roe v. Wade was struck down.
    
            The judge said the new law enacted after the reversal of federal abortion protections could prompt the court to revisit the “undue burden” standard, but in the meantime he would follow the precedent of his state’s highest court. 
    
            “This court does not get to declare that our Supreme Court got it wrong and then impose a different standard. Such would be an alarming exercise of judicial activism,” Seidlin said. “This court is bound to decide this matter pursuant to the instruction of our Supreme Court.”
    
            The legal advocacy groups in a joint statement said the law “violates Iowans’ constitutional rights to abortion and substantive due process.”
    
            “Today’s ruling means patients across Iowa will be able to access abortion care and retain control over their bodies and futures. We are proud to continue providing the care our patients need and deserve,” said Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States. “The fight to preserve Iowans’ fundamental right to reproductive freedom is far from over. We will continue to oppose this egregious, unconstitutional ban as it works its way through the courts.”
    
            Other legal challenges to abortion restrictions have been met with mixed results, with a South Carolina judge temporarily blocking the state’s six-week ban in May, while a judge in North Carolina allowed her state’s 12-week ban to go into effect last month.

      Iowa governor signs 6-week abortion ban into law

    ","
            Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a bill into law Friday that bans most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy.
    
            “This week, in a rare and historic special session, the Iowa legislature voted for a second time to reject the inhumanity of abortion and pass the fetal heartbeat law,” she said in remarks ahead of signing the bill at the Family Leadership Summit.
    
            The law, which is effective immediately, comes after Reynolds ordered a special legislative session last week with the sole purpose of restricting the procedure in the state. But it is already facing a legal challenge after a group of abortion providers in the state filed a suit to try and stop the law.  
    
            The bill, which passed the state’s Republican-controlled legislature earlier this week, prohibits physicians from providing most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. 
    
            It includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant’s death. It also includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days.
    
            While the bill language makes clear it is “not to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division,” guidelines on how physicians would be punished for violating the law are left up to Iowa’s board of medicine to decide – leaving the potential for some vagueness in how the law ought to be enforced in the interim.
    
            Iowa joins a growing list of Republican-led states that have championed sweeping abortion restrictions in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            Reynolds’ push for abortion restrictions in the state comes weeks after Iowa’s Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the state’s 2018 six-week abortion ban, deadlocking in a 3-3 vote whether to overturn a lower court decision that deemed the law unconstitutional. 
    
            “The Iowa Supreme Court questioned whether this legislature would pass the same law they did in 2018, and today they have a clear answer,” Reynolds said Tuesday in a statement following the bill’s passage. “The voices of Iowans and their democratically elected representatives cannot be ignored any longer, and justice for the unborn should not be delayed.”  
    
            Abortion rights supporters have been speaking out against the abortion ban in the state. National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison called the ban the “latest show of abortion extremism from MAGA Republicans.”
    
            “Governor Kim Reynolds just signed a cruel abortion ban into law among a crowd of extremists who cheered as Iowan women’s abortion rights were stripped away,” Harrison said in a statement Friday.
    
            Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups, including National Right to Life and Iowa Right to Life, praised Reynolds and the law’s supporters in the state legislature for the abortion ban. 
    
            “We will continue to advocate for life and will not stop fighting until abortion becomes unthinkable,” Kristi Judkins, executive director of Iowa Right to Life said in a statement. “We want to see lives saved and women no longer placed in harm’s way because of abortion.”

      Opinion: We don’t talk enough about the single most common complication of pregnancy
    ","
			Opinion by Aimee Danielson

        4:52 PM EDT, Fri July 14, 2023
    ","
            Motherhood is often painted in a bright palette: pink tulips, blueberry pancakes and sunny smiles.
    
            But there is a shadowy side of motherhood, too, that frightened women describe to me in private. It’s a darkness often felt in the middle of the night as they rock their babies, exhausted and spread thin.
    
            Their bodies have undergone rapid, often traumatic change. Their brains have experienced a steep spike and drop in hormones. The courses of their lives have shifted. Add sleep deprivation and isolation, and the early months of motherhood can bring on feelings of despair, of hopelessness — even terror.
    
            As a clinical psychologist with decades of experience in maternal mental health, I know that mental illness is the single most common complication of pregnancy. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 1 in 5 women develops a psychiatric disorder before or after birth. Among women of color, more than 1 in 3 suffer from postpartum depression. That means many of us will be affected by perinatal mental illness — or mental health conditions that arise or occur in the weeks before or after birth — whether personally or indirectly, at some point in our lives. Yet, in my experience, these statistics are rarely discussed, and I’ve learned from many obstetricians that they’re shocked to hear this data.
    
            Mothers and their families deserve better. And, finally, that silence is beginning to break, led by survivors who know the difference treatment can make, and the relatives and friends of mothers who never got the chance to be treated.
    
            Thanks to their advocacy, the US opened its first national hotline for maternal mental health last year. In less than a year, they answered nearly 12,000 calls and texts. The Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance also helped secure $50 million in federal funding for the hotline and for state programs that increase access to treatment for maternal mental illness. And here in Washington, the DC Council passed a bill that established a perinatal mental health task force, which will provide critical guidance and recommendations for improving perinatal mental health services in the District later this year.
    
            Now is the time to build on this momentum: expanding screening, broadening access and tailoring care.
    
            I know firsthand that a simple depression screening can be a vital step toward hope and healing. I’ve seen countless women cry with relief when they realize the pain they’ve been keeping private has both a diagnosis and a remedy.
    
            But screening must be accompanied by access to treatment, and the gap remains profound. Three in four women with a perinatal mental illness don’t get the treatment they need — which is both tragic and unacceptable, because even for the most serious disorders, we know how to help: More than 95% of women who receive immediate, urgent treatment for postpartum psychosis recover within three months.
    
            The problem is that there aren’t enough clinicians equipped to deliver care, and fewer still whom patients can afford to see. In Washington, D.C., there are over 8,000 births each year, yet far too few with specialty training in reproductive psychiatry who accept commercial insurance and Medicaid. Nationwide, there is one intensive perinatal mental health treatment program for every 21,000 women with a disorder. To visualize what that means, imagine Capital One Arena filled to capacity with sick mothers, all waiting for access to one treatment program — with hundreds more lined up outside.
    
            As a result, too often, mothers are shunted into care settings that don’t meet their needs. In a crisis, they’ll be admitted for an inpatient stay on a psychiatric unit — which can be traumatic in itself — as these programs take them away from their infants and family, often disrupting the bonding process.
    
            Intensive perinatal mental health programs address these gaps in services and confer a range of benefits, to both mother and baby, over traditional inpatient or outpatient care. Mothers spend the day alongside other mothers, engaged in group therapy, practicing mindfulness and developing healthy attachment with their infant — and at night, they can go home and integrate the skills they’ve learned into their family life. The program’s focused intensity — typically offering three hours of daily treatment over a four to six week stay — means that patients receive concentrated care, allowing them to gain essential skills and support that would otherwise take months to develop and that are essential to their recovery.
    
            Connecting every mother to the care she deserves requires everyone to act: philanthropists to provide seed funding, policymakers to create frameworks for scale — and, most of all, the public to demand change. We need your help, your attention and your voice. Our children, families and communities will only flourish when mothers do, too.
    
            As perinatal mental health clinical teams across the US work to open doors to new programs with models of care that center and protect the mother-baby bond, we hope they will be worthy of the mothers, families, clinicians and advocates who made them possible. Most of all, we hope this brings more women into the light.
    
            And to the moms and moms-to-be, who may be struggling in the silence of the night: Support is out there. Help is out there. You are not alone.
    
            For support and resources related to pregnancy and parenthood, call or text the National Maternal Mental Health hotline at 1-833-852-6262. If you or someone you know needs help, call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or visit 988lifeline.org.

      Sheriff says baby dies after teen mom put fentanyl in bottle

            A 9-month-old baby in Florida died after his teenage mother allegedly put fentanyl in his bottle before putting him down for a nap, Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper said.
    
            Deputies were called Monday to a home in the Callahan area about a baby who was not breathing and had no pulse, Leeper said at a news conference Wednesday. Deputies tried to revive the baby until firefighters took him to a Jacksonville hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Leeper said.
    
            “Originally, the mother said she didn’t know what happened. She put the baby to sleep and just couldn’t wake him up,” Leeper said.
    
            The mother, 17, allegedly “changed her story several times” but ultimately “confessed” she had been tired and wanted to take a nap, filled the baby’s bottle, and put some of “what she thought was cocaine” in the bottle, the sheriff said.
    
            The substance was fentanyl, an opioid, according to the sheriff.
    
            The medical examiner’s office said the child had 10 times a fatal dose in his bloodstream and determined the cause of death was a fentanyl overdose.
    
            Leeper said the child’s death was caused by the mother’s culpable negligence and “utter disregard” for his safety.
    
            “The suspect consciously did an act she must have known, or reasonably should have known, was likely to cause of the death, or great bodily injury, of her child,” Leeper said.
    
            She was charged with aggravated manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance.
    
            Deputies and the Florida Department of Children and Families are investigating.

      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center facing civil rights investigation for treatment of Black women giving birth

    ","
            Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles is facing a civil rights investigation into how Black women giving birth are treated in its hospital.
    
            “Maternal health is a priority for the Biden-Harris Administration and one in which the HHS Office for Civil Rights is working on around the country to ensure equity and equality in health care. To protect the integrity of this ongoing investigation we have no further comment,” the US Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement to CNN. 
    
            The federal investigation comes after Charles Johnson IV filed a civil rights lawsuit in May of 2022 against Cedars-Sinai following the 2016 death of his wife, Kira, who had gone to the hospital to give birth to their second son.
    
            An autopsy showed Johnson died from massive internal bleeding following a planned cesarean section, CNN previously reported.
    
            The lawsuit stated Johnson’s civil rights were violated, and she was denied health care because of her race, “which resulted in her untimely and wrongful death.”
    
            Cedars-Sinai declined to comment specifically on the federal civil rights investigation, but in a statement to CNN said, “Cedars-Sinai clinicians, leaders and researchers have long been concerned with national disparities in Black maternal health, and we are proud of the work we’ve done (and continue to do) to address these issues in Los Angeles as well as at the state and national levels.”
    
            Previously, Cedars-Sinai said it commended Johnson “for the attention he has brought to the important issue of racial disparities in maternal outcomes. While federal privacy laws prevent us from responding directly about any patient’s care, we have a longstanding commitment to making any changes to ensure we provide patients with the highest level of care.”
    
            Black maternal death rates have been steadily rising in the United States for decades, CNN previously reported. Black mothers are nearly three times as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications as White women with 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021, according to the CDC. Multiple factors contribute to the racial disparities seen in the data, including underlying chronic conditions, structural racism and implicit bias, the CDC found.

      Pence says he supports banning abortions for nonviable pregnancies

            Former Vice President Mike Pence said abortion should be banned when a pregnancy is not viable, according to the Associated Press. 
    
            “I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it,” Pence told the AP in a recent interview. “I just have heard so many stories over the years of courageous women and families who were told that their unborn child would not go to term or would not survive. And then they had a healthy pregnancy and a healthy delivery.”
    
            A Pence adviser told CNN that the former vice president’s position still allows for exceptions for life of the mother.
    
            Pence strongly opposes abortion and has been perhaps the most outspoken Republican candidate about the issue as many of his GOP rivals have avoided staking out a clear position on abortion.
    
            During a CNN town hall in Iowa last month, Pence said he supports a federal abortion ban including exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. He also backs federal legislation limiting the procedure and has called on other 2024 GOP candidates to support a 15-week national abortion ban. 
    
            Pence told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer back in March that he would support legislation restricting abortion to six weeks of pregnancy. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law in his state that banned abortion at six weeks while President Donald Trump has suggested the legislation was “too harsh.”
    
            Clinicians use ultrasound results and measure pregnancy hormone levels in order to determine “whether a pregnancy is viable beyond the first trimester,” according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
    
            Pregnancies that are deemed unviable regardless of gestational age include tubal ectopic pregnancies and early pregnancy loss, according to the ACOG, which can be deadly for the pregnant person. There are cases, such as “genetic or isolated structural abnormalities in which essential structures do not develop properly,” in which survivability is poor and patients may choose to end their pregnancies or give birth with palliative care options, the ACOG notes.
    
            Since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, several women have shared their harrowing stories of trying to obtain medically necessary abortions in states that have greatly restricted the procedure. One Texas woman told CNN’s Elizabeth Cohen that she nearly died after her water broke four months into her pregnancy, putting her at high risk for a life-threatening infection. Doctors in Texas had to wait until the woman was sick enough so they felt legally safe to terminate her pregnancy and then bring her to the ICU after she started developing symptoms of sepsis.
    
            A Christian conservative, Pence views the “cause of life” as “the calling of our time.” 
    
            “As your President, I will always stand for the sanctity of life and I will not rest and I will not relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the land,” he said in his presidential campaign announcement last month.
    
            Pence has called for more support and resources for women in crisis pregnancies and advocated for adoption as alternatives to abortion.

      Blue states see ‘shield laws’ as bulwark against Republican efforts to restrict abortion and gender-affirming care
    ","

    ","
            As Republican lawmakers have pushed restrictions on abortion and gender-affirming care in recent months, Democratic-led states have increasingly responded by passing so-called shield laws to protect people who undergo such care against the possibility they could one day face prosecution.
    
            Nearly a dozen states – including Washington state, Colorado, New Mexico and Minnesota – have passed shield laws, and several governors have issued executive orders with similar protections, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, and advocacy group Lawyers for Good Government. 
    
            So far, according to those groups, there are no known instances of law enforcement reaching across state lines to target citizens who traveled for such treatment – and the restrictive laws typically target doctors and others who provide such services. The laws also serve to protect patients in the event civil actions suits are filed against them or if officials from their home state try to subpoena or extradite them to face potential charges for accessing treatment in another state.
    
            But advocates see the shield laws, which typically require officials to not cooperate with out-of-state criminal inquiries under the protected health services, as a way to prepare for and protect against an uncertain political climate – despite questions over their enforceability.
    
            “Shield laws are the current kind of attempt to imagine where this continuing unfolding kind of chaotic legal landscape is going to end up, but the truth is, we just don’t know yet how they’re going to work in practice,” said Kelly Baden, the vice president for public policy at Guttmacher Institute.
    
            There are few restrictions on abortion in Colorado, where Democrats control the main levers of power, but the procedure is largely banned in neighboring Oklahoma and nearby Texas. Utah, Arizona and Nebraska, which also share Colorado’s borders, have passed laws restricting gender-affirming care. New Mexico also passed a shield law earlier this year to protect people seeking abortion and gender affirming care in the state.  
    
            The Centennial State, meanwhile, has been dubbed a “safe haven” for such care. In April, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed legislation prohibiting court officials from issuing a subpoena involving a legal matter pending in another state concerning someone who aids in, provides or accesses “a legally protected health-care activity in Colorado.”
    
            Idaho, a Republican stronghold, threatens physicians who provide gender-affirming care to minors with a felony and a hefty fine, and considers it a crime to refer women across state lines to obtain abortion services. The state also has a near ban on abortions and a law on the books that makes it a crime for people to help minors travel out of state to get an abortion. 
    
            So Democratic legislators in Washington this spring passed a bill preventing local law enforcement from complying with investigations from out of state and bars extraditions related to abortion and gender affirming care that occur in the state. 
    
            Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee’s office said officials there have yet to receive any legal challenges from outside states and don’t anticipate any in the near future. Still, spokesperson Jaime Smith told CNN that the state’s attorney general “is fully prepared to defend this law if or when needed.”
    
            If tested, however, advocates warn the “shield laws” could create a complicated legal dilemma between states.
    
            Khadijah Silver, an attorney for Lawyers for Good Government, said that shield laws look “pretty on paper” but many questions remain around enforcement.
    
            “The question is what happens when they send the sheriff from Missouri? What happens? What is the plan? What are the steps? Those things have not been agreed upon, they have not been budgeted for,” Silver said.
    
            Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, who co-authored a report about extradition in the post-Roe America, which explored the legal limitations of shield laws, noted enforcement challenges include the possibility that local law enforcement may not be equipped to immediately determine whether an arrest warrant from another state was issued for a crime the safe-haven law is intended to protect. 
    
            “The reality is, all of this is so theoretical at this point. It’s very, very hard to tell how it would play out, and even if it did play out, most of the people involved would not have anything really to draw on because this is kind of novel territory,” Caraballo said. 
    
            Andrew Warren, a state attorney in Florida who was suspended by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last year over his position on abortion and gender-affirming care, told CNN he thinks it’s unlikely prosecutors would try to bring people back to their home states who left to access abortion or gender affirming care.
    
            “I think that so much of the legislation around this is to fan the flames of culture wars and has nothing to do with the reality of what law enforcement officers and prosecutors are going to do,” Warren said.
    
            That hasn’t stopped the National Center for Transgender Equality from advising people looking to travel to access gender-affirming care to seek legal representation “as soon as possible” before leaving, said Devon Ojeda, a senior national organizer at the National Center for Transgender Equality. 
    
            “We’ve been telling and advising trans people and trans families to find legal representation … because we just don’t how these shield laws are going to interact with the anti-trans bills that we’re seeing and the anti-abortion bills that we’re seeing,” Ojeda said.
    
            Democratic state Rep. Leigh Finke, the first transgender lawmaker elected to Minnesota’s state legislature who sponsored the state’s “trans refuge bill,” said she has recently spoken with families in as far as Texas and Florida who are planning to travel to her state to access gender affirming care, and for now, she said, the shield laws serve as an extra layer to protect them. 
    
            “I think we will have to realize that people are not just relocating for gender affirming care, but they will be in their home states, criminals,” Finke told CNN. “They are going move and there will be extradition requests, there’s going to be a very complicated legal network of problems that arrive because some parents have transgender children.”

      Iowa Republicans advance 6-week abortion ban in special session

            Iowa’s Republican-controlled legislature advanced a bill that would ban most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy. 
    
            The state’s Senate passed a bill late Tuesday in a 32 to 17 vote and is now headed to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk for signing, after she ordered a special legislative session with the sole purpose of restricting the procedure in the state.
    
            The bill prohibits physicians from providing most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. 
    
            The bill includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant’s death. It also includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days. 
    
            The Senate vote came despite Democratic backlash after the state House voted 56-34 largely along party lines to advance the measure following a roughly 12-hour day that saw the measure move through rounds of consideration and debate. 
    
            “The voices of the unborn and their elected representatives will not be silenced any longer! Congrats to the Iowa House and Senate!” Reynolds tweeted early Wednesday upon the bill’s passage. 
    
            She is expected to sign the legislation into law on Friday, according to a statement from her office. The law would go into effect immediately following Reynolds’ signature, but abortion rights groups including Planned Parenthood of the Heartland and the ACLU of Iowa have already filed a challenge in court with the hopes of getting a temporary injunction. 
    
            While the bill language makes clear it is “not to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division,” guidelines on how physicians would be punished for violating the law are left up to Iowa’s board of medicine to decide – leaving the potential for some vagueness in how the law ought to be enforced in the interim.
    
            “There may or may not ever be rules promulgated,” said Iowa Senate President Amy Sinclair, a Republican, amid several questions from Democrats on the floor. There were no legal penalties for physicians added in the bill, she said.
    
            “As far as clarity, this is about as clear as mud,” Democratic state Sen. Molly Donahue said on the floor.
    
            Reynolds’ move to push for abortion restrictions in Iowa comes weeks after Iowa’s Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the state’s 2018 six-week abortion ban, deadlocking in a 3-3 vote whether to overturn a lower court decision that deemed the law unconstitutional. 
    
            The new bill and its 2018 predecessor are nearly identical. However, the latter was not enacted immediately, granting the board of medicine time to flesh out how it planned to administer the law. 
    
            Ruth Richardson, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, previously said the legislation “would have a devastating impact on patients and communities in Iowa,” as abortion procedures are currently legal up to 20 weeks in the Hawkeye state.

      Fact Check: Sen. Tommy Tuberville overestimates number of abortions military women would seek out under new DOD policies, researchers say
    ","

    ","
            Despite frequent claims from Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama that new Pentagon reproductive health policies would result in thousands more abortions a year, the number estimated by a study Tuberville himself cites is far lower, though nearly impossible to actually know. 
    
            Tuberville is protesting new Pentagon reproductive health policies, which provide a travel allowance to service members and their dependents who must cross state lines to get an abortion because of where they are stationed. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade last year, many states had so-called “trigger laws” go into place, immediately restricting abortion access. Tuberville is holding up hundreds of senior military nominations that must be confirmed by the Senate to protest the policies. 
    
            The Defense Department said earlier this year that because service members cannot choose what states they are stationed in, the Pentagon would provide up to three weeks of leave and a travel allowance for service members and dependents who have to travel out of state to receive care. The leave also applied to people who were traveling to receive other reproductive health care not covered by the military, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI).
    
            In a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in December, Tuberville referenced a briefing he said he received from the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. The briefing, he said, stated that the new policies “would increase DoD subsidized abortions by as much as 4,100 per year. That estimate does not include dependents, which your policy also intends to cover, who might seek assistance in obtaining an abortion.” 
    
            The new policies providing a travel allowance to receive an abortion do apply to dependents. Tuberville’s office told CNN that the number he is referencing came from a study by the RAND Corporation, a research organization which often conducts research on behalf of the DOD.
    
            Tuberville repeated a similar claim on Monday, during an interview on CNN’s “The Source with Kaitlan Collins.” 
    
            “We’ve done a couple of dozen abortions in the military for the last 40 years, a couple dozen a year,” he said. “Now we’re going to have 4,000 to 5,000 a year because this new rule, this new supposedly law that this administration’s pushing through. So let’s think about the unborn.”
    
            Facts First: Tuberville’s claim is incorrect. He is misleadingly comparing the number of covered abortions provided by DOD health facilities with an estimate of how many women in the military receive abortions outside of those health facilities, have ectopic pregnancies or still births annually. RAND researchers, one of whom was directly involved in the study Tuberville cites, told CNN that Tuberville is significantly overestimating the number of women in the military who would take advantage of the new DOD policies.
    
            The survey being referenced by Tuberville was conducted in 2020 and sponsored by the Defense Department, according to Dr. Sarah Meadows, a senior sociologist at RAND. 
    
            While it’s not possible to know exactly how many people would use the Pentagon’s new policies to be reimbursed for travel to receive an abortion, the estimates calculated through the 2020 survey provide a window into how many women in uniform may seek out abortion care. 
    
            In the survey, Meadows said they asked women who had been pregnant in the last 12 months how their pregnancy ended – in a birth, miscarriage, or “other.” The “other” category included ectopic pregnancies, still births and abortions. Meadows said other data on pregnancies led researchers to believe the bulk of the pregnancies marked as ending in “other” were abortions.
    
            That number was then taken by RAND and applied to the total population of women in the military, which gave them an estimated range of how many pregnancies of members of the military would end in one of the “other” categories.
    
            “The other thing to keep in mind,” Meadows explained, “is that’s total. That is every active-duty service woman in every state in the continental United States, to include Alaska and Hawaii. So, of those, only a certain percentage will need to travel to receive abortion care … So, people use those numbers, but it’s really only like half, 46% actually, of those women who are seeking an abortion will need to travel to get it based on where they live.”  
    
            Even Meadow’s estimate of about 2,000 assumes all of the women who would need to travel to get an abortion would take advantage of the Pentagon’s new policies, which even she said is not likely. Previous data shows that a “not insubstantial percentage” of women don’t feel comfortable even getting contraceptive care through military health facilities, Meadows said.
    
            “They don’t want the military health system to know what they’re doing, essentially,” she said. “So, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to think that … there’s still this barrier, that you’re going to have to go to your commander and say, ‘I need this, you know, administrative leave,’ and then I have to process the paperwork to get reimbursed for travel and my hotel and per diem.” 
    
            RAND senior political scientist Dr. Kyleanne Hunter added that many women in the military are barely comfortable telling their commanders of planned pregnancies because of long-existing stigma. 
    
            “What we do know as well from other research surveys, but also a lot of focus group research that has been done in the past, is that service women are often very uncomfortable even telling commanders about pregnancies that are wanted,” she said. “And there’s a lot of stigma around just reporting pregnancies – a planned, wanted pregnancy. So again, I think that we don’t have an estimate, but it’s a very reasonable assumption that having to go through the process of getting the travel claim will provide an additional barrier.” 
    
            Both Hunter and Meadows pushed back on the idea that the Pentagon’s new policy was providing more abortions as Tuberville has claimed. It is “a factually incorrect statement to say that they’re paying for abortion,” Meadows said. 
    
            The Defense Department is not allowed to provide abortions in DOD health facilities outside of three exceptions – in the cases of rape or incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk. A defense official told reporters last year that between 2016 and 2021, a total of 91 covered abortions were performed – coming out to roughly 15 a year.

      The jury for Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooter has begun deliberations to decide if the death penalty phase of the trial should continue
    ","

    ","
            The jury in the trial of the Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooter began deliberating Wednesday about whether he is eligible for the death penalty. 
    
            If the jury finds he is eligible, they will move to a final phase of the trial, called sentencing selection, to consider whether to recommend the death penalty for the capital offenses in light of all aggravating and mitigating factors.  
    
            This final phase is expected to last several weeks.
    
            The jury can also decide Bowers is ineligible for the death penalty at this stage, ending their deliberations and resulting in life sentences for the capital counts.  
    
            Robert Bowers, 50, was found guilty on June 16 of all 63 charges against him for killing 11 worshipers and wounding six others at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jewish people in the US. Twenty-two of those counts were capital offenses. 
    
            The jury deliberated for about an hour. Deliberations resume Thursday morning.
    
            The death penalty trial is split into two parts, the guilt phase followed by the penalty phase. In this case, however, the judge granted the defense’s request to split the trial into three parts: the guilt phase, the eligibility phase and the sentencing selection phase. Each part has opening statements, closing arguments and a verdict. 
    
            During this eligibility phase, prosecutors had to prove Bowers had an intentional mental state when he committed the crimes and at least one aggravating factor applied to the mass shooting. They argued the shooting showed extensive planning and clear intent that, in Bowers’ own words, “All Jews had to die.” 
    
            In contrast, the defense sought to question whether Bowers acted with intent and highlighted his mental health issues. Several doctors testified they diagnosed him with schizophrenia and noted his delusional thoughts and conspiracies about Jews. 
    
            During closing arguments Wednesday, the defense team said the shooter’s delusions “took over his thinking.” 
    
            “In 2018, that delusional belief system took over his thinking and made him incapable of really doing anything except following the dictates of that belief system,” defense attorney Michael Burt told the jury.
    
            The defense team has focused on the threshold intent factors in the case, attempting to prove that Bowers was incapable of forming the intent to kill or inflict serious harm due to mental illness, which Burt emphasized in his 90-minute closing argument.  
    
            “People don’t go into a church and kill a bunch of older people for no reason,” Burt said. “We’ve tried to provide you with reasons that we think explain how this horrible crime could’ve happened.”
    
            Two medical experts called by the defense testified the shooter diagnosed Bowers with schizophrenia, and one diagnosed him with epilepsy. Other experts testified that Bowers has shown signs of these conditions, as well as delusions. 
    
            Burt said there’s a difference between “a rational, conscious intent to kill, as opposed to a crazy, delusional intent that is found in mental illness.”
    
            In the prosecution’s rebuttal argument, attorney Eric Olshan disputed the defense experts’ diagnoses, saying Bowers does not have schizophrenia, epilepsy, or delusions.
    
            “He just believes things that are repugnant,” Olshan said.
    
            “Even if the defendant had these illnesses, they would say nothing about whether he could form the intent to kill,” the prosecutor told the jury.
    
            “Don’t be distracted from the simple and commonsense fact that everything the defendant did in the months leading up to October 27 and on that horrific day was because that’s exactly what he intended to do,” Olshan said.
    
            US District Judge Robert Colville instructed jurors before closing arguments, asking them not to consider the fact that Bowers did not testify in the trial. “You must not draw any adverse inference against him because he did not take the witness stand,” he said.
    
            The jury heard from a total of 20 witnesses over more than two weeks of testimony in the trial’s latest phase.
    
            In 2018, Bowers approached the synagogue with three handguns and an AR-15 rifle and began firing near the entrance to the synagogue and then opened fire on congregants, according to testimony.
    
            Police eventually shot Bowers multiple times before he surrendered and was arrested.
    
            Those who died included a 97-year-old great-grandmother, an 87-year-old accountant and a couple married at the synagogue more than 60 years earlier.

      Opinion: The surprising second life of the Supreme Court’s abortion decision
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler

        4:36 PM EDT, Wed July 12, 2023
    ","
            In Ohio, Republicans seeking to defeat a ballot initiative creating a state constitutional right to abortion have seized on another culture war issue: gender-affirming care. An ongoing ad campaign, initiated by anti-abortion group Protect Women Ohio, claims that the Ohio measure would allow minors to get gender-affirming care without parental consent. Those ads have been debunked — the ballot initiative says nothing about gender identity and has no impact on gender-affirming care. But there may be a surprising connection between abortion and gender-affirming care after all — one developed by conservatives, a reinvention of the Supreme Court’s decision destroying federal abortion rights.
    
            This year, 19 states have enacted restrictions or bans on gender-affirming care, but many of these laws have quickly faced constitutional challenges in court. Federal judges in Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana issued rulings blocking these state measures from taking effect. But now, an appellate court has recently upheld a state ban: A three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Tennessee’s ban to go into effect while litigation continues in the lower courts (a formal decision on the state’s appeal of the preliminary injunction is expected by the end of September). Central to the panel’s decision was the Supreme Court’s decision overruling Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Center.
    
            It may not seem surprising for a conservative court to rely on Dobbs in a case involving trans youth. There is certainly a political connection: Any states that ban gender-affirming care also have taken steps to criminalize abortion.
    
            But in the Sixth Circuit case, L.W. v. Skrmetti, three transgender minors, their parents and a physician argued that there was no constitutional connection between Dobbs and gender-affirming care. They contended that the court has long recognized constitutional rights for parents to direct the upbringing of their children — including crucial medical decisions about their care. If the Supreme Court in Dobbs recognized only rights honored since the nation’s founding, surely parental rights qualified.
    
            The parents and minors also asserted that Tennessee’s law amounted to unconstitutional sex discrimination. In the context of federal employment discrimination, in Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court held in 2020 that discrimination on the basis of gender identity (or sexual orientation) always counted as sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in L.W. suggested that the same was true when it came to gender-affirming care. As US District Judge Eli Richardson, a Trump nominee, explained in ruling for the minors and their parents, a minor’s genetic sex determined whether they could access certain treatments, and that made Tennessee’s law a sex classification.
    
            The Sixth Circuit panel, in their ruling, first used Dobbs to reframe what the minors and their parents were saying: The court positioned their claim not as a vindication of parental rights, but as a demand to access “new medical treatments.” This right, the court reasoned, was not deeply rooted in the nation’s history and tradition.
    
            What was more surprising was that the court held out Dobbs as a new paradigm for sex discrimination. This is striking because Dobbs itself said so little about sex equality. For years, the leading constitutional argument against abortion bans involved sex discrimination — claims that abortion bans rested on sex stereotypes, for example. Even though neither party had even fully briefed these claims, the Dobbs court reached out to reject them anyway in a terse paragraph, suggesting that past precedent established that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or a related condition did not qualify as sex discrimination.
    
            The Dobbs court barely said enough to offer a coherent response to arguments that abortion bans involved sex discrimination. And yet Tennessee — and the Sixth Circuit panel — saw it as a new model for sex discrimination law.
    
            What counted under Dobbs, this recent ruling suggested, was that bans on both abortion and gender-affirming care involved “real” biological, reproductive differences, not sex stereotypes. Banning a medical procedure, then, had nothing to do with sex discrimination unless the state used that “real” difference as a pretext for bias.
    
            Set aside, for the moment, that someone could see the state’s actions as pretextual, given that  Tennessee has shown hostility to LGBTQ Americans across other contexts, prohibiting medical coverage for gender-affirming care for adults working for the state and banning drag shows — a law that a court recently held to be unconstitutional.
    
            The court treated Dobbs as the start of an overhaul of sex equality law. At the center of this was Dobbs’ reliance on a 1974 decision, Geduldig v. Aiello, which held that pregnancy discrimination was not unconstitutional because sex and pregnancy were not perfectly aligned (not all women, for example, were pregnant at all times). Geduldig was reviled by pro-life as well as pro-choice Americans, who campaigned for a federal law banning pregnancy discrimination, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, in 1978. As Congress recognized in 1978, “the assumption that women will become pregnant and leave the labor market is at the core of the sex stereotyping.”
    
            The Sixth Circuit, by contrast, took Geduldig as a helpful touchstone for modern law: Biological determinism could be the start of a new approach to constitutional sex discrimination, and the state could use reproductive capacity as a smokescreen for sex classifications. In theory, that means the state could discriminate on the basis of anything related to reproductive organs: pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, infertility, gender-affirming care and, of course, abortion. These classifications, the Sixth Circuit suggested, were about biology, not sex stereotypes, and the Constitution allowed the state to discriminate on that basis.
    
            The Sixth Circuit panel even seemed to read Dobbs as holding that states were simply freer to discriminate on the basis of sex in every case, not just those related to “biological difference.” Since the 1973 decision of Frontiero v. Richardson, which was decided after Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court has closely scrutinized sex classifications, generally upholding them only if they serve an important governmental interest and use means substantially related to it. That meant a wide variety of discriminatory laws were struck down — rules allowing widows but not widowers to receive certain benefits, for example, or denying men admission to nursing school or preventing women from entering intensive, military-style undergraduate programs.
    
            In this recent case, the Sixth Circuit panel never invoked this demanding test, instead relying on an older, pre-Roe case that required deference to legislators classifying citizens on the basis of sex. As the Sixth Circuit panel read Dobbs, the Supreme Court made it easier to discriminate on the basis of sex in any context — and required courts to give states the benefit of the doubt when they draw lines based on sex, sexual orientation or gender identity.
    
            This decision is the first chapter of a much longer story about the expansion of Dobbs. The Supreme Court already revolutionized the law of reproduction in the United States—and raised critical questions about the future of other privacy rights. But the latest decision in struggles over trans rights suggests that longstanding protections for sex equality might be on the chopping block, too.

      Idaho AG sued over state’s teen abortion travel ban
    ","
			By Sarah Varney, KFF Health News

        9:56 AM EDT, Wed July 12, 2023
    ","
            Advocates who counsel and aid Idaho teenagers seeking abortion care filed suit Tuesday against Republican Attorney General Raúl Labrador in a bid to overturn the state’s abortion travel ban.
    
            The travel ban, which took effect May 5, created the crime of “abortion trafficking,” punishable by a minimum of two years in prison. It forbids helping a person under 18 years old obtain abortion pills or leave the state for abortion care without parental permission.
    
            The complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, says the ban infringes on the right to interstate travel and on First Amendment rights to speak about abortion and “engage in expressive conduct, including providing monies and transportation (and other support) for pregnant minors traveling within and outside of Idaho.”
    
            The suit also says the travel ban “lacks clarity” and “invites arbitrary enforcement,” raising the specter of traffic stops of girls of reproductive age, and infringes on the right of people to cross the border into neighboring states, including Washington, where minors can legally obtain abortion care without parental consent.
    
            Wendy Heipt, senior reproductive health and justice counsel at Legal Voice, an advocacy group representing the plaintiffs, said Idaho’s law prohibits “recruiting or harboring a minor, but what constitutes recruiting? Giving information? You can’t stop [my clients] from providing information about conduct that is legal in another state.”
    
            She added, “If we want to give money to a minor to go to another state, we should be able to do that.”
    
            In a statement, Idaho’s Office of the Attorney General said, “While we don’t comment on pending litigation, our office is always prepared to vigorously defend the constitutionality of statutes duly passed by the legislature.”
    
            Legal experts say the ban, based on a model bill written by National Right to Life, one of the country’s largest anti-abortion groups, is drafted to sidestep implied constitutional protections for interstate travel.
    
            “This National Right to Life proposal was designed to chip away at travel in a way that is less politically and legally risky,” said Mary Ziegler, a professor of law at the University of California-Davis and an abortion historian. “It’s easier to package this as a Republican parental rights initiative, and it’s easier legally because courts have been willing to countenance limits on minor rights that they wouldn’t countenance on adults.”
    
            She added, “The idea is to stop people from traveling to other states,” and teen travel bans “could be a steppingstone to limit an adult’s right to travel.”
    
            The plaintiffs include the Indigenous Idaho Alliance, a nonprofit that has helped pregnant minors access abortion care outside the state; the Northwest Abortion Access Fund, which provided financial assistance to 166 Idahoans in 2022, including 18 minors; and Lourdes Matsumoto, an attorney who works with victims of domestic and sexual violence, many of whom are minors.
    
            Domestic violence advocates “don’t know what advice they can give people,” Matsumoto said. “In the shelters, they are confused about what information they can and cannot give out without putting themselves in legal jeopardy.” She said the teen travel ban has had a chilling effect on her work with teenagers dealing with the trauma of sexual assault.
    
            Idaho’s law, the first in the nation to describe “abortion trafficking,” requires a minimum two-year prison sentence for any adult who acts “with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor.”
    
            But Matsumoto, who has two teenage nieces, said the law fails to detail what constitutes parental consent. “If my niece comes to me and says, ‘My mom says this is OK; can you take me to Oregon?’ — is that enough that the mom consented? Am I going to have to come back, get arrested, lose my law license, then go to court and say, ‘The mom said it’s OK’? Is it a nod? A thumbs-up in a text message?”
    
            Courts are usually suspicious of laws that are overbroad and vague, said I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law School professor. But he said abortion bans around the country, including Idaho’s teen travel ban, have been written in a “fuzzy” way so that they “will deter ever more conduct because people don’t know where the line is.”
    
            The lawsuit cites a legal opinion dated March 27 from Labrador that “stated that medical professionals who refer pregnant patients across state lines for either medical or chemical abortions violate Idaho’s Total Abortion Ban,” a separate law that went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Labrador withdrew the opinion on April 7, facing a legal challenge over constitutional rights of speech and movement.
    
            “It is unconstitutional to forbid citizens from traveling because you disapprove of the reasons they are driving to another state,” Heipt said. “Idahoans, like all people, should be free to travel within and between states without the specter of prison, even if they are traveling for a reason other people disagree with.”
    
            Idaho patients, including teenagers, have long crossed into Washington state to legally end their pregnancies. But fewer than 5% of patients at Planned Parenthood clinics in Washington who come for abortion care are minors, according to Karl Eastlund, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho.
    
            Most of those patients, he said, do involve their parents in the process, even though parental consent is not mandatory in Washington. Those who don’t, Eastlund said, have good reason not to. Some are in dangerous, abusive situations in which disclosing a pregnancy could put them at risk of further harm.
    
            The lawsuit in Idaho cites Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion in Dobbs, in which he claimed states could not bar residents from going to other states for abortions.
    
            “May a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion?” Kavanaugh wrote. “In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel.”
    
            But Kavanaugh represents only one vote on the court, Cohen said, and “it remains to be seen what the other justices have to say on the matter.”
    
            Rather than settle the question of whether states can prohibit traveling for an abortion, Heipt said, “Dobbs unleashed chaos. What’s next?”

      Iowa House passes 6-week abortion ban in special session called by GOP governor
    ","

    ","
            Iowa’s state House passed a bill Tuesday night that would ban most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy, acting quickly in the special session ordered by GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds with the sole purpose of restricting the procedure in the state.
    
            The bill now heads to the Senate, where it must earn approval before it can move to Reynold’s desk for her signature.
    
            Senate File 579 prohibits physicians from providing most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. 
    
            The bill includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant’s death. It also includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days.
    
            The state House voted 56-34 largely along party lines to advance the measure following a roughly 12-hour day that saw the measure move through rounds of consideration and debate. Debate in the state Senate continued late into Tuesday night.
    
            The bill would immediately take effect with Reynolds’ expected signature.
    
            However, while the bill language makes clear it is “not to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division,” guidelines on how physicians would be punished for violating the law are left up to Iowa’s board of medicine to decide – leaving the potential for some vagueness in how the law ought to be enforced in the interim.
    
            “There may or may not ever be rules promulgated,” said Iowa Senate President Amy Sinclair, a Republican, amid several questions from Democrats on the floor. There were no legal penalties for physicians added in the bill, she said.
    
            “As far as clarity, this is about as clear as mud,” Democratic state Sen. Molly Donahue said on the floor.
    
            Reynolds last week called for Iowa’s legislature to convene for the special session “with the sole purpose of enacting legislation that addresses abortion and protects unborn lives,” weeks after Iowa’s Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the state’s 2018 six-week abortion ban, deadlocking in a 3-3 vote whether to overturn a lower court decision that deemed the law unconstitutional. 
    
            The new bill and its 2018 predecessor are nearly identical, though the latter was not enacted immediately, granting the board of medicine time to flesh out how it planned to administer the law.
    
            Democratic backlash to the bill and Reynolds’ special session grew throughout the day, with state House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst saying in a statement, “Women are not free when they cannot make their own healthcare decisions. And after today, women won’t be free.”
    
            Iowa’s Senate Democratic Leader Pam Jochum said in a statement that her Republican colleagues were “ignoring Iowans in their rush to pass an extreme ban” and that “their actions today threaten the health and futures of all Iowa women.”
    
            “This extreme Republican power grab infringes on the personal freedom of every Iowa woman and girl. There are women alive today who will not be alive in six months because of this law,” Jochum added. 
    
            Iowa’s position as the first-in-the-nation caucus state for the coming GOP presidential primary has thrust its state politics onto the national stage, with Republican candidates jockeying for the favor of its voters.
    
            Former Vice President Mike Pence posted his support of the bill on Twitter Tuesday night, writing, “Grateful to see Iowa Republicans and Governor @KimReynoldsIA Standing For Life! Pro-Life Americans are Cheering You On!”

      Iowa’s special session places abortion at forefront in 2024 GOP primary

    ","
            Iowa’s legislature will kick off a special session Tuesday aimed at banning abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy, elevating the issue in a state blanketed by 2024 presidential contenders who have sought to avoid the kinds of specifics the Republican-led state House and Senate are poised to consider. 
    
            Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called for the special session as GOP officials there seek to implement rules in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade reversal that had existed, but been stymied by courts in the Hawkeye State, for five years.
    
            The special session could force the GOP’s field of 2024 presidential candidates who are courting voters in the state whose caucuses kick off the nominating process to address in specific terms their positions on whether and when abortion should be prohibited. 
    
            Some GOP candidates, including former Vice President Mike Pence – who has placed his advocacy for nationwide abortion restrictions at the forefront of his presidential run – could see Iowa’s special session as an opening to draw a contrast with rivals in a state where evangelical voters will be key to the outcome of the party’s caucuses. 
    
            “We must not rest and we must not relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in this country,” Pence said last month at the Faith and Freedom Coalition gathering in Washington, DC. “Every Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion before 15 weeks as a minimum nationwide standard.”
    
            But others, while touting their own pro-life bona fides, have been less committal when asked about a federal role in restricting abortion rights. 
    
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban into law in his state in April – a move he made with little fanfare, announcing it had been signed with a late-night news release. He has defended that measure. However, DeSantis has been less clear about where he stands on a national abortion ban. 
    
            So have other Republican 2024 contenders. 
    
            Former President Donald Trump suggested in May that the Florida measure signed by DeSantis was “too harsh.” 
    
            And in a CNN town hall, Trump said he recognized the splits within the GOP over whether there should be a federal ban, and how far into a pregnancy such a ban should take effect. 
    
            “We now have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done,” Trump said.
    
            Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, was similarly vague in a CNN town hall. She said she would seek a consensus that could clear the House and the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to end a filibuster.
    
            She said she believes such a consensus measure would include banning late-term abortions, encouraging adoptions, making contraceptives more widely available and making clear that women who have abortions would not be jailed.
    
            “Can’t we start there? Because what the politicos and what the media have done is they’ve made you demonize the situation when it’s so personal that we have to humanize the situation,” Haley said. “Our goal should always be, how do we save as many babies as we can, and support as many mothers as we do it.”
    
            Vivek Ramaswamy was the first GOP 2024 contender to seek to capitalize on the special session, announcing a Tuesday morning press conference on the steps of Iowa’s Capitol building. 
    
            Other GOP contenders could also weigh in later this week at a summit Friday hosted by the conservative FAMiLY Leader.
    
            Iowa has been at the forefront of a conservative push for restrictive abortion measures. In 2018, the state enacted a so-called “heartbeat bill,” banning abortions after six weeks – a point at which many women don’t yet know they are pregnant. 
    
            That 2018 law was blocked by a state court in 2018 and remains blocked after the Iowa Supreme Court reached a 3-3 split decision about the measure last month. 
    
            Republican lawmakers, with Reynolds’ backing, have introduced a similar measure that would ban abortions after cardiac activity is detected in an embryo or fetus. 
    
            The bill includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the mother is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant’s death. It also includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days. 
    
            The legislature’s consideration of the proposal is set to start with a 90-minute House committee hearing Tuesday morning. A Senate committee hearing is scheduled to start at the same time the House panel’s meeting is slated to end. Both chambers could move to vote quickly, and Democrats have no power to stop the anti-abortion measure. 
    
            Though the political winds could shift by November 2024, the outcomes of midterm races and other elections in recent months suggest that voters are broadly supportive of abortion rights. The issue has galvanized Democrats and tilted moderates in their direction. 
    
            Earlier this year, the Democratic-backed candidate won the swing seat on Wisconsin’s Supreme Court in an expensive, high-profile race that focused almost solely on how the court would rule in the future on the state’s 1849 abortion ban. 
    
            And 11 months ago, in one of the first signs after the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade that the battle over abortion rights would shift the political landscape ahead of the midterm elections, voters in Kansas rejected a constitutional amendment that would have declared that the state does not guarantee abortion rights. Months later, Kansas – a state won by Republican presidential candidates in every election since 1964 – voted to reelect its Democratic governor, Laura Kelly. 
    
            Last fall, voters in California, Michigan and Vermont voted to enshrine abortion rights in their states’ constitutions. The issue was pivotal in Michigan, where Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made abortion her central focus against Republican challenger Tudor Dixon. 
    
            Voters in deep-red Kentucky rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have outlawed abortion, and in Montana, voters rejected a measure that would have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion.

      A 45-year-old got pregnant in a state with a ban on abortions. She flew across the country to get one

    ","
            When 45-year-old Victoria realized she was five weeks late and the lines showed as positive on two pregnancy tests, the New Orleans resident dreamed up a plan to get an abortion.
    
            Traveling out of state was the only abortion option for Victoria, who asked CNN to withhold her last name out of fear of backlash against her and her family. Louisiana is one of several states that have essentially banned all abortions.
    
            “It was probably one of the hardest things I’ve had to go through, from the moment of discovering that I was pregnant at age 45 to actually having to have to take time off work, travel across the country, do a meeting with a doctor, and then take the pills and then skedaddle back home and then go to work like nothing had happened,” Victoria told CNN of her experience earlier this year. 
    
            Victoria’s story about the distance she traveled and the hardships she endured to get an abortion reflects a wider American reality, where women seeking the procedure must navigate through a patchwork of states with varying levels of access. 
    
            The average travel time to an abortion facility more than tripled, from less than 30 minutes to more than an hour and a half, after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, according to a November study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. And for women in Texas and Louisiana, average travel times to the nearest abortion facility were seven hours longer – almost a full workday in travel time to get an abortion. 
    
            Victoria says she was grateful she could drop everything and afford to spend $1,000 for the procedure, including same-week airfare with connections both ways and appointment and medication fees.
    
            “It was so hard for me wrap my head around the fact that I was able to do this, but I’m one of the lucky ones and that there are so many women who are in much tighter positions,” Victoria said. “And, God, what are they going to do?”
    
            Victoria says plans materialized quickly once she knew which states seemed more accessible.
    
            She researched the parameters for abortion in a state, how long she would have to take off work, travel options and how soon she could get an appointment. She found abortionfinder.org to be a helpful and reliable source, she says.
    
            “Because the situation is so fluid, it changes from day to day, that was really of paramount importance for me to be able to have a reliable source of information,” she said.
    
            Driving to a neighboring state was not an option, as every state adjoining Louisiana has a similarly restrictive law that bans virtually all abortions. Victoria says she considered close states, like Florida, but she ultimately dismissed them because available appointments were farther out.
    
            “Once I saw that Oregon was so, so protective of reproductive rights, I said, ‘Why would I think about going anywhere else?’” she said. “The second I got the definitive pregnancy result, I was like, ‘OK, let’s book a flight to Oregon. When can we do this?’”
    
            She reached out to a friend from college and asked if she could stay with her, detailing the reason for her visit. She then made an appointment and booked a flight for that week, she says.
    
            The provider sent instructions, including that the patient must be in Oregon for the telehealth appointment, according to documents provided to CNN. They contacted her within an hour of making the appointment to make sure she had proof of travel documents because she had made it from Louisiana, where the procedure is illegal. 
    
            Victoria planned to take a day off to fly across the country and work remotely for two days, which fits her hybrid work situation. She says she was grateful to have a supportive, female boss who showed understanding for why she had to take the unexpected time off. 
    
            “She was the only person I actually kind of broke down and cried for,” Victoria said. “I think it’s because I had been holding it back all week, and telling her was sort of the last thing that I needed to get in place before I could do everything.”
    
            Victoria says the hardest part of her experience was telling her mother because she didn’t know how her mom would feel about it. Victoria and her siblings were raised Catholic. Her father had a strong faith and her mother was a non-practicing Catholic, her mother says. Victoria’s mom asked not to be named for privacy reasons.
    
            Victoria’s mother says she wanted to support her daughter, even if she does not agree with what her daughter did. Victoria coming to her with tickets purchased and a full plan made it easy for her mother to support her, the mother says.
    
            “I agreed to drive her to the airport and that that was the only thing I could do because this would be a real game-changing thing in her life,” her mother said. “I wanted to support what she wanted to do because she has supported me on several family crises. I just wanted to do it because I love her. “
    
            Victoria said she appreciated her mom for being supportive in a way she didn’t expect. They talked about some of her mother’s friends who had abortions throughout the years, both say. Victoria’s mother even told her about when she tried to get her tubes tied, but her husband found out and she did not pursue it.
    
            “I feel like, if anything, it’s made our relationship stronger,” Victoria said. “We already had a fantastically strong relationship, though. So, it’s another rock in the wall.”
    
            After boarding early on a Wednesday in March, Victoria traveled for eight hours on two flights and landed in Portland, Oregon.
    
            Victoria reunited with her friend, and they did the things that old friends do, from staying up late talking about college memories to talking about why Victoria was there. They both described the situation as surreal.
    
            “The vast majority of reproductive conversations I have with friends at this point are people who are trying desperately to get pregnant,” said her friend, Emily, who asked that CNN not use her last name to keep Victoria’s privacy. “The sort of irony is that there could still be an unplanned pregnancy and it would still be just as devastating as it would have been when we were in our teens and twenties was kind of a shock to me.”
    
            Emily, who has been friends with Victoria for about 25 years, says it took so little effort for her to drive to the airport and let her friend stay with her. 
    
            “I felt honored that she trusted me,” she said. “I was really proud of Victoria. I was impressed that she had taken this in stride and that she had reached out to someone she knew – I think a lot of people would have been ashamed or hidden it.”
    
            After the telehealth appointment the next day, Victoria received an overnight package.
    
            Victoria took two medications as part of a medication abortion. She took mifepristone at her friend’s home. The next day she took misoprostol before boarding her flight home – she was careful not to take them in her home state, where it’s illegal.
    
            “It was like a heavy period,” she said. “I took some Aleve, had to get some extra jumbo pads, and I bled a lot on the flights home, but it was fine.”
    
            Physically, she felt fine – it was more of what was happening psychologically that she noticed, she says.
    
            “I had this feeling that I should be having some kind of deep, psychological moment of reckoning or something, but I didn’t really feel that,” Victoria said of the experience. “I’ve never wanted to have a kid. I wasn’t torn about this decision.”
    
            When Victoria learned she was pregnant, a big part of the shock came from not thinking she could get pregnant at age 45, she says.
    
            “You hear so much culturally out there about you’re in your forties, are told you’re too old to get pregnant and carry a child to term,” she said. “I feel like I had sort of a false sense of security.”
    
            Victoria joked that she’s “careening toward menopause,” but she says she has not been diagnosed as perimenopausal. 
    
            Her pregnancy news came several months after she was treated for a uterine fibroid, a benign growth, in July 2022, according to medical records. Victoria also tested positive for a PALB2 gene mutation, which can lead to an increased chance of breast cancer, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. She underwent a preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction earlier in 2022, according to medical records provided to CNN.
    
            She says she got an excellent standard of care around her surgeries, but it felt dissonant with her state’s laws around abortion.
    
            “It felt so surreal to get this really high standard of care around my secondary sexual characteristics, but then to have that freeze, slam shut when it comes to reproductive health, it just felt abrupt,” she said.

      Kentucky couple ‘furious’ state abortion laws meant they couldn’t hold their daughter to say goodbye
    ","

    ","
            All Heather and Nick Maberry wanted to do was hold their dead baby, but strict Kentucky abortion laws meant they couldn’t.
    
            They were “furious” that the laws meant they never got to kiss or cuddle their daughter, Willow Rose, or tell her goodbye, Heather said.
    
            “We’ll never know what her face looked like. We’ll never know what it was like to hold her in her arms,” she said. “We’re grieving someone that we’ve never seen.”
    
            The family’s ordeal started in April, when Heather was nearly five months pregnant and they found out their daughter was missing a major part of the brain, a condition called anencephaly. They say their doctors told them she would either be stillborn or die very quickly after birth.
    
            The Maberrys wanted to terminate the pregnancy, but a near-complete abortion ban in their state doesn’t have exceptions for birth defects – even severe ones like anencephaly.
    
            The Maberrys went out of state to end the pregnancy, but their insurance, Kentucky Medicaid, wouldn’t pay for it. They wanted to induce birth so they could hold Willow, but that would’ve cost them tens of thousands of dollars. Instead, they had to settle for a much less expensive surgical procedure – but that procedure does not leave the fetus intact.
    
            “We’re grieving pictures,” Heather said. “We’re grieving a blanket.”
    
            Still distraught after his daughter’s death, Nick sleeps with Willow’s blanket and has not been able to return to his job as a factory worker.
    
            “I was devastated,” he said.
    
            The Maberrys said they’re speaking publicly about their experience in the hopes that their state legislators will listen and revise abortion laws.
    
            Heather wants to protect her three daughters - Madison, 13, Aubrie, 12, and Hadlei, 6 – when they grow up.
    
            “I don’t want my kids to go through what I went through. It just isn’t right,” she said.
    
            CNN reached out to three sponsors of Kentucky abortion laws to ask why fatal fetal anomalies aren’t an exception to the current laws. None of them responded.
    
            Nick and Heather knew each other in high school in Stanton, Kentucky, and then met again years later through mutual friends. They married in March 2022 and settled in their hometown.
    
            Nick, now 34, had four children of his own and Heather, now 32, had three. They wanted a baby together, and she became pregnant, only to miscarry in October.
    
            On December 23, they found out Heather was pregnant again. They considered it “our early Christmas present” and proudly displayed four positive pregnancy tests in a Facebook picture few days later.
    
            “Please keep our little bean in your prayers as we wait for our first Doctor appointment,” Heather wrote. “Everything seems to be going good so far. The girls and us are so excited.”
    
            Struck with hyperemesis gravidarum – severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy – Heather was so sick that she had to stop working as a substitute teacher and was hospitalized for several days.
    
            “I was in the bed all the time,” Heather said. “I’d get maybe one good day out of the week and then the rest of the week would be awful.”
    
            It became difficult to care for her children.
    
            But then she wrote she “got to hear our little baby’s heartbeat,” which was “the most precious gift I could have received.”
    
            Still, the hyperemesis was overwhelming.
    
            “This is pure HELL!!!” she wrote on Facebook.
    
            Then came the anencephaly diagnosis in April, when Heather was 20 weeks pregnant.
    
            “Please keep Nick, me, and our girls in your prayers. We just received the worst news about our baby girl,” she wrote on Facebook and included an ultrasound image. “This is our baby girl, Willow Rose. We love you so very much!!!” She added three emojis: a heart, a rose and a crying face.
    
            Heather’s obstetrician referred them to maternal-fetal medicine specialists at the University of Kentucky, 45 minutes away in Lexington. A report from there the following week laid it out in stark terms: “Anencephaly was confirmed.”
    
            “It was just like a kick in the stomach,” Heather said.
    
            The prognosis for a baby with anencephaly is dire. The National Institutes of Health says that “if the infant is not stillborn, it will usually die within a few hours or days after birth.”
    
            A medical journal article about anencephaly says it is “incompatible with life but not with love.”
    
            That’s how the Maberrys felt: They loved their daughter and did not want her to suffer. They wanted to terminate the pregnancy for Willow’s sake - and for Heather’s. Her hyperemesis wasn’t abating, and she wanted to return to work and to caring for her three children. There was another health concern: Heather had high blood pressure, and continuing the pregnancy could make it dangerously high. While she was willing to take that risk for a live baby, Willow was not going to live.
    
            “I don’t feel like carrying her was an option. Period,” Heather said.
    
            Since Kentucky Medicaid wouldn’t cover the procedure, the Maberrys sought help from organizations that support abortion and from family and friends, but they still couldn’t raise enough for an induction.
    
            A clinic in Chicago agreed to do a surgical procedure called a dilation and evacuation for free, and organizations that support abortion rights paid for their travel expenses, Heather said.
    
            She said the procedure was “a nightmare” and “the worst pain ever” – much more painful than giving birth to her daughters.
    
            The Maberrys said the clinic wouldn’t give them Willow’s remains, which they wanted to cremate. Her medical records from there state that “major fetal parts and placental tissue were identified and the specimen was prepared for disposal.”
    
            The clinic, Family Planning Associates Medical Group of Chicago, declined to comment.
    
            With no remains, with no memories of holding Willow, the family has a baby blanket and some clothing they’d bought for her, a stuffed elephant with a recording inside of her heartbeat and prints of her feet taken at the clinic.
    
            “I wanted to be induced so that we could hold her, so we could see her, so we’d have one memory,” Heather said. “I would have been able to spend just a little bit of time with her.”
    
            “We’re grieving pictures. We’re grieving footprints,” Heather said. “We’ll never know what she looks like. We’ll never know what it was like to hold her.”

      Amy Olson: What to eat at a golf major when you’re seven months pregnant – peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
    ","

    ","
            In just two months’ time, Amy Olson is set to become a mother. But before she embraces parenthood, Olson has a golf tournament to try and win – the US Women’s Open, no less.
    
            “One of my longest dreams has been to be a professional golfer on the LPGA Tour and the other one is to be a mom,” Olson told CNN ahead of the major, which for the first time in its 104-year history is at California’s fabled Pebble Beach course.
    
            “I feel incredibly blessed to be able to do both of them and this week just feels like the culmination of those two dreams,” added Olson, who is one of the 156-player field teeing off on Thursday.
    
            The American announced her and husband Grant’s impending addition to the family after stamping her ticket to the 78th edition of the major with an impressive qualifying performance in Minnesota at the end of May.
    
            Olson had just one request for the tournament’s organizers: to have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches waiting for her at Pebble Beach. Demands suitably satisfied, the 30-year-old will turn her attention to what will be the 194th tournament appearance – and 35th major start – of a 10-year professional career.
    
            After the US Open ends, her maternity leave will begin.
    
            “Women do this all the time,” Olson said. “I want other women who have gone through this that don’t get the cameras on them as they go about their job, as they go about what they do every single day while pregnant, I just want pregnancy and life to be celebrated.
    
            “I love that people are acknowledging that it’s hard but it’s possible. I hope that when other women see me they feel like, ‘you know what, I can do it too.’”
    
            While pregnant, Olson’s workouts have altered drastically, both in format and intensity. Her swing has transformed to be in tune with her body, with Olson using the example of an ice skater to illustrate the change.
    
            When a figure skater wants to turn faster, they bring their arms in, according to Olson. When slowing down is the aim, the arms go out. With the emergence of a baby bump, Olson’s swing has slowed, cutting the distance of her shots in the process.
    
            “As a professional athlete you are very selfish – everything’s about you, everything depends on your schedule and your fitness,” added Olson, who is due to give birth in mid-September.
    
            “When you become a mom, all of sudden there’s another human that’s far more important than you and doesn’t care that you have a tee time or have something else going on – they need to eat, they need to sleep.
    
            “But I think that’s created that way because we all need that selfishness driven out of us and kids are the perfect way to do it.”
    
            Yet Olson also sees changes beyond her own life, in attitudes towards athlete pregnancy. Examples of sportswomen balancing their careers with childbirth – in the periods before and after pregnancy – are abundant in golf and a host of other sports.
    
            Amateur Brenda Corrie-Kuehn was eight months pregnant when she teed off at the 2001 US Women’s Open, with playing partner Jennifer Greggain well into her second trimester. Just one week later, Corrie-Kuehn’s daughter Rachel was born.
    
            In 2018, Stacy Lewis played the same tournament while four months pregnant. One year later, Nike made further adjustments to its maternity policy to ensure female athletes would not be “adversely impacted financially for pregnancy” after various high-profile athletes criticized its previous policies.
    
            “One of the things that I’ve not ever wanted to buy into is that pregnancy is somehow a disease,” Olson said. “I’m not ill, I’m not sick, I’m pregnant – my body is made to do this.
    
            “I think being an athlete, in a lot of ways, I’m incredibly fortunate because fitness has been part of my life just naturally and I think it’s helped the pregnancy go well. In some ways, yes, it impedes your career – I wouldn’t recommend anyone just gaining 25 pounds for performance in golf – but I also think there’s a mindset of gaining a little perspective and balance in new life recognizing there are different seasons.
    
            “There’s a season for us as women to pursue a career, to pursue a passion or a dream we’ve had since childhood, but there’s also a time to become a mother and you don’t want to look back at the end of your life and realize that I sacrificed one of these at the exclusion of the other.”
    
            This week will mark Olson’s seventh start at the US Women’s Open, a tournament she came within a whisker of winning three years ago and one touched by tragedy.
    
            A shot off the lead heading into the last 18 holes, all focus on chasing a first major evaporated on the eve of the final round when Olson’s father-in-law unexpectedly died Saturday night.
    
            Overcome with grief, the North Dakota-born golfer stayed within striking distance of the championship, only to be leapfrogged late on when South Korean A Lim Kim birdied her final three holes to tie the record for the largest comeback ever seen at the major.
    
            Olson finished tied runner-up, just one stroke behind. Alongside a second-placed finish at the 2018 Evian Championship, it remains the closest she has ever been to a major – or LPGA Tour – crown.
    
            “That tournament was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, having to compete in the middle of overwhelming grief that was extremely sudden,” Olson recalled.
    
            “The biggest thing I learned is that you just have to take one step at a time, one shot at a time.
    
            You can’t get ahead of yourself and win the battles of what’s coming up over the next hour or the next few days.
    
            “You can’t do it all at once – you just have to stay in the moment and fight the battle that is right in front of you. I think that’s a lesson we can all learn.”
    
            This week, history beckons at a landmark tournament. Women’s golf’s oldest major is finally touching down at Pebble Beach, a course that has already captivated Olson with its beauty.
    
            The question is, should a fairytale come to life and Olson lifts the trophy come Sunday, will it somehow be worked into the baby’s name?
    
            “I think we’ll deal with that if that opportunity comes,” Olson laughed.

      Under strict abortion law, Texas had nearly 10,000 more births than expected in last nine months of 2022, research suggests

    ","
            A strict abortion law that took effect in Texas in 2021 may have led to nearly 10,000 more births than expected in the last nine months of 2022, according to research published in the journal JAMA.
    
            Texas Senate Bill 8, which banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy with few exceptions, took effect nearly 10 months before the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade and revoked the federal right to abortion.
    
            For their study, published last week, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health analyzed years of birth records to understand how the state law may have affected local trends.
    
            Using data from other states and from Texas in years prior to the new law, they established a version of what birth trends in Texas would have probably looked like without the law and compared that with the actual number of births reported.
    
            They found that from April to December 2022, the first months that would have reflected the effects of the policy change, there were about 297,000 total births: about 3% more than the 287,000 births that would have been expected without the law.
    
            “Texas is really unique in that it is one of the states that had one of the higher abortion rates – and, because of the population size, a relatively large number of abortions,” said Suzanne Bell, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University and co-author of the research. “At first blush, seeing the number was higher than I might have anticipated or hoped it might be.”
    
            But the 3% increase is relatively in line with what other research predicted might happen, she said.
    
            “There were still a lot of people who were going further afield for abortion care or who were self-managing their abortion,” said Bell, who studies patterns of contraceptive use and abortion. “But our results suggest that not everyone was able to overcome those barriers, and many were forced an unwanted or unsafe pregnancy to term.”
    
            Experts say that it’s tough to use these findings to project what the broader effects of the Dobbs decision might be.
    
            Earlier research found that the number of Texas residents who traveled out of state for an abortion spiked after the state’s Senate bill took effect, but that may not be an option for as many people under Dobbs, as many neighboring states – more than a dozen states nationwide – have also enacted abortion bans.
    
            “Now, those people are traveling much more, and those trips are getting longer, and there’s definitely a possibility that births in Texas or another state with restrictions could be larger in a post-Dobbs time,” Bell said.
    
            “During this period, there’s also growing knowledge of self-managed abortion using medication and an outpouring of support to access resources. Whether that is sustainable – and how much it will offset the restrictions – is yet to be determined.”
    
            Other factors may affect birth trends, too.
    
            Poor policies around paid family leave and options for child care create challenges for many in the United States, and that hasn’t changed post-Dobbs, said Beth Jarosz, a demographer and program director with the nonprofit Population Reference Bureau who focuses on child well-being.
    
            “With the end of stimulus payments and some pandemic-era social network programs, birth rates may decline because people don’t feel like they have the resources to properly care for kids,” said Jarosz, who was not involved with the new Johns Hopkins research. “Will birth rates fall faster because of that or rise faster because of more restrictive abortion access? The implications are anyone’s guess.”
    
            Much research suggests that the impacts of restricted access to abortion care will be felt unequally, with the ability to seek abortion care intersecting with poverty, racism and other sociodemographic factors. Bell says that she and her fellow researchers continue to explore those demographic differences, but she stresses the importance of focusing on the individual experience, too.
    
            “People who are denied a needed abortion experience a range of negative impacts on their physical and mental health,” she said. “It’s hard to imagine the short- and long-term implications of a personal trajectory that may have been rerouted for the 9,799 people who were denied an abortion under SB8.”

      Opinion: The warning for Democrats in the recent Supreme Court rulings
    ","
			Opinion by David Mark
		","
  Published
        6:31 AM EDT, Thu July 6, 2023
    ","
            In the runup to the 2024 elections, Democrats plan to put the Supreme Court on trial. President Joe Biden and Democratic allies already have made the high court’s 6-3 conservative majority a political punching bag, a strategy spurred on by the justices’ landmark decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade and its constitutional guarantee of access to abortion.
    
            But that approach may have its limits, as a pair of high-profile, end-of-term Supreme Court opinions shows. The high court last Thursday ruled that colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admission, and on Friday it struck down Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.
    
            Both cases were decided 6-3, with appointees of Republican presidents in the majority and Democrat-chosen justices in the minority. And both outraged Democratic lawmakers.
    
            “This is not a normal court,” Biden said on Thursday in response to a question a CNN reporter shouted at him shortly after the Supreme Court ruling was issued. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut put a finer point on it on Friday. “This Supreme Court: Six right wing politicians, masquerading as judges, gleefully imposing their politics on the country by fiat,” he tweeted.
    
            The problem for Democrats, though, is that the court’s views on the higher education issues at hand are likely more in line with voters than their own. Though their political battle plan to demonize the Supreme Court has until now been largely successful, Democrats are poised to make a major miscalculation if they assume this year’s decisions will push more people against the court and therefore further into Democratic arms.
    
            It’s understandable why Democrats think they have an opening. On the eve of the Roe reversal just over one year ago (but after a leak to the press meant that voters already knew its fate), confidence in the court “reached a new low in Gallup’s nearly 50-year trend,” the polling outlet wrote. “Twenty-five percent of U.S. adults say they have ‘a great deal’ or ‘quite a lot’ of confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court, down from 36% a year ago and five percentage points lower than the previous low recorded in 2014.”
    
            The most recent installment of the General Social Survey also found confidence in the Supreme Court in 2022 had sunk to its lowest point in at least 50 years, with just 18% of Americans saying they have a great deal of confidence in the court.
    
            But Democrats shouldn’t take that as carte blanche to beat up on any decision the Supreme Court makes that they don’t like. Their support of affirmative action and student loan forgiveness are a case in point.
    
            Consider that in the nation’s preeminent blue bastion of California, Biden romped to victory against Trump. Yet on the same ballot, voters rejected 57%-43% a measure repealing California’s 1996 ban on affirmative action. Biden routed Trump in Washington state as well, but a year earlier voters rejected a ballot measure to reverse the state’s 1998 ban on considering applicants’ race in admissions.
    
            Years-long polling shows views on affirmative action are mixed, but that support for the policy declines as questions become more specific. Just Sunday, a snap ABC News/Ipsos poll after the high court struck down affirmative action found that 52% of Americans approved of the decision, while only 32% disapproved (16% didn’t know).
    
            The Biden student loan proposal has found more support in polling than affirmative action generally does, yet it still doesn’t garner a majority. And its support resides much more with young people than older Americans – and the latter vote at a much higher rate.
    
            On these two issues, the GOP also benefits from having sound-bite-ready rebuttals to liberal criticism – easily digestible and familiar lines that boil down complex public policy issues. In the conservative view, justices finally put an end to the “reverse discrimination” of affirmative action, a characterization going back to the 1970s.
    
            Conservative support for the Supreme Court’s student debt ruling, meanwhile, was neatly encapsulated by the phrase, “You take out a loan, you pay it back,” which Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, a Republican presidential candidate, tweeted on Friday. His refrain is more likely to stick in voters’ minds than Democrats’ complicated formulations about the skyrocketing costs of college education and how student loan relief fits into potential solutions.
    
            This isn’t to say that Supreme Court rulings can’t be fertile ground for Democratic political assaults in the Biden era. But it is to say that the party has to pick its spots, and that blanket condemnations that the court rules “by fiat” or isn’t “normal” could backfire.
    
            Where the Democrats can more confidently harness Supreme Court discontent is on the issue of reproductive freedom. The opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson overturning Roe elicited almost immediate political support for the Democrats’ position last year. Moreover, political professionals widely credited the Dobbs decision with prodding Democratic voters, angry at the court’s ruling, to turn out to prevent what had been expected to be a red wave during the 2022 midterm elections.
    
            Another test of the political winds on Democratic campaign plans over abortion comes this summer through an effort to enshrine abortion rights in Ohio’s constitution. If deemed to have enough valid signatures, the deadline for which was Wednesday, the proposal would go before Ohio voters in November. But anti-abortion forces are holding a special election in early August to raise the threshold for passing an amendment to the state constitution from a simple majority to 60% in a clear effort to stop the amendment’s passage.
    
            In Wisconsin and other battleground states, Democrats are already making abortion a front-and-center issue in US Senate campaigns even though Republicans have yet to pick candidates in some places. There’s reason to think this could be effective. In April, Democrat-backed candidate Janet Protasiewicz won a Wisconsin state Supreme Court seat by leaning into her support for abortion in campaign ads.
    
            The Supreme Court’s abortion ruling will undoubtedly continue to be a tool in the Democratic Party’s political arsenal. But with the high court’s term now over and the 2024 election season on the horizon, Democrats find themselves in the position of having their attacks on the conservative majority at least somewhat neutralized. That’s a political blow for Democrats, if not a fatal one.

      Ohio’s showdown over abortion rights intensifies as group files signatures for ballot measure
    ","
			By Eric Bradner and Jeff Zeleny, CNN

    ","
            Ohio is poised to become the next major abortion battleground after groups seeking to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution on Wednesday submitted hundreds of thousands of petition signatures to the secretary of state’s office. 
    
            If certified, those 710,000 signatures – nearly 300,000 more than state law requires – would place the proposed amendment on ballots in November alongside municipal and school board elections across the state. 
    
            The statewide vote would come the year after two of Ohio’s neighboring states – deep-red Kentucky and the political battleground of Michigan – supported abortion rights in their own ballot measures. 
    
            It would position Ohio, traditionally a presidential swing state that has shifted in the GOP’s favor in recent years, as the latest test of voters’ attitudes ahead of a 2024 presidential election in which the debate over abortion rights could play a central role in both the Republican primary and the general election. 
    
            “We know that Ohioans, just like our neighbors in Michigan and Kentucky – when they have the opportunity to vote for abortion access, they will,” said Lauren Blauvelt, vice president of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio. 
    
            Abortion rights advocates on Wednesday said they were pulled into politics in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision last June to overturn Roe v. Wade’s long-standing federal abortion protections and return the issue to the states. 
    
            “I was never very political before all this started last year,” said Dr. Aziza Wahby, a Cleveland dermatologist who has become active over the last year with Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights, a group that was part of the effort to gather signatures. “This has made me pay more attention and I think it will do the same for others.”
    
            The proposed amendment in Ohio would ensure “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s reproductive decisions.” It could make Ohio the only state with a ballot measure on abortion rights this year.
    
            Local officials have until July 20 to verify the signatures, with Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose having final approval to place the issue on this fall’s ballots by July 25.
    
            Before the November election, though, is another key vote: an August 8 special election set by Ohio’s Republican-dominated legislature, in which voters will decide whether to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution from the current simple majority to 60%. 
    
            The debate over the constitutional amendment and the change to the amendment process has galvanized both sides of the abortion fight.
    
            After filing U-Haul truckloads of petition signatures Wednesday, abortion rights advocates complained that the special election was slated for a moment when families will be wrapping up summer vacations and preparing for the start of school – a period when the state’s voters are not used to casting ballots. 
    
            “And they’re doing that on purpose because they know that their agenda is not the agenda of Ohioans,” said Kellie Copeland, the executive director of Pro-Choice Ohio. 
    
            Amy Fogel, who said she became awakened to politics during the Trump era and joined the grassroots group Red Wine and Blue, has spent months helping collect signatures for the citizen-led initiative for the November ballot. She said she was “absolutely heartbroken” when the August special election was approved by the Republican supermajority in the statehouse.
    
            “It was just a blatant power grab to take away the majority vote of Ohioans,” Fogel said.
    
            She said she and other volunteers would not be deterred by the new hurdle.
    
            “We started out telling people to vote in November and now we have to tell them to make sure you plan an absentee ballot, vote early, or show up at the polls on August 8,” Fogel said. “You have to vote ‘No,’ to protect the Ohio constitution and majority vote in August and then ‘Yes,’ in November.”
    
            It is confusing, she said, by design.
    
            Amy Natoce, the press secretary for Protect Women Ohio, the coalition working to defeat the abortion rights ballot measure in November, dismissed suggestions that a special election in August was in any way undemocratic because of concerns over historically low voter turnout in the summer.
    
            “There is no time like the present to protect Ohio’s constitution,” Natoce said in an interview. “Ohioans should be reminded of the fact that this is allowing them to determine how their constitution is amended. We’ve seen the other side saying one person, one vote, this takes away the people’s vote. Not at all.”
    
            For the next month, both campaigns will be unfolding across Ohio – on “Issue 1,” to raise the threshold of support needed to change the constitution, and on the November ballot measure on abortion. From door-to-door canvassing to a multi-million dollar television ad campaign, both sides are intensifying their efforts ahead of the August and November elections.
    
            “We’re going to continue in all 88 counties across Ohio,” Natoce said. “But we have to move ahead as if it will be on the ballot in November.”
    
            Two former Republican governors, Bob Taft and John Kasich, have come out against the August 8 special election, saying such a consequential change to state law shouldn’t happen during a low-turnout summer election.
    
            “I just think it’s a major mistake to approve or disapprove such a change at the lowest-turnout election that we have,” Taft said at a forum in Dayton last week. “This is a kind of change that really needs to be considered by all the people who go out and vote in a presidential election.”

      Man accused of raping and impregnating child in Ohio is sentenced to life in prison after guilty plea

    ","
            A man accused of impregnating an Ohio child – a girl who then went to Indiana for an abortion in a case that became a flashpoint in debates about post-Roe v. Wade abortion rights – was sentenced to life in prison  Wednesday after pleading guilty to rape, according to court documents.
    
            Gerson Fuentes, 28, pleaded guilty Wednesday to two counts of rape, and was sentenced the same day to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 to 30 years, according to documents from the clerk of courts in Ohio’s Franklin County. 
    
            The girl was 9 when she was raped, according to a court indictment, and was 10 when the pregnancy was ended last summer.
    
            In July, Fuentes admitted during a police interview through an interpreter that he raped the girl at least twice, authorities said, but later pleaded not guilty to felony rape of a minor. A trial was planned for this year – a trial now avoided through Wednesday’s plea.  
    
            CNN has sought comment from Fuentes’ attorney. 
    
            Fuentes was silent during Wednesday’s court hearing, which was covered by CNN affiliate WSYX. Prosecutors and defense attorneys recommended the sentence in a plea deal, Judge Julie Lynch said in court. 
    
            Agreeing to the sentencing recommendation was a “hard pill for this court to swallow,” Lynch said. “If (the) family hadn’t begged me to take this joint recommendation, this would never be happening,” she said.
    
            The girl’s case drew global attention when an Indianapolis doctor revealed to the Indianapolis Star last summer that she’d just provided abortion services to a 10-year-old Ohio girl. The disclosure of why the girl went to Indiana for the service – days after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the federal right to abortion, thrust that doctor into the national debate over abortion rights in the country.
    
            The physician, Dr. Caitlin Bernard, told CNN last year that she provided abortion services to the child in late June 2022, and that the girl traveled to Indiana for the procedure because Ohio, after the Roe ruling, generally banned abortions after early cardiac activity is detected, which is around six weeks into a pregnancy. The girl was six weeks and three days into her pregnancy, Bernard said.
    
            At the time of the procedure, Indiana allowed abortions up to 20 weeks after fertilization. The state then passed a law that would ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions for rape or incest or to save the woman’s life, prevent any serious health risk to the woman and for lethal fetal abnormalities. However, that law was temporarily blocked, pending court fights.
    
            Days after Bernard spoke about the case, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said he was investigating the doctor, in part over whether she violated privacy laws by addressing it publicly. 
    
            In May, Indiana’s medical licensing board reprimanded and fined Bernard after it determined the disclosure violated federal and state patient privacy laws.

      Iowa GOP governor calls special session with ‘sole purpose’ of passing abortion restrictions
    ","

    ","
            Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Wednesday that she will convene a special legislative session next week for the sole task of passing abortion restrictions.
    
            The governor’s call for lawmakers to return comes weeks after Iowa’s Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the state’s 6-week abortion ban, deadlocking in a 3-3 vote whether to overturn a lower court decision that deemed the 2018 law unconstitutional.
    
            The special session will convene next Tuesday “with the sole purpose of enacting legislation that addresses abortion and protects unborn lives,” according to a news release from Reynolds’ office.
    
            Reynolds said the state Supreme Court’s order, which left abortion in Iowa legal up to 20 weeks into a pregnancy, “disregards the will of Iowa voters and lawmakers who will not rest until the unborn are protected by law.” 
    
            The 2018 “fetal heartbeat” law sought to prohibit doctors from performing an abortion once early cardiac activity is detected, commonly as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant.
    
            Iowa Justice Thomas Waterman, who voted to leave the block in place, explained in the court’s decision that lifting the block would be akin to bypassing the state legislature, which is now composed of different lawmakers. 
    
            “When the statute was enacted in 2018, it had no chance of taking effect,” Waterman wrote, noting that its supporters anticipated a legal challenge at a time when federal protections for abortion rights remained in effect. 
    
            “To put it politely, the legislature was enacting a hypothetical law,” adding that “uncertainty exists about whether a fetal heartbeat bill would be passed today.” 
    
            Just over a year after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, at least 14 states have now banned or severely restricted access to the procedure, and six have set gestational limits. Most recently, North Carolina’s 12-week ban took effect last week after the Republican-led General Assembly overrode a veto by the state’s Democratic governor.
    
            Iowa Senate Democratic Leader Pam Jochum said in a news release Wednesday that Reynolds’ call for a special session was expected.
    
            “This attack on reproductive healthcare is opposed by a large majority of Iowans,” she added. “Senate Democrats will be fighting for that majority on the Senate floor next week, and we call on every Iowan to join us.”
    
            Mazie Stilwell, director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Iowa, echoed Jochum’s sentiment in a statement, and called the special session “drastic” and “power hungry.”
    
            “A growing majority of Iowans support abortion access,” Stilwell said. “Make no mistake—we are prepared to mobilize supporters across the state to demand state legislators reject any proposed abortion ban or further restrictions on abortion care.”

      Burner phones, savings and travel plans: How parents’ sex and birth control talks with teens changed since end of Roe v. Wade
    ","

    ","
            Parents of teens and preteens say it used to be that they only had to worry about explaining the mechanics of sex and pregnancy to their kids.
    
            But since the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision ended 50 years of protected access to abortions in the United States last year, some families say these discussions now include details that sound straight out of a spy movie, including how to rent out-of-state post office boxes if they end up needing abortion pills, use WiFi in a public place and delete any personal details from phone apps that could track them.
    
            These parents say the shifting legal landscape around reproductive health care has also brought new worries and a sense of urgency to conversations and decisions about birth control that might have been more distant considerations before.
    
            Christine, a mother in southeastern Wisconsin, said she felt “shocked” and “sick” after the Dobbs decision became official. She also sprang into action.
    
            CNN is not using Christine’s last name because she teaches at a Catholic school and feared that sharing her story could put her job in jeopardy. CNN isn’t using the names of her children to protect their privacy.
    
            Two of Christine’s children are living at home: a teenage son and a daughter who is in her early 20s and moved in with her parents to save money while she finishes her degree.
    
            Christine sees Wisconsin as a purple state that prides itself on its level-headedness. She says the horror of Dobbs was bad enough, but then a state law that had been on the books since the mid-1800s took effect, making it illegal to perform abortions except to save the life of a pregnant person. As a result, many providers have stopped offering terminations while legal challenges wind their way through the courts.
    
            For Christine, as a parent, the biggest change since Dobbs is the feeling that she urgently needed to protect her kids. “Like I would do to help keep a child from backing off a cliff. That’s kind of where I feel it’s at,” she said.
    
            She was a classroom teacher for 20 years, and “I’ve seen so many good kids make one bad choice that just changes their trajectory forever,” she said.
    
            Christine realized she needed to urgently stress the risks to her son and one of his friends. The friend, she said, was “making bad choices.”
    
            “I did lay into him,” she said, something she never would have done before the Supreme Court’s decision.
    
            She sat both boys down and told them things were different now. The stakes for having sex were higher.
    
            “I said, ‘you guys basically have to have a job if you want to have sex these days,’ ” she said.
    
            She told the boys that if they were having sex, they also need some savings in case they needed to pay for their girlfriends to travel out of state to get an abortion.
    
            “ ‘Kid, you better have two grand saved up, because guess what, Plan B doesn’t always work, right? And condoms don’t always work,’ ” she said. “ ‘Because you’re gonna have to go out of state, and you’re gonna have to go there stay for three days, so unless you’ve got that, I would best be making better choices.’ “
    
            Christine said her son’s friend was in shock. “Nobody had ever talked to him about that,” she said.
    
            For her 23-year-old daughter, the issues and the conversation were different. Her daughter has been on birth control since middle school for medical issues. In November, when she needed to renew her Nexplanon – an implant in her arm that releases hormones continuously for three years – the first provider she made an appointment with wouldn’t do it.
    
            Right around that time, a conservative group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine and others sued to revoke the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, a medication that’s used in abortion pills, creating a new front in the fight for access to reproductive health care.
    
            After nurses asked Christine’s daughter a series of baffling questions about her age, her plans to have children and whether she had considered more natural methods of birth control, her daughter said, they refused to change her implant.
    
            “They told me, ‘we’re going to have to hold off on this, or you may have to go find somewhere elsewhere, because this is not something that we are able to do as of right now.’ ”
    
            Christine’s daughter isn’t sure why they refused. She said she was intimidated by the visit and afraid to probe further. Her best guess is that even though there are no legal restrictions on birth control in the US, this practice might have been anticipating some.
    
            “I think that they were scared of the repercussions … of a potential legislation that could have been implemented within the next few months and be royally sued. Which is absolutely ridiculous,” her daughter said.
    
            She was eventually able to find another provider who did the procedure, but the experience rattled her and her mom.
    
            Christine said she and her daughter also made a plan for what she might have to do if she needed an abortion.
    
            “We talked about how you need a burner phone” so it couldn’t be traced, Christine said. They talked about what states she could travel to if she needed a procedure and how to get abortion medications mailed if she needed them. “If that was the case, how could you get a P.O. box outside of Wisconsin to get it forwarded to you? We went through all of this,” Christine said.
    
            They also discussed “on your phone, deleting any apps that track your cycle and how to handle medical bills,” Christine said.
    
            In Louisiana, where the Dobbs decision triggered a state law that banned abortion at any stage of gestation, except to save the life of the mother, Adam and his wife were discussing what they should do for their 15-year-old daughter, an honors student who competes on her school’s robotics team.
    
            Adam shared his family’s story on the condition that CNN use only his first name to protect their privacy and safety.
    
            “She’s a great student,” he said of his daughter. “She’s headed to college. She’s already made a 32 on the ACT, and she just finished her sophomore year in high school. So she’s got a bright future ahead of her, and we didn’t want this to be something that could derail that.”
    
            They had planned to address birth control around age 16, he said, but after Dobbs, they worried that states might go after birth control access next.
    
            “So we had talked about it with her before, and the decision to get birth control was really independent from the whole [end of] Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade thing just moved up the timeline,” Adam said.
    
            When they tried to get an appointment to get her an intrauterine device, or IUD, which releases a low dose of hormones as a form of long-acting birth control, there was already a two-month wait, Adam says – suggesting that they weren’t the only ones who were thinking along the same lines.
    
            Adam’s wife says that as they watched the news with their daughter after the Supreme Court ruling, they felt like they couldn’t wait.
    
            “We just felt like our choices were taken away – as a female, over our body – and what’s gonna come next?” she said.
    
            Their daughter says she feels more secure having the IUD, which should last until she is 22. They hope it will get her through at least an undergraduate degree.
    
            “Whether she wants a new one put in or what, she’ll be in a different place,” Adam’s wife said, and can make the decision on her own.
    
            These kinds of open and direct discussions about sexual health don’t happen in every family, of course.
    
            For teens who can’t talk to their parents about birth control, a federal program called Title X, which provides family planning services at little or no cost to low-income patients and adolescents, has been a lifeline. But now that’s under threat, too.
    
            On the website of the nonprofit legal group Jane’s Due Process, a Texas-based organization that until recently helped teens access birth control without having to tell their parents, a banner pops up: “Safety Alert: Computer use can be monitored and is impossible to completely clear. If you need to exit this website in a hurry, hit the ESCAPE key twice.”
    
            According to the reproductive health nonprofit Guttmacher Institute, 24 states require parents to give their permission before minors can access birth control, except under certain circumstances.
    
            Texas is one of the most restrictive states in that regard. There, anyone under 18 needs their parent’s permission to get birth control – even if they’re already a parent themselves.
    
            Until recently, there was an important loophole, however. Teens could get free, confidential contraception at Title X clinics in Texas and across the country.
    
            In December, District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled that Title X was violating parental rights and state law by allowing minors to get birth control without their parent’s consent.
    
            His ruling is being appealed. In the meantime, Title X clinics in Texas have stopped providing birth control to teens unless they get their parents’ OK. Advocates say it’s a devastating decision for the state, which ranks ninth in the nation for the rate of teen pregnancies, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Graci D’Amore, senior manager of direct services at Jane’s Due Process, said that after the Dobbs decision, Texas teens could still get birth control through Title X. Immediately, her group got an influx of calls and texts from teens looking for help getting to Title X clinics, which are concentrated in cities.
    
            “Now, we’ve stopped advertising because there’s just no way for them to get it,” she said. Instead, she says, the group is raising money to help teens travel to other states for abortions.
    
            “The more effective ways of preventing pregnancy are being completely taken away from teens,” she said. “Excuse my language, but it’s f**king atrocious and unjust, and teens, especially Texas teens, deserve better.”
    
            One development that could ease access significantly for teens would be the availability of birth control pills over the counter. In May, experts who advise the FDA on its drug approvals voted unanimously that the FDA should green-light Opill, an over-the-counter option for hormonal birth control. The agency is expected to announce its decision later this summer.
    
            If approved, the drugmaker says, Opill could be on pharmacy shelves by the end of the year.
    
            Kathleen was a teen mom and swore that she would never let her own kids follow that same path.
    
            “I don’t want my kids to struggle financially like we did through the years,” she said. “I don’t want that. And I feel like I’m protecting multiple generations by choosing to discuss birth control options with my kids.”
    
            She now has three girls and three boys. CNN is using only her first name to protect the family’s privacy.
    
            Among her conservative friends and relatives in Florida, Kathleen drew fire with her decision to get birth control pills for her oldest daughter to help with a medical problem.
    
            To them, she said, getting a teenager birth control was like giving her permission to have sex.
    
            “My mother-in-law, she blamed me. She said, ‘Why would you put her on birth control if she’s not sexually active?’ ”
    
            Her daughter started birth control pills for medical reasons but had significant side effects, and doctors said she needed a different option.
    
            At a follow-up visit with the gynecologist, either her daughter or the doctor shot down one alternative after another. They ultimately left without getting anything.
    
            Three months later, her daughter was pregnant at age 16. According to Kathleen, it happened one of the first times she had sex.
    
            The family agonized for weeks about what to do. Kathleen said her daughter considered all her options but ultimately chose to keep the baby and is comfortable with that decision. The baby is due any day.
    
            Last week, Kathleen asked another daughter who is 15 about what she wanted to do to protect her health and her future. The teen “hasn’t even had a kiss yet,” she says, but she knows how fast things can change.
    
            “It’s more or less like, ‘this is how the world is right now,’ ” Kathleen says she told her. “ ‘This is what your sister has had to face and the situation that she’s in. This is what I’ve had to face being in that same situation, 17 years ago. How do you feel?’ ”
    
            Kathleen says her 15-year-old is strongly against abortion. “She’s my more political child.”
    
            “She did tell my 16-year-old that if she was to get an abortion, that she would never speak to her again,” she said.
    
            Given her beliefs, she said, her middle daughter is choosing to get birth control, hoping she won’t ever have to face the decision herself.
    
            “She doesn’t want the pill because she doesn’t feel like she’ll be reliable taking it,” Kathleen said. “I think she’s more or less leaning towards the implant in the arm.”
    
            Kathleen has also started talking to her youngest daughter, who is in the fifth grade, something she said she never would have considered before Dobbs.
    
            “I’ve already started the conversation, just not as in-depth as I have with my 15-year-old, but more or less about her rights, her choices,” she said.
    
            “I definitely feel like I’ve been pushed, not just because of the laws but the situation that we’re at home,” she said.
    
            For now, she says, she’s working hard to support and protect her kids but knows that even her best efforts can only go so far. “No matter how much you try to teach them and guide them, they make their own decisions.”

      Black maternal deaths keep rising. These doulas want to reverse that grim trend
    ","

            “Sixteen years ago, I almost died giving birth,” Ebonie Karma Tudor said, recalling the birth of her son. “It was just a really traumatic experience.”
    
            It was 2007. Tudor, a Black woman, was 24 years old. During the delivery, she needed two blood transfusions and couldn’t see her son immediately after giving birth to him, she said.
    
            Experiences like Tudor’s are not uncommon, research suggests.
    
            But while labor and delivery are thought to be the most dangerous time in pregnancy, studies show it’s after mother and baby come home when most deaths occur, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
    
            Among pregnancy-related deaths, 53% happened within one week after childbirth to one year postpartum. The same study lists cardiac and coronary conditions as the primary underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths among non-Hispanic Black individuals.
    
            Wealth also does not make much of a difference for Black families. The wealthier a mother is, the more likely they are to survive the first year after childbirth – unless she’s a Black woman, a January study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found.
    
            The study included infants born to first-time mothers in California from 2007 to 2016.
    
            Tudor’s experience inspired her to become a doula – a trained birth worker that provides physical, educational and emotional support for their clients before, during and after childbirth. To some Black mothers, that kind of advocacy could mean life or death. 
    
            The recent death of Olympian Frentorish “Tori” Bowie has once again raised questions about Black maternal health care in the United States.
    
            The track and field athlete died from “complications of childbirth” in early May, according to an autopsy report. The 32-year-old, three-time Olympic medalist, who was found dead in bed, was estimated to be 8 months pregnant. There was evidence she had been “undergoing labor,” an autopsy report released by the Orange County, Florida, Medical Examiner’s Office states.
    
            Her manner of death was ruled natural, and the report found there had been “possible complications,” including “respiratory distress and eclampsia.”
    
            Eclampsia is an especially severe pregnancy-related complication and can happen when a mother’s blood pressure gets too high.
    
            The overall rate of pregnant women dying of delivery-related causes in the hospital appears to have declined significantly – by more than 50% – across the United States in recent years, a new study suggests.
    
            That decline, seen among more than 11 million hospital patients, came over a 13-year period from 2008 through 2021, according to the national study, published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open. But the decrease represents only in-hospital maternal deaths, not the nation’s overall maternal mortality rate, which has been on the rise.
    
            The new study “seems to contradict the data at the national level where maternal mortality is increasing, because most of the women don’t die in the hospital during childbirth; they die after they left the hospital after childbirth,” said Dr. Jean Guglielminotti, an assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center who was not involved in the new study but has conducted research on severe maternal morbidity.
    
            And Black maternal death rates have been steadily rising in the United States for decades. Black mothers are nearly three times as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications as White women with 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021, according to the CDC. The rate among White women was 26.6 per 100,000. Multiple factors contribute to the racial disparities seen in the data, including underlying chronic conditions, structural racism and implicit bias, the CDC found.
    
            Black babies are more likely to die than any other racial or ethnic group, the agency found. They are also far more likely to be born prematurely, setting them up for health issues that could follow through their lives.
    
            “The important thing for me is the advocacy. That’s what was missing in my birthing story,” Tudor said. “I didn’t know that I could say, ‘no.’ I didn’t know that I could switch providers. I didn’t know that I had all these different options.”
    
            Tudor recalled a comment from a doctor when she was pregnant who told her, “You’re a strong girl, you know this isn’t anything for you, you can deal with it.”
    
            After her traumatic birth experience, Tudor became a certified doula in New York City, she said.
    
            Studies have shown treatment of pain in Black patients has been influenced by racial bias. A 2019 study by the American Journal of Emergency Medicine showed Black patients were 40% less likely to be prescribed medication for acute pain. A separate study in 2016 showed racial bias in pain assessment by medical trainees and beliefs that Black and White patients had biological differences like the misconception that Black patients had thicker skin than their White counterparts.  
    
            When working with Black birthing people as a doula, Tudor said, those kind of comments aren’t as common.
    
            “I do notice that once a doula walks in the room, that it’s less likely to happen.”
    
            Tudor was trained by a group called Mama Glow. Based in Brooklyn, Mama Glow is a global maternal health and education platform. It has trained more than 2,500 doulas worldwide, it says. Its two-day Doula Expo is a gathering of birth workers and families prioritizing education, connection and community. 
    
            Mama Glow’s founder, Latham Thomas, likes to call the expo “Coachella for birth workers.”
    
            This year’s expo took place in New York at Hudson Yards. The space was transformed into a festival-like event featuring keynote conversations, live entertainment, a children’s play space and infant feeding lounge. Amid the fun, the expo tackles serious health care issues.
    
            “Black women are telling us that they don’t feel seen, they don’t feel heard; that they feel dismissed, ignored and feel undervalued by our health care system,” Thomas said. “We have people who feel afraid to give birth, that something will happen to them.”
    
            Mama Glow aims to raise awareness about the high death rate of Black mothers and find ways to bring it down.
    
            “It’s really scary, I think, for people to sit with the statistical information, we know what it is. We know it’s alarming, we know that it’s unsettling and yet we still have to make improvements. We still have to build towards a future where birth is safe,” Thomas said.
    
            One of those efforts is an initiative called “Love Delivered.”
    
            Mama Glow and beauty company Carol’s Daughter teamed up to combat high Black maternal mortality rates with the initiative, which provides training to doulas and expands access to doula services by providing grants to Black families.
    
            Cost is one of the major obstacles to hiring doulas. Kiyoko Ray was pregnant with her seventh child when she decided to hire doula Zania Mathis. Cost was a major factor in her decision.
    
            “I felt like I couldn’t afford (a doula), but I wanted it so bad,” Ray said.
    
            Mathis has been working with Ray since early in her pregnancy. Based just outside Atlanta, Mathis says most of her clients live in Georgia – a state with one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the United States, according to the CDC. Georgia ranks sixth in the nation.
    
            Mathis’ own pregnancies have not been without complications.
    
            She is 6 months pregnant with her fourth child – a girl. She’s the mother of twin boys, 7, and a 5-year-old daughter. Both of her previous pregnancies were difficult. Mathis’ younger twin was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for 2 days after his birth; she also experienced pelvic floor damage.
    
            “In the Black community, we’re told we don’t need a doula. It is looked at something as far as luxury goes. Look at the numbers, look at the data. We need doulas more than any other race,” Mathis said.
    
            Research suggests having a doula can be beneficial during childbirth and the postpartum period for both mother and baby. One study published in 2013 by The Journal of Perinatal Education, found expectant mothers who had doulas were four times less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, two times less likely to experience a birth complication, and significantly more likely to initiate breastfeeding compared to those without doula support.
    
            Mathis said she has also seen a lot of close calls in her four years of doula work.
    
            “I’ve seen a mom code. I’ve seen mom’s contractions completely stop,” Mathis said. “I’ve seen a mom completely neglected in active labor, having to wait in the (hospital) waiting room.”
    
            Mathis knows that cost can be a barrier to access when it comes to hiring a doula. She says she will sometimes make exceptions for clients who need her care by offering payment plans or exchanging services because she believes the care she offers is essential – especially for Black mothers. 
    
            Ray, a hairdresser, partially paid for Mathis’ services by styling her hair. “She’s more than a doula,” Ray said. “She became my therapist. She became a friend.”

      Abortion regulations and LGBTQ-related legislation among state laws taking effect Saturday

    ","
            As several state legislative sessions have concluded or are drawing to a close, some of the high-profile legislation enacted by state lawmakers is just taking effect.
    
            Many states saw particularly polarizing sessions, with Democrats and Republican state lawmakers moving in opposite directions on abortion- and LGBTQ-related legislation.
    
            Several GOP-led states moved to advance restrictions on abortion and gender-affirming care, while also tackling controversial issues such as child labor, guns and immigration.
    
            Here are some of the laws that took effect Saturday.
    
            South Dakota 
    
            The prescription and administration of puberty-blocking hormones to transgender minors are now blocked in South Dakota, along with sex hormones and gender transition surgery. 
    
            Health care providers who violate the new law risk civil suits and losing their professional or occupational licenses.
    
            Georgia 
    
            Medical professionals in Georgia are prohibited from providing patients under the age of 18 with hormone therapy or surgery related to gender transition, and a violation of the law may result in the health practitioner’s license being revoked. 
    
            Several families, backed by advocacy groups, filed a lawsuit Thursday against the ban.
    
            Tennessee
    
            A federal judge allowed Tennessee’s ban on gender transition surgical procedures to take effect Saturday, but has temporarily blocked the enforcement of its ban on other gender-affirming treatments such as hormone therapies and puberty blockers. 
    
            The new law specifies that minors who receive care cannot be held liable, but lawsuits could be brought against a minor’s parents “if the parent of the minor consented to the conduct that constituted the violation on behalf of the minor.”
    
            Florida
    
            Teachers, faculty and students in Florida are now restricted from using pronouns of their choice in public schools under a new law. The legislation requires K-12 public schools to define sex as “an immutable biological trait,” and says it is “false” to use a pronoun other than the sex on a person’s birth certification. 
    
            Another provision in the law affirms that sexual orientation and gender identity cannot be taught in schools through eighth grade, codifying a state Board of Education decision to block such topics in all K-12 schools in April. 
    
            Florida’s ban on transgender people from using a government building’s bathroom or changing room that matches their gender identity has also taken effect. The bathroom ban applies in places such as public schools, prisons and state universities. 
    
            North Carolina 
    
            A federal judge on Friday cleared the way for North Carolina’s 12-week ban on most abortions to take effect Saturday. The law provides exceptions in the case of rape or incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks.
    
            The law also prohibits health care providers who object to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in abortion procedures. 
    
            The judge, however, temporarily halted a provision of the bill, which required doctors to document the location of early pregnancies with ultrasound evidence before prescribing a medication abortion. 
    
            Wyoming
    
            The nation’s first ban on medication abortion was set to take effect in Wyoming Saturday, but a district judge blocked the measure last week while legal challenges play out. 
    
            Iowa 
    
            Teenagers in Iowa can now work longer hours with those 16 and older permitted to work the same hours as an adult – provisions that were part of a child labor bill passed in May. The state also no longer requires work permits for minors. 
    
            Florida 
    
            Two other highly criticized bills took effect in Florida. 
    
            One requires private employers with 25 or more employees to check their immigration status in a federal database or risk their employer licenses being suspended. 
    
            The other will allow Florida residents to carry a concealed weapon in public without a government-issued permit.

      Louisiana Democratic governor vetoes bill banning gender-affirming care for minors
    ","

    ","
            Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards has vetoed a ban on gender-affirming care for most minors in the state, the latest Democratic governor to push back on a GOP-led legislature’s efforts to restrict transgender youth’s access to such treatments.    
    
            The move sets the stage for a battle with the legislature’s Republican supermajority, which could vote to override his veto.    
    
            “It is unfathomable to think that in my last few months serving as governor of this state that I would sign into law a bill that categorically denies health care for children and families based on propaganda and misinformation generated by national interest groups,” Edwards, who is term-limited, wrote in a veto letter dated Thursday, saying the bill harms children.
    
            “I assessed the need for this bill based on Louisiana data and facts and read every word of this bill multiple times to determine if there was any possible merit to this bill. There is not,” he continued later.
    
            House Bill 648 would bar those under 18 in Louisiana from receiving gender-affirming surgeries, puberty blocking medications and hormone treatments, and punishes health care professionals that provide them with the revocation of their license for a minimum of two years.  
    
            Doctors who began providing such drug or hormone therapy to a minor before January 1, 2024, would be allowed to continue providing care through December 1, 2024, if they determine that “immediately terminating the minor’s use of the drug or hormone would cause harm to the minor.”   
    
            The bill passed the Republican-led legislature with strong support in early June – with the House voting 75-25 in favor and some Democrats crossing party lines in the Senate to advance the legislation by a vote of 29-10. 
    
            Gender-affirming care spans a range of evidence-based treatments and approaches that benefit transgender and nonbinary people. The types of care vary by the age and goals of the recipient, and are considered the standard of care by many mainstream medical associations.    
    
            Though the care is highly individualized, some children and parents may decide to use reversible puberty suppression therapy. This part of the process may also include hormone therapy that can lead to gender-affirming physical change. Surgical procedures prohibited under the measure, however, are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors.  
    
            No such surgeries were performed on Louisiana minors enrolled in Medicaid from 2017 to 2021, according to a report from the state Department of Health, which found that few minors, between 21 and 57 each year, received chemical treatment during the same time period.   
    
            Proponents of the legislation have expressed concern over long-term outcomes of the treatments. But major medical associations say that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria – a psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align, according to the American Psychiatric Association.  
    
            The issue has become a flashpoint with more than a dozen other states placing bans on gender-affirming care for minors on the books this year, largely in governments with Republican trifectas – though the legality of such laws are being questioned as a federal judge last week struck down a 2021 Arkansas measure. 
    
            Democratic governors have pushed back on Republican-led efforts to restrict the treatments with varying degrees of success – Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly successfully blocked a ban while state lawmakers overrode Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.   
    
            At a news conference following the Louisiana legislative session’s adjournment on June 8, Edwards said it was his “expectation” to veto a slate of anti-LGBTQ bills, including HB 648.  
    
            “I will tell you that on those issues, the judgment of history, I believe, will be very clear. It will be as clear as the judgment of history has been on those who didn’t want civil rights in the 50s, for example. But I am not going to wait until then to say that it’s wrong. My judgment today is that those bills are wrong,” he said. 
    
            Edwards advised Louisianans to “focus on the real problems,” rather than “pick on very small minorities who happen to be comprised of the most vulnerable, fragile children in our state, those most likely to engage in suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. There’s nothing great in that.” 
    
            The governor declined to take action on an anti-trans sports ban last year, claiming at the time that while he opposed the legislation, it was clear to him that lawmakers would move to override him if he issued a veto.    
    
            Republicans again hold strong enough majorities in the state’s House and Senate to override vetoes from the governor after Louisiana’s longest-serving legislator switched in March from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.   
    
            The legislature can consider the bill in a “veto session” where the House and Senate reconvene 40 days after the end of the normal legislative session – which adjourned June 8. To override the veto, supporters of the ban would need a two-thirds majority in both chambers.  
    
            Lawmakers could, however, halt the convening of the veto session “if a majority of the elected members of either house declare in writing that a veto session is unnecessary,” according to state law. 
    
            Republican state Rep. Gabe Firment, the bill’s sponsor, told CNN in a statement ahead of the governor’s action that his “biggest concern is that term-limited state senators will be persuaded by the governor to not show up for a veto override session.”  
    
            “However, grassroots groups and citizens across the state are already mobilizing in anticipation of a gubernatorial veto and the people of Louisiana have made it clear that our kids are worth fighting for,” he added. 
    
            The No. 2 Republican in the state House, Rep. Tanner D. Magee, said in a statement to CNN last week that whether GOP lawmakers will follow through with a veto session was “unclear right now. We are still talking to members and assessing their desires.” 
    
            Not all Republicans, however, have supported HB648. The bill was temporarily stalled in a state Senate committee last month, with the panel’s Republican chairman casting a tie-breaking vote against the legislation.   
    
            “I’ve always in my heart of hearts, believed that a decision should be made by a patient and a physician,” state Sen. Fred Mills said, explaining his vote.  
    
            The state Senate revived the bill the following week by recalling the bill from Mills’ committee and reassigning it to another, where it was passed.

      Judge clears way for North Carolina 12-week abortion ban to take effect, blocks one provision of law
    ","

    ","
            A federal judge will allow a ban on most abortions in North Carolina after 12 weeks of pregnancy to go into effect on Saturday but temporarily blocked one provision included in the law.
    
            US District Court Judge Catherine Eagles on Friday issued a narrow temporary restraining order putting on hold a requirement for doctors to document the location of early pregnancies with ultrasound evidence before prescribing a medication abortion. 
    
            “Sometimes patients can get to us very early in their pregnancy. … Our standard practice is to evaluate the patient, make sure that medication abortion is reasonable and safe, and then go ahead and start the medication abortion process even if we cannot yet see the pregnancy because the pregnancy is so early,” explained Dr. Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. “The way the law is written, it does not allow us to do that, and that is the piece that the judge enjoined – not whether or not we have to perform an ultrasound, but whether or not we have to see the pregnancy within the uterus before we can start the medication abortion process.”
    
            The order blocks that provision for two weeks, to allow for further review. 
    
            All of the other provisions will be allowed to take effect as scheduled. Eagles noted that the majority of the other measures raised in the lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers had been clarified by a bill signed into law by Gov. Roy Cooper on Thursday. 
    
            That legislation made significant changes to the sweeping abortion legislation – such as removing conflicting language that set a separate 10-week cut off for medication abortion and clarifications on laws on fetal homicide, doctor reporting requirements and rules surrounding residents who obtain abortions out of state. 
    
            Separately, court documents show that both plaintiff and defendant attorneys, as well as state lawmakers, agreed further to a stipulation that that the law will not penalize someone ” “who advises, procures, causes, or otherwise assists someone in obtaining a lawful out-of-state abortion.”  For example, people cannot be arrested for driving a person who is past 12-weeks in pregnancy to obtain an abortion in another state where it is legal. 
    
            “Starting tomorrow, North Carolinians will no longer be able to access abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy, and they will be forced to endure medically unnecessary restrictions that make it harder to get the health care they need even before 12 weeks,” said Jenny Black, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. 
    
            “Our legal challenge forced General Assembly leadership to clean up their mess of a bill, but we never should have had to sue to get clarity on how to comply with this law,” Black continued. “Planned Parenthood South Atlantic remains committed to providing abortion care to as many people as possible within the unjust and inhumane confines of this abortion ban, and we encourage anyone in need of abortion care to contact us as soon as possible for help navigating this new reality.”
    
            As CNN previously reported, legal filings from attorneys representing Republican leadership appeared to confirm the amendment was written to address the Planned Parenthood lawsuit, which flagged multiple inconsistencies and potential constitutional violations in the original text of the abortion law, Senate Bill 20.
    
            Cooper, a Democrat who vetoed the abortion law before the legislature’s Republican supermajority voted to override it last month, issued a statement on his decision to sign the bill containing the revisions. 
    
            “In addition to being dangerous for women, the rushed abortion ban was so poorly written that it is causing real uncertainty for doctors and other health care providers. This bill is important to clarify the rules and provide some certainty, however we will continue fighting on all fronts the Republican assault on women’s reproductive freedom,” said Cooper on Thursday. 
    
            Under current state law, which ends after Friday, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. 
    
            The new law, effective Saturday, bans any licensed physician from performing surgical abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It provides limited exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks.
    
            Under the bill, the procedure could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines an abortion is necessary to avert a patient’s death – “not including psychological or emotional conditions.”
    
            The new law prohibits health care providers who object to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.
    
            It also creates several new reporting requirements, adds multiple in-person appointments and examinations by physicians seeking to prescribe or administer abortion-inducing drugs and will prohibit people within the state from mailing such drugs to a pregnant woman. 
    
            There are certain changes included in the abortion law that are not set to go into effect until October, such as possible clinic licensing regulations and a requirement that any abortion performed after 12 weeks for a patient with a qualified exception be done in a hospital.

      Why Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote about babysitters in her student loan opinion
    ","
			By Tierney Sneed

  Published
        3:11 PM EDT, Fri June 30, 2023
    ","
            Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a concurrence to Friday’s ruling striking down President Joe Biden’s student debt forgiveness plan, defended the Supreme Court conservative majority’s use of a controversial legal theory and – deploying analogies concerning babysitters and grocery store owners – laid out how she believed the doctrine should be used in the future.
    
            The so-called major questions doctrine says that executive branch agencies only have authority to take aggressive unilateral action of significant political or economic importance if Congress explicitly gives it such power. 
    
            In the student loan case, the 6-3 conservative majority, including Barrett, concluded that the student loan law in question did not give the secretary of education the power to cancel broad swaths of loans.
    
            Barrett expounded on the utility of the doctrine by spelling out scenarios where, she writes, context is key to interpreting the limits of authority Congress has delegated to an agency.
    
            The grocer hypothetical concerned a store owner who typically keeps 200 apples on hand then instructs a clerk to “go to the orchard” to buy more apples.
    
            “Though this grant of apple-purchasing authority sounds unqualified, a reasonable clerk would know that there are limits,” she wrote. 
    
            “For example, if the grocer usually keeps 200 apples on hand, the clerk does not have actual authority to buy 1,000 – the grocer would have spoken more directly if she meant to authorize such an out-of-the-ordinary purchase,” Barrett wrote. “A clerk who disregards context and stretches the words to their fullest will not have a job for long.”
    
            A second hypothetical centered on a babysitter who took the kids to an amusement park for the weekend, having been given a parent’s credit card and told: “Make sure the kids have fun.”
    
            “Emboldened, the concurring babysitter takes the kids on a road trip to an amusement park, where they spend two days on rollercoasters and one night in a hotel,” Barrett writes.
    
            But whether the babysitter misinterpreted the okay she got to use the parent’s credit card may depend on other obvious or even less obvious facts, Barrett said. 
    
            “Was the babysitter’s trip consistent with the parent’s instruction? Maybe in a literal sense, because the instruction was open-ended. But was the trip consistent with a reasonable understanding of the parent’s instruction? Highly doubtful.”
    
            Barrett wrote that, under one set of contextual facts, the babysitter’s move would seem to overreach on an instruction that was meant for a trip to the “local ice cream parlor or movie theater, not on a multiday excursion to an out-of-town amusement park.” 
    
            But under another set of circumstances – “maybe the parent left tickets to the amusement park on the counter” or perhaps the parent told there was $2,000 budgeted for weekend entertainment – the babysitter’s move to go the amusement park would seem a “reasonable” understanding on what the parent had approved, Barrett said.
    
            “If a parent were willing to greenlight a trip that big, we would expect much more clarity than a general instruction to ‘make sure the kids have fun,’” she wrote.
    
            “In my view, the major questions doctrine grows out of these same commonsense principles of communication,” Barrett wrote. “Just as we would expect a parent to give more than a general instruction if she intended to authorize a babysitter led getaway, we also ‘expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.’”
    
            The Supreme Court’s use of the major questions doctrine to throw out Biden’s loan forgiveness program struck a nerve that went beyond educational policy – with the conservative justices and liberal justices sparring over how the controversial legal theory that has been used, with increasing frequency, to strike down unilateral acts of executive branch authority.
    
            Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissent joined by the other liberals, said in a footnote that she could “practically rest” her case for why the loan forgiveness program was lawful on Barrett’s “thoughtful” concurrence. 
    
            Kagan noted other tests Barrett put forward for interpretation under the doctrine, such as whether the challenged action was in the agency’s wheelhouse or whether the delegated power was tucked away in some “ancillary provision. “
    
            “The broadly worded ‘waive or modify; delegation IS the HEROES Act, not some tucked away ancillary provision,” Kagan wrote, referring to the relevant student loan program statute. “And as JUSTICE BARRETT agrees, ‘this is not a case where the agency is operating entirely outside its usual domain.’ So I could practically rest my case on JUSTICE BARRETT’s reasoning.”

      Opinion: Pregnant workers get a major win. How to follow that up
    ","
			Opinion by Vicki Shabo
		","
  Updated
        2:08 PM EDT, Fri June 30, 2023
    ","
            This week, pregnant workers in the United States – an estimated 2.8 million people per year – received new rights and protections from the federal government. This is a bright spot – and hopefully a gateway for more gender equity progress to come – in a month that has also included multiple reminders of persistent gender inequity at work, in the economy and in American society.
    
            Pregnancy discrimination has been illegal in the United States since 1978, but gaps in the law meant that many pregnant people faced practical barriers to work. The newly-effective Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) guarantees most US workers who are pregnant or have recently given birth the right to reasonable accommodations at work to address a “physical or mental condition related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.” The law applies to workers in businesses with 15 employees or more. The types of accommodations covered include, but are not limited to: the ability to sit rather than stand, carry a water bottle, lift lightweight objects only, take bathroom breaks or receive workplace leave or scheduling flexibility.
    
            Laws like PWFA and rights for breastfeeding workers (enhanced to include an estimated 9 million more workers last December with the passage of the PUMP Act) are a first step toward creating more stability for workers and employers.
    
            But these new policies should also lead to more, serving as gateways for addressing current chasms between where we are and the promise of policies that could make gender equity a reality: passing a national paid family and medical leave program (Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act), a national paid sick days law (Healthy Families Act) and stronger equal pay laws (the Paycheck Fairness Act), investing in child care (Child Care for Working Families Act) and investing in elder care and care for disabled people (Home and Community Based Services Access Act).
    
            Together, PWFA and federal breastfeeding rights should make it easier for pregnant and post-partum workers to stay at their jobs, which is a huge step forward. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency that enforces the law, has started to accept charges of violations under PWFA – and just as important – has created a suite of materials to ensure that workers and employers understand their rights and obligations and that health care providers understand the law too. PWFA builds on top of pregnancy accommodation laws in 30 states, Washington, DC, and several localities that guarantee additional or similar rights.
    
            The protection PWFA offers to pregnant workers complements federal protections for breastfeeding parents. Now, US law requires virtually all employers to provide nearly all nursing workers in all industries and jobs a private space and reasonable break times to express breastmilk at work. The Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor (DOL), the federal division that enforces this law, has created extensive outreach materials for workers and employers. A Wage and Hour Division hotline (1-866-4-USWAGE (1-866-487-9243)) offers real-time assistance to workers who need advice or want to file a complaint.
    
            These provisions are desperately needed. An estimated 88% of women who are pregnant with their first child work in the four quarters before birth, yet 23% of moms have considered leaving their job due to lack of reasonable accommodations or fear of pregnancy discrimination, according to the EEOC.
    
            Keeping women in their jobs and keeping them healthy is critical to families’ economic stability because households rely heavily on mothers’ earnings; employment stability for women is also essential for their wage growth and retirement security. Any law or policy that supports workforce attachment is also a win for employers who are facing challenges finding enough workers to fulfill demand.
    
            The passage of PWFA and expanded breastfeeding rights can pave the way for more policies that benefit women and families. Worker stories, hard data, and the work of multiple and diverse organizations were crucial to these victories and a similar constellation of stakeholders and evidence could be transformational, serving as a catalyst for more progress by fostering positive feedback loops.
    
            Government agencies like the EEOC and DOL, along with employer associations, must prioritize implementation so that workers are able to assert their rights and so that the laws work as intended, showing the power of public policy to positively affect people’s lives.
    
            Researchers can track and publicize the impact of newly-enacted policies on maternal and child health, workers’ labor force participation and tenure, and value for employers and the economy – providing evidence for policymakers and employers to make the case for additional improvements in families’ lives.
    
            Organizations that mobilize workers can amplify storytellers, harness data and encourage public engagement to influence policymakers – to show that these substantially bipartisan pieces of legislation are popular, that voters are appreciative and that politicians will see rewards for enacting new policies that support women and families.
    
            And media – both entertainment creators and journalists – can show the value of investing in and supporting workers as a win for working people, families, businesses and the economy, replacing individualistic mindsets, outdated norms about gender and work and devaluing of care and caregiving with a more communitarian mindset.
    
            As we celebrate new rights for pregnant and post-partum workers, let’s commit to this as the beginning and not the end of an era of policy changes that meet workers where they are: As humans who need to both care and provide for their families. Everyone has a role to play in hastening the further changes we need for families, businesses and the economy to thrive, and in creating a culture that embraces collective responsibility for fostering health and care.

      North Carolina governor signs bill adjusting new abortion law before it goes into effect

    ","
            North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law significant changes to the state’s recently passed 12-week abortion ban, just hours before it is set to take effect Saturday. 
    
            Earlier this week, the state’s Republican-controlled legislature advanced House Bill 190 – an unrelated measure focusing on the Department of Health and Human Services – with the last-minute changes to the abortion law to the Democratic governor’s desk for approval.
    
            Though Cooper vetoed the 12-week abortion ban before it was overridden by the GOP supermajority, the governor said the surprise amendment was “important to clarify the rules and provide some certainty.”
    
            “In addition to being dangerous for women, the rushed abortion ban was so poorly written that it is causing real uncertainty for doctors and other health care providers,” he said in a statement. “This bill is important to clarify the rules and provide some certainty, however we will continue fighting on all fronts the Republican assault on women’s reproductive freedom.”
    
            Cooper’s signature comes as a federal judge is considering whether to temporarily block certain parts of the new abortion law from going into effect on July 1. District Court Judge Catherine Eagles has said she will issue her ruling on the temporary restraining order by noon on Friday. 
    
            The bill addresses the majority of the measures being considered by the judge – such as removing conflicting language that set a separate 10-week cut off for medication abortion – likely making most, but not all, of the lawsuit seeking the temporary restraining order moot. 
    
            CNN previously reported that legal filings from attorneys representing Republican leadership appeared to confirm the amendment was written to address a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, which flagged multiple inconsistencies and potential constitutional violations in the original text of the new abortion law, Senate Bill 20.
    
            “Our legal challenge forced General Assembly leadership to clean up their mess of a bill and clarify the sloppy provisions in their ban,” said Jenny Black, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, in a statement. “These amendments are little more than lipstick on a pig, but they will allow us to provide abortion care to more people within the confines of this unjust and inhumane law. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic is working around the clock to implement these changes and prepare providers and patients for the sweeping abortion ban to take effect.”
    
            Senate Bill 20, dubbed the “Care for Women, Children and Families Act,” bans any licensed physician from performing abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It provides exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks. 
    
            Under the bill, the procedure could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines an abortion is necessary to avert a patient’s death – “not including psychological or emotional conditions.” 
    
            The bill prohibits health care providers who object to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.
    
            It also creates several new reporting requirements, calls for multiple in-person examinations by physicians seeking to prescribe or administer abortion-inducing drugs and will prohibit people within the state from mailing such drugs to a pregnant woman.

      Chrissy Teigen says she’s come to understand her miscarriage was actually an abortion that saved her life

    ","
            Chrissy Teigen has shared more about her 2020 pregnancy loss.
    
            According to The Hollywood Reporter, the cookbook author and entrepreneur spoke about that experience on Thursday at social impact agency Propper Daley’s “A Day of Unreasonable Conversation” summit held in Beverly Hills, California.
    
            Teigen, who is currently pregnant and has two other young children with husband John Legend, reflected on the loss of their son, Jack. 
    
            “Two years ago, when I was pregnant with Jack, John and my third child, I had to make a lot of difficult and heartbreaking decisions,” the publication reported her saying at the summit. “It became very clear around halfway through that he would not survive, and that I wouldn’t either without any medical intervention.”
    
            Following the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Teigen said she realized that what she had termed a miscarriage was actually an abortion.
    
            “Let’s just call it what it was: It was an abortion,” she said. “An abortion to save my life for a baby that had absolutely no chance. And to be honest, I never, ever put that together until, actually, a few months ago.”
    
            The “Lip Sync Battle” host had been hospitalized for severe bleeding in the days prior to announcing her pregnancy loss.
    
            “We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It was never enough,” she said in a statement shared on social media at the time.
    
            Part of the debate surrounding abortion in some states has been whether it should be legal in cases where the mother’s life is at risk.
    
            Teigen, according to THR, said it was during a discussion with her husband about abortion and the sympathy she felt for people who have to make an emotional decision to end a pregnancy that Legend helped her realize they were in fact those people. 
    
            “I fell silent, feeling weird that I hadn’t made sense of it that way,” she said. “I told the world we had a miscarriage, the world agreed we had a miscarriage, all the headlines said it was a miscarriage. And I became really frustrated that I didn’t, in the first place, say what it was, and I felt silly that it had taken me over a year to actually understand that we had had an abortion.”
    
            Teigen tweeted the THR story on Friday.
    
            “I told you all we had a miscarriage because I thought that was what it was,” she wrote. “But it was an abortion, and we were heartbroken and grateful all at once. It just took me over a year to realize it.”
    
            CNN has reached out to a representative for Teigen for comment.

      North Carolina lawmakers send governor last-minute changes to state’s recently passed abortion law

            The North Carolina General Assembly on Tuesday gave final approval to a bill that includes some last-minute changes to the state’s recently passed abortion law. 
    
            The Republican-controlled legislature sent the bill to the Democratic governor’s desk, just a day before a federal judge is set to hear a motion seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the abortion law from taking effect. The new law, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks, is set to go into effect on July 1. 
    
            CNN has reached out to Gov. Roy Cooper’s office about his plans for the bill. 
    
            The surprise amendment, which makes significant tweaks to the new abortion law, was added to House Bill 190, an unrelated measure focusing on the Department of Health and Human Services late last week in the state Senate. 
    
            In a Tuesday filing in opposition to granting the temporary restraining order, on behalf of Republican House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, attorneys admitted that the changes contained in the amendment were addressing issues raised by the lawsuit. 
    
            “The Legislative Leaders respectfully request that the Court deny the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (‘TRO’), and permit normal briefing on preliminary injunction issues, if any, that may remain,” wrote W. Ellis Boyle, an attorney for Moore and Berger. “The General Assembly is working to pass and enact, with or without the Governor’s signature, a technical and conforming bill to make changes to clarify and address most, if not all, aspects of Plaintiffs’ claims about the Act.”
    
            The lawsuit filed earlier this month by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, along with other organizations and an OB/GYN, claims the legislation contains several inconsistencies and vague language that could potentially violate constitutional rights. 
    
            For example, the lawsuit questions whether a provision stating it is unlawful “after the twelfth week of a woman’s pregnancy to advise, procure, or cause a miscarriage or abortion” would prevent a person from legally providing information about how to obtain a legal, out-of-state abortion – something the lawsuit says would be a First Amendment violation. The new amendment would remove the word “advise” from that portion of the law’s text. 
    
            Another measure that has been repeatedly highlighted in debate is language that regulates medication abortion. CNN has reported that while the law bans most abortions after 12 weeks into a pregnancy, it adds a separate, 10-week deadline for medication abortion in one section. 
    
            The lawsuit notes that instructions for physicians providing medication abortions are contradictory. “In one section, the Act states that abortion is lawful ‘during the first 12 weeks of a woman’s pregnancy when a medical abortion is procured,’ but in another section, it requires physicians who provide medication abortion to ‘verify the probable gestational age of the unborn child is no more than 70 days,’ or ten weeks.” The amendment would strike the “70-days” language from the law. 
    
            State Attorney General Josh Stein is named as the lead defendant in the lawsuit, due to his role representing the state in challenges to state laws. However, Stein – a Democrat who is running for governor – said last week his office will not defend parts of the new law that he has determined are unconstitutional.  
    
            In a weekend filing, Stein reiterated that he agreed with the plaintiffs that the law was unconstitutional, and referenced the recently passed amendments as evidence. 
    
            “S.B. 20 cannot satisfy this standard—and the General Assembly has effectively conceded as much. Last week, the legislature introduced a series of amendments designed to revise many of the unconstitutional provisions identified in this lawsuit,” wrote Stein in the filing. 
    
            “If those amendments are passed, they may remedy some of the constitutional violations that Plaintiffs allege. But unless and until the current law is repealed or significantly amended, immediate injunctive relief is necessary to avoid a due-process violation,” he continued. “Moreover, even if the legislature’s proposed amendments do pass, at least one constitutional problem with S.B. 20 will remain: even the currently proposed revisions to S.B. 20 fail to make clear that doctors in North Carolina can help their patients obtain abortions out of state.”
    
            District Judge Catherine Eagles is set to hear the motion for the temporary restraining order Wednesday morning in Greensboro. 
    
            Cooper has 10 days to take action on the amended House Bill 190. There are no line item vetoes in North Carolina, so to veto the amendment, he would have to veto the whole bill.

      Prosecutor says there’s ‘insufficient evidence’ for murder charge against woman arrested in shooting of a Black mother who knocked on her door

            A woman accused of fatally shooting her neighbor through a closed door earlier this month will not face murder charges, Florida officials said.
    
            The state will instead charge Susan Lorincz with one count of manslaughter with a firearm and one count of assault, State Attorney Bill Gladson said in a statement released Monday.
    
            Lorincz, a 58-year-old White woman from Marion County, is accused of killing her Black neighbor, Ajike “AJ” Owens after Owens repeatedly knocked on her door. Investigators have said Lorincz became angry because several neighborhood children, including Owens’ children, were playing near her home. 
    
            The Owens family previously told CNN Lorincz harassed Owens and her children and used racial slurs toward them prior to the killing. 
    
            One of Owens’ young sons witnessed the shooting.
    
            Lorincz could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted in the June 2 shooting, according to Gladson’s statement. Lorincz’s attorney had no comment on the charges, she told CNN, but an attorney for members of the Owens family said they were disappointed by the decision not to charge Lorincz with murder.
    
            “(Lorincz) deserves all 30 years of that 30-year maximum sentence,” attorney Anthony Thomas said during a news conference Tuesday.
    
            The state attorney’s office “carefully examined the viability of both second-degree murder and manslaughter with a firearm, both first-degree felonies,” Gladson said in his statement.
    
            Charging Lorincz with murder would require the state to prove Lorincz had a “depraved mind” at the time of the shooting, the statement said.
    
            “As deplorable as the defendant’s actions were in this case, there is insufficient evidence to prove this specific and required element of second-degree murder,” Gladson’s statement read. “While some may not agree with that decision, I can assure you that the decision was thoughtful and made without consideration of any factors other than the specific facts of this terrible crime.”
    
            Lorincz told police she did not mean to hit Owens and was frightened for her own life, according to an arrest affidavit. She admitted using racial slurs against neighborhood children in the past, the affidavit says.

      Making contraception free for low-income, uninsured women could prevent many unplanned pregnancies and abortions, new report shows

    ","
            Demand for contraceptives surged in the United States after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and a new executive order issued by President Joe Biden last week outlined the administration’s plan to protect and strengthen access to family planning.
    
            “Contraception is an essential component of reproductive health care that has only become more important in the wake of Dobbs and the ensuing crisis in women’s access to health care,” a statement from the White House said.
    
            About 1 in 6 sexually active women who did not want to become pregnant were not using contraception to prevent it, according to a KFF survey from 2022. And among those who were using contraception, about a quarter were not using their preferred method.
    
            The reasons for not using contraception vary, but a new report emphasizes the importance of making it affordable – particularly for uninsured women who receive care through Title X, a federal grant program that offers family planning services for low-income individuals on a sliding scale.
    
            Researchers compared the decisions made by about 1,600 uninsured women who were visiting a Title X-funded health center – about half of whom who received a voucher to cover the costs of contraception and the other half whom received care at the standard cost.
    
            When offered a voucher for free contraception, patients were 40% more likely to adopt any form of birth control, according to the report, published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research. And they were more likely to choose longer-lasting and more effective methods, too.
    
            Of the women who came to health centers seeking an IUD, most of those who did not receive a payment voucher left with a less expensive birth control option that was different than their initial preference. But about three-quarters of those who did receive a payment voucher received an IUD as they had originally planned.
    
            “When we just take cost off the table, we see that the decisions women are making are changing a lot,” said Martha Bailey, an economics professor at the University of California Los Angeles and lead author of the research. “It’s a straightforward policy lever to allow women to get their desired contraceptive method – which we think should also reduce a lot of undesired pregnancies that may have ended in abortion.”
    
            Earlier research has found that low-income women are more likely to experience an unplanned pregnancy, and many unplanned pregnancies result in abortion.
    
            The new report found that the chance of an unplanned pregnancy was cut by at least 30% for those who received a voucher for free contraception – and making contraception free under the Title X program could lead to 5% fewer unplanned pregnancies and 8% fewer abortions.
    
            Bailey says she’s “delighted” that the Biden administration is addressing access to contraception, and much of the executive order does specifically address the issue of affordability – including a request for $512 million in funding for Title X in the 2024 budget, a 76% increase.
    
            But Bailey says she would have liked the executive order to go “one step further” and specifically earmark that money to making contraception free under the program.
    
            Under the Affordable Care Act, most private health insurance plans are required to offer birth control coverage with no out-of-pocket cost. But many low-income, uninsured patients seeking family planning services rely on Title X funding, which uses a sliding scale for coverage costs.
    
            On Tuesday, Bailey published a policy proposal that called for changes that would scrap the Title X sliding scale and instead make contraception free for low-income patients through the program.
    
            “Access to contraception has been an issue for a long time, but it’s not something we’ve focused a lot on in the policy space,” she said. “I think (Title X) is a place where policy can do a lot, and very quickly. It would be a great place to focus.”
    
            Other experts stress that improving access to contraception requires more than cost-cutting.
    
            “Affordability is essential but not sufficient,” said Sarah Benatar, a principal research associate with the Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center. “It’s a huge potential barrier, but it is only one of many concerns that women have.”
    
            According to the KFF survey from 2022, just 30% of women said that they received all the information they needed before choosing their birth control method. And concerns about side effects were particularly common.
    
            Benatar has heard similar themes in her own qualitative research, including focus groups with women across the country.
    
            “You can’t overstate the importance of bodily autonomy, or people’s desire to feel like they truly have autonomy over their choices when it comes to contraceptive or reproductive or maternal health care,” Benatar said. “Making sure information is getting to people from really trusted messengers and being able to change one’s method when it feels appropriate to do so is of paramount importance to people.”

      Pregnant workers and nursing moms have new protections on the job

            Pregnant workers should have an easier time getting a stool, extra bathroom breaks or a bottle of water without fear of getting fired, thanks to a new law that takes effect on Tuesday.
    
            The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which Congress passed as part of a federal government spending package in December, requires employers to provide “reasonable accommodations” related to pregnancy or childbirth unless they would cause an “undue hardship.” It applies to businesses with at least 15 employees.
    
            The law is one of two enhanced job-based protections for expectant and new mothers contained in the spending package. The other, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, expands the right to have break time and a private place outside of a bathroom to pump to nearly 9 million more breastfeeding workers who were not covered under a previous Affordable Care Act provision. They include teachers, registered nurses, farm workers and others.
    
            Annually, nearly 2.8 million pregnant women – 70% of all pregnant women – worked while they were expecting, according to the National Partnership for Women & Families.
    
            Advocates have been fighting to improve federal protections for pregnant workers for more than a decade, saying that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is inadequate and that most pregnancy-related conditions are not considered disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
    
            “At long last, pregnant workers can no longer be forced off the job for needing light duty work or a stool to sit on to maintain a healthy pregnancy,” said Dina Bakst, co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance, a national legal advocacy organization. “Working moms no longer have to fear job loss for needing time off to safely recover from childbirth. No longer will women nationwide face the impossible choice between maintaining a healthy pregnancy and affording food for their families.”
    
            Other accommodations could include flexible scheduling for doctor appointments, additional or longer breaks for eating, drinking and using the bathroom, permission to wear maternity pants, changes to work schedules and time off to recover from childbirth.
    
            More than 30 states and cities have laws providing accommodations for at least some pregnant workers, according to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
    
            Armanda Legros is one mom who could have benefited from the law had it been in effect when she was pregnant with her second son in 2012. 
    
            Legros was working for an armored truck company on Long Island, New York, lifting bags of money and 40-pound boxes of coins, sometimes two or three at a time. Six months into her pregnancy, she pulled a muscle in her stomach. Her doctor gave her a note saying she should not do heavy lifting.
    
            Instead of allowing Legros to just drive the truck or expand the administrative work she was already doing, the company fired her. It was hard for her to get another job – because she was visibly pregnant, she believes – so she had to apply for food stamps and almost lost her apartment.
    
            The experience prompted her to become a community advocate with A Better Balance.
    
            “I didn’t want what happened to me to happen to any other mom,” said Legros, now a married mother of four living in Rosharon, Texas, and working at a credit union. “If the act was available at the time, this would not have happened to me. I would not have gone through the struggles I did if the protections were there.”
    
            The US Chamber of Commerce was among the supporters of the two provisions. 
    
            The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act clears up confusion left in the wake of a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that involved a pregnant worker seeking an accommodation, said Marc Freedman, vice president of workplace policy at the Chamber. It left employers unclear as to what their obligations are and what employees’ rights are. And it prompted workers who thought they should get accommodations to take their employers to court.
    
            “We believe it is going to reduce the chances for that type of litigation and provide clarity to employers about what their obligations are,” Freedman said, noting that it builds on the ADA’s existing process. “Our expectation is that a high majority of these requests for accommodation will lead to employers and employees finding a way to work things out.”
    
            Under the act, a pregnant worker asks her employer for an accommodation. They then have a discussion about whether the request can be granted. If it can’t, putting the worker on leave is a last-resort option, Freedman said. The worker can also file a challenge with the EEOC if she is not provided an accommodation.
    
            Among employment attorney Roger Feicht’s clients, the main request from pregnant workers is scheduling flexibility, such as a change in shift, a few days off or a modified schedule. Feicht, who works for Gunster, a Florida-based law firm, recommends companies update their employee handbooks or other written policies so workers understand their rights and the human resources personnel understand their obligations.
    
            Some of his clients are trying to walk through hypothetical scenarios to explore what are available options and what might create hardships for the employers, he said.
    
            While many employers already provide accommodations, countless workers have called A Better Balance’s help line to complain that their requests were turned down, Bakst said. But the law will help more than just the expecting moms.
    
            “Keeping women working is good for women, it’s good for businesses, it’s good for the economy,” she said.

      Most accidental shooting deaths among children involve guns left loaded and unlocked, study finds

    ","
            Most children in the US who die from an accidental shooting are playing around with guns at home or mistaking them for toys, according to a new study. And the research suggests that over 90% of guns used in such shooting deaths were left unlocked and loaded.
    
            The study, published Monday in the scientific journal Injury Epidemiology, looked at cases over a nearly a decade in which children under 15 accidentally killed themselves or another child with a gun. Most of the shootings happened at the victim’s home, where, in 8 out of 10 cases, the gun belonged to an older relative.
    
            Over 40% of the time, these unintentional deaths happened among kids ages 2 to 4, the researchers found.
    
            “It’s worth trying to figure out, ‘how do we encourage parents to embrace safe storage?’ ” said Dr. Nichole Michaels, senior author of the study and principal investigator in the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. “Because that’s the way that we prevent these fatalities. These are preventable deaths: We can keep guns out of the hands of toddlers and older children.”
    
            In the United States, guns are the leading cause of death for children and teens, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And for every child who dies due to gun violence, more than two more are treated in an emergency room for a gun-related injury, costing the US health care system $109 million each year for initial hospitalizations.
    
            For the new study, scientists at the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Ohio examined instances in which children and teens accidentally shot themselves or another child, resulting in a fatality.
    
            They used the National Violent Death Reporting System, a database maintained by the CDC that tracks the circumstances surrounding violent deaths by compiling information from coroners’ reports, hospital records, death certificates and more.
    
            “It is comprehensive to a level that just nothing else exists like it at all,” said Dr. Eric Fleegler, an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. “It’s probably, to the best of my knowledge, the most comprehensive in-depth look at unintentional firearm fatalities among kids.”
    
            Filtering through data from 2009 to 2018 across 33 states, the team counted 279 cases in which kids under 15 accidentally died due to firearm injury. Not included were scenarios where, according to researchers’ screening of the database, the shooter was over 15 or the shooting was driven by mental health struggles.
    
            About 64% of the accidental gun deaths, the study found, happened at the victim’s home, where in most cases, the gun belonged to a relative or a parent. Playing with the firearm or mistaking it for a toy were the most common circumstances of death. The report found that guns were left loaded and unlocked in 92% of fatal shootings for which information about the firearm was available.
    
            “People do not view guns as a safety risk,” Fleegler said. “They view guns frequently as the exact opposite: as a mechanism for protecting their family. The notion that guns protect us and they don’t, potentially, put us at risk is where the troubling thought process begins.”
    
            ‘Everything was a gun’
    
            According to the study, most of those accidental gun deaths were self-inflicted. That was particularly true for kids under 5, who unintentionally shot themselves in 8 out of 10 cases.
    
            “That is really an impactful finding, because what do we do to prevent these injuries?” Michaels said. “Nobody wants to see guns in the hands of toddlers.”
    
            For older kids, ages 10 to 14, nearly a third of the shooters were friends of the victims. According to Michaels, injuries could occur if children mistakenly pulled the trigger, thought a gun was unloaded while hunting or other had another kind of fatal mishap.
    
            For Dr. Chris Rees, a physician and assistant professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics at Emory University, the findings confirm what he sees in the emergency room.
    
            “I see children very, very often in the emergency department, even 2 or 3 years old, who present after having been involved in a firearm accident of some sort,” said Rees, who was not involved in the new research. “They come in shot in the foot, shot in the head, shot in the chest or shot anywhere because they don’t really understand what the firearm is and what it’s capable of doing.”
    
            The study also found that over 92% of the shooters and 80% of the victims were males. Although the researchers aren’t sure what drives the gender gap in gun deaths, some experts attribute it to societal expectations and gender norms for men.
    
            “When my oldest child was a little kid, everything was a gun,” Fleegler said. “A stick was a gun; a fork was a gun. It is a kind of a sociological phenomenon in our country … that boys tend to play with guns.”
    
            ‘It’s a team sport’
    
            Experts recommend some key things families can do to avoid the risk of an accidental shooting.
    
            Keeping firearms locked and in secure locations, out of the reach of kids, is a critical step that researchers agree could help stop young children from harming themselves or others. Simply hiding firearms rather than locking them, Michaels said, can be like hiding holiday gifts: Naturally curious kids end up finding them.
    
            “It’s really up to parents to embrace this safe storage idea,” Michaels said. “We recommend removing firearms from the home, and if that isn’t an option, the firearms should be stored, unloaded, and locked away from the ammunition.”
    
            Michaels and Rees also recommended open conversations with other families. If a child is going to play at another home, parents could ask the other family if they have firearms that are safely stored.
    
            Physicians, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, believe that it’s the job of pediatricians to educate families about safe gun storage practices with youth around, just like “car seats and bicycle helmets,” according to Fleegler. In his experience, when he asked about gun safety in the home, most parents’ responses were the same: “I hadn’t thought about it.”
    
            Due to an uptick in pediatric gun injuries, several hospital emergency departments, including Rees’s, also provide free gun locks to patients’ families.
    
            But experts agree that hospitals and doctors alone can’t take on the challenge of youth gun violence. Rees said schools, parents and politicians all have a role to play in promoting safe practices.
    
            “I think it’s a team sport,” Rees said. “I think everybody is against people getting hurt and dying from firearms. It’s a public health crisis, and we need to approach it as such.”

      Klobuchar says she supports allowing abortion restrictions in late pregnancy
    ","

    ","
            Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Sunday she supports allowing limitations on abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy wading into the thorny political debate of abortion procedure time frames.
    
            “I support allowing for limitations in the third trimester that do not interfere with the life or health of the women,” Klobuchar told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” while also reaffirming her support for codifying Roe v. Wade.
    
            The third trimester in a pregnancy begins at 27 weeks. Less than 1% of abortions are performed at 21 weeks or later, according to a 2020 report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Abortion has become an especially potent political topic in the year since the monumental US Supreme Court decision one year ago to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the federal constitutional right to abortion nationwide. More than a dozen US states have banned or severely restricted access to the procedure since the ruling. 
    
            “What I support – and I will be very clear about this – is Roe v. Wade, which does allow for limitations, but it also protects the life of the woman and the health of the woman,” Klobuchar said Sunday.
    
            “I think that is the best way to go. But you look at what they are doing, their leading Republican candidates, Dana, are asking for abortion bans. Trump was on just last night gloating about how he had put these Supreme Court justices in place that had reversed Roe v. Wade.”
    
            Klobuchar has long articulated the need for some restrictions on late-term abortions, telling Bloomberg in 2019 “there are limits there in the third trimester that are very important – about – except for the health of the woman.”
    
            In the 2022 midterms, abortion was a crucial motivator for many voters, as CNN exit polls showed that 46% of people said that abortion was the most important issue to their vote. Abortion is also likely to be a cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, as administration officials highlight what Democrats have done to protect access to abortion.
    
            “MAGA Republicans made clear that they don’t intend to stop with the Dobbs decision. No, they won’t, until they get a national ban on abortion,” Biden said this week, promising to issue a veto if a national ban is ever passed by Congress.
    
            CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify Klobuchar’s position on abortion restrictions.

      Kamala Harris found her voice on abortion rights in the year after Dobbs. Now she’s making it central to her 2024 message
    ","
			By Jasmine Wright, CNN
		;Jasmine Wright","
  Updated
        2:10 PM EDT, Sat June 24, 2023
    ","
            Vice President Kamala Harris was fed up. 
    
            At a March event in Des Moines, Iowa, Harris listened to a shy nursing student recount the harrowing story of a pregnant patient seeking an abortion. The patient’s sudden health complications required the early end of their pregnancy in a state where Republican legislators once tried to prevent doctors from performing an abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detected. 
    
            Harris, visibly moved by the nurse’s story, left the meeting telling aides it was just another example of why no one – including Republicans racing to pass restrictive abortion bans across the country – knows what leads someone to get an abortion. Harris left the event railing at the stigma women face for doing so, a staffer told CNN.
    
            The moment, following an event that echoed many she’s had around the country over the last year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, served as a window into an effort that has been defined by a defiant message on an issue Democrats plan to put at the center of the 2024 election cycle. 
    
            The months that followed the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade saw Harris become the Biden administration’s foremost voice on reproductive rights, both in public events and behind the scenes in hours of policy discussions and internal White House deliberations. She led intense efforts to marshal outside allies, many of whom were staggered by the ruling itself – and pressing the Biden administration to do more in response. For Harris, it was a process that paired an intense exasperation with an equally strong level of determination. 
    
            But it was that intense level of passion that finally gave Harris something she’d been searching for during a turbulent and often roller-coaster-like start to her time as vice president: A clear and unambiguous issue on which she could lead. 
    
            That passionate and defiant message is one the vice president and her aides hope to project over the summer months, as they seek to keep reproductive rights prominent in the conscious of American voters. 
    
            “I do believe when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We stand for the freedom of every American, including the freedom of every person everywhere to make decisions – about their own body, their own health care and their own doctor,” Harris said at an abortion rally in Washington, DC, Friday. “So we fight for reproductive rights and legislation that restores the protections of Roe v. Wade. And here’s the thing. The majority of Americans are with us, they agree.”
    
            Harris tested her message at a keynote speech on reproductive rights Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina, a place where White House officials have said is the “belly of the beast,” for the current abortion debate after the state’s Republican-led General Assembly banned most abortions after 12 weeks. 
    
            “Extremist Republicans in Congress have proposed to ban abortion nationwide. Nationwide. But I have news for them: We’re not having that. Americans believe in freedom. And we will not allow you to destroy our most basic rights and principles,” Harris said.
    
            Aides anticipate Harris will continue traveling the country at a “steady cadence,” following Saturday’s high-profile speech, hosting official but campaign-like events to reach thousands on an issue that helped Democrats stave off a complete Republican takeover in Congress in 2022. Harris’ outreach, which some liken to a re-introduction tour, will come months before President Joe Biden is expected to hit the campaign trail in a concrete way.  
    
            And it comes amid a shift in strategy from the White House, people close to Harris say, since the vice president’s fraught first year, during which frustration from aides and allies reached a zenith following a series of Harris’ self-inflicted gaffes, Republicans attacks and a string of bad press. 
    
            “I have seen a real shift in the way that the White House is giving opportunity for the vice president to be her authentic self. And I think that’s very good for the vice president. I also think it’s very good for the country,” said Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a longtime friend to Harris. “It’s important that the American people really get to know her.” 
    
            More than a dozen Democrats who spoke to CNN – some under anonymity to speak candidly – describe a White House that is coming around to see the merits of Harris’ work on abortion, guns and democracy, after two years of direct appeals from Harris allies to Biden aides to take a more hands-on approach in shoring up Harris’ public standing. 
    
            The West Wing has now been intentional about showing Harris’ ability to lead, frequently sharing her work on official outreach channels that once mostly promoted Biden. The vice president also held a prominent role in Biden’s April reelection announcement video, where she appeared 13 times, a clear signal officials said, of Harris’ importance to the reelection effort. 
    
            “There’s been a change in understanding that how Kamala does is really important for Biden’s legacy,” a second person in communication with the West Wing told CNN.  “I think a lot of the folks who have had some misgivings about Kamala have come to terms with that fact.” 
    
            Ron Klain, former Biden chief of staff and an early Harris advocate inside the West Wing, disagreed that the level of support from the White House for the vice president has changed.
    
            “I always believed that when the public got enough chance to see her, her coverage would get better,” Klain told CNN in an interview, touting the ways the White House has tried to support Harris and her platform. “And so, I think the support for us always been there in the White House. I think finally, the coverage is reflecting what a great job she’s been doing since day one.”
    
            CNN has asked the West Wing and the vice president’s office for comment on this story.
    
            Biden staff privately tout Harris’ inclusion in his announcing video as another example of her elevated role, noting that then-vice president Biden did not appear in Obama’s 2012 announcement clip. Even still, a source familiar with the rollout told CNN, Harris was not personally invited to film for the video, instead the campaign opted to use old footage and still photos of the vice president. 
    
            Many close to the vice president feel the intervention to pull Harris more into the fold could not have come fast enough as more Americans grow concerned about Biden’s age and health. The vice president’s place as only a heartbeat away from the Oval Office takes on new weight, some say, when the current commander in chief is only months away from his 81st birthday and seeking four more years. Republicans, including many low-polling GOP nominees, have already begun to test campaign messaging that it would be Harris who served the majority of a possible second term for the Biden-Harris administration. 
    
            In the face of those efforts, the White House has worked to show that the two leaders are in fact a team, hoping in part to reassure Americans who question Biden’s fortitude, one source familiar with the White House dynamic told CNN. 
    
            “A rising tide lifts all boats,” the source told CNN. “Her boat was the one sinking. And if no one helps her, she’s gonna drag everyone down. They recognize that.” 
    
            But others close to Harris see it as the West Wing “shaping a narrative that helps them both win.” And they credit the vice president with using her “own voice” to step into a leadership role and prove credible in areas Americans deem important. 
    
            The vice president and her staff all leaned into abortion heavily last year and Biden appointed her as lead. And Harris was supported by a recently shaken up staff, including a new chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, senior communications adviser and press secretary all known to and favored by the West Wing. Those new faces helped stabilize the office, helping Harris hit her stride.
    
            The shift in posture, many close to the White House say, has also been helped by one of Biden’s closest advisers, Anita Dunn.  
    
            An advocate of Harris’ since then-presumptive nominee Biden’s search to find a running mate in 2020, Dunn has more recently helped lift Harris’ profile among West Wing staffers and tamp down on anonymous critics coming from both within the White House and the larger Democratic Party. Communications director Ben LaBolt and chief of staff Jeff Zients have also been identified by allies as supportive to the vice president’s narrative. 
    
            Harris diehards often mention two sets of favorable internal polling done in early 2023 as evidence of her importance to Biden’s reelection effort. The first is a poll from a Democratic firm that tests Harris’ messaging on abortion, voting rights and on gun safety. A source who has seen it told CNN it shows Harris “moves voters to [Biden] that don’t start with him.” 
    
            The second poll, a separate Democrat relayed to CNN, shows Harris with higher favorability than Biden with young people and Black voters. The latter group has consistently been a bulwark for Biden. 
    
            “You look at the Democratic Party and you see a lot of people who, quite frankly, are generations away from these younger, diverse voters that are central, all except for the vice president,” said Cornell Belcher, who has conducted polls for several groups focused on Black voters. “The bridge to relatability and connection is shorter with her than almost any other major character in democratic politics right now.” 
    
            Allies say polls favorable to Harris’ could be one factor into the shift toward support from the West Wing. Another is the vice president’s team, which Biden officials now view as a more stable and competent version than those who first joined her office. 
    
            Looking forward to 2024, a Biden campaign official identified Georgia, an important battleground state that helped propel Biden to the presidency in 2020, as a state among many Harris will visit often. 
    
            “They know that she does really well with base voters for Democrats, right? Voters of color and women in general and young voters. So they’re gonna put her in front of that,” a source with knowledge of campaign dynamics told CNN. 
    
            Fundraisers will also be an important part of the equation. Already, Harris held the second most fundraisers for the Biden Victory Fund, Biden’s joint fundraising committee, and is expected to do more this month as the campaign looks to scoop up cash before the fundraising quarter ends on June 30.
    
            Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, a longtime Biden ally, said Harris was “relaxed” and “engaging” during the campaign’s inaugural donors meeting, working the tables in the nation’s capital during an April weekend after Biden announced he would run for reelection. 
    
            “It was clear she was having fun,” Coons, the Biden campaign’s national-co chair, told CNN. “The president and vice president cannot both be bouncing around the country doing fundraisers all the time. But for the vice president to be warm, engaging, casual, to clearly to convey the sense that she wants to linger and take a selfie with you and ask about your kids. Rather than, you know, on a Zoom screen. It’s a huge change and a very positive one.” 
    
            But even donors with loyalty to the vice president have complained to top Biden officials about the lack of perceived support for Harris since the administration came into power. Those donors say they have called on top Biden officials to treat Harris’ vice presidency with more care than her predecessors in acknowledgment of her historic role.
    
            But those with concerns will now have to look no further than the powerful political action committee that helps elect women, Emily’s List, to provide an offensive firewall of support to Harris for the upcoming election. Emily’s List President Laphonza Butler, a longtime supporter of the vice president, said the group would spend tens of millions of dollars to improve Harris’ image. 
    
            “We want to make sure that more people get to know the work of the vice president, what her leadership has brought to this administration, what her presence means to voters across the country,” Butler told CNN in an interview. “For us it’s really about telling an offensive story and reminding people just how much of a fighter she is for women and children in particular, and for further work of the administration in general.” 
    
            The Biden campaign also announced that Sheila Nix, a longtime Biden aide, will serve as the vice president’s chief of staff on the reelection campaign, akin to her own personal campaign manager. The early move to put her in place, a campaign official told CNN, represents the elevated role Harris will have in all 2024 endeavors. Nix served as a senior adviser for Harris after she was named as Biden’s running mate in 2020. 
    
            There is one statistic, aides say, that continues to haunt Harris on abortion: The 10 states with the worst maternal mortality rates have passed or tried to pass abortion bans.  
    
            Hearing that in recent weeks, one staffer said, led Harris to want to double down on calling out “the hypocrisy of leaders who say they are pro-life and advocate for the restriction of reproductive rights while at the same time take no action to address maternal health.” 
    
            It’s a feeling that has helped shape Harris’ Saturday message, advising staff to step-up language to illustrate the clear contrast between both parties. 
    
            “Over the past 365 days, the women of our nation have suffered under the consequences of these laws. In addition to the taking of rights, these laws have created chaos, confusion, and fear,” Harris said Saturday.
    
            Aides view her abortion work as in its third phase of existence.  
    
            The first was a “fact-finding mode,” in which Harris traveled the country, holding dozens of roundtables with state legislators and stakeholders to better understand how the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision would affect individual communities.  
    
            Dr. Todd Ivey, a Texas obstetrician and gynecologist who has met with Harris repeatedly over the last year, said in those discussions, “She asked what are some of the things that we’re seeing on the ground.”
    
            Ivey said he spoke with Harris about difficulties for patients to travel and other setbacks. “She went on to address those things immediately,” Ivey said.
    
            The second phase added in moderated (by a friendly host) panels where she could distill some of what she learned to small- and medium-sized crowds while still holding roundtables to learn. The third phase of this effort is expected to see Harris taking her findings directly to the American people in a rallying cry – outreach focused in part on young people. 
    
            Harris’ high-profile speech on Saturday will come after a full-court press from Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden and other Biden administration officials marking the one-year anniversary after Roe was struck down. 
    
            On Saturday, Biden pledged in a statement, “My Administration will continue to protect access to reproductive health care and call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law once and for all.”
    
            And on Friday, it was announced Harris and Biden have received endorsements from EMILYs List, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, three reproductive rights groups. 
    
            Biden also announced he would sign an executive order strengthening access to contraception by directing relevant agencies to consider guidance guaranteeing private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act covers all FDA-approved methods of contraception, in contrast to current guidance, which only mandates coverage for one contraceptive product per FDA category. 
    
            The president has evolved in his own delivery on abortion issues since the Dobbs decision. Abortion is a charged issue for a president who has witnessed up close the changing politics of abortion over the half-century span of his career. Long one of the Democratic Party’s most moderate voices on abortion, Biden has reckoned with personal qualms rooted in his Catholic faith.
    
            That reckoning has showed in his ability to discuss reproductive care with more ease than before. And he’s been buoyed by the support of the first lady, who recently held an emotional conversation with women who shared their stories of how the Dobbs decision and subsequent state bans on abortion impacted their own medical care. 
    
            But there is no action Biden can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion, empowering Harris’ final message that ultimately it is up to the American voter to change the makeup of legislators across the country to protect access to abortion.

      New York governor signs bill to legally protect doctors who prescribe abortion pills for out-of-state patients into law

    ","
            New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a bill into law Friday that legally protects doctors who prescribe and send abortion pills to patients in states where abortion services are outlawed or restricted.  
    
            “We are witnessing a shameful regression of women’s rights in this country as abortion access is restricted in states across the nation,” Hochul said in a news release, adding that the law will ensure that more women will be able to access reproductive health care. 
    
            The measure – passed by the state legislature Tuesday – will block out-of-state litigation, prohibiting prosecution against doctors in New York who provide telehealth services, prescribe medication abortion, or deliver reproductive health care to patients living in states with restrictive abortion laws. 
    
            Telehealth medication abortions have accounted for an increasing share of total US abortions since last year’s Supreme Court ruling that established there is no constitutional right to abortion, CNN previously reported. Prior to the June 2022 ruling, medication abortions provided by virtual-only providers made up 4% of all abortions in April 2022 and 5% in May 2022, according to data from the Society of Family Planning. However, between June and December 2022, the share of such procedure grew from 6 to 11%. And as of 2020, more than half of US abortions were conducted using medication. 
    
            Assemblymember Karines Reyes, a registered nurse who sponsored the bill, said Tuesday she was “proud to sponsor this critical piece of legislation to fully protect abortion providers using telemedicine.” 
    
            Hochul previously signed legislation aimed at expanding reproductive rights. Last month, the governor signed a bill to ensure that every student at a State University of New York (SUNY) or City University of New York (CUNY) college will be able to access medication abortion, along with another bill that allows pharmacists across the state to dispense contraceptives over the counter. 
    
            The governor’s recent moves demonstrate the changing abortion landscape nationwide. As Democratic-led states aim to expand access, states with Republican majorities have enacted widespread restrictions, including near-total bans. 
    
            Last month, North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature overrode a veto by its Democratic governor to ban most abortions after 12 weeks.

      More than two dozen states were expected to ban abortion post-Roe. Courts are keeping it legal in several of them

    ","
            In the year since the monumental US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the federal constitutional right to abortion nationwide, more than a dozen US states have banned or severely restricted access to the procedure. Abortion remains legal in seven states that were expected to ban abortion after Roe was overturned — bans are held up in courts in six of those states. In the seventh, Michigan voters approved a measure to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitution.
    
            State courthouses have since emerged as the battleground for both restricting and expanding access to abortion. Forty lawsuits challenging abortion bans have been filed in 22 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University and the Center for Reproductive Rights as of June 9.
    
            Months before the court heard arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Clinic Organization, 26 states were likely or certain to ban abortion if Roe were overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights.
    
            But one year later, abortion remains legal in seven of those 26 states as courts debate whether old — and new — bans should take effect.
    
            Overall, 14 states have now banned or severely restricted access to the procedure, and six have set gestational limits.
    
            “Bans have eliminated access to all or some abortions in 20 states, with more to come — leaving one in three women, as well as more trans and nonbinary people, without access to this fundamental right,” said Ianthe Metzger, director of state advocacy communications at Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
    
            As of February, 24.5 million women of reproductive age live in states with abortion bans, according to abortion advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America.
    
            Of the 24 states that were unlikely to ban abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, North Carolina was the one state that ended up passing a ban.
    
            When a longtime Democratic representative defected to the other side of the aisle in April, Republicans took unexpected supermajority control in both chambers of the state legislature. The GOP-led assembly then had the power to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto of a 12-week abortion ban.
    
            Abortion is currently legal until 20 weeks of pregnancy in North Carolina — until July 1, when the 12-week ban goes into effect.
    
            Before the Dobbs ruling, 22 states had laws or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, if Roe were weakened or overturned, according to Guttmacher.
    
            Thirteen of those states had restrictive “trigger” bans — laws that would go into effect when Roe was overturned — on the books when the Dobbs  decision was issued.
    
            Wyoming is the only one of the states with trigger bans where abortion is currently legal until viability. In March, a district judge temporarily blocked a strict ban that would prohibit abortion in most circumstances a few days after it took effect. Wyoming was also the first state to pass legislation explicitly banning access to abortion pills, though a district judge temporarily blocked the ban on Thursday, days before it was supposed to take effect.
    
            Ahead of the Dobbs ruling, several states had passed bans or extreme limits on abortion that could be enforceable without Roe. Among those states were Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina. Yet abortion remains legal in all states, as judges have temporarily or indefinitely blocked efforts to ban abortion.
    
            Nine states had banned abortion before Roe was in place and were expected to restrict access again after the Dobbs decision. All but one did.
    
            Michigan was the only state to repeal its pre-existing ban, which would have gone into effect in Roe’s absence and was originally enacted in 1931 with no exceptions for rape or incest. Now, the procedure is legal in Michigan through fetal viability, typically 24 weeks into a pregnancy.
    
            Following the Supreme Court decision, some states have moved to enshrine abortion rights while others have moved to curb the procedures. Thirteen states have laws protecting the right to abortion until viability. Ten of those states, including Illinois and Massachusetts, also have “shield laws” protecting providers and patients from investigations by other states, according to Guttmacher.
    
            Most recently, a committee of the Maine legislature advanced one of the most lenient abortion laws in the country that would make abortion legal past fetal viability.
    
            In most states where abortion was expected to be banned but remains legal — including Iowa, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, South Carolina and Wyoming — legal battles have put restrictive policies on hold there.
    
            Following the Dobbs decision, Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds asked a state court to revive a six-week abortion ban that had previously been halted in 2019. The legal battle made its way to the Iowa Supreme Court, which recently issued a split decision meaning abortion remains legal up to 20 weeks.
    
            In Indiana — the first state post-Roe to pass a law banning most abortions — Senate Bill 1 was blocked by a state judge one week after it went into effect, allowing abortions up to 20 weeks after fertilization, or 22 weeks after the mother’s last menstrual period, to resume.
    
            Voters have been drawn to the polls since Dobbs, and in November ballot measures in California, Michigan and Vermont to protect abortion rights were approved. In last year’s primary election, Kansas voters turned out in record numbers to defeat a constitutional amendment that said there was no right to abortion in the state.
    
            Other states, like Colorado and New Mexico, have declared themselves safe havens for people living in surrounding states with restrictive policies.
    
            “In the year since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, every state legislature in the county took action on abortion in some way. As a result, the abortion landscape has become even more fractured,” Metzger told CNN.
    
            Legislation regulating abortion access has been introduced in all 50 state legislatures in the past year, according to a CNN review of LegiScan data.
    
            “There is this continuing story of states where abortion is protected are moving beyond protection to recognize that legality alone is not enough. But those states that have been able to ban abortion, they are doubling down and going farther,” said Kelly Baden, vice president for public policy at the Guttmacher Institute.

      Italian women protest prosecutor’s call to erase lesbian mother’s name from child’s birth certificate
    ","

    ","
            Around 300 women took part in a sit-in outside Padua’s palace of justice on Friday, after a state prosecutor in the northern Italian city said the birth certificates of 33 children born to lesbian couples were not legal.
    
            In a peaceful protest, the women held up signs with slogans such as: “The teacher taught us that we are all the same. Didn’t your teacher teach you?”
    
            Originally, the state prosecutor questioned the legality of the birth certificate of a child with two mothers, registered by the municipality in August 2017. 
    
            The prosecutor described the naming of the non-biological mother as the second parent on the birth certificate as “illegitimate” and has asked the local civil court to allow her name to be removed from both the certificate and from the child’s double-barreled surname.
    
            The child’s biological mother, a 40-year-old who married her partner abroad, has received notification of the request from acting Padua prosecutor Valeria Sanzari, CNN affiliate SkyTG24 reported Monday.
    
            The court hearing is set for November 14, a document seen by CNN shows.
    
            In her petition to the court, the prosecutor wrote that “the young age of the child excludes that the change of the surname as requested could have repercussions on her social life.”
    
            On Monday, SkyTG24 reported the little girl’s biological mother as saying: “This is not just about repercussions on social life, but repercussions on one’s identity, until proven otherwise a fundamental right. A personal trauma at a delicate stage of development, from no longer having a brother and a mother.”
    
            And other families are likely to face a similar situation soon.
    
            The prosecutor’s office has also asked the municipality for the birth certificates of all 33 children who have been registered with the surnames of two mothers since 2017, a spokesman for Sergio Giordani, the mayor of Padua, told CNN Wednesday. He added that letters had been sent to seven more families that day, informing them that their children’s birth certificates are invalid.
    
            These 33 cases “are the same” and all the couples will be notified, Sanzari told Italian news agency ANSA on Tuesday.
    
            “I am obliged to enforce the law and with the current legislation I cannot do anything else,” she added.
    
            The Padua prosecutor’s office is acting on the basis that Italian law doesn’t recognize the possibility of a child having two mothers.
    
            Gay marriage has not been legalized in Italy. Because it isn’t recognized in law, the non-biological parent in a same-sex relationship has to make a special case for legally adopting their child.
    
            Padua mayor Giordani has said he is happy with the municipality’s decision to include both mothers on the birth certificates, saying in a press release on Tuesday that it is “an act of responsibility toward these little ones, because I do not accept the thought that they are discriminated against from the very beginning, as soon as they are born.”  
    
            He said there is a “very serious legislative vacuum” that the Italian parliament needs to remedy, and he called on politicians “to put aside the ideological battle and think only of the children.”  
    
            The prosecutor’s move comes three months after the right-wing government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ordered city councils to stop automatically registering both parents in lesbian couples on birth certificates.
    
            In March, the municipality of Milan had to stop registering the births of children born overseas to same-sex couples, following a letter from the Prefect of Milan.
    
            On Monday, Italian lawmakers began debating a controversial bill known as “DL Varchi,” which would criminalize surrogacies arranged abroad, with sentences of up to two years in prison and a fine of €600,000 to €1 million ($651,000 to $1.1 million).
    
            However, an “amnesty” may be granted to people who had children through surrogacy if the law is passed, Family Minister Eugenia Roccella said in an interview due to be aired Friday, Reuters reported. 
    
            CNN has reached out to the minister’s office for confirmation.
    
            Meloni’s campaign for last September’s national election was laced with anti-LGBTQ+ themes and support for traditional “family values.” And she tweeted in 2021 that surrogacy is “an abomination that wants to reduce human life to a bargaining chip.”  
    
            Her stance has drawn criticism from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who told Meloni at a G7 summit last month that Canada was “concerned” about some of Italy’s positions on LGBTQ+ rights.  Meloni responded that her government is following court decisions and not deviating from previous adminstrations.
    
            Italy’s Association of Rainbow Families, which represents LGBTQ+ families, condemned the Padua prosecutor’s move as “shameful” in a civilized country.
    
            “This is the first time that all of a city’s certificates have been challenged so many years after they were formed, and for this to happen as a result of pressure on mayors from a ministry and a government is something that should give anyone pause about the tightness of our democracy,” the association said Wednesday on its Facebook page.
    
            “Our families in Padua have been overwhelmed by a real tsunami: little girls and boys risk seeing their mothers, brothers and sisters erased, who will no longer be considered as such, becoming strangers before the Italian state,” it said.
    
            The minister for parliamentary elections, Luca Ciriani, defended the prosecutor’s decision. The prosecutor’s office “simply applied the law, as recalled by a Supreme Court ruling. In Italy, marriage is only between a man and a woman, and therefore only the biological parent is the parent whose surname can be registered,” Ciriani said Tuesday on RTL radio.  
    
            Chiara Gribaudo, an MP from the center-left Democratic Party, was at Friday’s protest. She tweeted that a “violent act” had been committed in Padua and that “the law (was) interpreted according to use and consumption to divide the country and discriminate against people.”
    
            And Alessandra Mussolini, a right-wing Member of the European Parliament and granddaughter of dictator Benito Mussolini, said in a video published on Twitter Tuesday: “What happened in Padua, with the prosecutor’s office challenging the birth certificates of children born to homosexual couples, is unworthy of a civilized country. It is like going to throw a bomb into a family and it just happens to hit only the children. An established chain of affection has been broken and tried to be broken.”

      Abortion is ancient history: Long before Roe, women terminated pregnancies
    ","
			By Katie Hunt, CNN

    ","
            Abortion today, at least in the United States, is a political, legal and moral powder keg. But for long stretches of history, terminating an unwanted pregnancy, especially in the early stages, was a relatively uncontroversial fact of life, historians say.
    
            Egyptian papyrus, Greek plays, Roman coins, the medieval biographies of saints, medical and midwifery manuals, and Victorian newspaper and pamphlets reveal that abortion was more common in premodern times than people might think.
    
            This long view of abortion matters, according to Mary Fissell, a professor of the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. That’s because assumptions about how abortion was viewed in the past color present-day arguments about abortion rights. Those rights have been severely restricted in many US states since Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that effectively made abortion legally available, was overturned on June 24, 2022, by the US Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
    
            Abortion opponents portray the rights granted by Roe v. Wade and legal access to abortion as an historical aberration, according to Fissell, which is not accurate, historians say.
    
            “We have to understand that this is much more changeable than we’ve been led to believe. There’s a steady constant of women terminating pregnancies throughout history, but the meanings of that act have changed very significantly over time and will continue to change,” said Fissell, who is working on “Long Before Roe,” a book on the history of abortion that will publish in 2025.
    
            “The Dobbs decision was not inevitable, but rather a part of a much longer cycle of restriction versus acceptance,” she said.  
    
            The first written references to abortion are contained in an ancient Egyptian papyrus written about 3,500 years ago. The Ebers Papyrus, a medical text, suggested around 1550 BC that abortion could be induced using a “plant-fibre tampon coated with a compound that included honey and crushed dates.”
    
            In ancient Greek and Rome, references to abortion and botanical substances that induce abortion were common in medical and other texts — although it’s not clear how widely they were used, Fissell said.
    
            In 411 BC, Greek playwright Aristophanes in his play Lysistrata described a desirable young woman as “trimmed and spruced with pennyroyal,” a plant thought to induce abortion.
    
            Plants and botanical substances can have toxic effects, and there’s no evidence on whether historical methods to induce abortion were effective or not.
    
            In ancient Rome, another plant that was thought to end an unwanted pregnancy (among other uses), was so valued it disappeared — the first recorded extinction in world history, according to archaeologist Lisa Briggs, a research fellow at Cranfield University and a visiting researcher at the British Museum.
    
            Silphium, also used to flavor food, was traded across the ancient Roman empire. The city state of Cyrene (in modern-day Libya), the only region where the plant grew, based its whole economy on the plant. It appeared on coins and other artifacts unearthed from the region, Briggs said.
    
            “Contemporary authors said it was worth its weight in gold and silver. And so it clearly had a value beyond just its tastiness. I suspect that women’s desire to use it as an abortifacient is one of the reasons the price was driven up,” said Briggs, who is searching for archaeological evidence of the plant, which was turned into a resin, in shipwrecks and museum collections.
    
            Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and philosopher who was born around 23 AD, described the plant’s ability to expel an unborn fetus along with other medical uses. It’s impossible to know for sure whether the plant would have had the desired effect, but modern-day studies on related Ferula plants and lab rats showed the plants “exhibit anti-fertility properties in rodents,” Briggs wrote in a paper she coauthored last year. 
    
            Briggs believes demand for the plant among women may have been a key factor, although not the only reason, for its extinction. The plant was resistant to cultivation, Briggs noted, and climate change and a shift in soil characteristics may also have been factors. 
    
            It’s sometimes assumed that Christianity has always unequivocally condemned abortion but Maeve Callan, a professor and historian of religion at Simpson College in Iowa, said this misrepresents the past.
    
            “People act like there’s only one acceptable attitude towards abortion if you’re Catholic, or if you’re Christian more broadly, or even if you’re religious more broadly. And there’s always been a diversity of viewpoints,” said Callan, the author of the book “Sacred Sisters: Gender, Sanctity, and Power in Medieval Ireland.”
    
            Her research, along with other scholars, has uncovered four medieval Irish saints who celebrated ending pregnancy among their miracles, according to medieval manuscripts that described saints’ lives. Typically, these miracles include a nun who has breached her vow to chastity and become pregnant but, through the saint’s intervention, the pregnancy miraculously disappears.
    
            The most famous was Saint Brigid, a lesser-known patron saint of Ireland than Patrick, and one whose standing was honored with an inaugural public holiday this year.
    
            According to a churchman named Cogitosus, who wrote the first biography of Brigid around 650 AD — some 200 years after her birth — she miraculously ended a woman’s unwanted pregnancy, “causing the fetus to disappear without coming to birth and without pain.”
    
            Another saint, Ciarán of Saigir, rescued a nun abducted by a king, according to a biography:  “When the man of God returned to the monastery with the girl, she confessed that she was pregnant. Then the man of God, led by the zeal of justice, not wishing the serpent’s seed to quicken, pressed down on her womb with the sign of the cross and forced her womb to be emptied.”
    
            Callan is quick to point out that these Irish saints weren’t champions of choice for women when it came to unwanted pregnancy, nor was it likely that these saints actually performed abortions.
    
            “The miracles show people’s attitudes toward abortion and in some circumstances it was seen as acceptable, even as a miraculous blessing.”
    
            According to Callan, the Old Irish Penitential, a book that details punishments for sins, the penance for abortion depended on the stage of pregnancy, divided into three, like trimesters: In the first, three and a half years of penance; in the second, seven years; in the third, 14 years. But as Callan put it, “pretty much everything was a sin.” The Old Irish Penitential also stipulates that oral sex merits four or five years’ penance the first time, seven years if it is repeated.
    
            “It’s not permissive. Abortion is not okay (according to these teachings). It’s just less of a sin.”
    
            The idea that life begins at conception becomes dominant in Catholic teachings only about 150 years ago, according to Callan.
    
            Previously, Catholic teachings suggested that a fetus becomes a person some weeks if not months later, once it receives a rational soul — known as “ensoulment.” This often gets associated with “quickening,” when the mother feels the fetus move for the first time, generally in the fifth month of pregnancy.
    
            It wasn’t until 1588, that Pope Sixtus V officially classified abortion, regardless of the stage of fetal development, as homicide. However, after Sixtus’s death in 1590, Pope Gregory XIV quickly rolled back the dictate, limiting it to ensouled fetuses.
    
            In research for her upcoming book, Fissell said she had uncovered that “what people dislike about abortion changes immensely over time.”
    
            In ancient Rome, for example, abortion was only an issue for elite women, who were thought to be covering up adulterous relationships. In the Renaissance, abortion was linked to witchcraft. For most of history, abortion has not been an issue about the fetus, like it is today, but rather about women’s behavior.
    
            “This whole innocent unborn life that is the language of the American right today, that’s only (in recent) decades. Sometimes abortion was something people didn’t like because it pointed to illicit sex. Women have always terminated pregnancies, for as far back in the historical record we can see,” said Fissell.  “I think the long view is really important. Things were not always as they are today.”

      The fight to repeal one of the most outdated abortion laws in the world
    ","

            Hundreds of protesters lined the street outside the UK’s High Court on Saturday holding picket signs that read “Our bodies, Our right to decide,” before marching through the streets of central London demanding reformed abortion laws for women in England and Wales. 
    
            Earlier this month, a British woman who used medication to terminate a pregnancy after the UK’s legally allowed limit was sentenced to 28 months in prison under Victorian-era legislation, in a case that has sparked calls for an overhaul of reproductive justice laws in the country. The woman, who has three children, will serve 14 months in custody and the remainder on license after her release.  
    
            One year after the US Supreme Court struck down Roe v Wade and reignited a worldwide protest movement against restricting abortion access, pro-choice advocates in the UK say little progress has been made to increase access to reproductive health services.  
    
            “It’s just ridiculous that the state, the government, keeps just involving themselves like in birthing people’s rights to choose abortion,” Nadia Hirsi, a 23-year-old actress and theater maker based in London, told CNN as she attended the protest in central London. 
    
            Jennifer Dean, a London-based blogger in their 50s, who was also at the protest, said: “Our body, our choice means as much to the trans community as it does to cisgender women … I don’t have a womb. But, you know, it should be ‘whoever has a womb should have the choice what they do with it.’” 
    
            Jenny Wickham, a 75-year-old pro-choice campaigner who has been demonstrating since the 1960s, told CNN: “The liberalization of abortion law is under threat like never before.”
    
            Abortion is currently legal in the UK up to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. After this threshold, women found to have administered drugs to terminate a pregnancy are liable to receive a prison sentence up to a life term.  
    
            In the recent headline-making case, the mother-of-three, 44, was handed her 28-month sentence by a judge in Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court in central England under the Offences Against the Person Act, which dates back to 1861. The woman was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant at the time she took the medication, the court heard. 
    
            Barrister Charlotte Proudman called the act itself “ancient” in an interview with CNN, highlighting that it was “written at a time when women didn’t even have the right to vote” in the UK.  
    
            Proudman was one of more than 60 signatories of a letter addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales last summer which highlighted the cases of two women who at the time faced prosecution for terminating a pregnancy.  
    
            She feels “disappointed” that little change has been enacted since the letter, saying there is real fear that “this landmark conviction may result in further convictions.”  
    
            In the past decade, 67 prosecutions have taken place in England and Wales under the same legislation, opposition lawmaker Stella Creasy told the UK parliament on June 15.  
    
            Proudman has observed a “collective outrage and anger” at the recent conviction, especially at “the fact that [the woman] could even be prosecuted for this type of crime.”  
    
            “I think, you know, people generally have been fairly shocked as well that abortion-related offenses still exist on the statute books,” she added.  
    
            Proudman said the decision of the US Supreme Court last year to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade ruling had made her reflect on the state of abortion laws in the UK.  
    
            “I was now thinking, well hang on a minute … look at what’s happening closer to home. England, Wales, Scotland and the fact that abortion still remains a criminal offense subject to certain exceptions,” she said.  
    
            In 2019, lawmakers in the British parliament voted for legislation which ended the criminalization of abortion in Northern Ireland, essentially placing its laws at odds with the rest of the UK.  
    
            Charity campaigners like Katherine O’Brien of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said they are now making what she called a “straightforward” argument for the extension of this legislation to the rest of the UK.  
    
            “When they amended the law to allow greater access to abortion care in Northern Ireland, what they did was they removed the criminalization of women for ending their own pregnancy. So, we’re effectively asking that politicians do the same,” O’Brien told CNN.  
    
            Proudman, the barrister, points to Canada as a further example, referring to its historic decision to decriminalize abortion 30 years ago.  
    
            The recent criminal conviction in Stoke-On-Trent has only highlighted how “restrictive” and “draconian” UK abortion laws are, O’Brien said.  
    
            “Even when we talk about Poland, or we talk about laws in Texas, even, you know, very anti-abortion politicians there aren’t proposing laws which see women sent to prison for life for ending their own pregnancy,” she stressed.
    
            Restrictive abortion care policies result in forced pregnancies that doctors say expose women of color to a maternal health crisis, exacerbated by existing economic and racial inequalities. 
    
            Dr. Annabel Sowemimo, a community sexual and reproductive health registrar, said liberalizing abortion measures allows patients to access the procedure earlier on in their pregnancy “in the comfort of their own environment.” 
    
            In August, the UK government introduced permanent access to early medical abortions at home. The legislation stipulates that women can access pills to be taken at home for gestation of up to nine weeks and six days, after a teleconsultation.  
    
            There were 214,256 abortions for women living in England and Wales in 2021, representing the highest uptake since the 1967 Abortion Act, according to the UK government website. Of those, 89% were carried out under 10 weeks.  
    
            “If abortion isn’t legal and isn’t free at the point of delivery then people tend to go on later and leave it [and] can’t access services,” Sowemimo told CNN. 
    
            “When we don’t have safe and legal routes to abortion it ends up with more dead pregnant people,” she said. “The issue is multiplied when people are marginalized.” 
    
            Black people in England are nearly four times more likely to die while giving birth than White women, according to a recent confidential inquiry into maternal deaths ​(MBRRACE-UK).  
    
            Similar figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than White women, due to factors including structural racism and implicit bias.  
    
            Charities such as BPAS which provide abortion care to women on behalf of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) maintain that the current abortion laws are making life “more difficult” for providers, clinicians and women themselves.  
    
            “For women to be learning that abortion is a crime, and how that then makes them feel when they need that care – the impact that that can have is really quite profound,” O’Brien said.  
    
            She believes that people in the UK are however seeing “the real-life impacts of the current laws” and are “really ready to take action.” 
    
            The voting record of British lawmakers provides further encouragement, according to O’Brien, referencing recent laws creating abortion buffer zones and approving the extension of provision of abortion pills by post.  
    
            Proudman hopes that action can be taken now to “put decriminalization on the political agenda for real” amid a growing consensus that “these laws don’t work.”  
    
            “They don’t work for women and girls, far from it. They don’t work when you have women behind bars who have been vulnerable and require support and compassion,” she said.

      Casper Star-Tribune: Judge blocks Wyoming’s first-in-nation ban on medication abortion

            Medication abortion will remain legal in Wyoming for now after a district judge on Thursday blocked the state’s ban on abortion pills, according to the Casper Star-Tribune. 
    
            The law, intended to take effect July 1, would have prohibited the prescription, sale and use of abortion pills – the first such measure in the nation. It joins the state’s near-total abortion ban, which has also been halted as legal challenges play out. 
    
            The Teton County District Court clerk’s office confirmed to CNN that district judge Melissa Owens had held a three-hour hearing in the case Thursday and issued a verbal order from the bench. The order had not yet been written and filed as of Thursday evening, according to the office. 
    
            After hearing from attorneys on both sides, Owens issued the pause on enforcement of the abortion pills measure, adding that Wyoming residents want to make their own health care decisions, the Star-Tribune said..
    
            “Essentially the government under this law is making the decision for a woman rather than the woman making her own health care choice, which is what the overwhelming majority in Wyoming decided that we should get to do,” Owens said during the hearing, the newspaper reported.
    
            Owens had also temporarily blocked the state’s near-total ban in March, with a full trial set for April 2024.
    
            The abortion pills ban, signed by Republican Gov. Mark Gordon in March, states that “it shall be unlawful to prescribe, dispense, distribute, sell or use any drug for the purpose of procuring or performing an abortion on any person.” Woman who received a medication abortion could not be criminally prosecuted under the law, which includes exceptions for medically necessary treatment to preserve the woman’s life or health and in cases of sexual assault or incest. 
    
            At the time of its passage, NARAL Pro-Choice America slammed the “first-of-its-kind ban” as evidence that “there’s no stone that anti-choice extremists will leave unturned.”

            A 2-year-old boy in Norwalk, Ohio, shot his pregnant mother in the back, killing her and the unborn child, police say.
    
            Police received a call just after 1 p.m. on June 16 from the 31-year-old mother, who said she was “shot in the back by her 2-year-old son,” according to a news release from the Norwalk Police Department. 
    
            She also informed the dispatcher she was eight months pregnant, the release said. Moments later, her husband called 911 and stated “he received a phone call from his wife ‘screaming something about my son and needing to call 911.’”
    
            Officers arrived at the house and forced entry through a locked front door, according to the release. 
    
            Both the mother and her son “were found in the upstairs master bedroom, along with” a pistol, the release said. 
    
            The son was removed from the room at the request of his mother, and officers rendered aid. 
    
            The mother was “fully conscious” and gave officers a “complete account of the events that occurred,” according to authorities. Her husband, who is 28, later also arrived at the home.
    
            The mother was transported to a medical center where an emergency C-section was performed. The unborn son was later pronounced dead, followed by the mother.
    
            The weapon, along with a spent shell casing, was seized from the home, police said, adding that the pistol’s magazine was loaded with an additional 12 rounds.
    
            The Norwalk Police Department’s detective bureau executed a search warrant and found a number of child safety features in the home, including safety gates at almost every doorway and child locks on all drawers, the release said.
    
            During their search, detectives seized an additional 12-round magazine for the pistol that the 2-year-old had gotten hold of in a nightstand in the master bedroom. They also discovered a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun with six rounds in the master bedroom closet and an airsoft rifle in the computer room closet.
    
            The investigation is ongoing, police said. No charges have been filed at this time, according to the release, and the case will be forwarded to Huron County Prosecutor’s Office.

      One year after Dobbs decision, families describe terror, trauma and putting ‘pain to purpose’

    ","
            As Amanda Zurawski walked into a Capitol Hill hearing room in April, she was awestruck at what she was about to do: testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
    
            Presidents had testified in this room. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of her heroes, had testified in this room.
    
            It was an unlikely turn for Zurawski, a 36-year-old high-tech analyst from Austin, Texas, who thought she would be caring for a newborn this spring, not testifying to the US Senate.
    
            She found herself on Capitol Hill because last summer, she nearly died after she was unable to get an abortion.
    
            “It was surreal,” she said of her Capitol Hill experience. “[But] this is my responsibility, and I take it very seriously.”
    
            Since the Dobbs decision one year ago that overturned the federal right to an abortion under Roe v. Wade, CNN has interviewed eight women who struggled to get abortions they needed for medical reasons.
    
            Some of the women nearly died because they couldn’t terminate their pregnancies promptly. Many of them had to travel out of state to get the care they needed.
    
            As states continue to pass more and more restrictive abortion bans, the women continue to fight for reproductive rights, even when they’ve received hateful messages on social media, many of them saying they made up their stories.
    
            “No one can tell me that my experience is wrong,” said Jill Hartle, a hair salon owner who had to travel out of her home state of South Carolina to terminate a pregnancy after learning that her fetus had a severe heart defect. “They can’t tell me my feelings are wrong. They can’t tell me the trauma is not valid. Nobody can take that away from me. I feel so confident in what I’m speaking to, because I’ve experienced it.”
    
            The other women interviewed by CNN this past year include a beauty blogger and a teacher from Texas, a hair stylist and a nurse from Ohio, a social worker from Georgia and a stay-at-home mother from Florida.
    
            CNN checked in with several of the women to see what has unfolded since they shared their stories.
    
            Marlena Stell, a beauty blogger from Texas, never expected to incur the wrath of an elected official.
    
            In 2021, when she was 9½ weeks pregnant, an ultrasound showed that her fetus had died. Texas had passed a strict anti-abortion law just a few weeks before, and Stell spent two weeks looking for an obstetrician who was willing to remove the remains.
    
            After Stell, 43, told her story to CNN in July 2022, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the report “fake news” and “all made up” and said the doctor made “a very poor decsion.” He made the comments on BlazeTV, a conservative media organization.
    
            After the Dobbs decision, Paxton issued guidance on Texas’ abortion laws, stating that the laws do not prohibit a procedure to “remove a dead, unborn child whose death was caused by spontaneous abortion.”
    
            Stell says that after Paxton’s appearance on the BlazeTV show, her social media accounts were inundated with thousands of hateful, sometimes vulgar, messages, many of them calling her a liar. She was already emotionally fragile from the loss of a child, and the onslaught of comments was devastating.
    
            She said it was “extremely frustrating” that Paxton “never reached out to me once, even to hear my side of the story or get proof of what he was saying.”
    
            Ten months later, she took note when the Texas House of Representatives voted to impeach Paxton after a legislative probe found that he had engaged in years of corruption, which he has denied.
    
            “Karma’s a b*tch,” she said.
    
            Stell says that despite the online attacks, she’s glad she spoke up last summer, just weeks after the Dobbs decision.
    
            “I knew even back then that this was going to happen to other women, and it was going to get worse. So that’s why, for me, it was really critical to speak out when I did,” she said.
    
            After Beth and Kyle Long told their story to CNN, they received a note from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican.
    
            His note made an agonizing situation even worse, they said.
    
            In January, when Long was 18 weeks pregnant, an ultrasound showed that most of her fetus’ organs were outside its body. A doctor involved with Long’s care told CNN that the girl they named Star wouldn’t survive.
    
            They say their doctor urged them to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible because the bigger the fetus was, the higher the risk of complications for Long.
    
            Ending the pregnancy was legal in Ohio, but Long is a nurse at a state-owned hospital, and Ohio law bans her health insurance from paying for abortions except in certain cases. Endangerment to the life of the mother is one of them, and although she was at an increased risk for potentially deadly complications, Beth’s life was not in imminent danger. The couple spent an agonizing three weeks locating a hospital out of state that would give them a discounted rate for the procedure.
    
            In January, Kyle sent an email to DeWine, who sent a handwritten note back.
    
            “I am so sorry to hear about what you [and] your wife are going through. This must be so very difficult. Thank you for sharing your story,” read the note, which Kyle says he received in April.
    
            “This f**ker wrote back to Kyle MONTHS later, didn’t bother to learn my name or Star’s name. We are just ‘wife and baby,’ ” Long wrote on a post on Facebook and Instagram. “I wish him nothing but suffering. May he never know peace.”
    
            DeWine’s office confirmed that he wrote the note and said, “It is the opinion of our office that the procedure recommended for Ms. Long was both legal under Ohio law and not prohibited from state employee insurance coverage pursuant to state law. … This should likely have been considered a therapeutic abortion under Ohio law.”
    
            Long is helping gather signatures to put an initiative for reproductive rights on the Ohio ballot. She said that recovering emotionally - from Star’s death, from the fight to get the abortion, from DeWine’s note - has been challenging.
    
            “People suggest counseling, planting a tree in her memory, naming a star, etc. and we have done all of that and it all still hurts so much,” she wrote to CNN. “I don’t think there is anything to make it better, and seeing the division and politicization of women’s health across the nation is mentally debilitating.”
    
            In August 2022, when Zurawski, the high-tech analyst from Texas, was 18 weeks pregnant, her water broke. Her cervix was fully dilated, and her obstetrician said the fetus couldn’t survive without the amniotic fluid that was leaking out of her womb.
    
            But her doctors said they couldn’t terminate the pregnancy because of Texas law. That law allows for abortions when a pregnant person’s life is in danger, but it doesn’t give specific guidelines. Eventually, Zurawski developed an infection and became septic, and her doctors would only do the abortion when she was near death.
    
            Seven months later, in March, Zurawski and four other Texas women who say the state’s abortion bans posed significant risks to their health sued the state. The lawsuit bears her name: Zurawski v. State of Texas.
    
            A month later, in her congressional testimony, she addressed her senators, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, testifying that her “horrific” experience was a result of policies they support. “I nearly died on their watch,” she said.
    
            Since the CNN story, Zurawski has also been a guest of first lady Jill Biden at the State of the Union speech and met Vice President Kamala Harris at an event marking the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. She’s become a focal point for women who’ve suffered under abortion bans.
    
            “I’ve heard a lot of other people’s traumatic stories, which has been difficult. But I’m happy to provide a place for people to tell their stories,” she said.
    
            Zurawski, still grieving the loss of her daughter, Willow, said she “certainly did not expect my life to take this direction.” She said that her advocacy work can sometimes be “draining” but that her family and her employer have been “incredibly supportive.”
    
            She knows not all women are as fortunate. She’s heard from others who had similar experiences to hers but can’t speak up because they risk alienating their families or losing their jobs. Some of those women, she said, fear for their safety if they tell their stories.
    
            “I can speak up. I’m not scared,” she added. “I have all the right pieces in place [to advocate], and so I will.”
    
            When CNN wrote about Jill Hartle on December 23, she had recently lost her daughter, Ivy Grace, who had a severe congenital heart defect, at nearly 25 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            Hartle, now 36, and her husband, Matt, were dreading the next few days: December 25 was Christmas, the next day was Jill’s birthday, and the day after that was Ivy’s due date.
    
            That week turned out to be just as horrific as they thought it would be. There was, Matt said, “an extra sense of sadness.”
    
            But the couple decided to “put pain to purpose,” his wife said.
    
            This spring, as South Carolina legislators considered a six-week abortion ban, the Hartles, both conservative Christians, spent days at the Capitol, telling legislators their story.
    
            Hartle was 18 weeks pregnant when they learned that their daughter had a severe heart defect. The couple say their doctors explained that Ivy might be stillborn and, if she were born alive, would live for a few days at most.
    
            They wanted to terminate the pregnancy to spare their daughter pain, but their doctors said that was illegal in South Carolina. The couple then spent several wrenching weeks arranging to terminate the pregnancy out of state in September.
    
            This spring, at the South Carolina Capitol, the Hartles told legislators their story, speaking individually to several Republican lawmakers and testifying to the state House Judiciary Committee.
    
            The “extra stress that this state has caused me” led to “so much mental trauma [that] I will deal with it for the rest of my life,” she testified.
    
            She said many of the Republican lawmakers they spoke to personally seemed sympathetic but then voted in favor of a bill that bans abortions in most cases.
    
            The bill does have an exception in the case of “fatal fetal anomalies,” requiring doctors to put in writing “medical rationale for making the determination that with or without the provision of life-preserving treatment life after birth would be unsustainable.”
    
            The Hartles had urged legislators to be more specific about what constitutes a fatal fetal anomaly. They explained to the lawmakers that for many severe birth defects, a baby can live for a few minutes or hours after birth before dying. Other times, extreme measures, such as life support, could possibly keep the baby alive for a period of time after birth. Doctors, afraid of facing prison time, and hospital attorneys might not consider those “fatal fetal anomalies” under the law and therefore might not offer an abortion.
    
            In the end, the legislators passed a law that didn’t contain the provisions the Hartles had fought for.
    
            “To watch them completely vote against everything that we talked about – it [was] devastating,” Hartle said. “They left us hanging out to dry.”
    
            A day after South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signed the bill into law, a state judge temporarily blocked it from going into effect.
    
            Hartle said she’ll continue advocating for reproductive rights because of support from family, friends and people she doesn’t know.
    
            “I get messages from women that say, ‘I don’t have the strength to stand up to these people. I’m so grateful that you and your husband are,’ and that keeps me going,” she said.
    
            A documentary the Hartles made about their daughter has won several awards at film festivals.
    
            She said people have written her to say, “Your story literally changed my vote. Your documentary literally opened my eyes, and I changed my vote based on that.’ ”
    
            Hartle says this was all completely unexpected: that her pregnancy with Ivy “thrusted me into the political realm that I never thought I would be in.”
    
            But looking back at her life – she majored in journalism in college, and for years, she has spent her days in the hair salon talking to people of various backgrounds – she now sees a “timeline” that’s led her to where she is today.
    
            “I can’t tell you that 20-year-old me was confident enough to do this. When I look at my life as a whole, now I do feel confident enough to do this,” she said.
    
            Kailee DeSpain, the Texas teacher interviewed by CNN, has had a rocky road with a happy ending.
    
            DeSpain, now 30, had a miscarriage in 2016 and then later had two more. In November 2021, she became pregnant again, and she and her husband, Cade, prayed for a “sticky” baby – a pregnancy that would last.
    
            About three months into the pregnancy, the DeSpains learned that their son, whom they named Finley, had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. Carrying him to term put DeSpain at high risk for severe pregnancy complications, including blood clots, preeclampsia and cancer.
    
            Doctors told them they couldn’t terminate the pregnancy because of Texas’s six-week abortion ban, in place even before the Dobbs decision. In March 2022, the DeSpains drove 10 hours to New Mexico to get the procedure.
    
            Later that year, she became pregnant again, and in April, DeSpain gave birth to a boy, Nolan. It wasn’t an easy pregnancy; they thought she was miscarrying at seven weeks, and she was hospitalized for signs of preeclampsia and then was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Nolan was born full-term by emergency C-section, but he wasn’t breathing on his own and spent 17 days in the neonatal intensive care unit.
    
            “I’ve been really disappointed in everything that continues to happen in Texas, and our laws just seem to get worse rather than better,” DeSpain said, adding that she hopes the Zurawski lawsuit is successful because “the state has caused so much pain to so many people with its abortion laws.”
    
            Other women struggle with pregnancy plans.
    
            Another pregnancy might not be an option for Zurawski, the Texas high-tech analyst who testified before Congress.
    
            She said that after she became septic and had emergency surgery to terminate her pregnancy, she had scar tissue in her uterus and right fallopian tube. Another procedure cleared out the tissue in her uterus, but she said the fallopian tube is permanently scarred over.
    
            Some of the other women interviewed by CNN say they’re fearful that if they get pregnant in their home states, they might once again not be able to get the care they need.
    
            In March, Melissa Novak, a social worker and sex therapist in Georgia, found out that the fetus she was carrying had died. Her doctor prescribed only one of the pills in a two-pill combination approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to terminate an early pregnancy.
    
            At the time, her doctor mentioned pending litigation that would ban access to mifepristone, the drug the doctor did not prescribe.
    
            With just the other pill, Novak had, according to her medical records, an “incomplete septic abortion,” was hospitalized for days and needed emergency surgery.
    
            Novak, 39, said she and her husband want to have a baby but worry about trying again.
    
            “Will I be a person that miscarries a lot, and what will that miscarriage care look like?” she asked. “Will I be able to get what I need? Will my doctors feel able to give me what I need?
    
            “It weighs a little heavy on my heart,” she added.
    
            Stell, the Texas beauty blogger, and her husband want to give their 3-year-old daughter, Adelina, a brother or sister, but they say they won’t do it in Texas because they worry about Stell’s health. Also, she’s starting a new company, and her employees will probably be young women.
    
            “We’re just looking for states that would be best for the women that I hire,” Stell said. “As a beauty brand, I don’t want to subject them to a state that’s going to put their health at risk. It doesn’t make me feel good as an employer.”
    
            Hartle, the hair stylist in South Carolina, said she and her husband also aren’t sure whether they want to have a baby where they live now.
    
            “It’s very scary,” she said. “It’s quite terrifying to be in a state that – God forbid if something else happens and something’s wrong – that we wouldn’t be able to be helped.”
    
            For now, they’re trying to change laws while grieving the loss of their daughter.
    
            “We’re still recovering. We’re still processing the pain that our state put us through.”

      Trump struggles to navigate defining 2024 campaign issue: Abortion
    ","
			By Alayna Treene and Kristen Holmes, CNN
		;Alayna Treene;Kristen Holmes","
  Published
        2:06 PM EDT, Thu June 22, 2023
    ","
            A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade – a decision largely made possible by Donald Trump – the former president finds himself struggling with how to navigate one of the defining issues of the 2024 presidential campaign: abortion. 
    
            And it isn’t going unnoticed.   
    
            Anti-abortion activists have watched nervously as Trump dodges questions on how he would handle a federal abortion ban. Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, his chief rival in the GOP presidential primary, has sought to outflank Trump on the issue and has embraced it as a key feature of his campaign.  
    
            Trump’s appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court during his time in the White House made him the architect of the post-Dobbs world, a decision that thrilled a huge faction of the Republican Party and many of the evangelical Christian voters Trump has viewed as central to both his 2016 presidential win and his 2024 campaign.   
    
            Yet even as he wants to take credit for the decision that changed the political and legal landscape of abortion, the former president has privately blamed abortion hard-liners for the party’s lackluster 2022 midterm results and attempted to largely steer clear of the issue on the campaign trail, offering only a series of muddled responses when pressed on whether he would sign a federal abortion bill into law – something many within the conservative movement see as the next frontier in this fight.  
    
            “What I’ll do is negotiate so people are happy,” Trump told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins during the network’s town hall in New Hampshire last month.  
    
            In this post-Dobbs world, Trump has told allies and advisers that abortion isn’t a winning campaign issue for Republicans, and that tacking too far to the right on abortion policy could end up costing him support from key voters – particularly among suburban White women, a demographic he has long coveted. 
    
            CNN interviewed five people close to Trump who have spoken at length with the former president about his anti-abortion views. Many of them described Trump’s current refusal to publicly back a national ban as being driven by his own political instincts – and a desire to avoid a political landmine.  
    
            “Trump will do and say whatever he needs to do to win the nomination. He doesn’t think coming out for a federal ban is a good idea politically,” one of the sources said.   
    
            Behind closed doors, Trump and his advisers have acknowledged they need to broaden his base if he is going to win not only the GOP nomination, but the general election, and they fear alienating large swaths of voters with harsh language around abortion.  
    
            “This is all just Trump driven, of him not wanting to step into a general election trap,” a Trump ally told CNN.  
    
            Some Trump advisers insisted the former president is aware of the importance of supporting a national ban on abortion, particularly in the primary, as other GOP candidates like DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have sought to run to the right of the former president on the issue. And Trump remains eager to take credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade and use his role to prove his conservative chops in certain circles.   
    
            “Multiple things can be true at once,” an adviser to the former president said. “He was the best president for the pro-life movement in history. He supports exceptions. He does not oppose a federal role, but he also doesn’t think it is a winning issue.”   
    
            Trump has so far refused to answer whether or not he supports a federal ban on abortion, but he may be forced to face the issue directly sooner rather than later.   
    
            The former president’s ambiguity on the issue will be front and center this weekend, when the 2024 GOP presidential contenders gather at the Road to Majority conference in Washington, DC. The Faith and Freedom Coalition, the organizers behind the event, characterize the conference as “the largest public policy gathering of conservative and Christian activists in the nation.” 
    
            The topic of abortion will be a crucial focus of the conference, event organizers tell CNN, and when Trump takes the stage on Saturday, many will be watching if he uses the opportunity to clarify his position or finally come out in support of a national abortion ban. 
    
            Ralph Reed, founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and a longtime Trump ally, told CNN, “Republicans have to get off their back heels and get on offense” regarding abortion.  
    
            As for where the party – and its eventual presidential nominee – will land on the issue, Reed said, “It’s going to be a highly organic process among the candidates, their campaigns, the pro-life movement, and the Republican Party that will likely land at a message that stresses most action at the state level, some commonsense federal standard & a ban on taxpayer funding of abortion. Then hammer away at how extreme the liberals’ position is.”  
    
            “The politics of abortion, like all politics, is simple: when you’re explaining, you’re losing,” he added.  
    
            DeSantis, who will address the conference on Friday, signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida earlier this year – a measure that goes further than the 15-week ban being embraced by many other Republicans and which Trump has described as “too harsh.” The ban still faces an additional hurdle at the Florida Supreme Court, which is considering a challenge to the state’s 15-week ban enacted last year. The six-week ban will not go into effect until after the court rules in the case.
    
            Regardless, DeSantis is expected to tout the passage of that bill during his keynote address, a source familiar with his remarks tells CNN.  
    
            The Florida governor has also heavily criticized Trump’s unwillingness so far to back a federal ban and recently told “The 700 Club” that he believes the former president has gone soft on the issue.   
    
            Some Trump allies and conservative leaders who, like DeSantis, have taken note of Trump’s vague rhetoric on abortion politics, recently attempted to intervene.   
    
            Anti-abortion leaders huddled with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago home in May and tried to convince him to solidify his stance on the issue and embrace a 15-week national abortion ban. Trump, however, refused to do so, even as some of his top advisers and allies have told him he will ultimately need to support such a measure, sources familiar with the talks tell CNN.   
    
            The meeting was arranged by Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, the crafter of a 15-week abortion bill, and included Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, and Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.  
    
            It served in part as an attempt for Dannenfelser to smooth things over with the former president after she publicly criticized his 2024 campaign for saying abortion should be decided at the state level, saying it was a “morally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate to hold.”   
    
            The anti-abortion leaders also used the meeting to try and persuade Trump to take a harder-line position on abortion. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the events, Dannenfelser, Perkins and Graham walked the former president through polling that showed a majority of voters think abortion should be limited after the first trimester.
    
            Trump made clear that whatever position he ultimately takes must include exceptions for the life of the mother, rape and incest – a distinction he believes is crucial to remaining politically popular – but refused to commit to a federal abortion ban.  
    
            “[Trump told them] that rather than get hung up on 12 weeks, 15 weeks, 16 weeks, his threshold is when the baby can feel pain,” one of the sources said. 
    
            Following the meeting, Dannenfelser issued a statement calling it a “terrific” session and gave a vague indication that Trump would support some sort of federal action.
    
            But just days later, Trump again cast uncertainty onto his stance, declining to say at what point in a pregnancy abortion should be outlawed. 
    
            “Some people are at six weeks, some people are at three weeks, two weeks,” Trump said at CNN’s town hall. “President Trump is going to make a determination what he thinks is great for the country.” 
    
            Some Trump advisers acknowledge the former president’s response lacked clarity, which means he will need to address the issue more directly as the campaign moves forward. When he does, some allies say they expect he will ultimately support a federal ban. 
    
            “Trump will probably commit to 15 weeks by the end of the campaign, but he knows Congress can’t pass it, and he doesn’t want to piss people off,” a source close to the former president said following the town hall.

      Maternal deaths in US hospitals are declining, study suggests, but birthing complications are rising
    ","
			By Jacqueline Howard, CNN

        11:00 AM EDT, Thu June 22, 2023
    ","
            The rate of pregnant women dying of delivery-related causes in the hospital appears to have declined significantly – by more than 50% – across the United States in recent years, a new study suggests.
    
            That decline, seen among more than 11 million hospital patients, came over a 14-year period from 2008 through 2021, according to the national study, published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open. But the decrease represents only in-hospital maternal deaths, not the nation’s overall maternal mortality rate, which has been on the rise.
    
            “Much of the reporting on maternal mortality has focused on the increasing maternal mortality rates. As a result, this has led many people to believe that hospitals may be the main cause of maternal mortality,” study author Dr. Dorothy Fink, director of the Office on Women’s Health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email.
    
            But the new study suggests that in-hospital maternal deaths may not be among the major drivers of the nation’s overall maternal mortality rate.
    
            “This study specifically looked at inpatient delivery-related outcomes and found a 57% decrease from 2008-2021,” Fink wrote.
    
            “This study also looked with greater granularity on the impact of race, ethnicity and age,” she said. “Mortality for American Indian women decreased 92%, Asian women decreased 73%, Black women decreased 76%, Hispanic women decreased 60%, Pacific Islander women decreased 79% and White women decreased 40% in the study period.”
    
            In contrast, from 2008 through 2021, the new study found a rise in the rates of severe maternal morbidity, or unexpected complications of labor and delivery that can have significant acute or long-term consequences to a woman’s health. Severe maternal morbidity “is likely increasing due to the overall health of US women giving birth, including increases in maternal age, obesity, and preexisting medical conditions,” Fink said.
    
            While the study suggests good news for maternal mortality rates among in-hospital deliveries, many maternal deaths still happen outside of the hospital setting, during pregnancy or postpartum.
    
            It’s estimated that among pregnancy-related deaths, about 53% have occurred seven to 365 days postpartum, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 80% of all pregnancy-related deaths were determined to be preventable.
    
            The new study “seems to contradict the data at the national level where maternal mortality is increasing, because most of the women don’t die in the hospital during childbirth; they die after they left the hospital after childbirth,” said Dr. Jean Guglielminotti, an assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center who was not involved in the new study but has conducted research on severe maternal morbidity.
    
            “But to see a decrease in mortality during hospitalization for childbirth is good news,” he said. “It means that the quality of care has improved a lot.”
    
            Not all expectant mothers, however, have access to such care. Across the US, about 36% of counties are designated as “maternity care deserts,” according to a report released last year by the infant and maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes. A county was classified as a maternity care desert if it had no hospitals providing obstetric care, no birth centers, no ob/gyns and no certified nurse midwives – which can drive maternal mortality rates.
    
            The new study included hospital data on 11.6 million deliveries. The researchers – from HHS and the health care company Premier Inc. – took a close look at patient discharge information from January 2008 to December 2021, including any deaths reported during hospitalization as well as complications or procedures indicative of severe maternal morbidities, such as heart attack, eclampsia or needing blood transfusions.
    
            The data came from the Premier PINC AI Healthcare Database, which comprises more than 1,200 US hospitals and health systems but does not include the type of detailed clinical data found in electronic health records.
    
            The hospital data showed that the rate of delivery-related deaths declined from 10.6 deaths per 100,000 patient discharges in the first quarter of 2008 to 4.6 deaths in the fourth quarter of 2021.
    
            The data also showed an increase in deaths from 2020 through 2021, but the researchers found that could be associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.
    
            Patients with a Covid-19 diagnosis “had a 13-fold increased odds” of death compared with those without Covid-19, the researchers wrote. And after they accounted for Covid-19 diagnoses in the data, they saw a consistent decrease in maternal deaths across the study period.
    
            “This large national study found a decreasing trend of in-hospital delivery-related maternal mortality during 2008 to 2021, regardless of racial or ethnic group, age, or mode of delivery, likely demonstrating the impact of national and local strategies focused on improving the maternal quality of care provided by hospitals during delivery-related hospitalizations,” the researchers wrote.
    
            The overall “decreasing trend” of in-hospital maternal deaths occurred despite increases in the prevalence of severe maternal morbidities among the patients, which climbed from 146.8 cases per 10,000 discharges in the first quarter of 2008 to 179.8 per 10,000 discharges in the fourth quarter of 2021. The biggest increases in severe maternal morbidity were among Pacific Islander, American Indian and Asian patients.
    
            “Maternal mortality has been described as the ‘tip of the iceberg’ and maternal morbidity as a larger problem, ‘the base.’ For every individual who dies as a result of their pregnancy, it is estimated that 20 or 30 more experience significant lifelong complications that affect their health and well-being,” the researchers wrote in the study.
    
            Compared with the prevalence of certain severe maternal morbidities in 2008, there was a higher prevalence in 2021 of sickle cell disease, high blood pressure, severe preeclampsia, substance use disorders, asthma, gestational diabetes, obesity and hemorrhage, the study found.
    
            “The findings in the study are very consistent with what other studies have shown, particularly around trends in severe maternal morbidity,” said Dr. Zsakeba Henderson, senior health adviser for the nonprofit National Institute for Children’s Health Quality in Boston, an expert on maternal and infant health inequities who was not involved in the new study.
    
            For instance, she noted that previously published CDC data found that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity increased almost 200% from 1993 to 2014.
    
            “The take-home message is that we’re still seeing increases in severe maternal morbidity,” Henderson said of the new study.
    
            “They found that there were certain risks associated with the increases. They noticed that cesarean delivery was a contributor, which is not surprising; the CDC reported on that as well previously. Comorbid conditions – or if they have another condition, if they had high blood pressure or are smokers or drug use – that increased the risk of severe morbidity,” she said. “But then the other thing is the disparities. There are persistent disparities, and they saw a statistically significant increased risk of death for American Indians, Blacks and Asians compared with white patients.”
    
            Severe maternal morbidities are known risk factors of maternal deaths. The study found that American Indian, Black and Asian patients “had a statistically significant increased risk of death” compared with white patients when the data did not account for severe maternal morbidities.
    
            The decline in maternal mortality suggests that some national strategies to improve maternal care – such as the nationwide initiative Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health and the CDC’s National Network of Perinatal Quality Collaboratives – have been working, Fink said in her email.
    
            “HHS continues to implement important initiatives focused on improving maternal and infant health. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently finalized two new hospital quality measures on severe obstetric complications and the rate of low-risk Cesarean deliveries, as well as a new ’Birthing-Friendly’ designation that requires hospitals engage in such quality improvement activities,” Fink wrote.
    
            “This new ‘Birthing-Friendly’ designation and other initiatives included in the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis demonstrate HHS and the entire Biden-Harris Administration is prioritizing efforts to improve maternal health outcomes,” she said.
    
            In general, the new study findings suggest that hospitals are “on the right track” when it comes to reducing death rates among people who are in the hospital to deliver a baby, said Dr. Mark Simon, chief medical officer at Ob Hospitalist Group, which provides ob/gyn specialists to hospitals.
    
            “I think we’ve gotten better and more aware of addressing issues that occur in the hospital setting,” said Simon, who was not involved in the new study but has worked to help care teams implement maternal health protocols within hospitals.
    
            He thinks several factors could be playing a role in the decline of maternal deaths within the hospital, including a heightened awareness to follow maternal care protocols, greater awareness of racial disparities in maternal mortality and obstetric hospitalists playing larger roles in care.
    
            But, he added, there is still more work to do to lower the maternal death rates outside of the hospital, especially after childbirth.
    
            “What still concerns me about maternal health in this country is, clearly there’s an issue with postpartum care,” Simon said, referring to the large proportion of maternal deaths that happen after delivery.
    
            “That’s an area that we need to continue to focus on. What do we do for our patients? What do we do for women in this country once they leave the hospital after delivering, making sure that we pay attention to their needs and concerns?” he said. “We might be doing a better job within the hospital, but what’s happening once mom leaves?”

      Opinion: A year since Supreme Court’s abortion ruling, there’s a real human cost
    ","
			Opinion by Samuel Dickman
		","
  Published
        6:22 AM EDT, Thu June 22, 2023
    ","
            One year ago, the Supreme Court eliminated the federal constitutional right to abortion in their Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision. Since then, lawmakers in 20 states — primarily in the South and Midwest — have banned some or all abortions. I often think about how these politicians have taken away patients’ freedom to choose their own medical care, making their personal opinions the most important presence in the exam room.
    
            If they had actually been present in my health center in Montana this year, here’s what they would have seen:
    
            One recent patient traveled nine hours from North Dakota. Last year, she went to a hospital there to replace her contraceptive implant. The religiously-affiliated hospital happily offered to remove the implant for her, but refused to place a new one. When she became pregnant, she had no choice but to spend two full days driving across state lines.
    
            An Idaho patient had to travel with her whole family — four generations piled into a minivan — to get an abortion after she received a devastating diagnosis that meant her fetus would have no chance of survival after birth. She couldn’t get an abortion in Idaho, which has banned all abortions, with no exceptions, and caused an exodus of providers from the state.
    
            A patient from Texas was absent from high school for weeks so she could get to Montana for an abortion. Minors are especially hurt by abortion bans.
    
            When I moved to Montana last year, I knew what was coming. I had already seen the consequences of banning abortion in Texas, where I worked for years as an abortion provider.
    
            In 2021, Texas enacted Senate Bill 8, restricting abortion after six weeks, and giving us a glimpse of what was to come. Under SB 8, we were forced to turn away almost every other patient because they were too far along in their pregnancy, which meant they were left with nothing but bad options: to drive eight or more hours each way to the closest health center in New Mexico, or to try to get medications outside of the formal health care system. Or, of course, they could — and many were forced to — carry a pregnancy to term.
    
            After SB 8 took effect, the joy I felt practicing medicine — a career I had spent years training for — started to drain away. Before that, I felt lucky; every day I got to see firsthand the positive impact my colleagues and I had in our patients’ lives, simply because we were there to help them end a pregnancy safely. In Texas, abortion had become so culturally and politically charged that patients seemed to walk into my clinic expecting to be judged or dismissed. Just a little human decency was enough to elicit over-the-top expressions of gratitude.
    
            And as I tried to settle into a new post-SB 8 routine, the job satisfaction I previously felt was replaced with what psychologists call “moral distress” — the despair that comes from being prevented from providing my patients with the kind of medical care that they sought.
    
            After the Supreme Court’s ruling last year overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion was completely banned in Texas, cutting off what little access remained. Doctors there have been forced to turn away patients, and are not only unable to provide medical care, but are faced with the threat of jail time, fines and potentially losing their medical license.
    
            A friend in Texas, privileged enough to move her family, left the state when she became pregnant because she was worried she would get subpar care if there was a complication. She was right to be concerned: researchers have documented dozens of cases where patients’ health has been compromised in the past year due to abortion bans.
    
            Thousands of people in Texas, and millions in other states who have been robbed of their ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, will never have their stories told. The consequences in the lives of these women and their families — their health, financial status, emotional state and ability to access essential care — will be felt for generations.
    
            These laws worsen the existing health inequities in a country that already has the worst maternal mortality rate among developed countries. Abortion bans and restrictions disproportionately harm marginalized communities. Patients from rural and Indigenous communities, and patients who face barriers like language, immigration status, income, the ability to take time off work, find child care and more, suffer the harshest consequences of abortion bans. Survivors of sexual assault are re-traumatized as they try to overcome obstacles to get abortion care or are forced to remain pregnant.
    
            In Montana, where I moved with my family last year, my patients may often have to travel hundreds of miles for care, but at least I’m able to help them get abortions. Montanans value personal liberty, and the state constitution protects the right to individual privacy and patients’ ability to make decisions with their health care providers without government interference — a bulwark against politicians’ continued attempts to restrict abortion access. And as a result of a preliminary injunction from a Montana court, Medicaid in Montana still covers medically necessary abortions — a lifeline for patients and families who are already just barely getting by.
    
            This spring, a woman came to my health center for an abortion. A colleague who had done an intake interview with her stopped me before I walked into the exam room: “She doesn’t want to talk.” This was an understatement. She had been raped, and when I walked into the room, she seemed both hypervigilant and terrified. She was grateful that I could help her end the pregnancy safely.
    
            As providers, we will continue to do everything possible to make sure patients can get the care that they need — but it will take all of us to address this public health crisis and restore, protect and expand abortion access for future generations.

      Woman accused of killing two newborns, keeping them in freezer for years

            Police in South Korea say they have requested an arrest warrant for a woman accused of killing two of her newborns and keeping their bodies in her freezer for years.
    
            An official with the Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police told CNN the woman, in her 30s, had admitted killing the babies and said that she did so because she faced economic difficulties in caring for her three other children, ages 12, 10 and 8. 
    
            The newborns were only a day old when they died, the official added.
    
            Her first alleged victim was her fourth child, born in a hospital in November 2018. Police allege she strangled the girl the day after giving birth, and put the body in the freezer of her home. She is accused of doing the same to her fifth child, a boy born in November 2019.
    
            Her husband said he had been told the two children were aborted, and therefore did not know about the alleged murders, according to police.
    
            The case came to light in May when the government’s Board of Audit and Inspection found the babies’ births were never officially registered, although there was a record of their births in the hospital. 
    
            The board then notified Suwon City Hal, the municipal government, which requested a police investigation after the mother refused an on-site inspection.
    
            On June 21, the police conducted a search and seizure operation in the woman’s home, during which she confessed to the murders, police say. 
    
            The woman is due to attend an arrest warrant hearing on Friday.

      Results from Virginia’s primaries set up test of Youngkin’s influence and abortion’s salience with voters
    ","
			By Eric Bradner, CNN

  Published
        4:27 PM EDT, Wed June 21, 2023
    ","
            The stage is now set in Virginia for the most important down-ballot election of 2023 – a battle for control of the split legislature that will offer an important window into the mood of swing-state voters as next year’s presidential race kicks off.
    
            One incumbent state senator, an anti-abortion rights Democrat, was ousted in Tuesday’s primary, while an election-denying Republican trailed her opponent. Their races were among dozens of contested primaries in a state where Democrats narrowly control the Senate and Republicans have a slight majority in the House of Delegates. 
    
            Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin – whose 2021 win ended Democrats’ streak of statewide victories and who remains the subject of buzz about a potential late entry to the party’s 2024 presidential race – placed himself in the center of Tuesday’s primaries as he seeks unified GOP control in Richmond. 
    
            But Youngkin wasn’t involved in what might be the two most consequential races, Richmond-area Senate contests that both offered clues about the directions of their parties. 
    
            State Sen. Joe Morrissey, a rare anti-abortion rights Democrat and veteran state lawmaker, lost to former Del. Lashrecse Aird in a race that focused on abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade. 
    
            Morrissey is a controversial figure in Virginia politics. In 2014, he resigned his seat in the House of Delegates under pressure after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor – a 17-year-old receptionist at his law office who later became his wife. But he ran for the seat as an independent and won the early 2015 special election while serving a six-month jail sentence. 
    
            A centrist and Catholic, Morrissey had said he would vote with Republicans to restrict abortion access. Abortion is currently legal up to about 26 weeks in Virginia; Youngkin is seeking to reduce that number to 15 weeks, but a measure to do just that was defeated by the Democratic-led Senate. 
    
            Aird, meanwhile, focused her campaign on her support for abortion access, with the backing of pro-abortion rights and women’s rights groups that she thanked in a Tuesday night victory speech. 
    
            “Aird was unapologetically pro-abortion rights and campaigned on stopping Governor Youngkin from enacting an abortion ban in Virginia,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia executive director Jamie Lockhart said in a statement.
    
            Meanwhile, state Sen. Amanda Chase, a self-described “Trump in heels” who has praised the January 6, 2021, Capitol rioters and parroted debunked election fraud claims, is trailing in a hard-fought GOP primary. 
    
            As of Wednesday, former state Sen. Glen Sturtevant, a conservative who promised a lower-key presence, led Chase by a few hundred votes. He campaigned on being “a workhorse, not a show horse in the Senate.” 
    
            Youngkin did not endorse in that race. However, his allies on Wednesday were touting the victories of all 10 legislative candidates he did back. 
    
            “The Republican Party comes out of the primary season unified and working together toward a common goal,” Youngkin senior adviser Dave Rexrode said in a memo released by the governor’s Spirit of Virginia political action committee. “The Governor along with House and Senate leadership are all on the same page; we are working together to run a coordinated and unified campaign.”
    
            Progressives, meanwhile, largely emerged victorious in Democratic primaries for the legislature and other key races. 
    
            Three progressive, reform-minded prosecutors in northern Virginia’s Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun counties each won their primaries, signaling that despite rising crime rates nationally, Democratic voters have not abandoned their support for criminal justice reform. 
    
            Republicans described the Democratic winners of Tuesday’s primaries as too liberal for a state that Democrats have won in every presidential election since 2004.
    
            “Gone are the reasonable Democrats who would put Virginia first,” Rexrode said. “They have been replaced with new nominees who would find like-minded comrades in the most liberal legislatures in the country.”
    
            Democrats, meanwhile, signaled that they intend to focus their campaigns on abortion rights and gun control in a state where the party hopes Youngkin’s 2021 victory was a blip, rather than the reversal of a suburban progressive shift.
    
            “The Republicans want to take us back to 1902. They want to take us back to 1865,” Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, a Democrat who is widely viewed as a potential 2025 candidate for governor, said in a Twitter video aimed at rallying his party around its ticket. “The primary was the appetizer. The entree is in November.”

      Most ob/gyns are concerned about negative effects the Dobbs ruling has had on care, survey finds

            Most US obstetrician/gynecologists worry that the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision has had significant negative effects on reproductive and maternity health in the United States, and many say they have experienced direct constraints on their ability to provide care, according to a new survey from KFF.
    
            Between March and May, KFF surveyed hundreds of practicing ob/gyns nationwide about their experiences since last year’s ruling that revoked the federal right to an abortion.
    
            More than two-thirds of ob/gyns nationwide say that the ruling has worsened their ability to respond to pregnancy-related emergencies and exacerbated pregnancy-related mortality, as well as racial and ethnic inequalities in maternal health in the United States.
    
            Federal data shows that the maternal death rate rose significantly in 2021, and experts worry the problem continues to get worse. Other research found that maternal and infant death rates are higher in states that ban or restrict abortion.
    
            Doctors practicing in states with abortion bans were more likely to report direct effects on patient care, the KFF survey found, but the impacts have been widespread.
    
            Since the Dobbs decision, about a quarter of ob/gyns nationwide – including about half of those in states where abortion is banned – say that they have had patients who could not get an abortion they wanted.
    
            About 1 in 5 ob/gyns surveyed say they have faced constraints on the ability to manage miscarriages and pregnancy-related medical emergencies in the past year. In states where abortion is banned, that share was about twice as high.
    
            In general, more than a third say that it has become difficult for them to practice within the standards of medical care.
    
            Concerns about legal risks have played a part in decisions about patient care for many, according to the KFF survey. In states where abortion is banned, about 3 in 10 ob/gyns say that they do not offer any resources or referrals to abortion services to their patients.
    
            And most worry that the Dobbs decision has made it harder to attract new ob/gyns to the field.
    
            In fact, an analysis from the Association of American Medical Colleges found that future doctors showed less interest in training in states with abortion bans or as ob/gyns after the fall of Roe.
    
            Changes to abortion care
    
            Amid the fractured abortion landscape in the US, many clinics have shuttered in states that have banned abortion, and the average travel time to the closest clinic has increased. But two new reports show how remaining clinics are filling some of that gap.
    
            It has become more common for abortion clinics to offer telehealth options and later-term services since the Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to an abortion, according to data compiled by researchers at the University of California San Francisco’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health.
    
            The group conducts an annual review of abortion facilities in the United States that publicly advertise their services and compiles that information into a database.
    
            Thirteen states had banned abortion by October 2022, at the time of the latest census. Nationwide, however, the researchers found that there were more abortion facilities in October 2022 than there were in 2021. And certain services that could help clinics meet the needs of those facing delays in accessing care, and growing demand in general, have become more widely available.
    
            About 800 facilities in the US offer medication abortion, a number that ticked up in both 2021 and 2022. Nearly a third (31%) of those facilities now offer to mail medication abortion to patients, almost double the share from 2021.
    
            The option to receive medication abortion through telehealth became an option during the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of virtual clinics doubled between 2021 and 2022, with 69 clinics now offering services to 23 states and the District of Columbia. However, most of those services are concentrated in the Northeast and West, according to the new reports.
    
            Among facilities providing medication abortion, 37% offer services after 10 weeks, up from 34% in 2021.
    
            The average gestational age limit also increased among facilities offering procedural abortion. From 2021 and 2022, the median gestational limit for facilities providing procedural abortion increased from 16 to 17 weeks.
    
            It became more common for facilities to offer abortion procedures in the second trimester – ticking up from 86% in 2021 to 89% in 2022 – as well as in the third trimester – up from 4% to 5%.

      To help tackle US maternal health crisis, more states extend Medicaid postpartum coverage
    ","

    ","
            Texas has joined a growing number of states extending the period in which new moms can qualify for Medicaid insurance after giving birth, offering coverage beyond the required 60 days postpartum to 12 months.
    
            On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law House Bill 12, which extends the duration of Medicaid coverage provided postpartum to a full year in that state, according to the office of Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, sponsor of the bill.
    
            The rate of severe maternal morbidity – or pregnancy and childbirth complications – has increased in Texas.
    
            “The Texas Legislature has made a significant commitment to the life of both mothers and their children. House Bill 12 is an important step in this continuum of care for mothers as they care for their children; they can be assured they will have proper care post-partum,” Kolkhorst said in an email Thursday. “In a post-Dobbs era, the Texas Senate and House have directed significant resources to the health of women, mothers, and children with appropriations nearing $1 billion. HB 12 is one bill in a package of bills aimed to improve health and outcomes for women and their children.”
    
            Abortion is banned in Texas – one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the developed world – which led lawmakers to debate the language used in HB 12, ultimately including an amendment clarifying that the extended Medicaid health coverage is “for mothers whose pregnancies end in the delivery of the child or end in natural loss of the child. This does not include pregnancies that end through elective abortion.”
    
            So far, an additional 35 states and the District of Columbia have extended their Medicaid postpartum coverage to a full year after giving birth, according to data from the nonprofit KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.
    
            New York also extended coverage recently.
    
            “New York’s efforts reflect the groundswell of support for setting families on firm footing by extending postpartum coverage to a full year after pregnancy,” Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a news release Tuesday. “The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized maternal health and will continue to do so until all 50 states and every U.S. territory can offer pregnant women and their families the lifeline that comes with connections to health coverage.”
    
            Maternal health advocates hope that the extensions will play small yet crucial roles in tackling the nation’s maternal mortality crisis. About 1 in 3 pregnancy-related deaths occurs about a week to one year after delivery, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            “It’s really important for people to have coverage before, during and after pregnancy, outside of pregnancy, and we know that having coverage enhances your access to care,” said Usha Ranji, associate director for women’s health policy at KFF, whose team has been tracking how many states have extended Medicaid postpartum coverage.
    
            “Medicaid actually pays for more than 4 in 10 births nationally. So when it comes to looking at issues of maternal health, Medicaid is a big player, and that’s really the impetus behind tracking these policies,” she said. “For decades now, Medicaid coverage for pregnant people has ended in 60 days postpartum. That has been federal policy for many years. And so when the American Rescue Plan passed, it included this option for states to extend to a year.”
    
            Last year, in an effort to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States, the Biden-Harris administration encouraged states to extend Medicaid’s postpartum insurance coverage requirements from two months after birth to a full 12 months.
    
            In that announcement, the administration called for ensuring that women giving birth are taken seriously when they raise concerns, diversifying the workforce of perinatal health-care staff, strengthening economic and social supports for patients, advancing data collection and research, and increasing access to maternal health services that include behavioral health – all part of its maternal health blueprint plan.
    
            As of now, according to the KFF tracker, only three states either have not extended Medicaid postpartum coverage, have not proposed plans to do so or don’t have pending legislation that passed at least one chamber: Arkansas, Idaho and Iowa.
    
            “Some states have just not taken it up because they may not want to have any expansion of Medicaid benefits. But that being said, it’s really important to keep in mind, most states have now done this and have now extended postpartum coverage for 12 months, at least,” Ranji said. “And if you look at the map, it’s not just blue states. There are red states there too, some in the South.”
    
            Medicaid postpartum coverage extension is different from full Medicaid expansion in a state.
    
            When it comes to coverage before pregnancy, Ranji said, there appear to be higher rates of coverage before pregnancy in states that have adopted full Medicaid expansion. As of late May, 41 states and DC have adopted full Medicaid expansion and 10 states have not, according to KFF.
    
            “Coverage and access to care before pregnancy is also important for a health pregnancy and postpartum period,” Ranji said.
    
            As for only extending Medicaid postpartum coverage, the process for a state to do so can take some time, needing action from state legislators and a financial commitment from the state.
    
            “The determination by a state to extend postpartum coverage may require authorization from the state legislature and likely requires the legislature to appropriate additional state funding to finance the extension of coverage for this population,” Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, which also tracks state efforts to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage, said in an email.
    
            “Going from 60 days postpartum of coverage to 12 months has a cost that will be different for each state as it depends on each state’s federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) and how many individuals will be eligible for Medicaid due to pregnancy and their income,” she wrote. “There may also be some state policymakers who are hesitant to expand federal coverage programs.”
    
            The rate of women across the United States dying due to pregnancy or childbirth each year has been getting worse.
    
            A report from the National Center for Health Statistics, released in March, found that the US maternal death rate for 2021 – the year for which the most recent data is available – was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with rates of 20.1 in 2019 and 23.8 in 2020.
    
            The total number of women who died of maternal causes in the United was 1,205 in 2021, up from previous years: 658 in 2018, 754 in 2019 and 861 in 2020.
    
            “States are also using other Medicaid policy levers to address the maternal mortality crisis such as providing reimbursement for doula and midwifery services,” Tewarson said.
    
            “Medicaid coverage of community-based providers such as doulas and midwives can improve health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum people, especially those who are low-income and people of color,” she said. “Research shows doula and midwifery care is associated with healthy birth outcomes including lower cesarean rates, fewer obstetric interventions, fewer complications, decreased likelihood of preterm birth, and more.”
    
            Tewarson added that 10 states, including Washington DC, implemented a doula Medicaid benefit and all states currently reimburse services performed by certified nurse-midwives.

      New York State Legislature passes bill to protect doctors who prescribe abortion pills for out-of-state patients

            A bill that would legally protect doctors who prescribe and send abortion pills to patients in states where abortion services are outlawed or restricted is now headed to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desk after the state legislature passed the legislation on Tuesday. 
    
            The bill ensures that doctors, medical providers and facilitators in the state will be able to provide telehealth services to patients out of state, according to a news release from the New York State Assembly.
    
            The new legislation also protects New York health providers from out-of-state litigation, meaning the state will not cooperate with cases prosecuting doctors in New York who provide telehealth abortion or reproductive services to people in other states.
    
            “This bill expands protections for telehealth providers by providing them the same protections afforded to doctors in other states with strong reproductive healthcare shield laws,” according to the news release. 
    
            The bill also ensures that New York medical providers, complying with their practice, who offer telehealth services are not subject to professional discipline, “solely for providing reproductive health services to patients residing in states where such services are illegal.” 
    
            CNN has reached out to the governor’s office to see if she will sign the legislation. 
    
            CNN previously reported Hochul has indicated support for a shield law protecting medical providers of out of state abortion and reproductive services. 
    
            Assemblymember Karines Reyes, a registered nurse who sponsored the bill, said she was “proud to sponsor this critical piece of legislation to fully protect abortion providers using telemedicine.”
    
            According to the state assembly’s news release, the bill recognizes the common use of medication abortion drugs, stating that 54% of abortions across the country are now medication abortions. 
    
            Speaker of the New York State Assembly Carl Heastie said, “It is our moral obligation to help women across the country with their bodily autonomy by protecting New York doctors from litigation efforts from anti-choice extremists. Telehealth is the future of healthcare, and this bill is simply the next step in making sure our doctors are protected.”

      Senate confirms lawyer who represented Mississippi abortion clinic at Supreme Court in Dobbs case for federal judgeship

            Julie Rikelman, the attorney who argued on behalf of the Mississippi abortion clinic before the Supreme Court in the case that led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, has been confirmed to a federal appeals court judgeship.
    
            The Senate voted 51-43 on Tuesday to confirm Rikelman to the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals. The approval comes days before the one-year anniversary of the high court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which she lost arguably the biggest case of her career when the conservative majority reversed nearly 50 years of abortion rights precedent. 
    
            President Joe Biden nominated Rikelman to the appeals court post last July. 
    
            A longtime reproductive rights attorney, Rikelman has served as the senior litigation director for the Center for Reproductive Rights since 2011. She is considered one of the best abortion rights attorneys in the country, and Biden’s decision to nominate her suggests an effort to bolster the bench with an expert on the issue now that states have the opportunity to regulate the procedure as they see fit. 
    
            The Mississippi clinic that Rikelman argued on behalf of in the Supreme Court case closed last summer after the state’s trigger ban – which prohibits abortions in the state with exceptions only in cases of rape or to preserve the life of the pregnant person – took effect. 
    
            Prior to joining the Center for Reproductive Rights, Rikelman worked for a time at NBC Universal, including as the company’s vice president of litigation. Before that, she worked at private law firms in New York and Alaska, and previously clerked for a federal judge on the Philadelphia-based appeals court.
    
            Rikelman was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, and immigrated to the US with her family as a child.

      Democrats push abortion rights bills in the Senate ahead of Dobbs anniversary

            Senate Democrats intend to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade by pushing a collection of abortion rights messaging bills.
    
            Ahead of the anniversary on Saturday, Senate Democrats will ask for “unanimous consent” on legislation which would seek to expand abortion access for women in the US. The procedural step allows any single senator to ask for a vote on a bill, but any one senator can object and the bill fails. It is a quick way to force a vote on an issue, but it won’t force every senator to go on the record, meaning Democrats and Republicans who may be facing a tough election in 2024 won’t be forced to take a vote.
    
            All of the requests are expected to fail.  
    
            The effort is being led by Sen. Patty Murray, a member of Democratic leadership from Washington state.
    
            “Senate Democrats will force Republicans to go on the record once again, and explain to the American people why they refuse to codify our right to contraception, why they refuse to let women travel across state lines for lifesaving health care – as we fight to get the votes we need to restore Roe, it’s imperative that we make plain to the country just how extreme and dangerous Republicans’ anti-abortion agenda is,” Murray said in a statement. 
    
            Abortion politics have also recently been in the spotlight in the Senate as Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican, has placed a hold on confirming more than 250 military promotions over a Pentagon policy created after the Dobbs decision, which allows servicemembers to access time off and reimbursement for travel costs if they have to cross state lines to access reproductive care.
    
            In the 2022 midterms, abortion was a crucial motivator for many voters, as CNN exit polls showed that 46% of people said that abortion was the most important issue to their vote. Abortion is also likely to be a cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, as administration officials highlight what Democrats have done to protect access to abortion.

      Parents of Nashville shooting victims urge court to deny release of shooter’s writings in new declarations

            Parents of two of the three children killed during the shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville expressed their pain and loss in filed declarations asking the court to deny Freedom of Information Act requests for the release of the school shooter’s writings.  
    
            “I have no desire to write this statement,” wrote Erin Kinney, the mother of one of the students killed in the March 27 shooting. “Every natural instinct in me tells me to hide from the world and shelter what is left of my family. I long for privacy and to be left alone from media intrusion, homicide investigations and unwelcome legal battles. I do not want anyone beyond our local community to know our names, faces or anything about us. I want to go back to March 26 and enjoy my family as it was – intact, vibrant, and whole – before an individual I have never met rampaged The Covenant School, savagely destroying my child’s life and the lives of friends and beloved teachers and staff.” 
    
            In the declaration, the grieving mother voiced frustration at the tactics used by the media. “As if it wasn’t enough to lose my baby, we have been robbed of our privacy by the media who have relentlessly cold called our friends and family, parked outside our homes, harassed me at work, asked to photograph my child’s room, and even surreptitiously entered churches and my home.” 
    
            Kinney said those demanding the release of the materials were helping the dead shooter accomplish “immortality” as she described her responsibility to protect the surviving victims from what she called “the unfathomable trauma of encountering sensitive material about the deaths of their siblings, friends, teachers; and most certainly to protect them from ever encountering the hateful, diseased words of the monster who slaughtered six human beings in their school.”
    
            The mother said the “mass murderer” should not get to speak from the grave “while our three children, along with the three adult victims are silenced in this life.” 
    
            Parents Katy and Michael Dieckhaus said their “life and family has been turned upside down” since losing their youngest daughter Evelyn. They describe lying in bed every night with their oldest and remaining daughter, trying to console her.  
    
            “As one of the families going through such deep grieving of losing their loved one – after simply dropping her off at school, we hope a more respectful, clear view can truly start to occur to help make a change that does not include releasing volumes of leverage for others planning similar devastation in this nation,” the parents wrote in their declaration.
    
            Parents of several of the surviving students who attend The Covenant School and were present the day of the shooting wrote about the social, emotional, and physical manifestations of grief and trauma that their children continue to experience in their declarations. The parents expressed concerns that their children would be forced to suffer additional trauma and be victimized again by the release of the writings. 
    
            They also expressed fear that the release of the material could present a roadmap for those with inclinations to commit similar crimes in the future. 
    
            “Please do not release these writings and cause further victimization and pain to my children – they have already suffered enough,” wrote parent Jennifer Nelson, the mother of two of the students who survived the shooting.  
    
            Petitioners seeking to have the writings released – including The Tennessean newspaper – maintain the documents are public records and the First Amendment and the Tennessee Constitution grant public access to the records in a brief filed last week. 
    
            The petitioners also claim the parents – who were granted the right to intervene in the case by Judge I’Ashea L. Myles – do not have standing in the case. 
    
            “The Intervenors also allege the potential for certain types of damage which are unproven. They offer no proof from any learned treatise or expert in support of the allegations. In essence, their allegations are basically their wishes. Appellate courts in Tennessee have found no legal authority supporting an exclusion from the Tennessee Public Records Act for an otherwise public record based upon the wishes of citizens involved,” said the brief filed before their declarations from the parents. 
    
            Last week, the petitioners filed an appeal of the ruling to allow the parents, school and church to intervene in the case and petitioned Myles to pause the proceeding pending the outcome of the appeal. Myles denied the request for a stay. 
    
            A “show cause” hearing has been scheduled for July 12, to hear from the parties involved in the case prior to Myles deciding whether the writings from the shooter will be released.

      Author of children’s book about grief who is accused of killing her husband files suit against his estate

            A Utah woman accused of killing her husband before she authored a children’s book about grieving a loved one, is suing his estate to obtain proceeds from his business and their family home, a new court filing shows.
    
            Kouri Richins, 33, is being held without bail on charges of criminal homicide, aggravated murder and three counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute in relation to the death of Eric Richins. She has not yet entered a plea.
    
            The civil lawsuit makes no mention of the charges against Kouri Richins.
    
            Eric Richins, 39, was found dead at the foot of the couple’s bed in March 2022. An autopsy and toxicology report showed he had about five times the lethal dosage of fentanyl in his system, according to a medical examiner.
    
            Richins told investigators at the time that she brought her husband a Moscow Mule cocktail in the bedroom of their Kamas, Utah, home, then left to sleep with their son in his room and returned around 3 a.m. to find her husband lying on the floor cold to the touch.
    
            Around a year to the day after her husband died, Richins published a children’s book, “Are You With Me?” about navigating grief after the loss of a loved one.
    
            In her civil lawsuit, she is seeking half of all equity in the couple’s home, which is estimated to be worth “at least $1.9 million,” according to the filing. The couple bought the home in 2012 for $400,000, the lawsuit said. 
    
            The legal title to the home was in Eric Richins’ name but mortgage payments were made from the couple’s joint account, according to the filing. 
    
            “Kouri is entitled to half of all equity in that Family Home,” the suit says.
    
            Kouri Richins is also seeking about $2 million in proceeds from the sale of Eric Richins’ share of a stone masonry business after his death.
    
            A pre-nuptial agreement signed by the couple states in part that while Eric Richins’ business is to “remain the sole property of the Husband,” unless he should die while the two are still married, in which case “Husband’s partnership interest in said business shall transfer to the Wife,” the civil filing states.
    
            But the proceeds are being held in an estate managed by Eric Richins’ sister, documents show.
    
            Before his death, Eric Richins met with an estate planner and intentionally directed that his estate be managed by his sister rather than his wife, according to documents filed in the criminal case. 
    
            He set up a trust to “provide for both my wife and our children during any time that I am incapacitated and after my death,” the documents said.

      Texas woman almost dies because she couldn’t get an abortion

    ","
            Another woman has come forward with the harrowing details of how the Supreme Court’s decision four months ago to overturn Roe v. Wade put her life in danger.
    
            CNN has told the stories of several women – including one from Houston, one from central Texas and one from Cleveland – and what they had to do to obtain medically necessary abortions.   
    
            Now, a woman from Austin, Texas, has come forward because she nearly died when she couldn’t get a timely abortion.
    
            This is her story.  
    
            Amanda Eid and Josh Zurawski, both now 35, met in 1991 at Aldersgate Academy preschool in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and dated in high school.   
    
            “Josh always tells me he’s been in love with me since we were 4 years old,” Amanda said.  
    
            Three years ago, they married in Austin, Texas, where they both work in high-tech jobs. 
    
            They tried to have a family but failed. Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.  
    
            “Very excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January,” Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in “Mama” and “Dad” hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.  
    
            “The fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness,” she said.  
    
            But then, 18 weeks – just four months – into her pregnancy, Amanda’s water broke.  
    
            The amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out.  She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.  
    
            “We found out that we were going to lose our baby,” Amanda said. “My cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.”  
    
            She and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.  
    
            “I just kept asking, ‘isn’t there anything we can do?’ And the answer was ‘no,’ ” Amanda said.  
    
            When a woman’s water breaks, she’s at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Josh’s baby – they named her Willow – was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.  
    
            “My doctor said, ‘Well, right now we just have to wait, because we can’t induce labor, even though you’re 100% for sure going to lose your baby,’ ” Amanda said. “[The doctors] were unable to do their own jobs because of the way that the laws are written in Texas.”  
    
            Texas law allows for abortion if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” 
    
            But Texas lawmakers haven’t spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.  
    
            “They’re extremely vague,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. “They don’t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided.”  
    
            In September, CNN reached out to 28 Texas legislators who sponsored anti-abortion legislation, asking them for their response to CNN stories about the woman in Houston and the woman in central Texas. 
    
            Only one legislator responded.  
    
            “Like any other law, there are unintended consequences. We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws,” wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.  
    
            The Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto O’Rourke’s unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.  
    
            After her water broke, Amanda’s doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was “considered sick enough that my life was at risk” would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.  
    
            “My doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks,” she remembers.  
    
             Once they heard “hours,” they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.  
    
            “The nearest ‘sanctuary’ state is at least an eight-hour drive,” Amanda wrote in an online essay on The Meteor. “Developing sepsis – which can kill quickly – in a car in the middle of the West Texas desert, or 30,000 feet above the ground, is a death sentence.”  
    
            So they waited it out in Texas.  
    
            On August 26, three days after her water broke, Amanda found herself shivering in the Texas heat.  
    
            “We were having a heat wave, I think it was 105 degrees that day, and I was freezing cold, and I was shaking, my teeth were chattering. I was trying to tell Josh that I didn’t feel good, and my teeth were chattering so hard that I could not even get the sentence out,” she said.  
    
            Josh was shocked by his wife’s condition.  
    
            “To see in a matter of maybe five minutes, for her to go from a normal temperature to the condition she was in was really, really scary,” he said. “Very quickly, she went downhill very, very fast. She was in a state I’ve never seen her in.”  
    
            Josh rushed his wife to the hospital. Her temperature was 102 degrees. She was too weak to walk on her own.  
    
            Her temperature went up to 103 degrees. Finally, Amanda was sick enough that the doctors felt legally safe to terminate the pregnancy, she said.  
    
            But Amanda was so sick that antibiotics wouldn’t stop the bacterial infection raging through her body. A blood transfusion didn’t cure her, either.  
    
            About 12 hours after her pregnancy was terminated, doctors and nurses flooded her room.  
    
            “There’s a lot of commotion, and I said, ‘what’s going on?’ and they said, ‘we’re moving you to the ICU,’ and I said, ‘why?’ and they said, ‘you’re developing symptoms of sepsis,’ ” she said.  
    
            Sepsis, the body’s extreme response to an infection, is a life-threatening medical emergency.  
    
            Amanda’s blood pressure plummeted. Her platelets dropped. She doesn’t remember much from that time.  
    
            But Josh does.  
    
            “It was really scary to see Amanda crash,” he said. “I was really scared I was going to lose her.”  
    
            Family members flew in from across the country because they feared it would be the last time they would see Amanda.  
    
            Doctors inserted an intravenous line near her heart to deliver antibiotics and medication to stabilize her blood pressure. Finally, Amanda turned the corner and survived.  
    
            But her medical ordeal isn’t over.  
    
            Amanda’s uterus suffered scarring from the infection, and she may not be able to have more children. She had a surgery recently to fix the scarring, but it’s unclear whether it will be successful.  
    
            That leaves the Zurawskis scared – and furious that they might never have a family because of a Texas law.  
    
            “[This] didn’t have to happen,” Amanda said. “That’s what’s so infuriating about all of this, is that we didn’t have to – we shouldn’t have had to – go through all of this trauma.”  
    
            The Zurawskis say the politicians who voted for the anti-abortion law call themselves “pro-life” – but they don’t see it that way. 
    
            “Amanda almost died. That’s not pro-life. Amanda will have challenges in the future having more kids. That’s not pro-life,” Josh said.  
    
            “Nothing about [this] feels pro-life,” his wife added.  
    
            In many ways, Amanda feels fortunate. She wonders whether she’d be alive today if it weren’t for her husband, who rushed her to the hospital and made sure she got the best care possible. And they have good jobs with good health insurance and they live in a big city with high quality health care. 
    
            “All of these things I had going for me, and still, this was the outcome,” she said.  
    
            She and Josh worry about women in rural areas, or poor women, or young, single mothers in states like Texas. What would happen to them, considering what happened to Amanda?  
    
            “These barbaric laws prevented her from getting any amount of health care when she needed it, until it was at a life-threatening moment,” Josh said.

      Opinion: America’s grandparents have the answer to gun violence
    ","
			Opinion by Anne Byrn

  Updated
        1:30 PM EDT, Mon June 19, 2023
    ","
            With the official arrival of summer this week, Americans are gathering out-of-doors with friends and family at picnics, parades, street fairs and weddings. And as they do, many are looking warily over their shoulders.
    
            Even as we pack our beach chairs and stock up on sunscreen, the nation’s public health crisis — gun violence — has many of us feeling vulnerable.
    
            I miss the world I knew before mass shootings, when mingling in a crowd during the months of June, July and August meant backyard burgers on a languorous summer afternoon.
    
            In blissful summers gone by, if you had absolutely nothing to do, you made something up. You ambled down the street. Maybe you spent a few lazy hours hanging out at the pool. And in an era before cell phones, if your mother wanted you to come home, the announcer called your name on the pool’s loudspeaker, broadcasting to the entire world that your mom was looking for you, and everybody had a good laugh.
    
            Now, with each mass shooting event at a graduation — or Juneteenth event or music festival or pro sports championship celebration or Sweet 16 birthday party — it becomes increasingly clear that we have veered further away than ever from the innocence and tranquility of bygone days.
    
            My two sisters and I once staged an ice cream parlor at home, and the neighborhood kids sat at our kitchen counter, and while I built the banana splits, one sister took the orders and the other took the money. Summers also meant catching lightning bugs in a mayonnaise jar, eating cold watermelon and spitting out the seeds, and cranking peach ice cream by hand.
    
            And to cool off, we bought tickets to the movies because the Belle Meade Theatre was air-conditioned. Never once did we eye the exit out of fear that someone with an AR-15 would start shooting.
    
            Today, my granddaughter can never have that sort of freedom. It’s hard to fathom that young people today mark the passage of time in their lives as “pre-Columbine” or “post-Sandy Hook” — as in the Columbine and Sandy Hook school shootings — although you don’t really have to mention the “shooting” part. Everyone knows exactly what you mean.
    
            Why are we putting up with this? Why is this OK? All I really want right now is what every grandparent wants — health and safety for my grandchildren and to be able to protect them from danger. And I believe we can do it.
    
            We managed once before to muster up the resolve to fight a terrible scourge: I’m old enough to remember the collective shrugging of shoulders about driving drunk, as if everyone had done it at least once — including young professionals in the 1970s and 1980s who reveled in a good happy hour after work.
    
            But on May 3, 1980, Candy Lightner’s 13-year-old daughter, Cari, was walking to a church carnival in the suburban town of Fair Oaks, outside Sacramento, California. Until then, Fair Oaks was like any other innocent small town. It had century-old citrus groves and a quirky tradition of letting chickens roam freely through the streets. But it seemed to lose some of its innocence that day when a drunken driver struck Cari from behind and killed her.
    
            Bereaved and distraught, Lightner founded Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, better known as MADD. The organization succeeded in helping educate Americans about how to be personally responsible behind the wheel and compassionate for others. One year in, MADD changed the dialogue. It also changed its name to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, focusing on the real foe — the act of impaired driving.
    
            Why can’t we marshal the same energy and outrage and resourcefulness to end the carnage taking place in our schools, malls, and on our city streets? A generation of activists protested the Vietnam War and marched for Civil Rights. Why aren’t their children and grandchildren taking to the streets now to demand an end to the gun violence madness?
    
            I write cookbooks for a living, and have researched American history for them: I am emboldened to learn of women throughout time who have responded to deplorable conditions and embraced solutions out of compassion and love. Decades before MADD, these brave crusaders pushed for food regulations, better working conditions and — something that’s been in the news a lot lately — child labor laws.
    
            That same energy can be marshaled to fight gun violence. Goodness knows, there is a groundswell of support for stricter gun laws today. Sixty-one percent of registered voters told a Fox News poll in April that they are in favor of reinstating a ban on assault rifles. And 65 percent of American gun owners polled said they are in favor of “red flag” laws, according to an NPR/Ipsos survey from July 2022.
    
            Are we finally ready to take personal responsibility? On the heels of this year’s mass shootings in Tennessee, Texas and Georgia, are we willing to give Americans what they are demanding — sensible gun legislation?
    
            The Covenant School shooting in Nashville happened right in my backyard. The red and black bows in the school’s colors remain on mailboxes up and down my street after that tragedy in late March, when three children and three adults were gunned down. Not long after the shootings, thousands of people of all ages linked arms over 3 miles of downtown Nashville to get the attention of our Tennessee Legislature. We were outraged that our state representatives did nothing to address guns before their session ended.
    
            Some of our politicians have responded, although not entirely as I might have expected. Gov. Bill Lee announced a special session of the state Legislature to be held in August on ways to “strengthen public safety and preserve constitutional rights.” When that session is held, all eyes will be on our gun-loving red state, home to three firearm manufacturers. Stay tuned.
    
            And a few weeks back, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee suggested that grandparents arm themselves to help protect schools. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at the notion. It seemed farcical and yet sadly tragic, too, that she had no better solutions.
    
            I believe grandparents would be more useful, and would be better able to get the attention of lawmakers, if we did more than just guard the door.
    
            We could write letters and make phone calls in support of red flag laws, talk with people who own guns, educate ourselves and others about extreme risk protection, and insist on universal background checks before a gun purchase, because in my home state and many others across the country, we have none of that.
    
            I know that there is a lively discussion about older people in public life, but we elders know a thing or two. We have tools that life has afforded us. We might be civic, neighborhood or church leaders.
    
            And our wisdom should be tapped as we strive to achieve a solution to a seemingly intractable problem. We can help show a broken country how to overcome differences with selfless persistence and love of community.
    
            At the very least, we have to try.

      Mothers accused of harming their babies are turning to the same science that freed Kathleen Folbigg
    ","
			By Hilary Whiteman, CNN

        10:21 PM EDT, Sun June 18, 2023
    ","
            Kathleen Folbigg had her first child at 21, and like most new moms kept a diary of the times her baby fed, slept, burped and bathed.
    
            But the records stopped abruptly after 19 days when the baby died, and over the next decade until 1999, as Folbigg lost her second, third and fourth child, the guilt she felt as a “failed” mother seeped onto the page.
    
            In 2003, Folbigg’s diaries were used as evidence that she had smothered her babies, a theory embellished by claims from prosecutors that losing four children in one family was so rare that it was almost impossible without human intervention.
    
            At trial, Folbigg was found guilty of three counts of murder and one of manslaughter, and spent 20 years in prison before being freed by the New South Wales attorney general earlier this month. 
    
            Folbigg’s release came after scientists discovered a previously unknown mutant gene in her two daughters that could have been fatal, creating “reasonable doubt” about her convictions and grounds for a pardon.
    
            Confirmation of a likely genetic cause for the children’s deaths has implications far beyond Australia for parents who have been accused of killing or harming their babies. 
    
            At the same time, the case has supercharged calls for a better system of post-conviction review in Australia, so that others who claim to have been wrongly convicted don’t languish in prison for years.
    
            “Today is a victory for science and especially truth,” Folbigg said after her release in a video filmed at a rural property in northern New South Wales, where she is recuperating before taking her case back to the Court of Criminal Appeal to have her convictions quashed.
    
            Critics of her 2003 trial say the prosecutor twisted Folbigg’s words and relied on tropes about motherhood to convince the jury that she was fundamentally unsuited for the role and had snapped under the pressure of caring for babies.
    
            The advances in genetic testing used to free Folbigg are giving other families hope that science may explain why their children have died, but experts say sometimes even that can’t exonerate parents – often mothers – accused of harming them.
    
            Folbigg’s first baby Caleb died in 1989, followed by Patrick who died in 1991 at 8 months after suffering epileptic seizures that had left him blind. Sarah died during the night in 1993 when she was 10 months old, and finally Laura slipped away in 1999 aged 18 months.
    
            The first three deaths were initially attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a term used when babies under 1 die for no apparent reason. Laura’s death was the first to raise suspicion after a forensic pathologist marked the cause as “undetermined.”
    
            Police began investigating, and while Folbigg’s then husband Craig was initially supportive, he became convinced she had killed their babies and testified against her during a seven-week trial that found her guilty. 
    
            Emma Cunliffe, a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Allard School of Law, who started studying trials of mothers accused of murder for her PhD in 2004, says she noticed a key difference in Folbigg’s case.
    
            “The other mothers whose cases that I set out to study had all been exonerated. Kathleen’s conviction was the only one left standing,” said Cunliffe, who made a case for Folbigg’s freedom in her 2011 book “Murder, Medicine and Motherhood.”
    
            In all cases, the convictions relied on a version of “Meadow’s law,” the false maxim pushed by discredited British pediatrician Roy Meadow that one sudden infant death in a family is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder.
    
            None of the cases had access to the genetic technology that eventually freed Folbigg, yet mothers in the United Kingdom and Canada were released after the evidence was examined by a form of post-conviction review committee that doesn’t exist in Australia.
    
            “(Australia’s) legal system failed Kathleen Folbigg,” Cunliffe said. “We didn’t need the genetics to know that this conviction was unreliable.”
    
            As the campaign to free Folbigg gained momentum, experts began analyzing her diaries and a very different image began to emerge of the woman presented in court as a baby killer.
    
            One of the experts, Sharmila Betts, a clinical psychologist with decades of experience working with mothers and in child protection, analyzed the contents of her diaries in 2014.
    
            “In the absence of conclusive medical evidence, (the prosecutor) has presented cryptic and unfathomable diary entries, which Ms Folbigg denied were confessions, as admissions of guilt, thereby dispensing of the need for more conclusive medical evidence of homicide,” she wrote in a report submitted as evidence to a recent inquiry.
    
            Betts told CNN a woman who had lost four children would no doubt blame herself for their loss.
    
            “If you lose one child, grief. You lose a second, you lose a third, you lose a fourth. So, there’s the accumulative grief. But there’s also, ‘what is wrong with me?’” she said. “She is blaming herself. She does think that she’s done something because no one’s explained to her what’s happened to those kids.”
    
            By 2019, some of the world’s leading genetic experts thought they had the answer. 
    
            They had conducted whole genome sequencing on the children and their mother and found that Folbigg and her daughters, Sarah and Laura, carried a never-before-seen variant of the CALM2 gene. 
    
            CALM genes regulate the protein calmodulin, which plays an important role in regulating sodium, potassium and calcium levels for healthy heart function. Variations can cause cardiac arrhythmia, and the first sign of a problem can be sudden death. 
    
            There was no record of the variant, and the scientists rushed to present their findings to an 2019 inquiry into Folbigg’s conviction that had largely been called to hear objections to the use of “Meadow’s law” in her trial.
    
            But while the genetic evidence was accepted, some after submissions had closed, the retired judge leading the inquiry, Reginald Blanch, concluded that everything that he had heard and read “reinforces Ms Folbigg’s guilt.” 
    
            The following year, in November 2020, 27 scientists published their evidence in a paper that laid out the results of whole genome sequencing on Folbigg and her children.
    
            The findings convinced more than 100 of the world’s leading scientists that she’d been wrongly convicted and they signed a petition urging the NSW government to hold another inquiry.
    
            From November 2022, the new inquiry was told that Folbigg’s sons – Caleb and Patrick – carried rare variants in the BSN gene (or Bassoon), whose deficiency is known to cause lethal epilepsy in mice.
    
            But more crucially, scientists explained that Folbigg and her daughters carried the CALM2-G114R variant, and that while it was totally new, a similar variant had been found in an American family, where a 4-year-old boy died suddenly, and his 5-year-old sister suffered a cardiac arrest. 
    
            This time, retired judge Tom Bathurst accepted the science and recommended Folbigg’s pardon.
    
            One of the lead authors of the study, Professor Carola Vinuesa, says that Folbigg’s case has encouraged other families and lawyers to come forward, seeking genetic evidence to clear mothers accused of harming their babies.
    
            In those cases, not all of the children have died. Some mothers accused of injuring their children are seeking a genetic explanation for their symptoms to counter claims of child abuse, she said.
    
            “The majority of these mothers have not harmed their children, but the children have these very rare conditions. And a few cases I’ve worked on already since the Folbigg inquiry, we’ve been able to make a genetic diagnosis. They’re very rare, so they’re not in the textbooks, you can’t find them easily,” she said.
    
            The mothers are being accused of “medical child abuse” or “fabricated or induced illness by carers” – when carers harm otherwise healthy children or fabricate their symptoms to force hospital visits and medical tests.
    
            In the past, such behavior was known as Munchausen by proxy, which was considered a mental illness by Meadow, the same doctor struck off the British medical register for providing wildly inaccurate statistics on SIDS at trials that saw some mothers jailed. 
    
            In a 1989 article in the “ABC of Child Abuse,” he wrote “for a worried parent to seek a second or third specialist opinion is reasonable: to seek a 22nd opinion is not.”
    
            Vinuesa, with the Francis Crick Institute in London, says mothers accused of medical child abuse are reluctant to talk publicly about what’s happening in case they’re perceived to be seeking attention, one of the traditional markers of Munchausen by proxy.
    
            One mother in the United States, who declined to be named, told CNN that she worries that if she speaks out, it’ll work against her and she could be imprisoned or lose access to her children, who have been taken from her as officials investigate the claims. 
    
            Helen Hayward-Brown, a leading expert in Munchausen by proxy, told CNN the allegation is becoming more common, and mothers are finding it more difficult to defend themselves, even when genome sequencing shows their child has a genetic illness.
    
            “It’s really, really hard for them to defend themselves because you can have a coexisting diagnosis, as well as supposedly harming your child,” she said.
    
            Seeming to know too much about their child’s illness, or asking too many questions can put parents, particularly mothers, in a vulnerable position, especially if they seek out other medical opinions, she said.
    
            “Part of the profile is the mother has too much medical knowledge. She’s overly interested in the medical situation, the mother is doctor-shopping,” said Hayward-Brown, pointing out the fine line some mothers need to walk.
    
            “If you’re a very good mother, and you care about your child, of course the first thing you’re going to do is look up what’s wrong with your child, and particularly if they’ve got a diagnosis and a rare diagnosis, you’re going to look it up immediately,” she said.
    
            “There are a number of different support groups around now for parents of children who do have rare genetic disorders, and one of the first things they say on their websites is that a lot of these mothers are falsely accused of harming their children.”
    
            Mothers aren’t being believed, she says, and Folbigg’s case shows that when a child dies of a rare genetic disorder before diagnosis, the results can be catastrophic.
    
            The world has changed since Folbigg was imprisoned, well beyond advances in genetic testing.
    
            She entered a cell the same year Concorde took its final flight, former US President George W Bush was claiming victory in Iraq, and MySpace was emerging as a new social network. The iPhone was still four years from its global launch.
    
            On her first day of freedom, Folbigg was “bamboozled” by phones and delighted to discover video-on-demand services, her friend Tracy Chapman told reporters in a press briefing carried live on national television.
    
            “She just wants to be able to live a life that she’s missed for the last 20 years,” said Chapman, who has created a sanctuary where Folbigg has the space to rebuild her trust in society. 
    
            “I’ve got a whole heap of rescue dogs here. We’ve got chickens and guinea pigs and rabbits. I’m a wildlife rescuer, so we’ve got a menagerie of wildlife floating around in various stages of release.
    
            “She’ll help me with all of that because she loves animals,” Chapman said.
    
            Bathurst, who heard the second inquiry, is yet to publish his full report, but questions are already being asked why Folbigg had to fight so hard for freedom, when women elsewhere were being released.
    
            Even after the scientific evidence was published, it took more than a year for the government to call a new inquiry and another year before Folbigg’s pardon. 
    
            The Australian Academy of Science acted as an independent scientific adviser during the second inquiry to make sure the world’s leading scientists were heard. Now lawyers are taking up the fight to make it easier for the wrongly accused to seek justice.
    
            Folbigg’s legal team and other associations, including the Law Council, the Sydney Institute of Criminology and the Australian Lawyers Alliance, say Australia needs a post-conviction review body to examine other potential miscarriages of justice.
    
            “There are independent bodies for identifying and reviewing miscarriages of justice in the United Kingdom, Scotland, Norway, New Zealand and Canada. We are lagging behind the rest of the common law world,” said her lawyer Rhanee Rego.
    
            Andrew Dyer, director of the Sydney Institute of Criminology, says that’s due to a lack of political will in a country where society calls for harsh punishments for people found guilty of breaking the law.
    
            “I think the general disdain in the community for convicted offenders has a lot to do with the indifference of governments to this issue,” said Dyer, one of more than 30 legal experts who have signed a petition calling for a permanent review body. 
    
            The UK experience shows that miscarriages of justice are perhaps more common than people think. Since it began in 1997, the UK’s review commission has overturned 540 convictions or sentences, according to its latest annual report published last October. 
    
            As he announced Folbigg’s pardon, NSW Attorney General Michael Daley, told reporters that he’s “open” to discussions on potential changes to the system.
    
            “I think we have to have a look at this case and all of the material that’s been put before Mr Bathurst, all that’s gone before us now to learn from it, and to amend the law, if needs be,” he said.
    
            In Australia, most criminal matters are heard by state and territory-based court systems, so any national review body would require agreement between different tiers of government. 
    
            When approached about the possibility of a national criminal cases review commission, Australian Attorney General Mark Dreyfus declined to comment.
    
            In the video released to media on June 6, Folbigg is seen arranging flowers, including the dainty white buds of Gypsophila, known as “baby’s breath.”
    
            “For the last 20 years I have been in prison, I have forever and will always think of my children, grieve for my children, and I miss them and love them terribly,” she said.
    
            If her children had survived, Caleb, her first born, would be 34, and the last born, Laura, 25.
    
            Perhaps they might have had their own children by now, and at 56, Folbigg would have been a grandmother.
    
            Chapman said of her friend’s traumatic experience: “If it doesn’t make us better human beings, or humane beings, I’ll be just devastated.” 
    
            “The worst thing for both of us is that this could happen to someone else.”

      Florida man executed for 1984 murders of babysitter, single mother

            Florida executed death row inmate Duane Owen by lethal injection on Thursday evening, nearly four decades after he murdered a 14-year-old babysitter and a single mother of two in separate attacks. 
    
            Owen was convicted for the 1984 rape and fatal stabbing of teenager Karen Slattery and for the rape and killing of 38-year-old Georgianna Worden in Palm Beach County.
    
            Owen declined to make a final statement, according to CNN affiliate WPBF.
    
            Family members of the victims were present for the execution. After it was over, Slattery’s younger sister, Debbi Johnson, said the family may now close Karen’s book, put it on a shelf and move forward. 
    
            “He didn’t open his eyes. I know because I looked at them,” Johnson said at a news conference. “He made no statement – no verbal statement anyway. He died with dignity, and unfortunately his victims did not.” 
    
            Johnson, who is now a deputy sheriff in Florida’s Monroe County, was 10 years old when her older sister was killed. 
    
            “With this rain today, I was really hoping I was going to see a rainbow. Because that’s what my mom always said: ‘Whenever you see a rainbow, that’s Karen smiling down on us,’” Johnson said.
    
            Slattery was repeatedly stabbed and raped in a home in Delray Beach while the two children she was babysitting were sleeping. 
    
            And two months later, Owen killed Worden of Boca Raton with a hammer, while her two small children slept nearby, according to WPBF.
    
            Owen had been on death row since his convictions, and despite decades of appeals and insanity defenses, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed his death warrant this year, according to CNN affiliate WPBF.
    
            For his last meal, Owen requested a bacon cheeseburger – no bun – in addition to onion rings, strawberries, cherry ice cream, a vanilla milkshake and a coffee, according to the state’s Department of Corrections. 
    
            Johnson said the authorities’ response to her sister’s case and the work officers put into it inspired her to go into law enforcement.
    
            “Closure may be a myth, but justice isn’t,” Johnson said.
    
            “Thirty-nine years and this process is finally over,” she added. “He served his sentence. The end.” 
    
            Owen is the fourth inmate to be executed in the state this year. Florida is one of 27 states where the death penalty remains in place, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Three of those states have governor-imposed moratoriums.

      Iowa Supreme Court deadlocks on 6-week abortion ban and leaves block in place

            Abortion will remain legal in Iowa for up to 20 weeks after the state Supreme Court on Friday declined to lift a block on a six-week ban.
    
            In a 3-3 decision, the state’s high court could not reach a consensus on whether it should overturn a lower court decision to strike down Iowa’s restrictive “fetal heartbeat” law, which was passed in 2018. The law sought to prevent doctors from performing an abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant.
    
            Calling the case “extraordinary,” Justice Thomas D. Waterman explained in an order that lifting the block would be akin to bypassing the state legislature.
    
            “When the statute was enacted in 2018, it had no chance of taking effect,” Waterman wrote, noting that its supporters anticipated a legal challenge at a time when federal protections for abortion rights remained in effect. “To put it politely, the legislature was enacting a hypothetical law. Today, such a statute might take effect given the change in the constitutional law landscape. But uncertainty exists about whether a fetal heartbeat bill would be passed today. To begin, a different general assembly is in place than was in place in 2018, with significant turnover of membership in the intervening three election cycles.”
    
            Ruth Richardson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, called the ruling an “enormous win” that “means that Iowans will be able to control their bodies and their futures.”
    
            Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said her office was reviewing legal options.
    
            “To say that today’s lack of action by the Iowa Supreme Court is a disappointment is an understatement,” Reynolds said in a statement. “Not only does it disregard Iowa voters who elected representatives willing to stand up for the rights of unborn children, but it has sided with a single judge in a single county who struck down Iowa’s legislation based on principles that now have been flat-out rejected by the US Supreme Court.”

      Fathers’ role in breastfeeding and infant sleep is key, study finds

            Fathers matter.
    
            A new study — a rare effort that focuses solely on the father’s involvement in an infant’s life — shows a striking link between the support that dads offer and better infant outcomes.
    
            The research sought to answer several questions about paternal participation in breastfeeding and the use of safe sleep practices for babies. The results showed that fathers play a crucial role in both — and it highlights the need for bolstered parental leave policies in the United States, according to the study, which published Friday in the journal Pediatrics.
    
            The results of the survey, which included 250 fathers, were “suboptimal,” the study concluded, revealing only 16% of dads followed all the recommended safe sleeping practices for infants. And many could do more to support mothers who breastfeed, which can provide key health benefits for babies, the study indicated.
    
            The reason the researchers asked these questions in the first place? Moms wanted them to, said study coauthor Dr. Craig Garfield, a pediatrician at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.
    
            For more than 30 years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has carried out a Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System — or PRAMS — survey that seeks to gather data from mothers before, during and after birth.
    
            “The moms actually started to write in the margins of the survey,” Garfield said. “The only question they asked (originally in the survey) about dads was: ‘Did your partner hit, kick, beat or slap you during your pregnancy?’ ”
    
            Mothers knew that a father’s active support could be critical in the early months of an infant’s life, and they wanted that data reflected, too, Garfield said. Ultimately, the CDC reached out to the Northwestern researchers for help, providing funding for the study.
    
            “We focused on breastfeeding and infant sleep because they are two key national health targets,” said lead study author Dr. John James Parker, who is a pediatrician, internist and researcher at Northwestern.
    
            The study started small: Researchers collected data, via a survey, from 250 fathers in Georgia within the first two to six months after the birth of their child. Fathers were eligible if the infant’s mother also took the PRAMS survey.
    
            It found 99% of fathers had put their child to bed, but less than a quarter of them used all the methods recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. These recommendations include:
    
            • Always place infants to sleep on their backs.• Use an approved sleep surface, one specifically designed for infant sleep (i.e., crib, bassinet, bedside sleeper).• The surface should be firm with no soft bedding or other items, such as blankets or stuffed animals.
    
            Those are all recommended strategies for preventing sudden infant death syndrome, which causes about 3,400 deaths in the United States every year, according to the CDC.
    
            The research also found racial disparities in sleep practices, with Black fathers less likely than White fathers to follow those practices.
    
            “I think that more needs to be done in this space to understand some of the reasons between the disparities,” Parker said. “But I think one scenario that we’ve seen play out is that racial and ethnic minorities have less availability to things like paternity leave … so it’s possible that it gets harder to get to appointments, or to be at the newborn nursery, the OB-GYN office.”
    
            Those are key places where fathers learn about these best practices, Parker said.
    
            Overall, almost a third of the fathers involved in this survey did not receive enough or any advice about safe sleep practices, according to the study.
    
            Breastfeeding can be a huge boon for an infant’s health, aiding immunity, overall well-being and parental bonding. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding a child for at least the first six months.
    
            Previous studies have suggested that fathers can play a key role in helping mothers breastfeed. But researchers in this new study were struck by how strong the correlation appeared to be.
    
            In this survey sample, the study found that “among fathers who wanted their infant’s mother to breastfeed, 95% reported breastfeeding initiation and 78% reported breastfeeding at (eight) weeks, which is significantly higher than fathers who had no opinion or did not want their infant’s mother to breastfeed, of whom 69% reported breastfeeding initiation and 33% reported breastfeeding at (eight) weeks.”
    
            The difference is “dramatic,” Parker added.
    
            Going forward, Parker said he hopes “we can tell fathers how valuable they are in the successful breastfeeding — tell them that this is a team effort.”
    
            Fathers can play an active role, ensuring mothers have food to eat and a comfortable place to breastfeed, and they can help with other household work to give moms the time and space to breastfeed their child.
    
            Parker urged fathers to continue breaking down the barriers on roles that society typically assigns to men and women.
    
            “We’ve made a lot of progress, promoting the importance of women in the workplace,” Parker said. “And I think to continue that — and for it to be as accessible — we need to have fathers who are equal parents and contributing in many ways at home.”
    
            Dr. Jennifer Lansford called the study results “sobering.”
    
            “We’re still not meeting guidelines and recommendations for these very basic physical caregiving practices,” said Lansford, director of the Center for Child and Family Policy and research professor in the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University in North Carolina. She was not involved in the study.
    
            Lansford’s own research focuses on parenting cultures across nine countries, and she said this study is just more evidence that the United States lags behind others when it comes to supporting and educating parents.
    
            “For example, in this country, we still don’t even have universal paid leave for mothers, let alone for fathers,” Lansford said. “Even if individual parents want to do the best they can … we don’t always have societal supports in place that let that be possible.”
    
            She added that another key takeaway from this study should be that, while the historical paradigm may have emphasized mothers as the caregivers, fathers are not just supporters.
    
            “More contemporary views suggest there are healthier ways to think about fatherhood — fathers are important in their own right, not just as helpers for mothers.”
    
            The Northwestern researchers are looking to expand their fatherhood research beyond Georgia, rolling out surveys into other states.
    
            But Garfield acknowledges that this information may not be particularly helpful for same-sex couples or single mothers with no other paternal support.
    
            “It took the CDC and the country 35 years to recognize we had a very biased — and not gender equal — approach to collecting this data,” he said. “My hope is (that it’s not another) 35 years till we start to understand what’s happening in (all) sorts of families.”

      ‘The Blackening’ finds the life in its ‘We can’t all die first’ concept

    ","
            The promotional line for “The Blackening” is so good – “We can’t all die first” – there was reason to fear the movie couldn’t live up to it. Yet like other self-referential horror/comedies (the “Scream” franchise come to mind), the film ably delivers on its premise, mining enough life from its satirical concept to deliver plenty of crowd-pleasing moments.
    
            If the idea sounds like a comedy sketch, that’s exactly how it began, the creation of comedian Dewayne Perkins, who blew that up into a feature script with Tracy Oliver (“Girls Trip”) handed over to director Tim Story (“Barbershop”).
    
            The small scale – with practically all the action taking place in a remote cabin in the woods – actually works to the movie’s advantage. That tight focus allows the story to consciously flesh out characters usually given short shrift in traditional horror fare, where, yes, people of color are often early casualties, with a mortality rate that probably ranks right behind teenagers who have sex.
    
            The simple set-up doesn’t waste much time, with a group of former college friends getting together for a 10-year reunion that doubles as a Juneteenth celebration. They’re toting with them a fair amount of baggage, including past relationships and strained friendships, all of which will be put to the test by having a faceless maniac trying to kill them.
    
            Faster than you can say “Jumanji,” they stumble upon a game, which the unseen attacker forces them to play. Beyond creating a sense of jeopardy, the questions evoke opportunities to riff on all sorts of minutia, from “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” trivia to whether anybody will admit to having watched “Friends.” They also drop plenty of wry horror references, whether that’s “Get Out” or “The People Under the Stairs.”
    
            The cast includes Grace Byers (“Empire”), Jermaine Fowler, Melvin Gregg, X Mayo, Dewayne Perkins, Antoinette Robertson, and Sinqua Walls (recently seen in Hulu’s “White Men Can’t Jump” remake), and they generally appear to be having a ball playing off each other.
    
            Yet there’s also something pointed in the underlying notion that an all-Black core group highlights how race has played a subtle and not-so-subtle role in movie conventions across the decades. As Perkins told the New York Times, the broader issue here involves feelings of being marginalized, with horror serving as a proxy for other institutions.
    
            While not overdoing the gore, Story wisely includes enough horror elements to conjure tension amid the laughs, recognizing that horror, more than comedy, has been one of the most durable genres at the box office since the pandemic began.
    
            Throw in the movie’s modest budget, and it’s not hard to envision “The Blackening” emerging as a sleeper success among the tall trees of summer blockbusters – potentially not just surviving but thriving, which, given the movie’s central conceit, would surely be the sweetest revenge of all.
    
            “The Blackening” premieres June 16 in US theaters. It’s rated R.

      Google earned $10 million by allowing misleading anti-abortion ads from ‘fake clinics,’ report says

    ","
            Google has earned more than $10 million over the past two years by allowing misleading advertisements for “fake” abortion clinics that aim to stop women from having the procedure, according to an estimate from a report released Thursday from the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate.
    
            The estimated amount is microscopic compared to the more than $200 billion Google generates from ad sales annually. But the report’s data hints at the broad reach pro-life groups can have by placing these advertisements in Google results for common phrases searched for by abortion seekers.
    
            Using Semrush, an analytics tool, researchers at the CCDH identified “188 fake clinic websites” that placed ads on Google between March, 2021 and February of this year. CCDH estimates that ads for fake clinics were clicked on by users 13 million times during this period.
    
            Some searching for “abortion clinics near me” on Google instead found results directing them toward so-called “crisis pregnancy centers” that may try to talk abortion-seekers out of treatment and offer medically unproven abortion pill reversal techniques, according to the report.  
    
            Other Google searches populated by crisis clinic ads included “abortion pill,” “abortion clinic” and “planned parenthood,” the report said, with clinics in states where abortion is legal spending two times as much as those in states with bans. 
    
            In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade, Google faced calls from Congressional Democrats to do more to prevent searches for abortion clinics from returning results for misleading ads – as well as calls from Republican lawmakers to do the opposite. The dueling pressure from lawmakers highlighted how central Google can be for women searching for information on the procedure.
    
            In a statement Thursday, Google said its approach to abortion ads follows local laws and that any advertiser targeting certain keywords or phrases related to abortions must complete a certification to confirm if it does or does not provide abortion services. 
    
            “We require any organization that wants to advertise to people seeking information about abortion services to be certified and clearly disclose whether they do or do not offer abortions,” a Google spokesperson told CNN. “We do not allow ads promoting abortion reversal treatments and we also prohibit advertisers from misleading people about the services they offer.”
    
            “We remove or block ads that violate these policies,” the company added. 
    
            Google said it does not allow for abortion reversal pill advertisements because the treatment isn’t approved by the FDA. In response to Thursday’s CCDH report, the company told CNN it took “enforcement action” on content violating this policy.
    
            Google has continued to face scrutiny in recent months for the steps it takes to protect abortion seekers’ location data.
    
            Nearly a dozen Senate Democrats wrote to Google in May with questions about how it deletes users’ location history when they have visited sensitive locations such as abortion clinics. The letter came after tests performed by The Washington Post and other privacy advocates appeared to show that Google was not quickly or consistently deleting users’ recorded visits to fertility centers of Planned Parenthood clinics.
    
            Google previously declined to comment on the lawmakers’ letter. Instead, it referred CNN to a company blog post that includes abortion clinics on a list of sensitive locations, but did not explain what it means when it claims the data will be deleted “soon after” a visit.

      Youth, young adults are dying from suicide and homicide at highest rates in decades, CDC report says

    ","
            In 2021, suicide and homicide rates for children and young adults ages 10 to 24 in the US were the highest they’ve been in decades, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Suicide and homicide were the second and third leading causes of death for this age group, both causing about 11 deaths for every 100,000 people ages 10 to 24. The homicide rate for this age group in 2021 was the highest it’s been since 1997, and the suicide rate was the highest on record, since 1968.
    
            Suicide rates surpassed homicide rates for this age group in 2010 and have continued rising for the past decade. But a large spike in homicide rates during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic brought the rates for both types of violent death together for the first time in a decade.
    
            For children ages 10 to 14, however, a large gap remained. The suicide rate in 2021 was twice as high as the homicide rate, according to the CDC report.
    
            Earlier research has found that there has been a steady increase in the number of children who are seen in emergency rooms for suicidal thoughts, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, and nearly half don’t get the follow-up care they need.
    
            Another CDC report said that the rate of suspected suicides and suicide attempts by poisoning among young surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially among children ages 10 to 12, with a 70% increase from 2019 to 2021.
    
            For teens ages 15 to 19, the homicide rate remained higher than the suicide rate, according to the new report.
    
            Last year, a study reported that firearms were the most common weapon used in children’s deaths and Black boys were killed more than any other group.
    
            In 2020, guns surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death for children and teens, a CNN analysis found. Firearms accounted for nearly 1 in 5 childhood deaths in 2021.

      Justice Department charges Marine in firebombing of California Planned Parenthood clinic

            An active-duty Marine and another individual have been charged with using a Molotov cocktail to firebomb a Planned Parenthood clinic in Costa Mesa, California, in March 2022, the Justice Department announced Wednesday.
    
            According to the DOJ, the two men from California – Chance Brannon, a corporal in the Marines, and Tibet Ergul – were arrested and charged Wednesday morning with “using an explosive or fire to damage real property affecting interstate commerce.” The men could face up to 20 years in federal prison, according to the DOJ.
    
            Brannon, 23, and Ergul, 21, were expected to make their initial appearance in federal court Wednesday afternoon in Santa Ana, California.
    
            “The complaint alleges that Ergul and Brannon attacked the clinic during the early morning hours of March 13, 2022,” the DOJ stated in its announcement of the arrests, “by igniting and a throwing a Molotov cocktail at the clinic entrance. As a result of the fire, the Planned Parenthood Costa Mesa healthcare clinic was forced to close the following morning and cancel approximately 30 appointments.”
    
            The Planned Parenthood in Costa Mesa provides reproductive health services, including abortion-related services, and was forced to cancel dozens of appointments after the incident.
    
            Nobody was harmed during the incident, Planned Parenthood said in a statement thanking the FBI and Costa Mesa law enforcement on Wednesday. 
    
            “While we are fortunate and grateful that no one was harmed, we stand firm against those who would wish to intimidate our staff, patients and supporters. Their safety is our highest priority, and we will not be deterred in our mission to provide expert, compassionate care to our community, as we have done for over 50 years,” said Nichole Ramirez, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties.
    
            The US Marine Corps declined to comment to CNN, citing the ongoing legal matter.
    
            The FBI in January offered a $25,000 reward for information on the incident, as part of what the agency called “a national effort to bring awareness to a series of attacks and threats targeting reproductive health service facilities across the country.”
    
            FBI Director Christopher Wray said at the time that the reward reflected the agency’s “commitment to vigorously pursue investigations into crimes against pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country.”
    
            The National Abortion Federation, a professional association for abortion providers, reported a “sharp increase” in violence at abortion clinics in 2022, the year the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The organization recorded four incidents of arson in 2022, up from two the year before and 218 reports of deaths threats or threats of harm, an increase from 182 in 2021.
    
            Earlier in the week, another California man pleaded guilty to making death threats to Planned Parenthood facilities in Santa Barbara, California, and Los Angeles following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, according to the DOJ.

      Woman who took abortion pill after UK term limit sentenced to 28 months

            A British woman who used medication to induce an abortion after the United Kingdom’s legally allowed limit has been sentenced to prison for 28 months, the PA Media news agency reported.
    
            In a case that sparked calls for an overhaul of reproductive justice laws in the country, the mother-of-three, 44, was handed the sentence by a judge in Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court in central England on Monday. She was sentenced under the Offences Against the Person Act, which dates back to 1861. 
    
            She had pleaded guilty to dispensing drugs or using instruments to obtain an abortion. The maximum sentence in the country is life imprisonment. 
    
            The woman will serve 14 months in custody and the remainder on license after her release. She was first charged with child destruction and pleaded not guilty. 
    
            She had searched a number of abortion-related items online in the months between February and May 2020, after she became pregnant in 2019, the prosecution said. 
    
            She had a conversation with a nurse at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), an abortion care facility, on May 6, 2020, PA Media reported. BPAS mailed her abortion-inducing medication after concluding she was about seven weeks pregnant, based on her answers. 
    
            Five days later, after the woman ingested the drugs, an emergency call was made saying she was in labor. Her child was born during the phone call, and was later pronounced dead at hospital following resuscitation attempts by paramedics.
    
            The woman was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant at the time, a post-mortem examination revealed. The baby’s cause of death was documented as still birth and maternal use of abortion drugs, according to PA Media.
    
            Abortion laws in the UK stipulate that a person may be able to have a medical abortion at home if they are less than 10 weeks pregnant, according to the National Health Service. 
    
            The lady had not visited a doctor about her pregnancy because she was “embarrassed” and had no knowledge of how far along she was, the court was told. 
    
            The prosecuting barrister, Robert Price, said the woman “lied to BPAS about how pregnant she was so they sent the tablets to her,” according to PA Media.
    
            Justice Pepperall declared the case was “tragic,” adding he might have contemplated suspending the jail sentence if the woman pleaded guilty earlier. 
    
            The case triggered calls for an urgent reform of abortion laws in the UK.
    
            “We must ensure the law protects women, like the woman who faces sentencing today, from prosecution. We call on the governemnt [sic] to reform our outdated #abortion laws now & safeguard our constitutional right to abortion,” the Fawcett Society, a UK-based gender equality and women’s rights charity, tweeted. 
    
            Commenting on the case, BPAS tweeted: “No woman can ever go through this again. We need abortion law reform in Great Britain NOW.”
    
            When asked if British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is certain that criminalizing abortion in some situations is the correct approach, his spokesperson told reporters: “Our laws as they stand balance a woman’s right to access safe and legal abortions with the rights of an unborn child, I’m not aware of any plans to address that approach.”

      Florida woman told 911 dispatcher she felt threatened before fatally shooting neighbor through door

    ","
            A Florida woman charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of her neighbor, a Black mother who confronted her during a dispute over children playing outside, told police in a 911 call she felt threatened just moments before authorities say she killed the mother of four. 
    
            Marion County officials released seven 911 calls from June 2, when authorities say Susan Louise Lorincz fatally shot Ajike “AJ” Owens through the front door of Lorincz’s home near Ocala, Florida, as Owens repeatedly knocked on her door, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said. 
    
            Owens knocked and demanded Lorincz come out of her apartment after the 58-year-old White woman yelled at Owens’ children and threw a roller skate at her 10-year-old son, hitting him, the sheriff’s office said.  
    
            In addition to manslaughter with a firearm, Lorincz is facing charges of culpable negligence, battery and two counts of assault, the sheriff’s office said last week. Lorincz remains in custody on a $154,000 bond. 
    
            When reached by CNN, an attorney for Lorincz said she had no comment on the case at this time. 
    
            Two of the 911 calls were made by Lorincz before and moments after Owens was killed, while several other calls came in as police were headed to the scene. Those calls reported possible shots fired in the area, according to an arrest affidavit. Information on the callers on all the tapes was redacted. 
    
            In her first call, Lorincz complained to a dispatcher about children that she said were on her property.   
    
            “I’ve got kids trespassing. Leaving all their toys around. Just screaming, yelling, just being absolutely obnoxious,” she said. “I went and threw the roller skate over to the other side, the kid says he’s going to beat me up for that and he’s mouthing off to me. I feel threatened in my own home.” 
    
            “There are several kids out there right now. I’m fearing for my life. I’ve very scared,” Lorincz continued. 
    
            During that call, the dispatcher told Lorincz to keep her doors and windows locked and advised her that an officer would be dispatched, according to the tape. A few minutes later, as deputies were headed to the scene, several other 911 calls reported shots fired in that same area, according to the affidavit. 
    
            One of Owens’ sons told a deputy he’d been playing basketball in the street while his younger 10-year-old brother played in the nearby field, according to the affidavit. The child told the deputy his younger brother told him that he had left an electronic tablet in the field and said Lorincz had picked it up. 
    
            When the 10-year-old asked Lorincz to return the tablet, the woman threw it to the ground and yelled at him, he told the deputy. The child claimed Lorincz threw roller skates at him, according to the affidavit. 
    
            The affidavit says the older child told his younger sibling to tell their mother what happened, and then he approached Lorincz’s front door and yelled, “You want to throw something, throw it at me!”  
    
            Lorincz came out of her home and told him he was trespassing and swung an umbrella in his direction, the affidavit stated. 
    
            One of the children went to get their mother, Owens, the affidavit says. 
    
            “Shortly after, the victim approached Lorincz’ front door and banged on the door, yelling for Lorincz to throw something at her if she wanted to throw something,” the affidavit said. 
    
            In her second 911 call, Lorincz recalled the shooting to the dispatcher as her voice was shaking. 
    
            “Oh my God. This lady just tried to break down my door. I shot through the door. Oh my God,” she said. 
    
            “The woman was screaming and yelling at me trying to break down my door. I didn’t know what to do. I grabbed my gun and shot at the door because I thought she was going to kill me,” Lorincz continued.   
    
            The older child then heard a “loud bang” and witnessed his mother “stumbling” away from the door while telling him to call 911, according to information obtained by a deputy, which is laid out in the affidavit. 
    
            When deputies arrived at the scene, Owens was found on the ground and was transported to a local hospital, where she later died.  
    
            According to an arrest affidavit, Lorincz claimed to investigators that she was acting in self-defense, saying she thought Owens was trying to break down her door and that she heard the victim threatening to kill her.  
    
            Lorincz said she discharged her firearm because “she felt like she was in ‘mortal danger,’” the document says. 
    
            Detectives, however, determined Lorincz’s actions “were not justifiable under Florida law,” the sheriff’s office said. 
    
            In the days since the killing, Owens’ family had repeatedly called for the arrest and charging of the shooter, insisting the incident was unprovoked and unjustified. 
    
            They also accused Lorincz of harassing the children and calling them racial slurs. 
    
            When investigators asked Lorincz about allegations of her calling children in the neighborhood racial slurs, “Lorincz admitted to having used the n-word toward children out of anger in the past and also to calling children other derogatory terms,” the affidavit says. 
    
            Last week, a judge set her bond at $150,000 for the felony charge and another $4,000 for four misdemeanor counts. Lorincz, who had told the court she could only afford a bond of $1,700, is unemployed and owns about $3,000 worth of furniture.  
    
            The state requested a $200,000 bond. 
    
            The owner of the apartment where Lorincz lives told detectives she was being evicted, according to a prosecutor – and the judge recommended Lorincz not return there. Her arraignment is set for July 11, according to court records. 
    
            A judge ruled that if Lorincz posts bond, she will not be allowed to possess a firearm or any other weapon, nor is she allowed to have any contact with the victim’s family. The ruling says if she returns to her apartment to gather belongings, she will have to have someone accompany her. She is allowed to live in her apartment as long as she isn’t evicted. Lorincz will also have to wear an ankle monitor.

      11-year-old British girl shot dead in France in dispute over garden

            An 11-year-old British girl was shot dead in Saint-Herbot in Brittany, western France, on Saturday, during a dispute between two neighbors over their gardens, according to the local mayor’s office.
    
            The girl’s parents were seriously wounded in the gun attack. Her 8-year-old-sister escaped and was found “unharmed but in a state of shock,” Quimper prosecutor Carine Halley said in a statement on Sunday.
    
            The family were in their garden when their 71-year-old Dutch neighbor appeared with a firearm and started firing several times in their direction before shutting himself in his house with his wife, authorities say.
    
            Police intervened at 10 p.m. local time. An hour later the Dutch man and his wife surrendered and were taken into custody – he has since been placed under investigation for murder, French prosecutors said.
    
            French prosecutors say the 11-year-old was pronounced dead at the hospital, and her father sustained a life-threatening head injury, and is in a critical yet stable condition. The mother, 49, was also wounded in the shooting and remains under care in hospital with the family’s other daughter, 8, who was hospitalized with shock.
    
            The shooting was caused by a disagreement over gardening noise and the cutting down of trees bordering the properties, Régine Guillot, an administrative worker at the town hall of Plonevez-du-Faou, told CNN Monday.
    
            The shooter had been angry at his neighbor, who cut down trees that provided shade to his property, Guillot said, adding that the dispute had been running for at least two years.
    
            The Dutch man is suspected of firing three or four times with a rifle from his own property at his neighbors in their garden, some 10 meters away from him, French prosecutor Camille Miansoni said.
    
            According to the prosecutor, the man is thought to have deliberately targeted the mother and father of the family, adding that the fact that the man went to find his rifle from within his house suggested a level of premeditation in the act.
    
            Miansoni continued to say the pensioner’s wife who has Belgian nationality was placed under investigation on a less serious status for “obstruction of finding the truth.” 
    
            The prosecutor said the wife returned the rifle suspected of being the murder weapon to their house following the shooting.
    
            According to the French prosecutor, the suspected shooter expressed “regret” for the killing, after being detained.
    
            “We thought they were playing with firecrackers,” Yannick, a neighbor who heard the gunfire, told CNN affiliate BFMTV.
    
            “The youngest girl came running to the neighbors shouting: ‘My sister is dead, my sister is dead,’” Yannick said.
    
            Halley said Sunday “the motives for the tragedy are not yet known.” But, according to the initial investigation, “it appears there had been a dispute between the two neighbors for several years over a piece of land adjoining the two properties.”
    
            The Quimper prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation on charges of voluntary manslaughter of a minor and attempted murder.
    
            Marguerite Bleuzen, the mayor of Plonévez-du-Faou, a town bordering Saint-Herbot, told BFMTV Sunday she had been made aware of a dispute between neighbors several years ago.
    
            “I intervened with my deputies when we were elected. There was a problem with the land, noise complaints,” Bleuzen said.
    
            “I’m dumbfounded,” the mayor added.

            A Florida woman who fatally shot a Black neighbor during a dispute over kids playing outside admitted hurling racial slurs at the children and told detectives the victim threatened to kill her, according to an arrest affidavit. 
    
            The affidavit was released before bond for Susan Louise Lorincz was set at $154,000 on Friday. 
    
            Lorincz, a 58-year-old White woman, was arrested on a charge of manslaughter Tuesday, four days after investigators say she fatally shot Ajike “AJ” Owens through the front door of Lorincz’s home near Ocala, Florida, as Owens repeatedly knocked on her door, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said. 
    
            The arrest affidavit released from the sheriff’s Office said Lorincz became “angry” that neighborhood children, including the children of the victim, were playing near her home.
    
            The affidavit detailed interviews with witnesses whose names are redacted. Two witnesses are believed to be some of the victim’s children.
    
            One of Owens’ sons told a deputy he’d been playing basketball in the street while his younger 10-year-old brother played in the nearby field, according to the affidavit. The child told the deputy his younger brother informed him that he had left an electronic tablet in the field and said Lorincz had picked it up.
    
            When the 10-year-old asked Lorincz to return the tablet, he told the deputy, the woman threw it to the ground and yelled at him. The child claimed Lorincz threw roller skates at him, according to the affidavit. 
    
            The affidavit says the older child said he told his younger sibling to tell their mother what was going on, and then he approached Lorincz’s front door and yelled, “You want to throw something, throw it at me!” Lorincz came out of her home and told him he was trespassing and swung an umbrella in his direction, the affidavit stated.
    
            “Shortly after, the victim approached Lorincz’ front door and banged on the door, yelling for Lorincz to throw something at her if she wanted to throw something,” the affidavit said. 
    
            The older child then heard a “loud bang” and witnessed his mother “stumbling” away from the door while telling him to call 911, according to information obtained by a deputy, which is laid out in the affidavit.
    
            The defendant painted a different picture of events in her interview with a sheriff’s deputy, according to the affidavit.
    
            Lorincz told the deputy she’d been having problems with the “same juveniles” for the past years “due to their lack of respect for her peace and privacy,” the affidavit stated. Lorincz also told the deputy that Owens’ children had told her “they would kill her” in the past, according to the affidavit.
    
            Lorincz denied picking up a tablet or throwing roller skates at anyone in her interview with the deputy, the affidavit states. But she acknowledged throwing roller skates in the yard and telling the children to “go fetch them.” She also admitted that it was possible she had swung an umbrella near one of the children, but wouldn’t have hit them, according to the court document.
    
            On the night of the shooting, Lorincz told the deputy that after she told all the children to leave, Owens suddenly appeared at her door and started banging on it while yelling, “I’m going to f**king kill you!”
    
            Owens was banging on her door with so much force, Lorincz told the deputy, that she panicked, stating “Oh my god she’s really going to kill me this time,” according to the affidavit.
    
            Then, Lorincz said, she retrieved her handgun and fired a single shot through the door, telling the deputy she was afraid for her life, the affidavit stated. The defendant also told the deputy she “never intended to hit the victim when she fired the gun and thought she ‘hit’ really high when she shot.” 
    
            Neighbors interviewed by sheriff’s deputies revealed a history of negative interactions between Lorincz and children in the neighborhood, with one saying the White woman was “always yelling at the children who play in the area and calls in false reports on them,” according to the affidavit.
    
            The court document quotes Owens’ younger child as saying Lorincz had called him and other children “bastards” and “jackasses,” and, at one time stated, “This isn’t the underground railroad, slave.” 
    
            A neighbor told deputies that the night of the shooting, Lorincz came out of her home and gave the children playing in the field the middle finger and yelled, “Get away from my house, you black slave,” the affidavit said.
    
            In a second interview with law enforcement, the affidavit said the defendant acknowledged using racial slurs toward children in the past.
    
            “Lorincz admitted to having used the n-word toward children out of anger in the past and also calling children other derogatory terms,” the detective noted in the affidavit.
    
            When reached by CNN, Lorincz’s attorney Amanda Sizemore said she has no comment on the case at this time. 
    
            A judge on Friday set bond at $150,000 for the felony charge and another $4,000 for four misdemeanor counts. Lorincz told the court she could only afford a bond of $1,700. 
    
            She also said she is unemployed and owns about $3,000 worth of furniture. 
    
            The state requested a $200,000 bond. 
    
            The owner of the apartment where Lorincz lives told detectives she was being evicted, according to a prosecutor – and the judge recommended Lorincz not return there. 
    
            In addition to manslaughter with a firearm, Lorincz is facing charges of culpable negligence, battery and two counts of assault, the sheriff’s office said early Wednesday. 
    
            If Lorincz posts bond, she will not be allowed to possess a firearm or any other weapon, nor is she allowed to have any contact with the victim’s family. If she returns to her apartment to gather belongings, she will have to have someone accompany her. She is allowed to live in her apartment as long as she isn’t evicted. Lorincz will also have to wear an ankle monitor. 
    
            Lorincz made an initial court appearance via video call on Thursday. She told the court she has no savings, is making payments on a car, and had filed for disability after working at UnitedHealthcare. She said she last worked two weeks ago and that she supports her 55-year-old sister.
    
            In the days since the killing, Owens’ family had repeatedly called for the arrest and charging of the shooter, insisting the incident was unprovoked and unjustified.  
    
            Though the arrest has brought Owens’ family some relief, one of her sons is grappling with remorse because he was the one who told his mother about Lorincz’s confrontation with the children, the family said. 
    
            “He witnessed his mother shot and killed. In his soul, and his heart, it’s his fault that his older brother, his baby sister, and his baby brother, as well as himself, will never see their mother again,” Pamela Dias, Owens’ mother, said of the young boy. 
    
            Another child also blamed himself because he was unable to perform CPR on his mother, Dias said.
    
            “Grandma, grandma. I couldn’t save her,” Dias recalled the 12-year-old boy telling her.
    
             A funeral service will be held for Owens on Monday, according to a family attorney.

      Paris rental bikes deliver unexpected anti-abortion messages

    ","
             Since being launched in 2007, Paris’ public Vélib’ rental bikes have proven a hit with tourists and locals as a trouble-free way to get around the French capital, especially in summer when Metro trains are hot and crowded.
    
            This year, however, the popular bikes have unwittingly become embroiled in a controversy with its roots in a fierce debate raging at the heart of French, and European, society.
    
            In recent weeks, activists have turned some Vélib’ cycles into billboards featuring unexpected messages from a guerrilla advertising campaign opposing abortion rights.
    
            The campaign has sparked outrage, with politicians and women’s rights groups condemning the move.
    
            Stickers first began appearing in May, when Parisians and tourists woke up to find neighborhood public bikes covered in decals showing a fetus growing into a happy-looking boy riding a bike with this slogan: “And if you had let him live?”
    
            The decals prompted backlash from government officials with Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo calling them “unacceptable and illegal.” France’s minister for gender equality, Isabelle Rome, vowed the country wouldn’t let anyone undermine abortion rights.
    
            The guerrilla campaign is the work of a group called Les Survivants, according to a statement posted on its website after the stickers began appearing. The group says its name refers to people born post-1975 who “survived” the threat of abortion, which was legalized in France that year.
    
            It was, the group said in a statement issued May 24, a response to efforts to make abortion a constitutional right in France.
    
            “At a time when a proposed law aims to enshrine abortion in the constitution, The Survivors have decided to act on behalf of all those we miss,” the statement said. “We will not tolerate a dichotomous supreme standard in which abortion becomes a fundamental right, like the right to life.”
    
            Suzy Rojtman, a spokesperson for the French National Collective for Women’s Rights said the campaign demonstrated an urgent need for France to secure abortion laws.
    
            The people who put up these stickers “would be overjoyed to revisit abortion rights,” Rojtman, a feminist campaigner since 1974, told CNN.  
    
            “We are worried, we are wary because we know this right could always be challenged and the United States has proven this,” Rojtman said.
    
            The US Supreme Court’s 2022 overturn of Roe v. Wade, a ruling that made abortion a federal constitutional right, sent shockwaves across French society. In response, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his solidarity with “the women whose liberties are being undermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.”
    
            In the following months, the French government moved to introduce a bill that would inscribe abortion rights into the constitution. The proposal  has stalled after lawmakers in the lower house and upper house disagreed on wording.
    
            Representatives in the National Assembly, where Macron’s party is the biggest force, voted for a bill that would  list abortion as a “right” in the constitution while the conservative-dominated French Senate only agreed to listing abortion as a “freedom.” In French legal context, a “right” is protected by the government in a more active manner than a “freedom.”
    
            The assembly standoff comes amid prominent opposition to abortion in some of France’s neighbors – most notably Italy, a country with strong Roman Catholic traditions.
    
            Italy’s Minister of Family, Eugenia Roccella, voiced her opposition to extending the use of Mifepristone, a common abortion pill, in an interview in 2022 with Italian newspaper Quotidiano Nazionale, calling it home abortion “abolishing conscientious objection and the legal obligation.”
    
            Nearly 70% of doctors in Italy refuse to carry out abortion on the grounds of “conscientious objection” leading to extreme difficulties for many women to get one, as CNN has previously reported.
    
            In Spain, the center-right People’s party and far-right Vox party have been challenging the country’s abortion law, in effect  since 2010. There have been similar moves elsewhere in Europe, with Poland and Hungary curtailing abortion access.
    
            Meanwhile, Vélib’, the company which runs the public bike system in Paris, says it is unhappy to see its two-wheeled charges being drafted into the debate.
    
            It called the sticker campaign uncivilized and said it “may have confused the general public.” It said it has begun legal action against the anti-abortion group.
    
            “It’s shocking that some people ignore all advertising regulations,” Vélib’ President Sylvain Raifaud said in a statement, adding that perpetrators must be brought to justice.
    
            CNN has reached out to The Survivors for comments on the the legal action and whether it plans to continue carrying out similar campaigns in the future.
    
            Raifaud also vowed to return the bikes to their original status as quickly as possible. Vélib’ has yet to confirm how many bikes are impacted and when they will be restored.

      Children of Black Florida mother who was killed after knocking on neighbor’s door consumed with guilt over her death
    ","

    ","
            One of the children of Ajike “AJ” Owens, the Black woman who authorities say was fatally shot last week in central Florida after knocking on a neighbor’s door, is consumed with guilt over his mother’s death. 
    
            The 9-year-old boy, who witnessed the shooting, blames himself because he first told his mom the neighbor had confronted him and his siblings. 
    
            “In his soul, in his heart, it’s his fault that his older brother, his baby sister and his baby brother, as well as himself, will never see their mother again,” Owens’ mother, Pamela Dias, told reporters Wednesday. 
    
            Dias, who spoke at a news conference a day after a 58-year-old woman was arrested in connection with the death, said another child also blamed himself because he was unable to perform CPR on his mother.  
    
            “Grandma, grandma. I couldn’t save her,” Dias recalled the 12-year-old boy telling her.  
    
            Susan Louise Lorincz was arrested on charges of manslaughter with a firearm, culpable negligence, battery and two counts of assault, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said early Wednesday. 
    
            Lorincz, who is White, was taken into custody Tuesday night, the sheriff’s office said. It was not immediately clear whether she has an attorney.
    
            Her first court appearance is expected on Thursday, according to the sheriff’s office. Lorincz is “undergoing testing to be medically cleared” before being held in a cell at the Marion County Jail. She will not be present in court but will appear via video call, the sheriff’s office said.
    
            Ben Crump, an attorney representing Owens’ family, and Dias said they were grateful for the arrest but questioned why it took days to happen.  
    
            “We don’t take that lightly. We don’t take it for granted, because Black people, and swift justice, in America, is not something that happens all the time,” Crump said at the news conference with members of Owens’ family. 
    
            “If the roles were reversed, and you have a Black woman shoot a White woman through a locked metal door, nobody would be saying, ‘It’s a difficult case. It is a simple case.’ The only question is, are we going give AJ the same respect, the same dignity?” Crump added. 
    
            Dias asked, “When is it OK, in America, to shoot someone (from) behind the locked door? When is that okay?”
    
            The Rev. Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy at a service for Owens on Monday. 
    
            Authorities say Owens was shot through the door of her neighbor’s home near Ocala, Florida, on Friday. Owens’ family and attorneys had demanded that her killer be arrested and charged. Her family has also accused Lorincz of yelling at Owens’ children and calling them racial slurs prior to the shooting.
    
            When interviewed, Lorincz claimed that she acted in self defense and that Owens had been trying to break down her door prior to her discharging her firearm, according to a news release the sheriff’s office. Lorincz also said Owens had come after her in the past and had previously attacked her, the release said.
    
            “Through their investigation – including obtaining the statements of eyewitnesses who only came forward as late as yesterday – detectives were able to establish that Lorincz’s actions were not justifiable under Florida law,” the sheriff’s office said.
    
            Prosecutors had been working with investigators in Marion County to determine whether they will file charges in the case, Fifth Judicial Chief Assistant State Attorney Walter Forgie said Tuesday. 
    
            Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods said Monday that investigators had to consider Florida’s “stand your ground” law before making an arrest. The statute allows people to respond with deadly force if they reasonably believe they are being threatened with death or serious injury, and says they don’t have to retreat if they’re “not engaged in a criminal activity and … in a place where he or she has a right to be.”
    
            Woods emphasized Monday that authorities had largely only heard the perspective of the shooter, who has not been publicly named, and were still working to interview Owens’ children, who witnessed the killing. 
    
            Investigators have determined Owens knocked on Lorincz’s door to confront her after the she threw a pair of skates at her children, hitting at least one of them, according to Woods. 
    
            Owens’ family has insisted that her killing was unjustified. 
    
            “My daughter, my grandchildren’s mother, was shot and killed with her 9-year-old son standing next to her,” Dias said Monday. “She had no weapon, she posed no imminent threat to anyone.”
    
            One witness told a sheriff’s deputy that children were playing in a nearby field before the shooting and a dispute ensued as the neighbor picked up an electronic tablet that one of the children left on the ground, according to an incident report. 
    
            The shooter “engaged” with Owens’ children and threw a pair of skates at them, hitting at least one, according to Woods. 
    
            One of Owens’ children then went home and told the mother what had happened, prompting Owens to walk over to the neighbor’s house and knock on the door, Woods said. 
    
            As Owens confronted the neighbor, Owens was shot through the door, the sheriff said. When deputies responded to the scene Friday night after receiving a trespassing call, they found Owens laying in the grass with a gunshot wound, the incident report said.
    
            The mother was then brought to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, authorities have said. 
    
            Owens’ family and attorneys gathered at a news conference Monday to demand justice for her, saying that her killing was unwarranted and unprovoked. 
    
            In an interview with MSNBC on Monday, Owens’ mother said Owens acted “as any parent would do.”
    
            “She simply knocked on the door, was unarmed, no weapons. She just wanted answers. She wanted to speak to another adult regarding the incident with her 9-year-old son,” Dias told MSNBC.
    
            A single mother of four, Owens has been remembered by her loved ones as a dedicated caretaker of her family and an infectiously positive person.
    
            “She had a smile that would light up the room,” reads a verified GoFundMe page started by her family. “But most of all, she was known for how much she loved and absolutely lived for her four children.”
    
            “There wasn’t anything that she wouldn’t do for those near and dear to her heart. She often would give to other single mothers that were in similar situations that she’d been in,” the fundraiser page said.

      Louisiana’s legislature sends ban on gender-affirming care for most minors to Democratic governor’s desk
    ","
			By Jack Forrest, CNN
		;Jack Forrest","
  Updated
        3:56 PM EDT, Tue June 6, 2023
    ","
            Louisiana’s Republican-led legislature Tuesday passed a ban on gender-affirming care for most minors in the state, sending the bill to a Democratic governor who has signaled opposition to the legislation but faces a GOP supermajority with the numbers to override his veto power.
    
            House Bill 648 would bar those under 18 in Louisiana from receiving gender-affirming surgeries, puberty blocking medications and hormone treatments, and would punish health care professionals that provide such care to minors with the revocation of their license for a minimum of two years. The legislation passed the state House Tuesday by a vote of 75-25, after the Senate passed it Monday with a 29-10 majority, which included some Democrats. 
    
            “Thanks to the bi-partisan support of the Louisiana State Senate, we are one step closer to protecting children in Louisiana from experimental chemical and surgical sex change procedures,” said the bill’s sponsor Republican state Rep. Gabe Firment. “The people of Louisiana have made it clear that our children are worth fighting for.”
    
            While Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards has said that he “almost never” comments on whether he will veto a bill, he expressed dissatisfaction at a news conference in May with a slate of anti-LGBTQ bills, including HB 648, calling them “damaging” and saying that he did not “think they address any real problems.” 
    
            “Those are not the issues that I hear about when I travel the state and meet with our constituents and so forth. It appears to be an effort to simply do in Louisiana what we’ve seen some other states do,” he said last month.  
    
            CNN has reached out to Edwards’ office for comment. 
    
            Gender-affirming care spans a range of evidence-based treatments and approaches that benefit transgender and nonbinary people. The types of care vary by the age and goals of the recipient, and are considered the standard of care by many mainstream medical associations.    
    
            Though the care is highly individualized, some children and parents may decide to use reversible puberty suppression therapy. This part of the process may also include hormone therapy that can lead to gender-affirming physical change. The surgical procedures that the bill seeks to limit, however, are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors.  
    
            The Louisiana bill, if enacted, would prohibit these treatments with limited exceptions. Doctors who began providing such drug or hormone therapy to a minor before January 1, 2024, would be allowed to continue providing care through December 1, 2024, if they determine that “immediately terminating the minor’s use of the drug or hormone would cause harm to the minor.”  
    
            Some Republicans have expressed concern over long-term outcomes of the treatments. But major medical associations say that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria – a psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align, according to the American Psychiatric Association.  
    
            The issue has become a flashpoint with 16 states placing restrictions on gender-affirming care this year – largely in governments with Republican trifectas. Democratic governors, however, have pushed back on Republican-led efforts to restrict the treatments with varying degrees of success.
    
            Edwards faced similar tensions last year, when he declined to take action on an anti-trans sports ban, allowing it to become law. At the time, he said that while he opposed the legislation, it was clear to him that lawmakers would move to override him if he issued a veto.  
    
            Republicans again hold strong enough majorities in the Louisiana’s House and Senate to override vetoes from the governor after the state’s longest serving legislator switched in March from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.  
    
            Not all Republicans, however, support HB 648. The bill was temporarily stalled in a state Senate committee last month, with the panel’s Republican chairman casting a tie-breaking vote against the legislation.  
    
            “I’ve always in my heart of hearts, believed that a decision should be made by a patient and a physician,” state Sen. Fred Mills said, explaining his vote.
    
            The state Senate revived the bill the following week by recalling the bill from Mills’ committee and reassigning it to another, where it was passed. 
    
            “This is a dark day in Louisiana,” the American Civil Liberties Union for Louisiana said in a statement after the bill was revived. “Lawmakers have turned their backs on democratic processes, science, parental rights, and the health and safety of children.” 
    
            The ACLU chapter urged Edwards to veto the bill to “protect the rights of transgender youth and their families.”

      Nonsurgical cat contraception could help curb overpopulation, study says
    ","
			By Kate Golembiewski, CNN
		","
  Updated
        12:11 PM EDT, Tue June 6, 2023
    ","
            There are an estimated 600 million domestic cats in the world, and 80% of them are feral or stray animals.
    
            Spaying and neutering cats helps prevent homeless kittens and overcrowded animal shelters. Curbing feral cat populations also reduces the risk of these animals preying on wild animals, such as birds, small mammals and reptiles. Now, scientists have announced a potential new method of feline contraception that’s shown early promise: long-lasting contraceptive injections that prevent ovulation.
    
            The impetus for the proof-of-concept study “was really to address the cat and dog overpopulation issue and the euthanasia of a lot of these animals in shelters,” said Dr. Bill Swanson, director of animal research at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden and a co-senior and corresponding author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. “The best way to avoid euthanasia is not to have all these animals that don’t have homes.”
    
            The journey to the potential new feline contraceptive method began with a discovery in the laboratory of Dr. David Pépin, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a molecular biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He and his colleagues were studying a hormone present in ovarian follicles, the layer of cells around a mammalian egg cell that nurtures its growth. To learn more about the hormone’s function, the research team injected female mice with the gene that produces it, essentially giving the mice an extra dose of the naturally occurring hormone.
    
            “Much to our surprise, it essentially shut down most ovarian activity in rodents and made them completely infertile,” said Pépin, who was also a co-senior and corresponding author on the new study. “We thought, well, this is a very interesting tool, but what can we use it for?”
    
            Pépin and his colleagues learned about the the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Michelson Found Animals Foundation, which supports the development of nonsurgical contraceptives for cats and dogs. “We had a tool that we knew worked in rodents, and potentially could work in these species. So it was just a matter of applying this to a new species,” Pépin said. “That’s what led us to start collaborating with Bill (Swanson).”
    
            The Cincinnati Zoo, Swanson says, is home to the widest array of wild cats in North America, including lions, tigers and tiny sand cats. Behind the scenes, more familiar felines call the zoo home: a research colony of around 45 domestic cats.
    
            “Most of them are animals that we’re using for either this study or related studies with the Michelson Found Animals Foundation,” Swanson said. “We also do a fair amount of research into cat welfare. We’re working with shelters and trying to figure out the best way to manage cats to get them to be less stressed and more healthy and more adoptable.”
    
            For the contraception study, the scientists worked with nine female cats, which all had names inspired by former US first ladies: Michelle, Betty, Abigail, Nancy, Dolly, Barbara, Rosalyn, Jacque and Mary. Three cats were a control group, while six received injections of the gene of the hormone in question, hitched to a mild virus. The virus makes its way to the muscle cells, which are extremely long-lived.
    
            “Then, basically, the DNA will just float around,” Swanson said. And since muscle cells last so long without being replaced, the gene sticks around, too.
    
            The cats’ genomes remained unaltered by the addition of this gene. “We’re basically introducing the blueprint to make a protein, and it’s not incorporated into the animal’s DNA,” Pépin said.
    
            But the gene does cause the cats’ bodies to make the hormone that prevents ovarian follicle development. Without the maturation of these cells around the egg, the cats don’t ovulate and thus can’t get pregnant.
    
            The researchers monitored hormone levels in the cats’ urine and feces three times a week for two years, and they found elevated levels of the hormone in question more than two years after the injection. To test if those elevated hormone levels would actually prevent pregnancy, though, the scientists brought in two male cats. The three control-group cats all became pregnant, but none of the six cats in the experimental group did.
    
            While these early findings show promise as a new means of cat contraception, Swanson noted, cat owners will have to be patient, as it will likely take several years for the procedure to gain the necessary approvals to become available in veterinary offices, as well as for the injections to be manufactured.
    
            “We are very optimistic that this is going to be a useful product and we’ll eventually have it approved and available, but it’s not going to happen in the next year or two,” he said.
    
            Dr. Pierre Comizzoli, a senior program officer for science and research biologist at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute who was not involved with the new study, is hopeful about the preliminary results, especially the relatively noninvasive nature of the procedure and more limited side effects.
    
            “It’s highly significant. It’s also highly innovative,” he said. “Of course, the number of cats they used for the study is still limited, but those are very encouraging results.”
    
            Meanwhile, the first lady cats from the study are looking for loving homes in the Cincinnati area, where their new owners can bring them back to the zoo for yearly checkups to study their hormone levels over time and monitor for any side effects.
    
            “We’re really focused on adopting these cats out,” said Swanson, who’s adopted three cats from earlier studies. “We want them to have nice homes to live in after they’ve done so much work for us, getting us this important data.”

      A Black mother of 4 was shot and killed by a neighbor. Her family wants the woman who shot her arrested

    ","
            A mother of four was shot and killed in Florida following a longtime feud with a neighbor who had complained about the victim’s children playing outside, authorities and a family attorney said. 
    
            Deputies responded to a trespassing call Friday night and found one woman suffering from a gunshot wound, Marion County, Florida, Sheriff Billy Woods said in a Monday news conference. 
    
            The victim was identified by authorities as Ajike “AJ” Owens. She was 35. 
    
            The shooter, also a woman, “engaged” with Owens’ children and threw a pair of skates, hitting the children, the sheriff said. A witness told police there had been a dispute over a child’s electronic tablet device prior to the shooter throwing the skates at the children, according to an incident report from the sheriff’s office.
    
            Following that interaction, one of the children went back inside their home and told their mother, who went to the neighbor’s home “to confront the lady,” the sheriff said. 
    
            According to the shooter, there was “a lot of aggressiveness” from both sides, as well as threats being made, and Owens was ultimately shot through the door, Woods said. 
    
            Witnesses told authorities Owens went to the shooter’s home and knocked on the door before she was shot, according to the incident report.
    
            Owens was later pronounced dead at a hospital, authorities said. 
    
            The woman who fired at Owens has been cooperating with law enforcement, the sheriff added. No arrest has been made in the case. 
    
            Authorities have not named the shooter or shared any identifying information. But civil rights attorney Ben Crump, one of the attorneys representing the family, identified her as a White woman, according to a news release from his office Monday. The incident report also described the shooter as a 58-year-old White woman.
    
            In a separate news conference held by Owens’ family attorneys, the victim’s mother said the neighbor who shot her daughter had called the family, including the children, racial slurs. 
    
            The neighbor’s door “never opened,” when Owens, who was Black, tried to confront her, and she was shot through the door, Pamela Dias, the victim’s mother said.
    
            “My daughter, my grandchildren’s mother, was shot and killed with her 9-year-old son standing next to her. She had no weapon, she posed no imminent threat to anyone,” Dias said. 
    
            “What I’m asking is for justice,” she added. “Justice for my daughter.”
    
            Speaking to MSNBC Monday night, Crump said the fact that there has not been an arrest in the case is “appalling.”
    
            “It is asinine when they try to justify this unjustifiable killing of this mother of four who was killed in front of her children,” Crump said. “It is heartbreaking on every level.”
    
            A verified GoFundMe page to support Owens’ family had raised more than $30,000 by Monday night. 
    
            In Monday’s news conference, authorities pleaded for calm and patience as they investigated the shooting, worked to recover possible video footage and interview the children who witnessed the incident. The sheriff also asked for anyone with information to come forward.
    
            While responding to criticism about how long the investigation and a possible arrest is taking, the sheriff referenced the state’s “stand your ground” law. The law allows people to meet “force with force” if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant.
    
            “What a lot of people don’t understand is that law has specific instructions for us in law enforcement,” he said. “Any time that we think, or perceive or believe that that might come into play, we cannot make an arrest, the law specifically says that.”
    
            “What we have to rule out is whether the deadly force was justified or not before we can even make the arrest,” he said.
    
            Authorities had received reports from the two neighbors dating back to at least January 2021, the sheriff said. Those reports included calls from the shooter complaining about Owens’ children, the sheriff said, adding that it was “children being children,” either being on someone’s property or playing in front of the multiplex. 
    
            “Here’s what I wish: I wish our shooter would have called us instead of taking actions into her own hands. I wish Ms. Owens would have called us, in hopes we could have never got to the point in which we are here today,” he said.
    
            “Pray for those children. Pray for each and every one of them,” Woods added. “Their life has changed.” 
    
            The sheriff vowed to Owens’ family and friends that his office “is going to do everything to bring justice.”

      Kathleen Folbigg: Mother who served 20 years for killing her four babies pardoned

    ","
            A woman condemned as Australia’s worst female serial killer has been pardoned after serving 20 years behind bars for killing her four children in what appears to be one of the country’s gravest miscarriages of justice.
    
            New South Wales Attorney General Michael Daley intervened to order Kathleen Folbigg be freed, based on the preliminary findings of an inquiry that had found “reasonable doubt” as to her guilt for all four deaths.
    
            Daley told a news conference Monday that he had spoken to the governor and recommended an unconditional pardon, which had been granted, and she would be released from Clarence Correctional Center the same day.
    
            “This has been a terrible ordeal for everyone concerned and I hope that our actions today can put some closure on this 20-year-old matter,” said Daley, who added that he had informed Craig Folbigg, the babies’ father, of his decision. “It will be a tough day for him,” he said.
    
            Kathleen Folbigg was jailed in 2003 on three counts of murder and one of manslaughter following the deaths of her four babies over a decade from 1989. In each case, she was the person who found their bodies, though there was no physical evidence that she had caused their deaths.
    
            Instead, the jury relied on the prosecution’s argument that the chances of four babies from one family dying from natural causes before the age of 2 were so infinitesimally low as to be compared to pigs flying.
    
            They also noted the contents of her diary, which contained passages that in isolation at the time were interpreted as confessions of guilt. 
    
            As recently as 2019, an inquiry into her convictions found there was no reasonable doubt she had committed the crimes. But another inquiry began last year after new scientific evidence emerged that provided a genetic explanation for the children’s deaths.
    
            In her closing submissions, Sophie Callan, the lead counsel assisting the inquiry, said that “on the whole of the body of evidence before this inquiry there is a reasonable doubt as to Ms Folbigg’s guilt.”
    
            She also told the inquiry that in its closing submissions, the NSW director of public prosecutions had indicated she was also “open to the Inquiry to conclude there is reasonable doubt as to Ms Folbigg’s guilt.”
    
            Folbigg was just 20 years old when she married Craig Folbigg, who she’d met in her hometown of Newcastle on the northern New South Wales coast. 
    
            Within a year she fell pregnant with Caleb, who was born in February, 1989 and lived only 19 days. The next year, the Folbiggs had another son, Patrick, who died at eight months. Two years later, Sarah died at 10 months. Then in 1999, the couple’s fourth and longest lived child, Laura, died at 18 months.  
    
            The police investigation into the deaths of all four children began the day Laura died, but it was more than two years before Folbigg was arrested and charged. By then, the couple’s marriage had fallen apart, and Craig was cooperating with police to build a case against her. 
    
            He handed police her diaries, which prosecutors argued contained the deepest thoughts of a mother tortured by guilt for her role in her children’s deaths.  
    
            Examination of the babies’ remains failed to find any physical evidence they’d been suffocated, but without another plausible reason to explain their deaths, suspicion focused on Kathleen, their primary carer.
    
            In 2003, as he sentenced Folbigg to 40 years in prison, Judge Graham Barr recalled her troubled past. Folbigg’s father had killed her mother when she was just 18 months old, and she had spent many of her formative years in foster care. 
    
            According to court documents, Barr said Folbigg’s prospects of rehabilitation were “negligible.”
    
            “She will always be a danger if given the responsibility of caring for a child,” he said. “That must never happen.” 
    
            That initial conviction ruling now stands in stark contrast to the latest inquiry, which looks set to paint a far different picture of Folbigg as a loving mother who was devastated and confused by the successive deaths of her babies.
    
            As he ordered her release Monday, Daley distributed a memorandum of the findings by retired judge Tom Bathurst, who said after reviewing the evidence he was “unable to accept … the proposition that Ms Folbigg was anything but a caring mother for her children.”
    
            In the case of the two girls – Sarah and Laura – Bathurst found there was a “reasonable possibility” a genetic mutation known as CALM2-G114R “occasioned their deaths,” and that Sarah may have died from myocarditis, inflammation of the heart, identified during her autopsy.
    
            In the case of Patrick, who had an unexplained ALTE, an apparent life-threatening event, when he was 4 months old and died at 8 months, Bathurst found that it’s possible his death was caused by an underlying neurogenic disorder. 
    
            During Folbigg’s 2003 trial, the prosecution used “coincidence and tendency” evidence to allege that Folbigg had also killed Caleb. In other words, that having been allegedly responsible for the deaths of three children, it was likely she killed him, too.
    
            However, Bathurst found that the reasonable doubt over Folbigg’s role in his siblings’ deaths meant that the prosecution’s case against her for Caleb’s murder “falls away.” 
    
            In relation to her diaries, Bathurst said the “evidence suggests they were the writings of a grieving and possibly depressed mother, blaming herself for the death of each child, as distinct from admissions that she murdered or otherwise harmed them.”
    
            Bathurst also expressed doubts about evidence from Craig Folbigg, who had claimed his wife had been “ill-tempered” with their children and had “growled at them from time to time.”
    
            “The balance of evidence … (was) that she was a loving and caring mother,” wrote Bathurst, whose full report will be released at a later date. 
    
            In an email to CNN, Craig Folbigg’s lawyer Danny Eid said his client’s view of his former wife’s guilt had “not changed whatsoever.”
    
            “Ms Folbigg has not been acquitted of the crimes, and her convictions are not displaced,” Eid said.
    
            Folbigg’s case has been compared to that of Lindy Chamberlain, who swore a dingo took her baby Azaria from the family’s campsite at Uluru in 1980. 
    
            The case polarized public opinion and Chamberlain was jailed before evidence emerged that she was telling the truth.
    
            In 1986, Azaria’s matinee jacket was found half-buried in the dirt, prompting officials to free Chamberlain, later known as Chamberlain-Creighton. Two years later, a court overturned her conviction, and in 2012 a coroner ruled that a dingo was indeed to blame for Azaria’s death.
    
            Like Chamberlain-Creighton, Folbigg’s release from prison could be the start of a long process to clear her name.
    
            Daley told reporters Monday that Folbigg’s pardon only meant she did not have to serve the rest of her sentence, and that it would be up to the Court of Criminal Appeal to quash her convictions.
    
            He said it was too early to talk about compensation, as that would require Folbigg to initiate civil proceedings against the New South Wales government, or to approach it seeking an ex-gratia payment. 
    
            Daley acknowledged that after 20 years of believing Folbigg’s guilt, some people may not accept her innocence. 
    
            “There will be some people who have strong views. There’s nothing I can do to disavow them of those views, (and) it’s not my role to do that,” he said.
    
            But he suggested the events of the past two decades should elicit some compassion for a woman who has lost so much.
    
            “We’ve got four little bubbas who are dead. We’ve got a husband and wife who lost each other. A woman who spent 20 years in jail, and a family that never had a chance. You’d not be human if you didn’t feel something,” he said.

      We all need ‘Sushi Tuesdays’: Lessons in understanding and finding a way forward after suicide
    ","
			By Jodie Sadowsky, CNN

    ","
            When Sam Maya, a beloved husband, father, friend, stockbroker and coach, died by suicide 16 years ago, he left a note. He apologized to his wife, Charlotte, for being a burden and telling her and their two sons, then 6 and 8, that he loved them. 
    
            In her recent heartbreaking memoir, “Sushi Tuesdays: A Memoir of Love, Loss and Family Resilience,” Charlotte Maya bears witness to Sam’s life, death and the aftermath with a singular purpose: to humanize the face of suicide and help readers develop a fluency in discussing mental health.
    
            She spent nearly a decade writing “Sushi Tuesdays,” beginning with a blog by the same name, an homage to the weekly ritual she created after her husband’s death. 
    
            Every Tuesday while her kids were at school, Maya set aside her overwhelming to-do list as a lawyer and widowed single parent. Tuesdays began with a yoga class, then therapy, followed by whatever she needed most: perhaps going back to bed, going on a hike or heading to a solo sushi lunch.
    
            I met Maya in a memoir workshop last year. I have a family history of mental illness and suicide, so I connected with her work and motivation for sharing her story.  
    
            In 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for Americans ages 10 to 34, the fifth for ages 35 to 54, and the 11th leading cause of death nationwide, claiming the lives of more than 48,000 people, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
    
            The suicide rate among men in 2021 was nearly four times higher than the rate of women, according to the CDC. Research supports the assumption that men typically choose more effective and lethal means, such as firearms, to complete suicide, according to Dr. Ashwini Nadkarni, a psychiatrist and researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. 
    
            Additionally, men are less likely to seek treatment for depression due to gendered expectations that equate masculinity with emotional stoicism, Nadkarni said. 
    
            Suicide is a national health crisis, Maya told me, but when we hear of such a loss, we often attribute each death to the unique problem the deceased faced, such as financial or legal troubles. 
    
            These stressors don’t explain suicide, she said. “Lots of people lose money, and they don’t take their own lives. They figure things out.” 
    
            When her husband died, Maya knew he had back pain and was stressed about work and money, but she didn’t think these things added up to being suicidal. In retrospect, she can now spot clues, such as his review of his will shortly before he died. 
    
            “I wanted to turn back the clock after Sam died,” she said. “I felt so strongly that if I could get back to that morning, I could have changed everything. It’s hard to reckon with what cannot be undone, to face straight into what I did or didn’t do, where I failed, where Sam failed.”
    
            “Whenever I say that Sam made a mistake, the mistake I mean is that he didn’t ask for help,” Maya said. “It’s hard to say you’re suffering when you’re suffering, so let your loved ones know you are available to help.” 
    
            Asking people directly about suicidal thoughts may reduce, rather than increase, suicidal ideation, according to a 2014 review of scholarly literature in the journal Psychological Medicine.
    
            That does require that people look for and notice signs that others may be struggling, such as changes in mood, behavior, appetite or sleep habits or that they are giving away cherished possessions. 
    
            Speaking directly about mental health became a trademark of Maya’s single parenting. She aimed for her boys “to live full and fruitful lives, not defined by their father’s suicide, not limited by their father’s suicide, but also not ignoring their father’s suicide.”
    
            Her sons grieved their dad in their own ways, including denial (one pretended his father was on an extended business trip) and rageful episodes that ended with destroyed Lego sets and tears. Maya mourned with them about the “daddy-shaped space in their hearts” but promised that someday they’d be able to say, “I survived my father’s suicide, and I can do anything.”
    
            “It can be awkward to say yes when people ask to help,” Maya said. “Because I was so shocked and overwhelmed, I just said yes. I recommend that course of action to people. Let people show up and help you.”
    
            The support from Maya’s village was so vast that she wrestled with which of her friends would be fully fledged characters in “Sushi Tuesdays” and which would have cameo appearances. 
    
            She dealt with this challenge — and the confusion caused by many friends with names starting with the letter J — by cleverly referring to her friends, collectively, as “The Janes.” Given her background as a lawyer, she thought of them as Jane Doe No. 1, Jane Doe No. 2 and so on. 
    
            In the book, readers meet District Attorney Jane who helped with the coroner’s office, Engineer Jane who gets the boys to school each day on time and Prayer Warrior Jane who prays for Maya while she’s “not exactly on speaking terms with God.” 
    
            One friend, identified not as a “Jane” but as “Bess” in the narrative, is Katherine Tasheff, a college friend from Rice University. When Sam Maya died, Tasheff was a single mother living on a budget in Brooklyn and couldn’t travel to California to visit. So, she did what she could: She wrote her friend an email. And then another. And another. Morning and night for 365 days following Sam’s death. 
    
            The emails were always heartfelt and genuine but often mixed with dark humor. In one, Tasheff wrote, “We did an informal poll on whose husband was most likely to take his own life, and I want you to know that Sam came in last place.” 
    
            Almost immediately, Charlotte Maya replied, “Dead last?”
    
            This kind of banter fueled Maya, who told her therapist to “call 911” if she ever lost her sense of humor. Finding moments of levity, she said, helped her hold onto her humanity. “Humor doesn’t cancel out what is devastating,” Maya told me. “Just like gratitude cannot cancel out what is horrifying. What’s important is having the capacity to hold both of those things.”
    
            Seven years after her husband died, in 2014, Maya felt ready to write about surviving his suicide. Tasheff acted with her signature hadn’t-been-asked swiftness, setting up a blog site for sushituesdays.com within an hour.
    
            By then, Maya had met and married the most eligible widower in her town, now nicknamed Mr. Page 179 because that’s where he shows up in the book. They each brought two sons to the marriage. (Coincidentally, each has a child named Daniel, so they now have two Daniels.) 
    
            Maya continues to honor her Tuesdays with therapy and yoga, a hike with a friend, and sometimes a sushi lunch. 
    
            She urges everyone — especially single parents and anyone managing anxiety or depression — to carve out a similar weekly ritual, even if it’s just an hour to “treat yourself with the same compassion as you treat your dearest friends.”
    
            The coping mechanisms that Maya relied on in her grief may further explain the gender disparity in suicide rates, according to psychologist Lauren Kerwin.
    
            Men may be less likely to have strong support networks or to engage with them when in stress or emotional pain and may be more likely to use maladaptive coping strategies, such as substance abuse or isolation, Kerwin said. 
    
            Seeking social connection and professional help is critical to preventing suicide. 
    
            “Now, more than ever, we have a better understanding of the neuroinflammatory basis for depression — the medical framework gives us a model in which to consider depression as a medical condition and one which can be treated,” said Nadkarni, the Boston psychiatrist.
    
            If you see warning signs or are worried about someone who may be struggling, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention recommends you assume you are the only one who will reach out. Find a time to speak privately and listen. Let people know their life matters to you and ask directly if they are thinking about suicide. Then encourage them to use the national suicide hotline by calling or texting the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, contact their doctor or therapist or seek treatment.

      A gynecologist accused of secretly being a ‘serial sperm donor’ died in an aircraft crash. A lawsuit against him is still pending

            A New York gynecologist who was accused by a woman of secretly using his own sperm to impregnate multiple patients died in an aircraft crash Sunday. 
    
            Morris Wortman, 72, of Rochester, New York, died when the experimental aircraft he was a passenger in crashed into a pasture in western New York, according to a news release from the Orleans County Sheriff’s Office. The aircraft’s pilot, 70-year-old Earl J. Luce Jr., was also killed, the sheriff’s office said. 
    
            Preliminary investigations indicate the wings fell off the aircraft’s body and landed in an orchard and what was left of the aircraft traveled briefly before crashing, the sheriff’s office said. The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the wreck, according to the news release. 
    
            Wortman was the director of The Center for Menstrual Disorders, a Rochester medical office founded in 1986 and dedicated to women’s healthcare and reproductive services, according to its website. 
    
            Wortman is also described on the website as a “world-class aviator.” 
    
            In 2021, Wortman, along with his medical practice, was sued for allegedly using his own sperm to impregnate a woman who was seeking to become pregnant through a sperm donor.
    
            The woman’s daughter filed the lawsuit in Monroe County, according to court documents.
    
            The plaintiff began seeing Wortman in 2012 for ongoing gynecological problems, the lawsuit alleges. She was by then married with children of her own, the lawsuit states.
    
            “It was inconceivable to Plaintiff that … Wortman would use his own semen to impregnate a patient, her mother in 1985, and furthermore, knowingly treat his own biological daughter as a gynecology patient for almost a decade,” the lawsuit states.
    
            She claims she discovered she had at least 13 half-siblings after DNA testing, court documents say.
    
            At least six of the half-siblings were all donor-conceived and born in the same four-year time frame between 1981 and 1985, according to the lawsuit.
    
            “With each new half-sibling discovery, Plaintiff experienced increased anxiety, migraine headaches, shock and confusion, feelings of despair, stress and other physical manifestations of continuing to learn that her donor father had been a serial sperm donor,” it said.
    
            CNN has reached out to Wortman’s attorneys for comment. Wortman was board certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1982, according to his medical office’s website.
    
            The lawsuit is still pending, according to court records.

      Teen girl in India stabbed to death in public, reigniting outrage over violence against women

            A 16 year-old girl was brutally stabbed and bludgeoned to death in a busy public alleyway in India’s capital on Sunday, sparking renewed outrage over the safety of women in the country and violence perpetrated by men. 
    
            Video of the incident, which lasted for more than a minute and was captured on security camera, shows multiple people walking close by as the attacker repeatedly strikes the victim. 
    
            Only one man is shown attempting to intervene, trying to pull the attacker off the victim before quickly retreating. 
    
            The body of the victim, who has not been identified, was found Sunday evening in the Shahbad Dairy area of the northern Delhi neighborhood of Rohini, where the incident took place. 
    
            On Monday afternoon, Indian police said they had arrested a male suspect named Sahil in connection with the murder. 
    
            Sahil, a mechanic, was detained in Bulandshahr in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state, Ravi Kumar Singh, Deputy Police Commissioner for Outer Delhi, told reporters on Monday.
    
            Delhi’s Special Commissioner of Police Deependra Pathak told Indian news channel Times Now that the initial investigation pointed toward a so called “crime of passion.”
    
            “I saw my daughter was lying on the ground, with her face to the ground,” the girl’s father, Janak Raj, told CNN. “Her organs had come out and her head had been smashed in. She lay there lifeless. There was no point in taking her to hospital.”
    
            “It angers me to know that no one helped my daughter,” he added. If they had helped her, she would have been alive today. I also heard that the bystanders were busy filming videos of the incident. Even if they had screamed, it would have helped my daughter.”
    
            Raj said his daughter helped the family’s finances by tutoring. “I don’t feel alive today,” he said through tears. “I miss her so much. She was such a good child. What do I do?”
    
            The incident is the latest in a long line of killings and rapes that have triggered anger about whether enough is being done both to protect women in India and punish attackers.
    
            “A minor girl is brutally murdered openly in Delhi,” Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote on Twitter. “This is very sad and unfortunate. The criminals have become fearless, and there is no fear of the police.”
    
            “The safety of the people of Delhi is of paramount importance,” he added. 
    
            Swati Maliwal, chairperson of the Delhi Commision for Women, told ANI she’s never seen such a frightening incident. 
    
            “Delhi has become extremely unsafe for women and girls,” she added. 
    
            India has long struggled to address gender violence. A 2018 Thompson Reuters Foundation survey of experts on women’s issues ranked the country as the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman. 
    
            The frequency of crimes against women in India also appears to be increasing. According to data from India’s National Crime Records Bureau, crimes against women were 20% higher in 2020 compared to 2013 – the last year before the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. 
    
            Activists say the real statistics are likely just the tip of the iceberg, given that many forms of violence against women, such as rape, are often underreported.
    
            Yogita Bhayana, founder of People Against Rapes in India, said the problem is largely rooted in old societal norms. 
    
            “We learn to live with this kind of situation in our country which is very unfortunate,” Bhayana told CNN. “The basic patriarchal fabric is totally rotten and right now we need to fix that.” 
    
            “Putting cameras and putting marshals is not going to be enough,” she added. “The work has to be done on the mindset of the men and the boys.”

            The parents of a three-month-old girl who was found dead in a wooded area in the Bronx have been arrested in connection with her death and the concealment of her body, a law enforcement source tells CNN. 
    
            Ivana Paolozzi, 20, and Damion Comager, 23, were both arrested Monday night, according to the New York Police Department. 
    
            The arrests came nearly 24 hours after the body of an infant, identified as Genevieve Comager, was found near the Major Deegan Expressway Sunday night.
    
            The medical examiner ruled the baby’s death a homicide, police said Tuesday. Investigators believe Comager violently shook the baby because she wouldn’t stop crying, the law enforcement source said.
    
            Comager was arrested on charges of murder, manslaughter and concealment of a human corpse, police said. Paolozzi was arrested on charges of concealment of a human corpse and obstructing governmental administration, according to police.
    
            CNN was unable to determine whether they have legal representation as of Tuesday morning. 
    
            The investigation began when Genevieve was reported missing around 1 p.m. Sunday, according to the NYPD, which declined to say who made the report. The law enforcement source said the city’s Administration for Children’s Services alerted detectives the child was missing. 
    
            The infant’s body was found about seven hours later and she was declared dead at the scene, police said.

      Indiana medical board reprimands doctor who publicly discussed providing abortion services to 10-year-old Ohio rape victim

            An Indianapolis doctor who publicly revealed she provided abortion services to a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim last year has been reprimanded and fined by Indiana’s medical licensing board after it determined the disclosure violated federal and state patient privacy laws. 
    
            The board on Thursday found Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an obstetrician-gynecologist, liable on three counts of violating patient privacy laws after Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a complaint against the doctor in November. 
    
            However, the board dismissed two other allegations in the complaint, determining she did not violate laws requiring physicians to immediately report suspected child abuse and keep abreast of mandatory reporting and patient privacy laws.
    
            Bernard will be fined $3,000 and receive a letter of reprimand, according to the board, which agreed to allow her to continue practicing medicine.   
    
            The complaint alleged that Bernard violated patient privacy law when she discussed the case of the girl without the consent of the patient or a guardian – even while not using her name – over the summer with the Indianapolis Star.
    
            The disclosure of why the Ohio girl made her medical journey to Indiana, days after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the federal right to abortion, helped make Bernard part of national debate over abortion rights in the county.
    
            Bernard told CNN last year that she provided abortion services to the child in late June, and that the girl traveled to Indiana for the procedure because Ohio, after the Roe ruling, generally banned abortions after early cardiac activity is detected, which is around six weeks into a pregnancy. The girl was six weeks and three days into her pregnancy, Bernard said. 
    
            At the time of the procedure, Indiana allowed abortions up to 20 weeks after fertilization. The state then passed a law that would ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions for rape or incest or to save the woman’s life, prevent any serious health risk to the woman and for lethal fetal abnormalities. However, that law was temporarily blocked, pending court fights.
    
            The case quickly became a flashpoint in the post-Roe clash over abortion rights. Several GOP politicians and media outlets initially cast skepticism on Bernard’s claims until a man was charged with raping the child and an Ohio detective testified that the girl had undergone an abortion in Indianapolis. 
    
            The Indiana medical licensing board’s president on Thursday spoke about supporting a sanction against Bernard.
    
            “My reason to recommend a letter of reprimand would be that I don’t think she expected this to go viral,” the board’s president, Dr. John Strobel, said during deliberations. “I don’t think she expected this attention to be brought to this patient.”
    
            “But I do think that we as physicians need to be more careful in this situation,” Strobel said. “I think she’s a good doctor. … I think she’s safe to go back to practice.” 
    
            Cory Voight, co-director of the attorney general office’s complex litigation division, said the complaint focused on Bernard’s decision “to speak about her patient to a reporter for the largest newspaper in Indiana.”  
    
            “The effect of that decision is everyone, the country, learned about her patient. Learned that a 10-year-old little girl was raped and had an abortion,” Voight said in his opening remarks.  
    
            The complaint asked the licensing board to impose “appropriate disciplinary action,” but did not request a specific penalty.   
    
            Bernard’s attorney has dismissed Rokita’s complaint as a “last-ditch effort to intimidate” her and other abortion providers. Bernard maintained that she did not release protected details about the child.  
    
            “I did not release any protected health information. I complied with all patient confidentiality and HIPAA laws to the best of my knowledge,” Bernard testified on Thursday. “And, again, there was no information that I released that led to her being identified.” 
    
            Bernard’s employer, Indiana University Health, said in July that it reviewed the case and determined the doctor was “in compliance with privacy laws.”  
    
            The complaint alleged that Bernard did not follow the correct procedures of reporting child abuse to Indiana authorities after the abortion services were performed. 
    
            After deliberations on Thursday, the state medical board concluded that Bernard did not violate the procedures and found her not liable.  
    
            Bernard told the board she immediately notified a hospital social worker about the possible abuse. The social worker testified that she contacted officials in Ohio, where the abuse occurred, and that authorities there were already investigating the case.   
    
            Bernard reported the abortion procedure to the Indiana Department of Health on July 2 – two days after it was performed – as required by the department, according to agency documents obtained by CNN.  
    
            She told the licensing board Thursday that she also submitted the report, which noted the abuse, to Indiana’s Department of Child Services. The department previously declined to publicly confirm whether it received a report from Bernard, citing confidentiality law.

      State judge temporarily blocks South Carolina’s 6-week abortion ban

            A South Carolina judge has temporarily blocked the state’s new abortion restrictions from going into effect, just one day after Gov. Henry McMaster signed them into law. 
    
            The law, which limited most abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, was signed by McMaster, a Republican, on Thursday and went into effect immediately. Moments later, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, along with the Greenville Women’s Clinic and two physician plaintiffs, filed a lawsuit in state court to try to stop it.
    
            Circuit Court Judge Clifton Newman made the decision Friday in Richland County, South Carolina, to put the new law on hold until the state Supreme Court can review the case to determine whether it violates the state’s constitution. 
    
            For now, abortions in the state remain legal up until around 20 weeks until the Supreme Court makes a decision or takes other action to allow implementation of the law.
    
            “Today the court has granted our patients a welcome reprieve from this dangerous abortion ban,” said Planned Parenthood South Atlantic President and CEO Jenny Black. “Our doors remain open, and we are here to provide compassionate and judgment-free health care to all South Carolinians. While we have a long fight ahead, we will not stop until our patients are again free to make their own decisions about their bodies and futures.”
    
            McMaster said he looked forward to the state Supreme Court taking up the case and state Attorney General Alan Wilson, a Republican, said his office is “considering all our options” as a response. 
    
            “We’ve defended the right to life in court before, and we’re prepared to do it again,” Wilson said.
    
            According to McMaster, South Carolina has filed a motion asking the state Supreme Court to quickly take action on the case. In the emergency petition, the state wrote that the “Court should grant the Petition or, alternatively, expedite the briefing in this appeal or transfer the case to the Court’s original jurisdiction docket.”
    
            In the filing, the state asked the Supreme Court to stay Newman’s order and allow the new restrictions to take effect while the appeal is being heard. 
    
            South Carolina passed a similar six-week abortion ban in 2021, but the state Supreme Court struck it down earlier this year, concluding that the state constitution’s privacy protections require that women be allowed sufficient time to determine they are pregnant and end a pregnancy.
    
            Republican sponsors of the new legislation said they felt changes to language in the new legislation addressed the Supreme Court’s concerns about the previous law. 
    
            The author of the January decision, Justice Kaye Hearn, was the only woman on the state’s high court bench at the time. She has since retired. There are currently no women on the South Carolina state Supreme Court bench.  
    
            Senate Bill 474, known as the “Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,” bans most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Any physician who knowingly violates the law will have their license to practice in the state revoked by the State Board of Medical Examiners and could face felony charges, fines and jail time.
    
            The law includes exceptions to save the patient’s life and for fatal fetal anomalies, as well as limited exceptions up to 12 weeks for victims of rape and incest, with doctor reporting requirements to local law enforcement. It also contains an amendment added by the House that would require a “biological father” to pay child support from the point of conception.

      ‘I don’t know if I’m going to make it’: With abortion drug’s future in limbo, Georgia couple shares their cautionary tale

    ","
            Depending on the outcome of a federal lawsuit, more women having early miscarriages could end up like Melissa Novak: septic, in the hospital and needing emergency surgery to survive.
    
            “We didn’t know if she was going to live or die,” said Novak’s husband, Stewart Day.
    
            Novak had a miscarriage in March and was prescribed only one of the pills in a two-pill combination approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for women in her situation. Although the medication she took, called misoprostol, can help a woman have a complete and safe miscarriage, it’s not approved by the FDA to do so, and studies show that it’s less effective than when used in combination with the second drug, mifepristone.
    
            Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are seeking to ban access nationwide to mifepristone. If they are successful, more women who need medication for miscarriage care will, like Novak, take only misoprostol.
    
            Obstetricians are “very worried,” said Dr. Erika Werner, a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The concern is that if medication for miscarriage doesn’t work, patients will end up having surgeries they hadn’t anticipated.
    
            “More women are going to have unnecessary surgeries. More women are going to have complications,” said Werner, who is also chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center.
    
            At a hearing this month, a three-judge panel on the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals showed sympathy for the arguments put forward by the plaintiffs, anti-abortion physicians and groups who are challenging the FDA’s approval of mifepristone 23 years ago.
    
            A decision from the circuit court is expected in the coming weeks, and the case will eventually head to the US Supreme Court.
    
            Dr. Christina Francis, chief executive officer of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, one of the plaintiffs in the case, told CNN that “medical management of miscarriage with misoprostol has been standard of care for decades.”
    
            “It is vital that patients being treated with misoprostol for miscarriage management have a close follow-up scheduled to ensure that they have completely passed all pregnancy tissue and to determine whether additional treatment is needed. Women deserve the highest quality of reproductive healthcare, especially when faced with a situation as emotionally and physically traumatic as miscarriage,” Francis added.
    
            A New Year’s Eve kiss
    
            Melissa Novak first spotted Stewart Day when he was standing at a beer cart at a New Year’s Eve festival in Fort Lauderdale in 2007.
    
            “I saw him, and I was like, ‘he’s very attractive,’ and I tried to do a little dance to see if he would check me out, and he did a little bit,” Novak said.
    
            Three hours later, her friends asked her whom she’d be kissing at midnight, and she remembered the cute guy at the beer cart and found him again.
    
            “We kissed on New Year’s, and we haven’t been separate since,” said Novak, now 39.
    
            “We haven’t stopped talking,” added Day, now 42.
    
            Novak, a social worker and sex therapist, and Day, an accountant, married on New Year’s Day three years later and, after a move to Chicago, settled in Atlanta.
    
            They were thrilled this year when they found out Novak was pregnant. Day, who always wanted a big family, ran to the store at all hours to get his wife soup, her only craving. They started to think about which room in their home they’d convert into a nursery and how they would decorate it.
    
            Their obstetrician scheduled an ultrasound at eight weeks.
    
            “That was my first time in an ultrasound room, and the technician got it all set up and then just kind of looked at Melissa, and you could just kind of feel the mood in the room just sort of deflate,” Day remembers.
    
            The ultrasound showed that the fetus had no heartbeat. Novak had had an early miscarriage.
    
            Studies show advantages of drug combination
    
            Early miscarriages are common, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which estimates that 10% of all clinically recognized pregnancies end in an early loss. After a fetus dies, it’s common for patients to need medical help to clear the tissue – sometimes referred to as “terminating” a pregnancy.
    
            Several studies have shown that the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is more effective at terminating an early pregnancy than misoprostol alone.
    
            One report looked at several studies and concluded that the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol was 95% to 98% effective. That report was published in 2006 in the journal Contraception.
    
            Another report detailed studies on a total of 12,829 people who received only misoprostol, and in 78% of the cases, the pregnancy was terminated completely without the use of surgery or additional medicine. The authors of the study, published this year in Contraception, noted that this was “a substantially lower proportion than the approximately 95% expected after the use of mifepristone and misoprostol” together.
    
            Another study was a clinical trial in which doctors in the US randomly assigned 300 women with an early pregnancy loss to receive misoprostol either alone or in combination with mifepristone. Among those receiving the combination, 84% had a complete expulsion of the pregnancy, and among those receiving misoprostol only, 67% had a complete expulsion.
    
            The authors, writing in 2018 in the New England Journal of Medicine, concluded that the drug combination “resulted in a higher likelihood of successful management of first-trimester pregnancy loss than treatment with misoprostol alone.”
    
            Francis, the anti-abortion activist and plaintiff in the federal litigation, pointed to another study in NEJM, also a clinical trial, that found that of 491 women who received misoprostol alone after early pregnancy failure, 84% had complete expulsion within eight days.
    
            ‘How in 2023 can this happen to us?’
    
            When Novak had her miscarriage in March, she says, her obstetrician explained her options: have surgery, called a D&C, to remove the pregnancy or use medication to help the miscarriage along.
    
            Novak chose to have medication, and her doctor prescribed misoprostol – alone, not in combination with mifepristone.
    
            Nine days after taking the medicine, Novak spiked a fever.
    
            Thinking she had just caught a cold from her nephews, Novak took Advil, felt better, got in her car and went out on errands.
    
            Two hours later, while driving, she felt her fever go up and had intense back pain.
    
            “I knew I was crashing,” she said. “I had never felt like that before.”
    
            She started to shiver intensely.
    
            “I had my seat heater on. It was 70 degrees in Atlanta,” she said. “I’m on the highway, I’m hunched over, getting smaller and smaller.”
    
            She somehow made it to the hospital, where they immediately recognized that she was having a miscarriage. She shared her medical records with CNN, which show that she had an “septic incomplete abortion.”
    
            It took two days of intravenous antibiotics and other medications to bring her fever down.
    
            “My mind started going to some dark places – like, ‘this isn’t normal. I’ve never felt like this before,’ ” she said. “I was like, ‘I’m really scared. I don’t know if I’m going to make it.’ ”
    
            Her husband wasn’t sure, either.
    
            “She’s laying in the hospital shaking with a 100-some-odd-degree fever, [and] there’s nothing I could do about it,” Day said. “It was very surreal, like ‘how in 2023 can this happen to us?’ ”
    
            Once her fever came down, doctors performed a D&C, the surgery to remove the dead fetus from her uterus. She left the hospital after a four-day stay.
    
            Confusion among obstetricians
    
            A sponsor of Georgia’s abortion ban pointed her finger at Novak’s physician, whom Novak is not identifying.
    
            Georgia law doesn’t bar the use of mifepristone in case of miscarriage. In fact, the state’s six-week abortion ban that took effect in November allows for termination of a pregnancy if the fetus has died and doesn’t specify what methods can be used.
    
            “I would offer a strong reminder that it is his/her responsibility to understand any Georgia law that affects medical practice. The failure of any doctor to understand the law, and further, to allow a lack of knowledge or possible political motive to affect the standard of care provided to any patient borders on malpractice,” said state Rep. Ginny Ehrhart.
    
            But on March 22, the day the doctor prescribed Novak only misoprostol, obstetricians in Georgia and across the country were thinking about more than just their own state laws.
    
            At that time, the federal court in Texas was considering whether to ban access to mifepristone, and the case was making headlines nationwide.
    
            Novak said the doctor mentioned this litigation when treating her for the miscarriage, and she played for CNN a voice mail from the doctor that also mentioned it.
    
            Doctors tell CNN that they’re not surprised that the doctor chose not to prescribe mifepristone, saying it’s been difficult to keep track of various state and federal legal cases.
    
            This week, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had a “special late-breaking session” at its annual scientific and clinical meeting that addressed the confusion around mifepristone and whether it was still available for doctors to prescribe.
    
            “Mifepristone is still on the market as the cases go through legal proceedings,” according to the group’s guidance.
    
            Dr. Mae Winchester, a high-risk pregnancy specialist in Cleveland, said obstetricians need this kind of guidance.
    
            “Lots of times, I get calls from doctors in the area about what they can and cannot do for patients,” said Winchester, a fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty as the laws change constantly. Physicians can’t keep up with the laws, and they’re scared.”
    
            Dr. Carrie Cwiak, a professor in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, said she has sometimes seen the same confusion among her colleagues in Georgia.
    
            “It’s confusing when you have a situation like that case against mifepristone because you were waiting to see what final decisions” would be, she said.
    
            She added that over the past year, doctors have been scared to provide “safe, effective, ethical health care” because they’re under threat of prosecution by ever-changing abortion laws that frequently get overturned by courts. These bans typically punish doctors with fines, prison sentences and loss of their medical license.
    
            “It’s human nature that you might be cautious and say, ‘well, I can’t do anything at all, because I’m afraid that someone will misinterpret what I’m doing and then penalize me,’ ” said Cwiak, director of the Complex Family Planning division at Emory.
    
            Werner, the obstetrician at Tufts, agreed that confusion among obstetricians about what kind of miscarriage care they can and cannot offer is widespread and understandable.
    
            “I would say there’s no other subspecialty right now that has to follow court decisions to figure out what treatment to give their patients,” she said. “While unintended, when the courts and the legislators get involved in medical decision-making, this is the kind of downhill effect that you see.”
    
            Novak and Day say they’re sharing their story in case other couples end up in their situation.
    
            They said they know she might have had the same experience if she’d been given mifepristone as well as misoprostol, but they wish they could have had the two drugs in combination, since they have a better track record than misoprostol on its own.
    
            Day said that if the plaintiffs in the federal litigation prevail and access to mifepristone is barred, “it seems like it’s really regressing, that we’re taking away freedoms and medicines that have been around for a long time.”
    
            “The fact that nonmedical professionals are able to dictate medical care to my wife or anyone is absurd.”

      Confusion on abortion, mistrust in US Supreme Court followed Dobbs decision, survey finds

    ","
            The US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, created a fractured abortion landscape in the United States. Nearly a year later, a new KFF survey shows that it has left widespread confusion about the legal status of abortion, along with little trust in the high court to decide cases on reproductive health.
    
            Most adults in the United States disapprove of the Supreme Court’s performance in general, the survey found, along with more than 6 of 10 who say that they don’t trust the court’s ability to decide cases related to reproductive and sexual health.
    
            In April, the Supreme Court made another significant abortion-related decision, this time protecting access to mifepristone – a drug that is approved for use in medication abortion by the US Food and Drug Administration – which has been challenged in lower courts. Nearly two-thirds of survey participants say that they have at least some confidence in the FDA’s efforts to ensure that medications are safe and effective, and most agree that it would be inappropriate for a court to overturn that authority.
    
            Awareness of mifepristone grew significantly in the past year amid the legal attention.
    
            But there’s still general uncertainty around the legal status of abortion. In the 14 states where abortion is banned, about 1 in 8 residents incorrectly believes that medication abortion is still legal there. And more than half of residents say they are unsure of the legality of abortion in their state.
    
            Amid the confusion and unease, many women are changing their approach to contraception.
    
            More than half of women under 50 say that they or someone they know has taken a precaution – such as getting a new prescription for contraception, stocking up on contraception options or delaying getting pregnant – because they were concerned about having access to an abortion, the survey found.
    
            And abortion remains a key issue for voters heading into the 2024 presidential election.
    
            About 3 in 10 registered voters say that they will vote only for a candidate who shares their views on abortion. No party has a clear majority; about a third say that neither represents their views. But respondents are more likely to say that their views align with the Democratic Party (42%) than the Republican Party (26%).
    
            The new KFF survey data is based on responses from a representative sample of about 1,700 adults collected in mid-May.

      South Carolina governor signs 6-week abortion bill into law

    ","
            South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster on Thursday signed a bill into law that will limit most abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.
    
            South Carolina now joins a list of Republican-led states that have championed sweeping abortion restrictions in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. The entire US South, with the exception of Virginia, has moved to significantly curtail abortion rights in the past year.
    
            “With my signature, the Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act is now law and will begin saving the lives of unborn children immediately,” McMaster, a Republican, said in a statement. “This is a great day for life in South Carolina, but the fight is not over. We stand ready to defend this legislation against any challenges and are confident we will succeed. The right to life must be preserved, and we will do everything we can to protect it.”
    
            The law is effective immediately, but it already facing a legal challenge. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, along with the Greenville Women’s Clinic and two physician plaintiffs, has filed a suit in state court to try to stop the law.
    
            “State lawmakers have once again trampled on our right to make private health care decisions, ignoring warnings from health care providers and precedent set by the state’s highest court just a few months ago,” Planned Parenthood South Atlantic’s President and CEO Jenny Black said in a statement. Black was referring to a similar six-week abortion ban that was passed in the state in 2021 but struck down earlier this year by the state Supreme Court, which concluded that the state constitution’s privacy protections require limits on the procedure to allow women sufficient time to end a pregnancy.
    
            Senate Bill 474, known as the “Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,” bans most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Any physician who knowingly violates the law will have their license to practice in the state revoked by the State Board of Medical Examiners and could face felony charges, fines and jail time.
    
            The law includes exceptions to save the patient’s life and for fatal fetal anomalies, as well as limited exceptions up to 12 weeks for victims of rape and incest, with doctor reporting requirements to local law enforcement. It also contains an amendment added by the House that would require a “biological father” to pay child support from the point of conception.
    
            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre condemned the legislation in a statement as “an extreme and dangerous abortion ban,” which she warned “will criminalize health care providers and cause delays and denials of health and life-saving care.”
    
            In the wake of new abortion regulations passed in Florida and North Carolina this legislative session, Jean-Pierre stressed that “South Carolina’s ban will cut off access to abortion for women in the state and those across the entire region for whom South Carolina is their closest option for care.”
    
            McMaster’s signature on Thursday is the culmination of a drawn-out and contentious effort that has engulfed the state legislature over the past couple of weeks. After McMaster called a special session for lawmakers to work on the abortion bill, it took the state House two days to pass it because Democrats filed more than 1,000 amendments to slow down the legislation. And in the state Senate, a bipartisan group of five female lawmakers banded together to try to stop it, but it ultimately passed by a vote of 27-19.

      Five years after Ireland’s historic abortion referendum, access to care is still ‘patchy’
    ","

    ","
            In 2018, the Irish public voted overwhelmingly to repeal the country’s Eighth Amendment, overturning one of the strictest abortion bans in the European Union.
    
            There were scenes of jubilation as the referendum result was announced, with many in Ireland seeing it as a historic step that would give women control over their own bodies. 
    
            But five years on, although abortion is free and legally available in Ireland up to 12 weeks of pregnancy – after that allowed only in exceptional circumstances, if there is a risk to the mother’s life or the fetus is not expected to survive – the abortion system is still far from where campaigners and charities would like it to be. 
    
            “The system is failing a certain number of women every year,” Ailbhe Smyth, a longtime women’s rights activist who campaigned for the repeal, told CNN.
    
            One woman who experienced a failed medical abortion which pushed her to the edge of Ireland’s 12-week limit for terminations, told CNN that she felt unsupported by medical practitioners during the process and was made to feel ashamed.
    
            “I felt like I had to say I had a miscarriage as opposed to an abortion, because there’s still stigma in the country,” said the woman, who requested that CNN call her Sarah due to her fears of the effects of stigma.
    
            A report ordered by the Irish government, published last month, highlighted restrictive legal provisions and alarming gaps in the availability of abortion services, among other issues.   
    
            Three years on from the introduction of these services, access to abortion is “unequal” in Ireland, with women subjected to a “postcode lottery,” the review led by barrister Marie O’Shea said.   
    
            Rural parts of the country suffer particularly sparse coverage, the report found.
    
            In nine of the Republic of Ireland’s 26 counties, there are fewer than five general practitioners (GPs) registered to provide services. 
    
            Orla O’Connor, director of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, told CNN the gaps in services impacted Ireland’s “more marginalized” women the most, listing homeless women, women in experiencing domestic abuse and disabled women as examples.
    
            In response to CNN’s request for comment on the report’s findings and concerns over uneven access to abortion services, Ireland’s Department of Health described the referendum as “a landmark day” for reproductive rights in the country. “Since that day, significant strides have been made in the rollout of termination of pregnancy services for those who need them,” a statement from the press office said.
    
            “The Minister for Health is committed to ensuring that any remaining barriers to services are identified and addressed, to give full effect to the historic decision of the Irish people.” 
    
            Despite the failings identified by the review, Thursday’s anniversary will hold a special place for Irish women at home and across the world. 
    
            For those at the forefront of the campaign, repealing the Eighth Amendment – which banned abortion in Ireland unless there was a “real and substantial risk” to the mother’s life – was very much the “first step” in making abortion part of healthcare for women, according to Smyth. She recalled thinking after the result was announced, “the hard work begins now.”
    
            Although strike action and endorsements from high profile Irish figures had proved effective, Smyth recalls that it was testimonies from Irish women who traveled abroad for abortions which really galvanized the Irish public.
    
            “It was women stepping forward and saying, 50 years ago, ‘I had an abortion in England, and I’ve never told anyone.’ ‘I’m aged 21. Last year, I had to go to England on my own.’
    
            “It was these real stories of the distress for many women over decades of having had to do something that was important to them and having to do it in secrecy without help. That really, really struck people,” Smyth told CNN last week.
    
            The call to reform Ireland’s repressive ban had intensified since 2012 following the death of a young woman named Savita Halappanavar, who died of complications after abortion was denied to her when she was miscarrying in a County Galway hospital, in western Ireland.
    
            “It really brought into people’s consciousness that anybody could die simply by presenting at a hospital when they’re unwell and pregnant,” said Camilla Fitzsimons, an associate professor at the University of Maynooth who has researched the history of abortion in Ireland.
    
            By the time the vote finally came around on May 25, 2018, there was a sense among Irish people that the abortion ban was “very wrong” and that if Irish society was ever to be equal, people would have “to put our trust in women and believe them when they say this is the best decision for me,” Smyth said. 
    
            Within four months of the referendum, Ireland’s president formally repealed the Eighth Amendment to the constitution. Irish lawmakers then passed the legislation that allows for terminations in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 
    
            But despite the changes heralded by the vote five years ago, the O’Shea review highlighted a number of obstacles to equal access to abortion services in Ireland.
    
            Under current legislation, women must undergo a three-day waiting period after an initial consultation before gaining access to abortion medication, a requirement which medical practitioners have described as “patronizing,” according to the O’Shea review.
    
            Sarah told CNN that, in her case, she found the three-day waiting period both “patronizing” and “upsetting.”
    
            It’s a measure which medics and campaigners alike wish to scrap, especially in light of its impact on more vulnerable groups of women, who may find it difficult to attend two appointments.
    
            One GP in the northwest of Ireland interviewed for the report highlighted the cost burden on lower income women, for example, stressing that “it’s not a free service if you have to spend 100 euro on petrol to get there and back” from appointments. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Irish government allowed the first consultation to be done by phone, which report author Dr. Lorraine Grimes says improved but did not entirely solve the problem. Women still need to attend the second appointment in person for the procedure itself.
    
            Dr. Mary Favier has played a huge part in organizing abortion services in GP clinics across Ireland. Although she acknowledges that coverage is “not perfect,” she is even more concerned about the situation in Irish maternity hospitals. At present, only 11 out of the 19 maternity facilities in the country are providing abortion services, the report states.
    
            Favier says the expansion of services in maternity units has been held up by a controversial provision within the law which allows medical practitioners to refuse to provide abortion services on grounds of “conscientious objection.”  
    
            She chalks this up to “more conservative” attitudes among some Irish obstetricians and gynecologists, who she says for the most part did not actively participate in the “Repeal the 8th” campaign.
    
            Although the proportion of conscientious objectors in Ireland’s health service is relatively small, Favier told CNN that they are concentrated in rural areas. And these tend to be places where there are fewer abortion providers already.
    
            Favier also finds it “problematic” that abortion training, including on surgical procedures, has not been formally integrated into Irish medical schools’ curricula, and expressed support for the review’s recommendation that such training be “embedded” into teaching.
    
            Probably the greatest obstacle for Irish medical professionals, however, is a legal provision which criminalizes any individual who assists a pregnant person to obtain an abortion outside the confines of the law. This becomes especially relevant when considering the 12-week gestational limit embedded in the new legislation.
    
            It is a limit which Grimes describes as “extremely tight.” This strict cut-off is also exacerbated by the three-day waiting period. If a woman is near the limit during the weekend or around a public holiday, she will have more difficulty accessing an appointment and may “time out” of care, Favier explains.
    
            After 12 weeks it becomes “extremely difficult” to have an abortion in Ireland, according to Grimes. She highlights that in the case of a fatal fetal abnormality, for example, two doctors must certify that the baby would die within 28 days of being born for an abortion to be approved.
    
            “That is practically impossible to do, it is really a huge ask,” Grimes said, noting that because abortion is still criminalized beyond the first 12 weeks, doctors tend to make more conservative decisions when dealing with complex cases.
    
            Because the failed first abortion left her with only limited time for a second attempt before the 12-week limit, Sarah was left fearing her only options would be “to go to the UK or to continue with the pregnancy.”
    
            Ultimately, a second procedure was carried out successfully at an Irish maternity hospital before the cut-off.
    
            Sarah recounted the sense of anger she felt after one medical practitioner told her she was “lucky” to have made it within the limit. 
    
            “It shouldn’t be 12 weeks. What if it happened to somebody miscarrying? It just really resonated with me that mine was a choice. But if it wasn’t the choice, it would be very hard to hear words like that,” she said.
    
            Against this backdrop, more than 200 Irish women still traveled to the UK for abortion procedures in 2021, according to UK health service statistics, although the O’Shea review notes that the “rate of abortion travel has declined substantially.”
    
            “We do need to acknowledge that any instance where a woman has to leave her country to access full reproductive health care is a failure of the health system,” Grimes stressed.
    
            Campaigners such as Smyth and O’Connor are now focusing their efforts on lobbying the Irish government to accept the recommendations within the O’Shea review. The Irish parliament’s health committee is set to review the findings before the summer. 
    
            In its statement to CNN, the Department of Health said the Health Service Executive, Ireland’s healthcare system, would work toward implementing the report’s operational recommendations. The parliamentary Joint Committee on Health would consider recommendations proposing legislative change, it added.
    
            On Wednesday, the National Women’s Council launched an online campaign encouraging Irish people to write to their elected representative to call for “cross-party political commitment to reform,” according to a press release.   
    
            “Repealing the 8th didn’t mean abortion access only for some women and not others – the provision of abortion services needs to be consistent and equitable,” O’Connor stressed.
    
            Sarah told CNN that she just wants women in Ireland to “feel that the decision they made is the right one” if they chose to have an abortion and that there is “no guilt or stigma attached” to having an abortion in 2023.

      Shiv Roy’s pregnancy reveals the heart of ‘Succession’
    ","
			Opinion by Rebecca Bodenheimer
		","
  Published
        5:56 PM EDT, Wed May 24, 2023
    ","
            Note: The essay below contains spoilers for the final season of “Succession.” 
    
            Critics have long debated whether the HBO show “Succession,” created by Jesse Armstrong and concluding its run on Sunday, is fundamentally a drama or a comedy. In its earlier episodes, the comedic and satirical elements were what felt unique to me—the hilarious meanness of the barbs these characters launched at each other brought a “Veep”-like energy to the show.
    
            However, somewhere around the end of season three—perhaps when the audience was left wondering if Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) had drowned in a pool—the tragedy of the story began to overwhelm the comedy.
    
            “Succession” is still wickedly funny in the most zeitgeist-y way, but ultimately, it’s destined to be remembered as a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. The show’s final season has revolved around the Roy siblings’ reactions to the death of their father, Logan (Brian Cox). (HBO and CNN share the parent company Warner Brothers Discovery.)
    
            The audacious choice to kill off the show’s patriarch in episode three was initially shocking, but it has allowed the writers to patiently sift through the fallout from his demise and portray the jockeying for dominance among his children and other power brokers.
    
            In the episode immediately following Logan’s death, the audience finds out that the youngest and only female sibling, Siobhan “Shiv” Roy (Sarah Snook), is pregnant. For a show that has some of the best one-liners in TV history, “Succession” has also given us a uniquely nihilistic portrayal of pregnancy, devoid of joy and hopeful anticipation. Ironically, for a show all about family lineage and inheritance, children are almost completely absent and childrearing is left to minor characters, like Kendall’s ex-wife Rava (Natalie Gold).
    
            Reproductive rights have become a focal point of national politics, and while I’m alarmed by the criminalization of abortion—and pregnancy, as we’ve seen women who suffer miscarriages come under suspicion—I’ve also experienced the wonder of my body creating new life and look back fondly on my pregnancies. One of this show’s many tragedies is that Shiv doesn’t get to experience this.
    
            “Succession” has shown us the countless ways Logan’s brutal parenting style and pitting of his children against each other has wrought emotional damage on them. How many times have we witnessed Kendall’s attempts to either beat his father at his own game or get out of the toxic family business completely?
    
            In episode two of this season, Connor Roy (Alan Ruck), who has always been the butt of running jokes, devastatingly proclaims: “The good thing about having a family that doesn’t love you is that you learn to live without it.” Similarly, we’ve seen Roman (Kieran Culkin) make terrible, impulsive decisions in the wake of Logan’s death, culminating in his emotional collapse during the funeral episode.
    
            As for Shiv, fans’ curiosity and speculation around her pregnancy has surged. In chat groups and on Twitter, I’ve seen fans wondering whether the baby is really Tom’s (Shiv’s estranged husband, played by Matthew Macfadyen), how far along she is, whether she has gotten pregnant through in-vitro fertilization or even whether she might be having a baby via surrogate.
    
            To be fair, the audience is given very little information initially. After Logan’s death, we see Shiv’s doctor informing her that the results of the amniocentesis are encouraging and we learn that she’s less than 20 weeks pregnant. It is the day after her father’s death, so a muted reaction seems appropriate, but Shiv shows no happiness, or even relief, when given this news.
    
            Shiv has also imbibed alcohol on more than one occasion, even accepting the offer of cocaine by the Roy family’s corporate rival Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård) in episode five—though we never see her actually snort it. Having a few drinks during pregnancy is unlikely to cause lasting harm to a fetus, but Shiv’s behavior was predictably memed to death on social media as evidence of what a terrible mother she would be.
    
            Despite all the fan theorizing and mockery, the show’s penultimate episode crystallized for me how tragic this pregnancy storyline really is.
    
            Many TV characters, from Erica Kane on “All My Children” to Cristina Yang on “Grey’s Anatomy,” have struggled with the choice about whether to remain pregnant or not, but that’s not really the case with Shiv. Her decision to have an amniocentesis–a test intended to identify genetic or chromosomal health conditions in a fetus—is a strong indicator she’s invested in the pregnancy.
    
            Later in the episode where her condition is revealed, Shiv suggests she wanted her dad to meet her unborn child. If he hadn’t gotten on that plane, she says, he might have lived for 20 more years, “so he could rock his grandkids to sleep.” Tom responds with gentle sarcasm (knowing how absent and aloof Logan was with his existing grandchildren): “As he was evidently so keen to do?” He’s attempting a reconciliation in their rocky marriage, but she rejects it.
    
            In the following episode, Shiv plays hot and cold with Tom, which she’s done for their entire relationship—she has never allowed herself to be truly vulnerable with him because both her parents doled out their “love” in transactional, contingent ways.
    
            As the season continues, there are two separate, intimate moments in which she could have told Tom about the baby, but didn’t. Also somewhat implausibly, although they have sex multiple times, Tom doesn’t seem to notice any changes in Shiv’s body as her pregnancy progresses.
    
            The couple has an ugly (and impeccably acted) fight on their balcony at the end of episode seven, propelled by Tom’s exhaustion that he tried to warn her about and she ignored. Horrible insults are hurled back and forth, and Tom says: “I think you are incapable of love. And I think you are maybe not a good person to have children.”
    
            This is a callback to her own mother Caroline (Harriet Walter) in season three, who told Shiv she regretted having children and that Shiv had made the right decision because “Some people just aren’t made to be mothers.”
    
            Caroline is a terrible mother, arguably an even worse parent than Logan. Shiv has two bad parenting models—one who sees her children as an inconvenience (Caroline), and the other as pawns to be manipulated (Logan)—so it’s not surprising that we’ve seen little indication of happiness from Shiv about having a baby.
    
            In fact, her reasons for continuing with this pregnancy are still, with only one episode left, very opaque. But one would expect at least a sign that Shiv actually wants this. Instead, her revelations about the pregnancy in the past two episodes have only doubled down on the dark overtones.
    
            In episode eight, Shiv reveals the news to Tom in the middle of election night, just as he, the head of a cable news network, is dealing with overlapping crises. She pulls him aside to make up after their balcony fight and when he appears unmoved, she throws the Molotov cocktail about her pregnancy: “Actually, also, I’m pregnant. Yeah, by you.”
    
            His response is devastating: “Is that even true, or is that like a new position or tactic?” Clearly hurt, Shiv ekes out a weak “what?” She’s reaping what she sowed—she has manipulated him so many times that it’s natural that his first response is disbelief.
    
            The other reactions to Shiv’s news are similarly dispiriting. Roman immediately makes an incest joke, Kendall asks her whether the baby is Tom’s and Caroline sizes her up immediately, saying, “Blimey!” and making it all about herself, asking why Shiv didn’t tell her.
    
            Matsson also lets on that he knows, insinuating it might present a problem for her ambition to be CEO of Waystar, the company he’s trying to acquire. Shiv’s response is brutal: “She’s one of those hard bitches, right? Who’s gonna do, what, 36 hours of maternity leave? Emailing through her vanity cesarean. Poor kid will never see her.” This is of course an allusion to how distant Logan and Caroline were as parents.  The saddest thing is, she’s throwing her fetus under the bus and there’s a good chance Matsson still won’t give her the job.
    
            Shiv’s later conversation with Tom and Caroline compounds the tragedy. When he asks why she didn’t tell him sooner, she says, “Because it seemed so sad, Tom.” Notably, Caroline then comes over and says to Tom, “Lovely news. Well done, you.” Meanwhile, she has yet to congratulate her own daughter.
    
            Tom responds, “If it wasn’t such a total fuckin’ disaster, it would be a dream come true.” Finally, when Caroline turns to Shiv and indicates how hard raising a child is, Shiv reiterates her intention to be an absent mother: “Oh, no, I’m not gonna see it. I’m just gonna do it the family way…I mean, they don’t grow up emotionally stunted, do they?”
    
            All these interactions are dripping with mean-spirited sarcasm, and Shiv is seemingly in denial about how a baby will change her life, or complacent about the fact that she will pass on her emotional damage to her child. We know Shiv is posturing for power, so she may not actually believe the things she says or end up parenting the same way she was parented—and sadly we’ll never get to find out. But, as a mother of two, I’m struck by the absence of genuine excitement and goodwill about this news.
    
            No one congratulates Shiv or inquires about how she’s feeling, and she’s not even allowing herself to fantasize about motherhood. She’s so caught up in beating her brothers at the succession game that she can’t see this baby as anything but an obstacle.
    
            Ultimately, this storyline is a perfect encapsulation of the larger tragedy that is “Succession.” As suggested by Ewan Roy’s (James Cromwell) searing eulogy at the funeral, Logan’s true legacy is his children’s emotional inheritance of his self-isolation, selfishness, greed and lack of self-awareness, which leads them to hurt other people. Shiv Roy’s pregnancy speaks volumes about the emotional rot at the core of this family.

      Senate Democrats write to Google over concerns about abortion-seekers’ location data
    ","

  Published
        2:58 PM EDT, Wed May 24, 2023
    ","
            Nearly a dozen Senate Democrats wrote to Google this week with questions about how it deletes users’ location history when they have visited sensitive locations such as abortion clinics, expressing concerns that the company may not have been consistently deleting the data as promised. 
    
            The letter dated Monday and led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Mazie Hirono seeks answers from Google about the types of locations Google considers to be sensitive and how long it takes for the company to automatically delete visit history. 
    
            The letter comes after tests performed by The Washington Post and other privacy advocates appeared to show that Google was not quickly or consistently deleting users’ recorded visits to fertility centers of Planned Parenthood clinics. 
    
            “This data is extremely personal and includes information about reproductive health care,” the senators wrote. “We are also concerned that it can be used to target advertisements for services that may be unnecessary or potentially harmful physically, psychologically, or emotionally.”
    
            Concerns about the security of location data have spiked in Washington since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, opening the door to state laws restricting or penalizing abortion-seekers. Under those laws, privacy advocates have said, states could potentially compel tech companies to hand over location data that might reveal whether a person has illegally sought an abortion.
    
            “Claiming and publicly announcing that Google will delete sensitive location data, without consistently doing so, could be considered a deceptive practice,” the senators added, implying that Google’s conduct could be grounds for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is authorized to police unfair and deceptive business practices.
    
            Google declined to comment Wednesday on the lawmakers’ letter, instead referring CNN to a blog post that answers some but not all of the senators’ questions.
    
            Google defines sensitive locations as “including counseling centers, domestic violence shelters, abortion clinics, fertility centers, addiction treatment facilities, weight loss clinics, cosmetic surgery clinics, and others,” according to an update to the blog post dated May 12. “If you visit a general purpose medical facility (like a hospital), the visit may persist.”
    
            The blog post does not, however, address the senators’ request for Google to explain what it means when it claims the data will be deleted “soon after” a visit.

      South Carolina legislature sends 6-week abortion ban to governor’s desk

    ","
            A controversial six-week abortion ban bill is headed to South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk to be signed into law after the measure cleared the state Senate Tuesday. 
    
            The state Senate approved a House-amended version of the bill by a vote of 27-19, after that chamber passed it last week. 
    
            Senate Bill 474, known as the “Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,” would ban most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Any physician who knowingly violates the law would have their license to practice in the state revoked by the State Board of Medical Examiners and could face felony charges, fines and jail time. 
    
            McMaster said on Twitter after the vote that he looks “forward to signing this bill into law as soon as possible.”
    
            The bill includes exceptions to save the patient’s life and for fatal fetal anomalies, as well as limited exceptions up to 12 weeks for victims of rape and incest, with doctor reporting requirements to local law enforcement. It also contains an amendment added by the House that would require a “biological father” to pay child support from the point of conception.
    
            It remains to be seen whether the measure would survive a court challenge once signed into law. South Carolina passed a similar six week abortion ban in 2021, but the state Supreme Court struck it down earlier this year, concluding that the state constitution’s privacy protections require limits on the procedure to allow women sufficient time to end a pregnancy. 
    
            With McMaster’s signature, South Carolina will join a list of Republican-led states that have championed sweeping abortion restrictions in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. But backlash, demonstrated in some instances by electoral evidence, to severe restrictions has created a complicated political landscape in some states, including South Carolina. 
    
            Recent efforts to pass further restrictions on abortion faltered in April when the state Senate failed to pass the “Human Life Protection Act,” which would have banned most abortions in the state, in a 22-21 vote with several Republicans voting against it. The bill had previously passed in the state House and included exceptions for incidents of rape or incest. 
    
            A bipartisan group of five women lawmakers in the state Senate banded together to try to stop the bill from passing Tuesday. However, the three Republican men who joined them weeks ago in blocking the more restrictive total ban on abortion during the regular session voted in favor of the six-week ban.  
    
            Republican state Sen. Katrina Shealy, before she voted no, attempted to push through an amendment to change the limit on abortions to 12 weeks, and 20 weeks for victims of rape and incest.
    
            “Men are 100% responsible for pregnancies,” said Shealy, as she introduced her amendment. “Men are fertile 100% of the time. So, it is time for men in this chamber and the ones across that hall and all across the state of South Carolina to take some ejaculation responsibility.” 
    
            Republican men in the Senate who voted for the bill pushed back on their colleagues’ assertions, noting they felt the amended legislation was a compromise.  
    
            “So, what basis do we say, by law, that we’re going to draw a line by majority vote, which we can kill that human being?” asked Republican state Sen. Richard Cash. “That’s what this debate is all about. I mean, I’ll be the first to say it’s a terribly flawed bill that we’re going to vote on, this fetal heartbeat bill, filled with inconsistencies and exceptions. It fails to protect human life from the beginning.”  
    
            The “sister senators” – three Republicans, one Democrat and one independent – maintained during the debate on Tuesday that changes made by the House, specifically to the definitions of certain terms, materially altered the version of the bill that passed the Senate.  
    
            State Sen. Sandy Senn, a Republican who voted against the bill, expressed particular concern over a clause added to the bill by the House giving the state “a compelling interest from the outset of a woman’s pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child.” 
    
            The House’s changes were a key reason for Republican state Sen. Penry Gustafson’s vote against the bill Tuesday, after voting in favor of an earlier version of the six-week ban in February. 
    
            “They struck the bill pretty much, inserted their own language, their own definitions, extra ‘whereas’ fact-finding clauses, which could be problematic for the South Carolina Supreme Court,” Gustafson told CNN’s Abby Phillip. “It is simply not the same bill. I do not support it.”
    
            Shortly after the bill’s passage, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic said on Twitter, “We have just one thing to say to the state of South Carolina: We’ll see you in court.”

      The epicenter of anti-abortion America
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler

    ","
            Nearly one year after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, a new rule has solidified in American politics: no abortion access in the American South. And until recently, that rule had three increasingly visible exceptions — states which, unsurprisingly, became destinations for abortion seekers from across the region.
    
            Florida saw the single greatest increase — reportedly 1,200 patients a month — after Dobbs. North Carolina, another receiving state, had seen a nearly 40% increase. After the South Carolina Supreme Court struck down that state’s abortion law in January, that state also saw a sharp increase in abortions, with roughly half of patients coming from out of state.
    
            It seems that there won’t be exceptions to the rule for much longer. In North Carolina, Republicans recently overrode a veto by the state’s Democratic governor to pass a law that banned elective abortion at 12 weeks, prohibited medication abortion after 10 weeks and introduced a tough new waiting period that will make it harder for people traveling out of state to seek the procedure.
    
            The South Carolina House once again passed a ban on abortion at six weeks, before many know they are pregnant, setting up a clash in the state Senate, where five female lawmakers had previously mounted a successful filibuster (the state Supreme Court had struck down a virtually identical law last year, but since the court’s composition changed, Republicans are betting that the new court will reverse course). And in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, one of the likely frontrunners for the 2024 GOP nomination, signed into law another six-week ban with narrow exceptions (the state’s ultraconservative Supreme Court is expected to overturn existing precedent and allow the law to go into effect).
    
            For those seeking abortions, or women experiencing life-threatening conditions that may not fit narrow exceptions to abortion bans, the closest option in the South may be Virginia, where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is pushing for a ban at 15 weeks, or Washington, DC.
    
            With travel becoming prohibitively expensive and often complex, this region — known for the nation’s worst maternal mortality rates — will almost certainly be an even more dangerous place to be pregnant. For some, it comes as no surprise that the South would define itself as an anti-abortion region. But in reality its status as the center of anti-abortion America was not historically inevitable.
    
            In its early years, the anti-abortion movement had the most influence in Catholic strongholds on the East Coast and Midwest, places that often elected Democrats as well as Republicans. Anti-abortion organizers, then as now, argued that the fetus was an independent person with rights, and that liberal abortion laws were unconstitutional, but they disagreed about how personhood should be enforced, with some calling for harsh punishment of providers and those who helped them, and others equally focused on laws that would make it easier for the economically marginalized to afford to carry pregnancies to term.
    
            But when the anti-abortion movement aligned itself with the Republican Party in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it started moving south. White evangelical Protestants, who had once been uncomfortable with what they viewed as a Catholic movement, had spoken out about abortion before the late 1970s, but they became more publicly involved in the 1980s, heeding the advice of new organizations in the religious right like Concerned Women for America.
    
            By the 1990s, conservative Christian law firms, many with ties to Christian Right organizations in the South, opened their doors or expanded considerably. The Alliance Defending Freedom, for example, the group litigating the current challenge to the abortion pill mifepristone, became a sort of mega-funder for anti-abortion litigation.
    
            Jay Sekulow, an attorney who later represented former president Donald Trump in his impeachment hearings, led the American Center for Law and Justice, a well-funded group launched by televangelist Pat Robertson.
    
            With new partners and members, the new anti-abortion movement was more comfortable framing its cause as a matter of faith, and more focused on harsh punishment for those perceived to have wronged the unborn child.
    
            These messages reflected the new influence of Southern activists — the South, for example, has long had especially harsh criminal laws and high rates of incarceration, even in a nation with the highest rate of incarceration in the world. In turn, as different leaders took the helm, a focus on punishment resonated with the movement’s rank and file.
    
            The anti-abortion movement is still complex, with a large Catholic cohort and members from other faith communities or with no faith commitments at all. A growing number of activists seek to require the government to provide limited aid, at least during pregnancy (the group Americans United for Life has launched an initiative to “make birth free,” while other anti-abortion lawmakers have voted for legislation offering paid family leave to some state employees).
    
            Nevertheless, the epicenter of anti-abortion America remains the South, and as abortion access across the region disappears, that shift will have profound consequences. States with existing shortages in obstetricians (in South Carolina, for example, there was no practicing OB-GYN in 14 of 46 counties in August 2022) have seen a sharp drop in OB-GYN residency applicants — a 10.5% decrease in 2023 alone — that presages a possible future shortage in doctors. Other physicians are fleeing.
    
            This exodus is not just an act of political resistance: It’s a reflection of doctors’ unwillingness to gamble their liberty on the interpretation of vaguely written laws backed up by harsh criminal sanctions. This physician shortage will almost certainly exacerbate what is already a dire situation for women in the South: six of the 10 highest maternal mortality rates are in Southern states.
    
            And the pressures facing pregnant people are higher since Southern states combine harsh abortion bans and abysmal child welfare outcomes. According to the nonpartisan Annie Casey Foundation, eight of the 10 worst-performing states in terms of children’s well-being were found in the region.
    
            Census data confirms this bleak picture of child welfare in the South: Three-quarters of Southern states had child poverty rates of at least 18%, compared to only one state in the Northeast and Midwest and two states in the West.
    
            Southern states, which rarely have fully expanded Medicaid, pay low rates of minimum wage and rarely offer paid family leave, make it harder for women to raise the children they want while making it more dangerous to bring those children into the world.
    
            Fights over reproduction will continue in the South: Work is under way on a ballot initiative that would restore abortion rights in Florida, and preliminary efforts on a similar strategy have started in Oklahoma.
    
            Abortion may become a key election issue in state supreme court races. But for now, women seeking abortion or life-saving emergency care in a region that claims to be the most pro-life in the nation will often have to leave it. Whatever it means to be pro-life in America, it has to be more than that.

      Family planning clinics risk losing federal funding by attempting to follow state abortion laws
    ","
			By Rachana Pradhan, KFF Health News

    ","
            State abortion bans in Tennessee and beyond, which constrain women’s health care, have put family planning clinics at risk of losing their federal funding.
    
            The conflict involves the Title X family planning program, which provides services to low-income people, including minors. As of 2021, more than 3,200 clinics used federal grants to supply free or low-cost contraception, testing for sexually transmitted infections, screening for breast and cervical cancer, and pregnancy-related counseling.
    
            Federal regulations for the program, which was established more than 50 years ago to reduce unintended pregnancies, say participating clinics must offer pregnant women information about terminating pregnancies and abortion referrals on request. But following those rules puts medical providers at odds with state laws banning abortion, some of which threaten jail time, fines, or the loss of medical licenses if they help someone end a pregnancy.
    
            President Joe Biden’s administration at the end of March cut off Tennessee’s Title X funds after determining the state health department — which oversees its clinics and was awarded $7.1 million last year — violated federal rules by not counseling patients about abortion. “Continued funding is not in the best interest of the government,” two U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials wrote to Tennessee officials on March 20. The state had more than 100 Title X clinics as of March, according to an HHS directory.
    
            In 2022, the federal government awarded Title X grants to roughly 90 entities, a mix of state and local governments and private organizations. Those grantees distribute funds to public or private clinics.
    
            Federal law prohibits clinics from using Title X money to pay for abortions. However, HHS requires clinics to offer pregnant women information about prenatal care and delivery, infant care, foster care, adoption, and pregnancy termination.
    
            In states where abortion is generally illegal, that could mean directing patients to providers in other states. But Tennessee told family planning clinics they could discuss only services that were legal in the state — effectively cutting off any talk about abortion.
    
            Tennessee allows abortions only under limited circumstances, including to save a pregnant person’s life. State health department policies for family planning “are consistent with state law,” said Jade Byers, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Tennessee allocated state funds to replace the federal money.
    
            Whitney Rice, director of Emory University’s Center for Reproductive Health Research in the Southeast, said failing to provide timely information and referrals for abortion “could contribute to further delays in people’s ability to access that care,” especially because women may need to travel long distances for it.
    
            The clash over the federally funded clinics is part of the widening fallout from the Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ending the constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            In Idaho, which has a near-total abortion ban, two Planned Parenthood clinics with Title X funding recently stopped giving patients abortion information and halted out-of-state referrals, according to a lawsuit Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union filed in April against Idaho’s attorney general.
    
            State law prohibits providers from assisting in performing or attempting to perform an abortion, and violators risk having their medical license suspended.
    
            The clinics’ decision came after Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, in a March 27 letter, said Idaho law prohibits providers from “referring a woman across state lines to access abortion services.”
    
            That interpretation is “preventing medical professionals from providing full information to their patients,” said Mack Smith, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky.
    
            Though Labrador later withdrew the letter, Planned Parenthood clinics there still are not referring patients out of state for abortions, Smith said.
    
            Before Labrador’s letter, the lawsuit states, Planned Parenthood staff would furnish general information about pregnancy options, a list of abortion providers in other states and organizations that help defray patients’ abortion and related costs, and a flyer about Idaho’s abortion law. Staff would also occasionally help patients schedule care outside of Idaho. Now, “Planned Parenthood providers no longer do so.”
    
            “When my patients require abortions, I am now forced to tell them that I am unable to help them and that I cannot say anything about their abortion options in other states,” Caitlin Gustafson, a physician who had practiced at an Idaho Planned Parenthood clinic, said in a legal declaration.
    
            Kimberley Harris, a visiting assistant professor at Texas Tech University School of Law, said clinicians in states with strict bans worry about referring patients to other states because a prosecutor could interpret that as “aiding and abetting an abortion.”
    
            Facilitating medication abortion in particular could “pose potential risk to health care providers,” Harris said, because a patient they refer to obtain pills out of state might then take them in a state where abortion is illegal. Medication abortion accounts for most abortions in the U.S. and involves taking a series of pills during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            “The federal regulation might require me to provide counseling and provide information,” Harris said of clinicians. “But if you’re telling providers that they may lose their license, or they might go to jail, or they might face a huge fine? Rightfully, they’re going to be concerned.”
    
            As senior HHS officials travel the country, they are getting an earful about the issue.
    
            HHS spokesperson Tara Broido said that, increasingly, “providers and patients have raised concerns about the impact that the Dobbs decision has had on access” to pregnancy counseling and referrals.
    
            KFF Health News asked Broido which grantees have not been following the counseling and referral requirements. She declined to say.
    
            People who use Title X’s services are disproportionately women. A report from HHS’ Office of Population Affairs said roughly two-thirds of 1.7 million patients in 2021 had family incomes at or below the poverty line. Thirty-six percent were uninsured, more than two times the national uninsured rate for adults.
    
            The Office of Population Affairs and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention jointly recommend family planning services that clinics are expected to follow. They include pregnancy testing and counseling.
    
            The Title X program has been whipsawed before.
    
            In 2019, the Trump administration barred Title X clinics from making abortion referrals. And the administration said abortion providers couldn’t share physical space with Title X clinics. The number of participating clinics subsequently dropped sharply — from 3,825 sites in 2019 to 3,031 the following year. With fewer clinics, the number of people receiving free or low-cost family planning services through the program plummeted from 3.1 million in 2019 to 1.5 million in 2020.
    
            The Biden administration in 2021 overturned many of the Trump policies. The Biden rules remain in effect, but several states sued to block them. That litigation is ongoing.
    
            Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, anticipates additional challenges to Title X rules because “states have an interest in defending their own laws and their ability to enforce their own laws.”
    
            In Texas, which prohibits abortion with few exceptions, the nonprofit Every Body Texas oversees 154 Title X family planning clinics.
    
            Its providers are still counseling pregnant women about options, but “that’s not to say it hasn’t been made very, very difficult,” said Stephanie LeBleu, the group’s acting Title X director.
    
            LeBleu said the approach to counseling “can look different” from clinic to clinic. For example, clinics in rural Texas “have to be a lot more cautious about how they share information with their clients,” LeBleu said. Sometimes that means making a “referral to the referral” — such as directing patients to organizations like All-Options, which operates a national pregnancy options hotline.
    
            Other Title X grantees also say they are fully complying with federal regulations. In Alabama, if patients ask for information on pregnancy options, “our clinics refer clients to other resources,” Karen M. Landers, chief medical officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health, said in a statement. The department declined to say what those resources are and whether clinicians worry about being prosecuted under Alabama law for providing abortion counseling or referrals.
    
            “Clients are additionally informed of the legality of pregnancy termination in the state,” Landers wrote.

      Nebraska governor signs bill that bans most abortions at 12 weeks, gender-affirming care for those under 19

    ","
            Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, signed a bill into law on Monday that bans most abortions after 12 weeks with exceptions for sexual assault, incest and medical emergencies. 
    
            The bill does not define “medical emergency” and the legislation includes a clause that will put the rules into immediate effect the day after it is signed.
    
            LB 574, which passed the state’s Republican-controlled unicameral legislature in a 33-15 vote last week, also bans gender-affirming care for people under 19 years old. The abortion amendment was tacked onto the legislation after previous efforts to restrict abortions failed to overcome a filibuster. 
    
            The bill only allows medical procedures for transitioning after a “waiting period” and “therapeutic hours” to determine if a person’s gender dysphoria is “long-lasting and intense.” The details of those provisions will be determined by the chief medical officer of Nebraska’s Division of Public Health. 
    
            In a statement released after the bill’s passage, Pillen said, “All children deserve a chance to grow and live happy, fruitful lives. This includes pre-born boys and girls, and it includes children struggling with their gender identity. These kids deserve the opportunity to grow and explore who they are and want to be, and they can do so without making irreversible decisions that should be made when they are fully grown.”
    
            The new law reflects ongoing legislative efforts around the US to restrict access to abortion and gender-affirming care. More than a dozen states have moved to restrict gender-affirming care in 2023 and more than 130 bills that target LGBTQ rights, especially health care for transgender patients, have been introduced nationwide this legislative session, according to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union.
    
            “From North Carolina to Nebraska, extremists so-called leaders continue to restrict access to abortion across the nation,” Vice President Kamala Harris tweeted Monday. “Enough is enough. We need a federal law to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade for women in all 50 states.”
    
            Major medical associations say that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria, the psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align, according to the American Psychiatric Association. But some Republicans have expressed concern over long-term outcomes of the treatments.
    
            Some Nebraskans have expressed displeasure with the bill and many protested and filled the halls of the state Capitol last week as lawmakers spoke, resulting in the arrest of several people on Friday on charges ranging from disturbing the peace to obstructing a government operation.
    
            ACLU of Nebraska executive director Mindy Rush Chipman said in a statement last week that the consequences of the law will be “devastating.” 
    
            “To be clear, we refuse to accept this as our new normal. This vote will not be the final word. We are actively exploring our options to address the harm of this extreme legislation, and that work will have our team’s full focus. This is not over, not by a long shot,” Chipman said.  
    
            This story has been updated with additional information Monday.

      The mourning dress codes of ‘Succession’
    ","
			By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

        9:31 AM EDT, Mon May 22, 2023
    ","
            Media giant Logan Roy was laid to rest on Sunday in the airy gilded interior of the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, located on New York’s Upper East Side. “Succession” has treated us to both a wedding and a funeral as fate of the Roy siblings spin out towards its finale (which is produced by Warner Bros. Discovery, parent company of CNN), and its penultimate episode gave us mourning dress codes in a grand Catholic setting.
    
            Enter the brothers in black suits and ties; Shiv (Sarah Snook) in a dramatic neckline with high wide lapels; and Marcia (Hiam Abbass) playing the grieving widow in a slim double-breasted blazer over a mesh striped shirt with a layered necklace and a veiled hat — “Marcia’s looking chic. Yummy. Sexy funeral lady,” Roman (Kieran Culkin) quips. Kerry (Zoë Winters), who had a long-running affair with Logan (Brian Cox), seems to have missed the memo to wear a hat as she sits between Marcia and Caroline (Harriet Walter), Logan’s first wife. (Sally Anne, who Caroline introduces as her “Kerry,” doesn’t wear a hat either).
    
            Surrounding the cast, marble Corinthian pillars, religious frescoes and sculptures of saints became the latest backdrop for new political machinations, which, like in every setting of “Succession,” continue at Logan’s funeral. “I can do anything — my dad just died,” Shiv responds when asked for a favor at the mass.
    
            The setting and looks were based on the real-life service of former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, which took place in Midtown’s Saint Patrick’s Cathedral in 2020, according to the show’s costume designer Michelle Matland.
    
            “The most important factor for the funeral was authenticity, because in the world of the 1%, as you would with the pope, every single funeral episode must be dealt with great accuracy,” Matland explained to CNN.
    
            Fashion on “Succession” has become an unexpected pillar of the show, creating an archetype of logo-less “stealth wealth” — leaving those who have broken it, such as Cousin Greg’s (Nicholas Braun) date with the “ludicrously capacious” Burberry bag earlier this season, to be ridiculed. But it has also subtly reinforced each character’s development. Shiv adopted a feminine corporate uniform to come into the fold at Waystar Royco, while Kendall (Jeremy Strong) oscillates between dark Kendall (Tom Ford sweaters, incognito baseball cap and sunglasses) and manic Kendall (flashy Gucci bomber jackets, gold pendants).
    
            By episode nine, with the company in a shaky post-Logan transition, the optics of how the Roy siblings perform at the funeral hold a lot of weight. In attendance are two of the season’s antagonists: the (contested) President-elect Mencken, who may hold the regulatory fate of their news network ATN in his hands, and future Waystar Royco owner Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård), who chaotically plays the game but has nevertheless ditched his gold velvet bomber jacket in favor of a demure suit.
    
            The Roy siblings deal with optics to different degrees of failure and success, with Roman noting early on that Kendall will “win” the funeral thanks to his emotion-obscuring sunglasses. Perhaps the most precariously placed is Shiv, who has betrayed her brothers to partner up with Matsson in hopes of becoming CEO. Pregnant and starting to show (a detail not missed for even a second by their newly resurfaced mother, Caroline) Shiv is maneuvering through high stakes at a public event, concealing a potential gendered bombshell to her career. The wide sculptural neckline she opts for serves a few purposes — it’s a subtle show of power, it draws the eyes away from any visible bump — but it’s also awkward, a symbol of her complicated emotional state and its “discomfort,” according to Matland.
    
            “Everything that happens in Shiv’s costumes after the pregnancy reveal relates to her complications with her incredibly difficult placement at that moment,” Matland said. “She is still trying to maintain her affiliation with the family and (is) now trying to understand the relationship she has personally with Tom and her siblings.”
    
            At Connor’s (Alan Ruck) summery yacht wedding, Shiv’s black Tom Ford Padlock blazer struck a similarly discordant note. But it soon made sense as the already fraught wedding devolved into an afternoon of despair, with Logan dying on an airplane and the siblings phoned in to hear it. Matland said her styling choices for the episode weren’t just foreshadowing, but were also reflective of everyone’s mood going into the event.
    
            “Everyone’s feelings about this wedding were so problematic,” she said. “So I think it’s just the structure of that part of the storyline — it needed a little bit of darkness.”
    
            As the Roy siblings attempt to eulogize their complicated father without shaking the company’s already mercurial stock price, it’s clear that optics are all they have. Emotions must be stamped down, they maintain a fragile façade, and getting too close to the truth of Logan Roy is met with a wall of cognitive dissonance.
    
            After all, that’s the bubble the characters from “Succession” live in. The Roys are insulated from the impacts their decisions make on the wider world as they move room to room, building to building, with reality only occasionally knocking at the glass. In this case it comes in the form of protests sweeping the city at Mencken’s declared presidency, who are mostly relegated to background noise until the episode reaches its fever pitch and Roman finds himself among them, an angry rich guy glaringly out of place in a luxury suit, commanding no attention or respect, agitating the crowd in his grief.
    
            As the series winds down to a close, Matland has continued to emphasize each character’s distinctive journeys through their styling, every small idiosyncrasy contributing to the larger whole.
    
            “To see the transitions for these actors through the seasons has been a real pleasure… even if the costume is inappropriate, perhaps, for what you feel the moment is, that’s part of the story,” Matland said. “And I think when something is slightly wrong, that’s when it’s right. It’s just the way we are in life; we have our flaws.”

      Opinion: A boast that could sink Trump

            “I’m the one that got rid of Roe v. Wade,” former President Donald Trump boasted Tuesday on Newsmax. He cited his appointment of three Supreme Court justices who last June joined three other conservatives in overturning the 50-year decision guaranteeing abortion rights.
    
            The problem: two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the court’s rejection of a right to abortion, and many independent and even some Republican voters have shown repeatedly that they will side with Democrats on the issue.
    
            In a general election, a strong anti-abortion stance can be a real negative. Trump — who has dodged questions about whether he would support a national ban on abortion — admitted as much by saying that his strongest GOP rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed a bill banning most abortions after six weeks, is “losing women voters like crazy.” 
    
            Yet within the Republican base, strong opposition to abortion is a plus. DeSantis has challenged the former president, citing his state’s ban: “I signed the bill. I was proud to do it. He won’t answer whether he would sign it or not.”
    
            Trump’s refusal to say if he would support a national ban has drawn criticism from conservatives. Alice Stewart wrote, “Trump’s past performance on protecting the sanctity of life is strong, but his future commitments are about to be put to test in the 2024 GOP primary. Other Republican primary candidates have committed to signing a federal abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. This policy distinction will not go unnoticed. … Trump may need to come up with a better answer to keep the pro-life community in his good graces.”
    
            While ambiguity on abortion could help Trump politically, he’s also vulnerable to blowback against other unpopular decisions from the Supreme Court he helped mold. It has weakened states’ ability to limit gun ownership, another unpopular stance in a nation plagued by mass shootings. And before the court’s term ends in late June, it could block Biden’s plan to forgive some college debt for millions of people.
    
            Democrats in Congress have stepped up their criticism of the court. They not only object to its increasingly conservative bent but also argue that continuing to shield the nine justices from the same ethics code that applies to other federal judges makes no sense.
    
            Congress has the power to rein in the court, wrote CNN legal analyst and law professor Steve Vladeck, whose new book “The Shadow Docket” focuses on the Supreme Court. “Congress, in the first century under the Constitution, repeatedly used an array of unquestioned constitutional powers to check the court. In 1802, Democratic-Republicans effectively eliminated the Supreme Court’s entire annual sitting for that year by changing the court’s regular meeting date — a not-so-subtle threat to the Federalist justices to behave…”
    
            “Even the most pro-judiciary readings of the Constitution still leave to Congress broad control over the court’s docket, its budget and just about everything else short of the justices’ tenure and salaries,” Vladeck argued. “The issue isn’t that the Constitution prevents Congress from pulling these levers to exert influence over the court; it’s that Congress has chosen to stop pulling them.”

            DeSantis, who is expected to announce his candidacy for the GOP 2024 nomination within days, has a boast of his own.
    
            According to the New York Times, he told donors Thursday, “You have basically three people at this point that are credible in this whole thing.” They are “Biden, Trump and me. And I think of those three, two have a chance to get elected president — Biden and me, based on all the data in the swing states, which is not great for the former president and probably insurmountable because people aren’t going to change their view of him.”
    
            How will the Florida governor’s war against Disney, his state’s largest employer, play in those swing states? Last week, a fifth-grade teacher in Florida revealed that she’s under investigation by the state’s Department of Education for showing students the Disney animated film, “Strange World.”
    
            “She says she selected the film because it reinforced lessons on earth science and ecosystems,” wrote Jodi Eichler-Levine, a religion professor. “But then she said a parent (who is a local school board member), upset by the film’s depiction of a gay teenager flirting with his crush, reported her to the state.”
    
            “Why would DeSantis, as a Republican who claims to be pro-business,” Eichler-Levine asked, “antagonize the largest single-site employer in his state, a company that attracts tens of millions of tourists a year? And why, as a social conservative, would he take aim at the nation’s leading purveyor of wholesome family-friendly American films?”
    
            “Because the Cinderella Castle holds an entire century’s worth of cultural capital. Disney remains an enduring symbol of youth — and childhood is the symbolic crucible in which we forge our notions of the future and the values it will contain. Disney is a potent cultural force that now promotes a vision of diversity and inclusion that regressive groups are right to fear.”
    
            When Disney announced Thursday that it’s scrapping plans for a $1 billion office campus in Florida, citing “changing business conditions,” Trump’s campaign said the real cause was “DeSantis’ failed war on Disney.” The governor’s office blamed it on Disney’s business challenges.
    
            On the Democratic side, there’s worry about a potential threat to Biden’s re-election chances. The centrist group No Labels is weighing the possibility of running a third-party presidential ticket and Sen. Joe Manchin, the moderate Democrat from West Virginia, has been mentioned as a possible contender to lead it.
    
            A Manchin run could strip vitally needed votes away from Biden and help elect Trump, if the former president gets the GOP nomination, wrote historian Julian Zelizer. “Since we live in an era of narrow elections, where landslides like 1936, 1972 or 1984 are extremely rare, all that Manchin would need to do is to take enough votes from a handful of voters within a handful of states to have a dramatic impact.”
    
            Meanwhile, Trump was claiming vindication over the release of special counsel John Durham’s report on the FBI’s Russia investigation. The report found that the FBI shouldn’t have launched a full investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.
    
            According to the report, “There was significant reliance on investigative leads provided or funded (directly or indirectly) by Trump’s political opponents. The Department did not adequately examine or question these materials and the motivations of those providing them, even when at about the same time the Director of the FBI and others learned of significant and potentially contrary intelligence.”  
    
            But the Washington Post Editorial Board noted, “Despite some commentators’ efforts to portray the actual result of the four-year investigation as damning, the reality is that the Justice Department special counsel uncovered next to nothing.”
    
            An earlier investigation of the Russia probe by the Justice Department’s inspector general Michael E. Horowitz  found “flaws in the FBI’s handling of the matter … but they flowed from confirmation bias rather than politically motivated misconduct,” the Post said.

            In 2019, then-President Trump issued an executive order requiring hospitals to post the prices of common medical services and procedures. It took effect just as Trump’s term ended, but the goal of ending surprise bills and enabling patients to shop around has yet to be achieved. As CNN Opinion’s Kirsi Goldynia wrote, “According to a February review by the nonprofit Patient Rights Advocate, hospitals have largely ignored the rule, and fines for noncompliance are extremely rare.”
    
            But now rapper Fat Joe “has a message for the authorities: Enforce the law,” Goldynia wrote.
    
            The New York native told CNN Opinion, “In the Bronx, you have women working two, three jobs, men working two, three jobs, and unfortunately the hospital bills are so high that people become scared to go to the hospital…”
    
            “I wanna know how much a hospital is charging me for an MRI because I might wanna go to the hospital down the block who’s charging me $2,000 less for the same exact MRI. Every other business – Burger King, McDonald’s, Baskin-Robbins, Carvel – has competition. The only place that doesn’t, and where they don’t present you with the prices, is the hospital.”
    
            “At the end of the day, I come from a community of people who championed me and stood by my side and helped me get to where I am. And so I gotta always think of them and be conscious of the voiceless. It’s about my community. It’s about helping people.”
    
            Mia Ives-Rublee was born with a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta, “which makes my bones brittle.” When she fell and broke her femur in graduate school, she underwent the first of a series of surgeries.
    
            “Medicaid covered hundreds of thousands of dollars in surgeries, hospitalizations, therapy and pain management. … Medicaid allowed me to pursue my education full time, leading to a career giving back as a social worker, advocate and researcher at a top think tank.”
    
            If the debt ceiling bill passed by House Republicans last month takes effect, Ives-Rublee warned, hundreds of thousands of people would lose Medicaid coverage because they couldn’t meet the bill’s work requirements.  “People who depend on the program for basic checkups, complicated medical procedures and community living could be harmed. As politicians quibble over rules, they ignore the real impact those funding cuts would entail.”
    
            Conservative writer Patrick T. Brown agreed that work requirements for Medicaid would be a “bad fit.” But he argued that requiring work as a condition for other benefit programs makes sense. “Research indicates that work plays an essential role in stable communities and strong families. Especially in the case of non-disabled adults without dependents, the idea of asking for a tangible connection to the workforce in exchange for public aid has a commonsense appeal. … Pursuing those opportunities could lead to better safety net politics and, more importantly, avoid a catastrophic default.”
    
            Republicans should agree to lift the specter of a June debt default by focusing instead on the October 1 deadline for a federal spending plan, wrote Lanhee J. Chen. If there’s no agreement by then, the government would shut down.
    
            “A shutdown would hurt both the economy and politicians’ political fortunes, but unlike a hypothetical debt ceiling default, we know what to expect. Government workers wouldn’t be paid. The Washington Monument would be shuttered. But Social Security checks would still be mailed. Medicare providers would still be paid. And, most importantly, the nation’s creditors would be kept whole.”
    
            Sasha Dovzhyk is part of a team of journalists, writers and scholars who bring aid to recently liberated villages in Ukraine. She witnesses not only the human cost of war, but also its devastating impact on the environment.
    
            A onetime resort town, Sviatohirsk, “complete with a pine forest and an Orthodox monastery hanging over the river on chalk cliffs … was under Russian occupation for three months over summer last year.”
    
            “Today it still smells of pines, but also of burnt metal. Scorched military equipment rots in the locals’ backyards from which the occupiers shelled Ukrainian positions.”
    
            “The Russians tried to shell the townspeople into submission too: A school gapes at us with two black holes from a Russian tank’s direct hit. Apartment blocks are dissected by air bombs — the remnants of the residents’ possessions are mixed with bricks and concrete on the road.”
    
            You have to step carefully to avoid Russia’s internationally banned landmines, known as “petals.”
    
            “Scattered from aircraft or delivered by mortars, the ‘petals’ spin through the air, bite into the earth and explode upon contact with as little as 5 kilograms of weight,” Dovzhyk noted. “The Russians have sown these seeds throughout the liberated and frontline territories of Ukraine.”

            Musk has allowed conspiracy theories to flourish on the platform. “As he spreads the messages from obscure conspiracy mongers, throwing logs onto what is already a growing fire, Musk is making a brittle, fragile social media environment even more explosive, making the world even more perilous,” Ghitis observed.

            Alaimo wrote, “Just imagine the possibilities of AI-driven weapons. Some even worry it could overtake humanity…”

            At 81, Martha Stewart can add a new accomplishment to her long resume: cover model for Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue.
    
            “Stewart does indeed look amazing on the cover of Sports Illustrated,” wrote Jill Filipovic. “She’s the oldest cover model in the history of the Swimsuit edition, long an annual festival of the hottest of hotties: gorgeous, sun-kissed women who are (with a few exceptions) improbably thin and busty – and also young. In a culture that ties youth to beauty, the women the magazine deems among the most beautiful in the world are typically many decades Stewart’s junior. This year, the magazine is shaking things up, and essentially saying, ‘the elderly can be super-hot, too.’”
    
            “Any expansion of a narrow and often punishing beauty ideal is probably good,” Filipovic added.
    
            “For women, the ideal is widening a bit, but it remains far more constricted – and being perceived as attractive and sexy remains far more important for women than it is for men. For women (but not for men), being overweight or perceived as unattractive has a financial cost: Women already earn less than men, and women who are heavier see an even bigger wage gap. Women also experience ageism in the workplace at younger ages than men do.”
    
            “So let’s not confuse an unconventional swimsuit model being on the cover of a sexy swimsuit magazine for feminist liberation.”

            Queen Charlotte was a real person. Born in 1744, she married Britain’s King George III and was the mother of King George IV. But a popular Netflix series reimagines her, as Shaun Armstead noted: “A Black noblewoman finds love and happiness as the wife of England’s king: That is the heart-warming if improbable plot of Shonda Rhimes’ latest historical miniseries, ‘Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.’”
    
            The real-life Queen Charlotte was “a descendant of Portugal’s royal family, and some even debate whether or not she had African ancestry,” wrote Armstead.
    
            “It ought to be clear that an interracial love story between royals in late-18th century Britain where people of all races interact on near-equal footing, is fantasy. And for those who don’t know that, a disclaimer at the start of the first episode of ‘Queen Charlotte’ offers a reminder.”
    
            “But its departure from history has not detracted from its appeal: the series has charmed millions of viewers since its debut this month. For some, its celebration of a multiracial but purely fictional British aristocracy may even be a big part of its appeal.”
    
            As escapism, “Queen Charlotte” is a success. But Armstead pointed out that the series ignores the reality that “imperial domination and dispossession as well as slavery enriched the coffers of British and other European nations and monarchies.”
    
            “‘Queen Charlotte’ shows that we cannot fantasize away or ignore the injustices of the past – they haunt us still.”

            A 3-year-old child shot and injured two people in Indiana on Thursday evening, which led to the arrest of a man wanted for murder in Illinois, law enforcement told CNN. 
    
            The child got access to a gun and fired one round, striking two people at an apartment in Lafayette, Lafayette Police Department Lt. Justin Hartman told CNN.  
    
            Officers responded to a local hospital where the two victims were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries after the shooting, Hartman said. One of the victims is the child’s mother, he added. Police did not say how the child was able to access the gun or what type of weapon was used.    
    
            The second shooting victim, identified as 23-year-old Trayshaun Smith, was a friend of the child’s mother who was visiting the apartment, Hartman said. Smith, a resident of Lafayette, was then arrested on an active murder warrant issued out of Cook County, Illinois, the lieutenant said. 
    
            CNN has not been able to reach Smith and has been unable able to determine if he has legal representation.

      Mother of ‘Baby India,’ the newborn who was found alive in a plastic bag in Georgia woods nearly 4 years ago, arrested and charged

    ","
            Nearly four years after an abandoned newborn girl was found alive in a plastic bag left in a wooded area of northern Georgia, authorities have identified and arrested the child’s mother.
    
            Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrested Karima Jiwani, 40, Thursday on charges of criminal attempt to commit murder, cruelty to children in the first degree, aggravated assault and reckless abandonment.
    
            The sheriff’s office identified the child’s father about 10 months ago using advanced DNA investigative practices and familial DNA, Forsyth County Sheriff Ron Freeman said during a news conference Friday. 
    
            Within the past week, DNA helped the sheriff’s office identify Jiwani as the mother of the child, dubbed “Baby India,” Freeman said.
    
            The baby was believed to be just hours old when a family in Cumming, Georgia, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, heard what they thought were animal noises coming from a wooded area on June 6, 2019.
    
            Body camera footage from responding law enforcement officers showed the crying child wrapped in a yellow plastic bag with her umbilical cord still attached. 
    
            Baby India’s birth likely took place inside a vehicle, according to Freeman. 
    
            Additional evidence revealed that Jiwani drove for a “significant period of time” after the birth with the child in the car “until she decided to tie the baby in a plastic bag and throw it into the woods to die,” Freeman said. 
    
            CNN could not determine whether Jiwani has an attorney. 
    
            Freeman said evidence collected during the investigation led authorities to believe Jiwani was likely alone when the child was abandoned. 
    
            Jiwani, who lived in southeast Forsyth County, has cooperated with detectives throughout the investigation, according to the sheriff’s office. 
    
            Authorities said they could not discuss motives or details of what Jiwani told investigators as the case is pending prosecution. 
    
            “Little can explain how this happened, and no motive can justify that decision,” Freeman said. “Jiwani made no effort to leave this child, not only under ‘Safe (Haven) Law,’ but in any place this child could be found.”
    
            Under Georgia’s Safe Place for Newborns Act, also known as the “Safe Haven Law,” mothers cannot be charged criminally if they leave their baby with medical facility volunteers or staff, or at a fire or police station, according to the Georgia Department of Human Services. 
    
            The Georgia law applies to children 30 days old or younger. 
    
            The sheriff’s office investigation discovered Jiwani had a history of “hidden and concealed pregnancies and surprise births,” Freeman said, adding digital evidence indicated she had known of this particular pregnancy for a period of time and “went to extremes to conceal” it.
    
            “There is no evidence, at this point, that the father was aware of either the pregnancy or the abandonment of (the) baby,” the sheriff added.
    
            Freeman did not discuss details of Baby India’s current status Friday, but said she was “happy, healthy and in a safe place.”

      Nebraska legislature passes bill to restrict abortions at 12 weeks, gender-affirming care for those under 19
    ","
			By Jack Forrest
		;Jack Forrest","

        10:08 PM EDT, Fri May 19, 2023
    ","
            A Nebraska bill combining a ban on most abortions after 12 weeks and restrictions on gender-affirming care for transgender Nebraskans under 19 is poised to become law after the state’s unicameral legislature voted for its passage Friday. 
    
            Nebraska’s LB 574, also known as the “Let Them Grow Act” was first introduced to bar health care providers from performing gender transition surgeries and to restrict access to puberty blocking medication and hormone treatments for anyone under 19. It will also severely restrict most abortions at 12 weeks after legislators added a last-minute amendment to the bill on May 17.  
    
            Republican Gov. Jim Pillen has said he will sign the bill into law. 
    
            “All children deserve a chance to grow and live happy, fruitful lives. This includes pre-born boys and girls, and it includes children struggling with their gender identity,” he said in a statement after the bill’s passage. “These kids deserve the opportunity to grow and explore who they are and want to be, and they can do so without making irreversible decisions that should be made when they are fully grown.” 
    
            The measure passed by a vote of 33-15, just meeting the threshold needed, following lengthy debate and multiple efforts by opponents to delay the final vote. The chants of protesters in the halls of the state Capitol could be heard in the chamber as lawmakers spoke, with the Nebraska State Patrol arresting several people during the debate on charges ranging from disturbing the peace to obstructing a government operation. 
    
            The bill makes it illegal for medical personnel to perform an abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy — with exceptions for sexual assault, incest and medical emergencies. The bill does not define “medical emergency.”  The legislation includes an emergency clause, meaning the new abortion rules will take effect the day after it is signed by the governor.
    
            The bill also bans a range of treatments that fall under the umbrella of gender affirming care. Some of what it bans, like various gender affirming surgeries, are already extremely rare for minors. Others, like puberty blockers and other hormone treatments, are the standard of care for many trans and nonbinary youth. The bill leaves the governor-appointed chief medical officer with the authority to make rules on access to puberty blocking medication and hormone treatments for Nebraskans under 19.  
    
            Unlike the abortion ban, the provisions regarding non-surgical gender-affirming care do not take effect until October 1.
    
            Some Republicans have expressed concern over long-term outcomes of the treatments. But major medical associations say that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria –the psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align, according to the American Psychiatric Association. 
    
            “Senators just voted to deny Nebraskans medically necessary care and to trample their freedom to make decisions about their own lives, families and futures,” American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska executive director Mindy Rush Chipman said in a written statement following the vote.
    
            State Sen. Ben Hansen introduced his “Preborn Child Protection Act” amendment earlier this month on the heels of the failed  LB626, or “The Heartbeat Act,” which would have banned most abortions after six weeks. That bill failed to overcome a filibuster in the legislature.  
    
            Hansen said the amended bill was born out of compromises to overcome the filibuster, with a two-thirds vote needed to break that obstacle in Nebraska’s legislature — which consists of a single lawmaking chamber as opposed to the typical House and Senate chambers. 
    
            He also said adding the restrictions onto the already existing bill was Republicans’ last shot at passing abortion restrictions in the Cornhusker State, which have been sought by Pillen since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. 
    
            “We didn’t shove things down people’s throats like we could have, I think we paused and listened like we should have,” Hansen said, which he said got the Republicans to the 33 votes they needed.  
    
            “These are some of the socially and culturally hottest topics that are tough to deal with,” he added. “Some people don’t deal with them. We are.” 
    
            Opponents of the bill don’t see the amendment as a compromise at all, with state Sen. Megan Hunt calling the Republicans’ tacking on of the abortion restrictions in a statement “unprecedented procedural maneuvers that eroded the respect for our institution.”  
    
            She asked that her Republican colleagues earn back that respect by “heeding the voices of the hundreds of thousands of Nebraskans who are pleading with them to stop this discriminatory and hateful attack on our most inherent rights.” 
    
            Under the state’s constitution, legislation proposed in Nebraska is required to be limited to a single topic, though the bill’s advocates say both issues addressed in its language are medical procedures.

      Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson expecting third child with wife, Carrie Johnson

            Carrie Johnson, the wife of former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, announced on Friday that she is “weeks away” from having their third baby. 
    
            “New team member arriving in just a few weeks,” Carrie posted on Instagram, with a photo of herself and the couple’s two other children, Wilfred and Romy. 
    
            This will be the couple’s third baby and the former prime minister’s eighth known child.
    
            “I’ve felt pretty exhausted for much of the last 8 months but we can’t wait to meet this little one,” she wrote. “Wilf is v [very] excited about being a big brother again and has been chattering about it nonstop. Don’t think Romy has a clue what’s coming… She soon will!”
    
            Carrie Johnson previously announced she suffered a miscarriage prior to the birth of Romy, who she referred to as “our rainbow baby.”
    
            “Fertility issues can be really hard for many people, particularly when on platforms like Instagram it can look like everything is only ever going well,” Johnson wrote in 2021. “I found it a real comfort to hear from people who had also experienced loss so I hope that in some very small way sharing this might help others too.”
    
            After long dodging the question, Boris Johnson finally admitted prior to the birth of his second child with Carrie in 2021 that he had six children.
    
             At that time, the number referred to his first child with Carrie, four children with his ex-wife Marina Wheeler, and one daughter from an extra-marital affair.
    
            The couple’s son, Wilfred, was born in April 2020, shortly after Mr Johnson had been hospitalized with Covid-19 symptoms so severe that he was admitted to an intensive care unit.
    
            Their daughter Romy was born in 2021, the same year they married in a secret wedding at Westminster Cathedral in London.
    
            Johnson resigned as prime minister a year later after a historic party revolt over a series of ethics scandals forced him to step down.
    
            Johnson had been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him at the time, including accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.

      South Carolina House passes six-week abortion ban after hours of contentious debate

    ","
            South Carolina House members approved a controversial bill late Wednesday that would ban most abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy, after having spent the last two days in contentious debate on the legislation. 
    
            Lawmakers had been called back for a special session this week by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to continue work on Senate Bill 474, known as the “Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,” which bans most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, which can commonly be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.
    
            The bill will now head to the Republican-controlled state Senate, where lawmakers will consider changes made by the House. The Senate passed the initial version of the bill back in February. 
    
            Even if approved by the Senate, it remains to be seen whether the law would survive a court challenge. The state Supreme Court earlier this year struck down a similar six-week ban over privacy concerns. 
    
            But were the new legislation to go into effect, it would mean that the entire US South, with the exception of Virginia, has moved to significantly curtail abortion rights since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            The state House voted 82-33 to advance the amended bill, with two Democrats joining Republicans in the chamber, but not before debate on the legislation dragged on for hours over multiple days.
    
            Democratic lawmakers had filed more than 1,000 amendments to the legislation and vowed to make fellow legislators consider all of them, while Republicans said they would stay to work on the bill for as long as it took. 
    
            “We have no intention of pulling any amendments. We are going to make it hurt if they are going to force this on us,” Democratic state Rep. Beth Bernstein said.
    
            Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday whether the Democrats were “delaying the inevitable” passage of the measure, Bernstein conceded that “unfortunately” they were but that they also sought to raise awareness around it.
    
            “[T]he reason these amendments are being filed is so we can have that voice and so people can understand what we’re doing at the statehouse is we’re effectively banning abortion,” Bernstein said on “The Lead.” 
    
            South Carolina passed a similar 6-week abortion ban in 2021, but the state Supreme Court struck it down earlier this year, concluding that the state constitution’s privacy protections require limits on the procedure to allow women sufficient time to end a pregnancy. 
    
            Recent efforts to pass further restrictions on abortion also faltered in April when the state Senate failed to pass the “Human Life Protection Act,” which would have banned most abortions in the state, in a 22-21 vote with five women voting against it – including three Republicans. The bill had previously passed in the state House and included exceptions for incidents of rape or incest. 
    
            Consideration on South Carolina’s latest abortion bill came as lawmakers in neighboring North Carolina moved on Tuesday to ban most abortions after 12 weeks after the state’s Republican-led General Assembly overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.

      DeSantis is angling to run to the right of Trump on abortion, guns and more
    ","
			By Steve Contorno and Kristen Holmes, CNN
		;Steve Contorno;Kristen Holmes","
  Published
        7:00 AM EDT, Thu May 18, 2023
    ","
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said little publicly about the six-week abortion ban he signed this year or about former President Donald Trump. 
    
            On Tuesday, he broke his silence on both.
    
            Responding to Trump’s recent criticism that Florida’s new abortion restrictions were “too harsh,” DeSantis shot back, “I was proud to do it. He won’t answer whether he would sign it or not.”
    
            Abortion is not the only issue where DeSantis has found space to the right of the former president. As he readies a campaign for the White House, DeSantis has staked out positions on guns, immigration and the Covid-19 vaccine that appeal to the most conservative voters in the party. 
    
            And it isn’t simply rhetoric. DeSantis has championed consequential new laws that will turn Florida into a state where it’s incredibly difficult to get an abortion and easy to carry a gun in public, where undocumented migrants are not welcome and doctors with fringe views are free to practice medicine.
    
            Those new laws, pushed through with the help of Republican supermajorities in the state legislature, are part of a larger effort by DeSantis to leverage his political power into policy victories that could outshine any other potential rival in a presidential primary. 
    
            The move to outflank Trump comes as the former president is fighting to both maintain his grasp on the conservative voters whose support he once easily commanded as well as broaden his appeal to voters outside of his base. Though polls show Trump with an overwhelming lead over DeSantis, he has lately clashed with some of his staunchest allies – pastors, anti-abortion groups and gun rights advocates – as he campaigns for another four years in Washington.
    
            Meanwhile, DeSantis was well-received during an appearance Saturday in Sioux County, Iowa, a deeply red part of the state’s northwest corner where Trump won 82% of the vote and evangelical influences run through its politics. Before DeSantis spoke, the invocation included a call to protect children from conception on.
    
            “There’s a lot of Trump fatigue,” Jim Dean, who hosted the event at his classic car museum, told DeSantis afterward in an exchange observed by CNN. “You know, it just, he just doesn’t carry our values in this part of the world. We believe in a lot of his policies, but the value system just isn’t there.”
    
            But DeSantis’ move does not come without risk. Even close allies have privately suggested that the Florida governor is squandering the chance to run as a less divisive Trump and capture moderates and suburban women eager to move on from the former president. They see these attempts to appease the base as unnecessary for a popular leader who has already captured attention through his fight with Disney and clashes over parents’ rights in the classroom. Advisers to Trump privately share that assessment, viewing the six-week abortion ban DeSantis signed as too restrictive for much of the country and likely to hurt the Florida governor, particularly with more moderate female voters.
    
            And Democrats on Tuesday provided a prelude of the attacks to come if DeSantis is the GOP nominee. The Democratic National Committee called his abortion ban “extreme” and declared it “rips away women’s ability to make their own health care decisions before many even know they’re pregnant, threatens to throw doctors in jail, and could force women and young girls to flee the state for care or carry out a medically risky pregnancy.”
    
            A handful of deep-pocketed donors have publicly stated their objection to Florida’s new abortion law – which bans the procedure at six weeks with limited exemptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother. However, several DeSantis fundraisers insisted to CNN that most top GOP donors remain firmly behind the governor despite a few public defections. 
    
            For his part, DeSantis has stylized himself as a governor who doesn’t shy away from divisive issues.
    
            “We made sure to go on offense, and not just be in office like some potted plant,” DeSantis told Republicans in Peoria, Illinois, on Friday. “And we also understood that governor executive positions required you, just not to be right on policy, but to exercise leadership.”
    
            Heading into 2024, it seemed unlikely any GOP contender could outflank Trump on many social issues, especially abortion. Trump had delivered the most significant victory in the anti-abortion movement’s history by way of nominating the three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.
    
            But lately, Trump has drawn criticism for his reluctance to embrace the next frontier of this fight: national legislation to curb abortion. Last month, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America lashed out at Trump for suggesting abortion should be decided at the state level, calling it “a morally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate to hold.” Shortly afterward, the organization’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, reversed her position after a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which she called “terrific.” She added in a statement thatTrump opposed late-term abortions and said he reiterated in the meeting that he believes any federal abortion legislation would need to include exceptions in the case of rape and incest as well as if the life of the mother was in danger.
    
            Then, Trump muddled his position again by declining to say at what point in a pregnancy abortion should be outlawed during CNN’s town hall in New Hampshire.
    
            “Some people are at six weeks, some people are at three weeks, two weeks,” Trump told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. “President Trump is going to make a determination what he thinks is great for the country.”
    
            Despite his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, Trump has privately blamed abortion for Republican losses in the 2022 midterms and told advisers he doesn’t think it’s a winning issue for the GOP in 2024. However, amid his back-and-forth with DeSantis, the former president touted his role in helping deliver the landmark ruling.
    
            “After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the ‘shock’ of everyone, and for the first time put the Pro Life movement in a strong negotiating position over the Radicals that are willing to kill babies even into their 9th month, and beyond,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Without me there would be no 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, or whatever is finally agreed to. Without me the pro Life movement would have just kept losing. Thank you President TRUMP!!!”
    
            Dannenfelser told CNN in a statement that the organization expects all presidential candidates “at the very least, honor the will of the American people, and the humanity of the child in the womb by opposing abortions after 15 weeks.”
    
            Neither DeSantis’ political operation or his gubernatorial staff responded when asked if DeSantis supports a national abortion ban. He has largely avoided discussing the six-week ban and he signed it deep into the night behind closed doors.
    
            On Tuesday, however, DeSantis stood by the law and offered a window in how he could use it to drive a wedge between Trump and anti-abortion voters.
    
            “Protecting an unborn child when there’s the detectable heartbeat is something that almost probably 99% of pro-lifers support,” he said.
    
            DeSantis signaled early that he intended to track to the right of Trump on at least one issue: the pandemic response. 
    
            Though an early and vigorous endorser of the coronavirus vaccine – once praising its life-saving potential – his support waned as conservative skepticism intensified. By the end of 2021, DeSantis had called lawmakers into special session to ban vaccine mandates while refusing to say if he had received a booster shot. 
    
            More recently, DeSantis has led his state to prevent doctors from facing punishment for taking positions against the vaccine or pushing other opinions out of step with the medical establishment. His own surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, has faced accusations of doctoring a study that purportedly showed greater risks of the mRNA vaccine and led the state to advise young men against inoculation.
    
            DeSantis’ actions have had the effect of undermining one of Trump’s signature accomplishments as president, at least in Florida, where vaccination rates have fallen behind other states after taking an early lead. Trump, in turn, seemed to call DeSantis “gutless” for refusing to say if he had been boosted.
    
            In a recent interview, Trump dismissed vaccine conspiracies and stood by the vaccine. 
    
            “I was able to get something approved that, you know, that has proven to have saved a lot of lives,” Trump said.
    
            At the CNN town hall, DeSantis allies cheered on Collins as she prodded Trump over his administration’s failure to finish a wall at the US-Mexico border. DeSantis, too, has often said he wants a wall – a regular reminder that there isn’t one despite Trump’s many promises. 
    
            Last week, DeSantis signed into law a sweeping crackdown of unlawful immigration into Florida designed to deter undocumented individuals from showing up in the state. The bill requires companies with at least 25 employees to check the legal status of workers against a federal database called E-Verify and creates penalties for employers who knowingly employ “unauthorized aliens” – a measure that immigration hardliners have sought for years with limited success. 
    
            Trump as a candidate in 2016 promised to “strengthen and expand” E-verify but later said it was “so tough” to deploy for many employers and it wasn’t included in his administration’s ill-fated proposal to reform immigration laws. 
    
            Trump in New Hampshire also defended his decision as president to unilaterally ban bump stocks, an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire sustained bursts of ammunition. Trump deflected a question from a member of the audience about his Second Amendment bona fides by suggesting the National Rifle Association had also supported the ban. The NRA did not return a request for comment.
    
            Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting DeSantis’ political aspirations, pounced on the answer. The organization characterized Trump’s modest gun safety measure on Twitter as “gun control” and posted a video of the former president seeming to embrace other restrictions on firearms like red flag laws, which allow courts to intervene and remove firearms from people determined by law enforcement to be a threat to themselves or others. 
    
            DeSantis, meanwhile, urged lawmakers to lift one of the few restrictions on guns in Florida, a requirement for someone to obtain a permit and training before carrying a concealed gun in public. He said he would go further by allowing the open carry of firearms in public – a step too far for even Republican lawmakers in his state despite persistent lobbying from gun advocates. DeSantis has also said he opposes the bipartisan legislation passed in Florida in the aftermath of the Parkland high school mass shooting that established the state’s red flag law and raised the age to own a rifle to 21.
    
            After he signed the bill to end concealed carry permits, DeSantis said he would “come back for more some time in the future.”
    
            Aidan Johnston, the director of federal affairs for the Gun Owners of America, said many people in his organization have mixed feelings about the Trump years. Though he didn’t say if the organization would endorse DeSantis, Johnston said, the Florida governor “has demonstrated that he understands the Second Amendment by his words and his actions.”

      Takeaways from the 5th Circuit arguments over abortion drug access
    ","
			By Tierney Sneed, CNN
		;Tierney Sneed","
  Updated
        8:26 PM EDT, Wed May 17, 2023
    ","
            The roughly two hours of oral arguments that an extremely conservative appeals court heard Wednesday in a blockbuster abortion pill case suggested that the judges were not buying the Biden administration’s arguments for why courts should not second guess how the government has regulated a medication abortion drug. 
    
            The appeals court is considering whether to uphold a federal trial court’s opinion that would suspend the drug, mifepristone – the highest-stakes legal dispute over abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. 
    
            Wednesday’s hearing featured several tense exchanges between the three GOP appointees and lawyers for the Justice Department and Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of mifepristone that is also defending its approval. 
    
            The stakes of the case are incredibly high, medication abortion is the most common form of abortion in the United States. The availability of abortion pills, and how the US Food and Drug Administration has made the drug easier to obtain via telemedicine, have been a crucial tool for abortion providers in states whether the procedure remains legal, as their clinics have been overwhelmed by out-of-state patients traveling from places where abortion is illegal or severely restricted. 
    
            The 5th Circuit is reviewing an April ruling from US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that concluded the US Food and Drug Administration broke the law in how it approved the drug more than two decades ago. That ruling has been put on hold by the Supreme Court. 
    
            Here are takeaways from the hearing in New Orleans: 
    
            In what were some of the most critical comments by the judges, the appellate panel signaled that it was deeply skeptical the arguments put forward by the government and its supporters that the scientific decisions of the FDA should not be second-guessed by the courts. 
    
            Circuit Judge James Ho, who was appointed by Donald Trump, showed his hostility to the idea of giving the FDA deference right from the beginning of the hearing, when he interrupted DOJ attorney Sarah Harrington’s opening remarks to question why the department was describing Kacsmaryk’s opinion as “unprecedented.” 
    
            “I’m just wondering why not just focus on facts of the case rather than have this sort of ‘FDA can do no wrong’ theme?”  Ho said. 
    
            Ho later suggested that it was not a “very pro-science, pro-information, pro-intellectual curiosity” position for the FDA to reduce some of the reporting requirements for when the drug had an adverse effects while it was also relaxing some of the requirements for obtaining the pills. 
    
            “I don’t understand this thing, ‘the FDA can do no wrong,’” Ho said at another point, as he ticked off unrelated controversies at the agency. “We are allowed to look at the FDA just like we’re allowed to look at any agency.”  
    
            Ho was not the only judge on the panel who was not willing to accept without scrutiny how the agency exercised its expertise in regulating mifepristone. Circuit Judge Cory Wilson, who was also appointed by Trump, grilled the Justice Department attorney on whether the FDA was obligated to consider how its regulations allowing for the mailing of the drug were making it possible for people in states were abortion was illegal to obtain the pill. 
    
            “If the FDA didn’t consider an important part of the problem, it is our role – correct? – to go behind the FDA and determine if what they did was arbitrary and capricious,” he said. 
    
            When the attorney for the anti-abortion doctors and medical associations challenging the drug’s approval, Erin Hawley, was up to argue, she faced plenty of pointed questions. But the tenor of the judges’ inquiries for her was much less heated, and the tough questions she received may have been their way of exploring how to rule against FDA and the Biden administration in a way that will protect that ruling when it is appealed up to the Supreme Court. 
    
            Much of their grilling of her focused on some of the wonkiest procedural issues in the case. The Justice Department is arguing that, even before the court gets to the merits of the abortion foes’ arguments, the case should be thrown out because of the threshold problems with the case, like the statute of limitations of the laws the challengers are using to challenge FDA’s actions. 
    
            The judges had a line of inquiry aimed at disentangling the challengers claims about why the way the FDA went about approving the drug was unlawful, with Circuit Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod, a George W. Bush-appointee, asking her questions about whether that claim had been made moot by later actions by the agency and Congress. 
    
            Wilson had Hawley elaborate on how the challengers are getting around the statute of limitations issues the DOJ argues they face. The anti-abortion doctors claim the FDA “reopened” the 2000 approval when it made changes to the how the drug can be used in 2016. 
    
            “Is every time the FDA is going to relax some prior restriction or requirement or safeguard, based on history of performance [of the drug], does that then mean we’re here on a reopening issue? I mean, how do you draw that line?” Wilson said. 
    
            The tone of those questions seemed to suggest the panel was working to dot its I’s and cross its T’s so that its decision can withstand a review by the Supreme Court. Often, when the high court wants to duck weighing in on a politicized and divisive issue, it will throw out a case for a procedural reason. Mifepristone’s defenders in the current litigation have focused on the supposed procedural flaws in the challengers’ case. 
    
            A large portion of the hearing was devoted to the question of standing, i.e. whether the challengers are at imminent risk of suffering the kinds of concrete, direct harms due to the FDA’s actions that make it appropriate for a court to intervene. 
    
            The appeals court judges did not seem to buy the Justice Department’s arguments for why the challengers did not overcome this threshold issue, though they did grill Hawley about the topic as well, asking her to point them to specific testimony in the record that backs the way she was describing their declarations. 
    
            DOJ attorney Harrington and Danco attorney Jessica Ellsworth both argued that, if you read closely the declarations submitted by the anti-abortion doctors in the case, none of them had provided the level of detail that showed that they were forced to perform – against their moral or religious convictions – surgeries to complete an abortion due to a medical emergency caused by an FDA-approved drug used in the fashion set out by the agencies’ rules. 
    
            The language in the declarations lacked the needed level of detail, Ellsworth argued, and were “generalized statements.” 
    
            The judges pushed back aggressively on her and Harrington’s claims about the declarations’ ambiguity, with Ho repeatedly reading from the declarations themselves. 
    
            Wilson appeared to embrace the challengers’ arguments that the FDA, by relaxing the rules around mifepristone’s use, increased the likelihood the anti-abortion doctors would see emergency patients suffering from mifepristone-related adverse effects. 
    
            “It just strikes me with what the FDA has done in making this more available and doing it by mail and order and removing the doctor visits, as well as the requirement that the provider be a doctor, is you’ve made it much more likely that patients are going to go to emergency care or a medical clinic where one of the doctors is a member,” Wilson told Harrington. “I don’t see how you can square that circle.” 
    
            The appeals court has the option of reversing the parts of Kacsmaryk’s ruling that would seek to pull mifepristone from the market while leaving in place the aspects of the ruling that would reverse the more recent regulatory moves by the FDA, effectively restoring certain requirements for the drug that would make it harder to access. 
    
            That is what a previous 5th Circuit panel – made up of a different set of judges – did during an emergency appeal of Kacsmaryk’s ruling, at an earlier stage of the litigation. But the Supreme Court ultimately put the entirety of Kacsmaryk’s ruling on hold several days later, with an order that will stay in place until the case is appealed again to the justices and they have another chance to weigh in. 
    
            There were some hints during Wednesday’s hearing that the current 5th Circuit panel was considering the possibility of another mixed ruling that would leave the approval of the drug in place but restore the FDA rules that made the pills more difficult to obtain. 
    
            The judges made some comments that suggested that they were at least open to the Justice Department’s arguments that the abortion opponents were time-barred from challenging the 2000 approval.  
    
            Elrod also grilled the drug company lawyer on what harms the manufacturer would face if the FDA was ordered to restore the more stringent rules for the drug. When the emergency litigation was at the Supreme Court last month, Danco argued the complexities of changing the instructions for mifepristone’s use under such a court order would take the drug off the market for at least several months. 
    
            While the Supreme Court’s emergency order was in effect, the judge asked Ellsworth, “you could get that all ready to go and so … how would you have an injury?” 
    
            After a rough first round of questioning for the DOJ’s attorney, Danco’s lawyer seemed to be having a smoother time getting the appellate panel to follow its arguments – until the final moments of her presentation, when Elrod brought up the rhetoric her team used in its briefs to describe Kacsmaryk’s opinion. 
    
            “There’s comments that the district court ‘defied long standing precedent,’ the court’s injunction was ‘an unprecedented judicial assault,’ the court’s ‘relentless one-sided narrative,’ the ‘non-expert’ court,” Elrod said, calling the rhetoric the kind of “remarks towards a district court that we normally don’t see from learned counsel.” 
    
            As Ellsworth tried to defend the language, Elrod jumped in again: “So you think it was appropriate to attack the district court personally in the case in that way?” 
    
            Ellsworth said the briefs weren’t intended as personal attacks and after more pressing from the judge, conceded, “With more time we may have ratcheted down some of that” rhetoric. 
    
            The 5th Circuit did not give any indication as to how quickly it would rule. During the proceeding, Elrod suggested she might need to see more evidence from the government – in the form of a so-called administrative record, or the set of information an agency had looked at when it made a regulatory move – as she pressed the parties on whether the court should have that “administrative record” in front of it before it rules. 
    
            Regardless of when the appeals court hands down its final ruling, the case will need to go back to the Supreme Court first before that ruling goes into effect. The emergency order from the justices last month pausing Kacsmaryk’s ruling said the current regulatory regime would remain until the case is appealed to the Supreme Court and at least until the justices decide whether they’ll take the case up. 
    
            That process could take months, and it seems likely that the 5th Circuit will take some time – at least a matter of weeks – to work on its opinion, given the consequential nature of the case and the guarantee that the Supreme Court will be looking at it very closely.

      The future of medication abortion in the US is uncertain. These women say they’re glad they got sterilized
    ","

    ","
            In January, as a 28th birthday present to herself, Mariah Marsh got herself sterilized.
    
            Five months later, she says she’s very glad she did.
    
            On Wednesday, a panel of federal judges in New Orleans will consider whether a drug used in medication abortions should be taken off the market. More than half of all abortions in the US use the drug, called mifepristone, in combination with another pill called misoprostol.
    
            Marsh has known since she was a teenager that she doesn’t want children. A few years ago, a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease that can make pregnancy risky, further solidified her decision.
    
            She wasn’t in a rush to get sterilized until June, when the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the federal right to an abortion.
    
            “It scared me. I knew that the only way I could really protect myself is to go ahead and get the surgery,” she said. “It’s a surgery I knew I would always have. My timeline was pushed up by fear.”
    
            Now she says she’s particularly glad she got her fallopian tubes removed, considering that mifepristone might not be available for abortions in the future anywhere in the United States.
    
            “It makes me happy that I made the decisions that I made because it validates my thought process, which was [that] they’re just going to come for any access to care,” said Marsh, an admissions officer at Indiana University.Although there are no national statistics on whether more women have opted for sterilization because of legal cases limiting abortion rights, some doctors say they’ve recently seen an increase in requests for such procedures.
    
            “Being concerned about access to abortion care has definitely driven up the request for sterilizations,” said Dr. Leah Tatum, a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who practices in Austin, Texas. “I see about three times the consults for sterilization as I used to.”
    
            Tubal ligation is a permanent surgical sterilization procedure that aims to prevent pregnancy by either cutting, removing or sealing off the fallopian tubes so an egg and sperm can’t meet for fertilization.The surgery is typically done at a hospital or at an outpatient surgical center, and women can go home the same day, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The procedure is immediately effective at preventing pregnancy, and recovery is quick; most women can get back to their regular activities after a few days, the CDC says.Most insurance plans are required to cover sterilization procedures, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. People without health insurance may be able to enroll in Medicaid or use state programs to offset the cost of the procedure, according to Planned Parenthood.Dani Marietti, a licensed clinical social worker candidate in Montana, had her fallopian tubes removed about a month after the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe last summer.
    
            Abortion remains legal in Montana through about the first half of pregnancy, but the 25-year-old said she’s glad she opted for sterilization, since state legislators could ban abortion in the future.And she said she was especially glad she was sterilized after US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled on April 6 that the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone more than 20 years ago should be suspended.“I feel even more confident in my decision,” she said.
    
            Kacsmaryk’s ruling was put on hold by the Supreme Court on April 21, and it will remain on hold until the case goes back to the high court, regardless of how the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rules on the merits of the case.
    
            The 5th Circuit is considered one of the most conservative in the country. Circuit Judge James Ho, one of the three judges who will hear the case Wednesday, is a Trump appointee who has called abortion a “moral tragedy.”
    
            Tatum, the doctor in Texas, said her patients worry that after last year’s decision overturning Roe and the ongoing battle over mifepristone, the next step might be that state legislators will try to limit access to birth control.
    
            “What if their reproductive rights are restricted even further?” she said. “Patients want their autonomy respected, and so they are trying to take back control over their reproductive health.”CNN’s Amanda Musa and Kyla Russell contributed to this report.

      Mother accused of abducting her daughter 6 years ago in Illinois has turned herself in, local authorities say

            The woman accused of abducting her daughter from an Illinois suburb six years ago has turned herself in, days after the girl was found safe in North Carolina and then reunited with her custodial father, local authorities said.  
    
            Heather Unbehaun, the mother of now 15-year-old Kayla Unbehaun, is being held at the Kane County Adult Justice Center in Illinois without bond on an abduction charge, according to the jail.
    
            Unbehaun was arrested Saturday on a fugitive warrant out of Illinois on kidnapping and child abduction charges and was held on a $250,000 bond while she awaited extradition, Buncombe County, North Carolina, Deputy Clerk Cory Alexander told CNN on Tuesday.  
    
            She bonded out Tuesday morning and was released, Asheville Police Department spokesperson Samantha Booth told CNN on Tuesday. 
    
            Kayla was 9 when she was abducted by Unbehaun, from the Chicago suburb South Elgin, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children said.  
    
            The girl’s disappearance came after Unbehaun took her to a parade on July 4, 2017, according to John Vojta, an attorney for Kayla’s custodial father, Ryan Iserka. When Iserka went to pick up his daughter the next day, he was told Unbehaun took her on a camping trip and Unbehaun and Kayla never returned, Vojta told CNN. 
    
            A felony warrant for kidnapping was issued for Unbehaun on July 28, 2017, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which helps families look for American kids who are taken by relatives or strangers or run away.  
    
            On Saturday evening, Kayla was spotted at a shop in Asheville by someone who recognized her from an episode of Netflix’s “Unsolved Mysteries” series about parental abductions, Booth told CNN. That person notified a store employee, who then called the police, Booth said. 
    
            Iserka had won full custody of Kayla in early 2017, with Unbehaun allowed unsupervised “parenting time” visits, Vojta said. 
    
            The year prior, the judge assigned to their custody case granted Kayla’s father “sole discretion, to make all decisions regarding medical treatment and care for the minor child,” according to court documents. 
    
            That decision came because, according to Vojta, Kayla’s mother was “messing with the medical and health issues” for Kayla. The child’s parents shared custody of her until Iserka filed for full custody after Unbehaun moved to Georgia with Kayla, according to Vojta. 
    
            CNN reached out to the attorney representing Unbehaun, who declined to comment. 
    
            Speaking on Iserka’s behalf before Unbehaun turned herself in on Wednesday, Vojta told CNN it was “very concerning that Heather was released on bond in North Carolina after she was a fugitive for six years.” 
    
            Iserka connected with his daughter in North Carolina on Sunday, and they drove back to Illinois together, Vojta said. He is overjoyed his daughter is home safe, he said in a statement through the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, thanking the organization and law enforcement agencies for spreading the word about the search for her. 
    
            “I also want to thank all of the followers on the ‘Bring Kayla Home’ Facebook page, who helped keep her story alive and were instrumental in spreading awareness,” he said. “We ask for privacy as we get to know each other again and navigate this new beginning.” 
    
            Unbehaun’s next court date is set for Wednesday morning at the Kane County Judicial Center, according to online jail records.

      Conservative appeals judges tear into Biden administration defense of anti-abortion drug approval
    ","

    ","
            A federal appeals court tore apart the Biden administration’s arguments for why the federal government’s regulatory approval of an abortion pill should be left in place – signaling the three-judge panel appointed by Republican presidents will side with a lower court decision to block access to the drug.
    
            The judges on the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals showed sympathy for the arguments put forward by anti-abortion actors who are challenging the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortion and the actions taken by the agency since that made the pills easier to obtain.
    
            However, the judges did indicate they are considering the Justice Department’s arguments that the challengers are time-barred from challenging the nearly 23-year old approval of the drug.
    
            Still the three GOP appointed judges showed particular hostility to the idea that courts shouldn’t guess the FDA or its scientific findings.
    
            “I don’t understand this thing: the FDA can do no wrong,” said Circuit Judge James Ho.
    
            “We are allowed to look at the FDA just like we’re allowed to look at any agency. That’s the role the courts,” Ho added.
    
            The panel was also skeptical of Justice Department arguments that the anti-abortion doctors and groups don’t have the legal right, or standing, to challenge the approval of the drug mifepristone in the first place.
    
            Mifepristone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration more than two decades ago for terminating pregnancies. 
    
            The case is the most substantial legal fight over abortion since Roe v. Wade was reversed by the Supreme Court last summer. The lawsuit puts in jeopardy access nationwide to medication abortion – the most common method of abortion in the United States – including in states where abortion remains legal.  
    
            The 5th Circuit is considered one of the most conservative in the country and has consistently ruled against the Biden Justice Department. All three judges on Wednesday’s panel are Republican appointees. Circuit Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod was appointed by George W. Bush. Circuit Judges Ho and Cory Wilson were both nominated by Donald Trump. Ho, in particular, has described abortion in inflammatory terms in judicial opinions in the past. 
    
            Wednesday’s hearing – and the lines of inquiry the extremely conservative panel of appellate judges explore – could tee up the questions that will be at the forefront when the justices are asked again to step into the dispute.  
    
            “The Supreme Court tends to pick up big questions that are very tightly defined,” Roger Severino, the vice president of domestic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told CNN. “So, if, in the hearing, it turns out that there’s only one or two big issues that are tightly defined, then that dramatically increases the odds that the Supreme Court will take it up.”  
    
            The Biden administration and Danco Laboratories, a mifepristone manufacturer that has intervened in the case, contend that the FDA has acted appropriately in how it’s regulated abortion pills and that the current medication abortion regime is exceedingly safe. 
    
            Their assertions are backed up by leading medical associations and other health experts that have filed friend-of-the-court briefs in the appeal.  
    
            Federal judges on opposite sides of the country have issued rival rulings on mifepristone this year. In the case now before the 5th Circuit, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Texas said that FDA broke the law in how it approved the drug and, thus, mifepristone’s approval should be suspended.  
    
            Kacsmaryk’s ruling is now on pause, and the Supreme Court issued an emergency order last month maintaining the status quo around how abortion pills can be obtained. The justices’ order will remain in effect until the lawsuit again heads up to the high court. 
    
            The arguments put forward by challengers – individual doctors and medical associations that are opposed to abortion – were embraced wholeheartedly by Kacsmaryk, another Trump nominee. They argue that mifepristone is unsafe and that its risks have been ignored by the FDA. 
    
            “The district court meticulously reviewed the science and evidence and reasonably concluded that women and girls are being harmed,” the challengers said in a filing submitted to the appeals court last week. “The public does not benefit from medical innovation that disregards red flags in drug studies.” 
    
            Those arguments also had some resonance with a previous 5th Circuit panel – made up of different judges than the one presiding over Wednesday’s hearing – that have would let some of Kacsmaryk’s ruling go into effect, before the Supreme Court stepped in last month. That emergency order from the justices was not a decision on the merits of the case, and only one justice, dissenter Justice Samuel Alito, wrote to explain his vote.
    
            Judge Ho asked the Justice Department lawyer whether the administration would abide by the end result of the litigation, whatever it is, echoing language Alito used last month.
    
            “Justice Alito in his recent dissent to whatever you call it in this case, the stay, sort of alludes to some public chatter about FDA perhaps may not follow court orders,” Ho said Wednesday. “Is the FDA intending to follow whatever this court decides and obviously subject to Supreme Court review?”
    
            “Absolutely. Whatever this court decides may be continued to be stayed, pending Supreme Court review,” DOJ’s Sarah Harrington said. 
    
            “Of course, subject to Supreme Court, right. But the FDA will oblige?” Ho responded.
    
            “Yes,” Harrington said.
    
            In addition to the Texas case, a separate lawsuit – brought in Washington state by several Democratic attorneys general – led to a ruling that said that mifepristone must remain available in the jurisdictions that brought the case.  
    
            “It’s a battle of evidence and you have now two federal district courts in this country that have opposite opinions,” said Rachel Rebouche, the dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law and a reproductive law expert.  
    
            “They have different conceptions about what is mifepristone’s safety and efficacy,” Rebouche added. “We should care about a decision of an appellate federal court that embraces one version of science and rejects another.”  
    
            With medication abortion making up the majority of abortions obtained in the United States, a decision that ultimately cut off or limited access to abortion pills would drastically reshape the abortion landscape in the country.
    
            The pill’s defenders note that mifepristone is used for miscarriage treatment, and argue that, even in states where abortion is mostly illegal, the impact of a ruling that pulled the drug from the market would be felt, because of health-of-the-mother exemptions and other exceptions to those bans.
    
            Kacsmaryk’s opinion, Danco told the appeals court in a brief, “fails to account for harms from forcing women into alternative ways of ending a pregnancy or into carrying an unwanted or unviable pregnancy.” 
    
            “It also ignores the destabilizing harm to innovation facing the pharmaceutical industry if courts can override FDA’s considered view of the scientific evidence, invent new rules for drug approvals, and throw out drug approvals based on questionable materials never presented to the agency,” the company said. 
    
            While the stakes of the lawsuit are clear, the legal claims it brings up are sprawling and convoluted. 
    
            The challengers argue that the FDA broke multiple federal laws when it approved mifepristone in 2000 and in how it’s regulated the drug since, including in its moves in recent years that have made the pill easier to obtain.  
    
            One major point of tension is over a law first passed by Congress in 1873 called the Comstock Act, which criminalized the mailing of birth control, lewd materials and abortion-inducing drugs. Some in the anti-abortion movement see the Reconstruction-era law as a backdoor avenue for a de facto federal ban on abortion. 
    
            The lawyers in the mifepristone case are focused on how the law should be applied to abortion pills, arguing that the FDA unlawfully ignored the criminal statute when it approved mifepristone – since that approval rested on drug companies’ plans to ship the drug – and when it changed the regulations more recently to let abortion pills be mailed to patients.  
    
            “This Circuit could issue an opinion that says the Comstock Act is good law. It should be applied, it should be read literally,” Rebouche said, while raising the possibility that it would be interpreted to apply to the tools used for surgical abortion as well. “That in itself, to breathe life into 150-year old law that hasn’t been enforced in 100 years, is pretty significant.”  
    
            Another major claim in the lawsuit is that the FDA’s approval of the drug should be wiped away because, the challengers argue, the regulatory mechanism that was used for its approval was aimed at “illnesses” and pregnancy is not an illness. The defendants counter that the FDA used its regulatory power appropriately in the 2000 approval and that the regulation in question also contemplates treatments for “serious or life-threatening conditions.”  
    
            “Those big beefy questions of … does an agency have the power to legalize abortion drugs when Congress didn’t authorize it? Those sorts of questions are right in the Supreme Court wheelhouse,” said Severino, who also served as a top civil rights lawyer in the Department of Health and Human Services during the Trump administration. “And even more so if it goes contrary to existing laws, such as in the Comstock Law.”  
    
            The Justice Department, meanwhile, argues that the Comstock Act allows for the mailing of abortion drugs that are intended for lawful abortions. The government also asserts that the 1873 law has no relevance in the abortion pill lawsuit, because the FDA is not charged with enforcing the criminal statute. 
    
            But before the 5th Circuit gets to the merits of legal claims, court will have to navigate through a thicket of procedural issues that mifepristone’s defenders are raising about the lawsuit. 
    
            They argue that FDA’s approval of the drug is not inflicting the type of harm on the anti-abortion doctors that would justify a court’s intervention. The abortion opponents are pointing to anecdotes of doctors having to care for patients who suffered medical emergencies after taking mifepristone. The challengers say the threat of anti-abortion doctors having to be implicated in those abortion-related emergencies has only increased since the FDA made the drug easier to obtain.  
    
            Kacsmaryk adopted the challengers’ views on both the merits issues and the procedural questions. In doing so, he pointed to evidence in the form of anonymous blogposts solicited by a website called Abortion Changes You.  
    
            In briefs filed to the appeals court, the FDA argued that Kacsmaryk had “swept the agency’s judgments aside by substituting its own lay understanding of purportedly contrary studies, offering demonstrably erroneous characterizations of the record.”  
    
            “At bottom,” the FDA added, “the district court’s conclusions about women’s interests lack merit and ignore the agency of women, who are in the best position to decide what is in their own interests in consultation with their medical providers.”

      The abortion access map is being dramatically redrawn this week
    ","
			Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN

    ","
            The evolving patchwork of access to abortion care is going through big changes this week, with the entire Southeast on the brink of imposing new limits. 
    
            Bands of states restricting abortion access could soon extend the entire length of the country, depending on legislative action and pending court battles.
    
            ► Republican lawmakers in North Carolina overrode their Democratic governor’s veto, moving to ban most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Under current state law, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. 
    
            The new law, which takes effect July 1, also imposes new requirements for medication abortion, which now accounts for the vast majority of US abortions and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to be conducted up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            North Carolina Republicans got the supermajority they needed when a Democrat who had previously supported abortion rights, state Rep. Tricia Cotham, changed parties.
    
            ► In South Carolina, a total abortion ban was blocked earlier this year by a bloc of female lawmakers, including several Republicans. But this week, the legislature is on pace to restrict abortion after six weeks. 
    
            The bill is known as the “Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,” and would ban most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo. Such activity can commonly be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, according to CNN’s report.
    
            South Carolina state Sen. Penry Gustafson, who helped defeat the total abortion ban, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour this month that she considers herself to be “pro-life,” but that neither she nor most South Carolinians support a total ban.
    
            “The Republican consensus is that we do need restrictions,” Gustafson said. “There’s a range of that between zero weeks and 12 weeks.” She supports a six-week ban in South Carolina and opposes a federal abortion ban. 
    
            ► In Nebraska’s unicameral and nonpartisan legislature, after lawmakers earlier this year failed to impose a six-week ban, they voted this week to include a 12-week abortion ban in a bill to ban transgender health care for minors.
    
            ► Nationally, the legality of medication abortion has been challenged and an appeals court hearing Wednesday in New Orleans will set the stage for how the case is ultimately brought to the Supreme Court, which has kept the drug mifepristone available for now.
    
            RELATED: See where abortions are banned and legal — and where it’s still in limbo
    
            The actions in the Carolinas – assuming the six-week ban ultimately passes in South Carolina – mean that the entire Southeast, from North Carolina over to Oklahoma, and from Florida east to Texas, will have restricted access to abortion care far beyond what was available under Roe v. Wade.
    
            The restrictions continue to the north in Kentucky, where voters last November rejected placing anti-abortion rights language in the state’s constitution, but legislators have so far left in place a near-total abortion ban during an ensuing court fight. 
    
            The abortion restriction zone could soon extend further north to include Indiana, Ohio and Iowa, where legislatures have passed more restrictive laws but abortion rights remain in limbo during court fights.
    
            In Ohio, voters could get two chances to make their feelings known. In August, Republican lawmakers want to ask voters to decide whether to make it more difficult to change the state’s constitution. In November, abortion rights activists want to ask voters to change the state’s constitution to guarantee abortion rights. Read more about developments in Ohio.
    
            Related: These bans may feel arbitrary to women facing difficulty in pregnancy. CNN reported back in February about an Ohio couple who agonized over how to deal with an unborn child who had organs outside her body – state law there allows for abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            In Florida, Republicans who control the state government have also passed legislation to restrict abortion access to six weeks of pregnancy, beyond the current restriction of 15 weeks – but again, there is ongoing litigation.
    
            In Kansas, like Kentucky, voters last year rejected the idea of amending the state constitution to say that a right to abortion is not guaranteed.
    
            That trend carried into the midterm elections in 2022, when voters in red and blue states either moved to protect abortion rights in their state constitutions or reject proposals to further restrict them.

      Missouri attorney general drops controversial emergency rule that would have banned gender-affirming care for children and many adults
    ","

    ","
            A controversial emergency rule to ban gender-affirming care for minors and most adults in the state of Missouri was withdrawn Tuesday by the attorney general who first proposed it, days after state lawmakers passed their own ban.
    
            “The legislature has now passed a ban that exceeds the authority of the rule that we passed, so we will now be prepared to defend the statute in court,” Attorney General Andrew Bailey told CNN affiliate KMOV.
    
            The attorney general’s rule – which was among the nation’s widest-reaching limits on gender-affirming care – has already been paused through at least July 20 as a lawsuit plays out. 
    
            Bailey’s rule sought to make it “unlawful” for individuals or health care providers to provide gender-affirming care without confirming that a patient has “for at least the 3 most recent consecutive years … exhibited a medically documented, long-lasting, persistent and intense pattern of gender dysphoria.”
    
            Gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender, the gender by which one wants to be known.
    
            The rule, announced late last month, was quickly met with backlash and advocacy groups sued to stop it, asking the Circuit Court of Saint Louis County to declare the emergency rule invalid “due to the Attorney General’s lack of statutory authority to promulgate it.”
    
            Petitioners at the time said the attorney general’s rule targets gender-affirming care with “unprecedented and unique restrictions so onerous that it effectively prohibits the provision of this necessary, safe, and effective care for many, if not most, transgender people in Missouri.”
    
            The ACLU of Missouri on Tuesday applauded the decision to withdraw the emergency rule. 
    
            “After weeks of embarrassing Missouri on the national stage, the Attorney General has finally joined everyone else in recognizing that his hasty attempt to usurp other branches of government cannot withstand scrutiny,” the organization said in a press release Tuesday.
    
            While the emergency rule has been withdrawn, Missouri’s legislature last week passed its own bill banning most gender-affirming care for most minors, but not transgender adults. That bill awaits the signature of Republican Gov. Mike Parson.
    
            If enacted, the bill would bar health care providers from performing gender transition surgeries, although such surgeries are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors.
    
            Republicans, including the governor, have argued that the bill is about protecting minors from permanent health treatments. 
    
            The movement to limit gender-affirming care in Missouri comes on the heels of similar bans in other states.
    
            North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill last month banning gender-affirming care for most minors with the possibility of a felony for health care professionals who provide it. Indiana and Idaho have both also enacted their own bans on gender-affirming care for youths this month, and several other states have signed into law restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors in the past few years.

      North Carolina’s GOP-led General Assembly overrides Democratic governor’s 12-week abortion ban veto

            North Carolina’s Republican-led General Assembly moved Tuesday  to ban most abortions after 12 weeks, voting to override a veto from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.
    
            The state House voted 72-48 along party lines hours after the state Senate voted 30-20 to do the same. A three-fifths vote in both chambers, where Republicans hold supermajorities, was needed to override the governor’s previous rejection of the measure.
    
            Cooper, who had previously pressed on lawmakers to sustain his veto, said in a Twitter post following the votes that “North Carolinians now understand that Republicans are unified in their assault on women’s reproductive freedom and we are energized to fight back on this and other critical issues.”
    
            He had vetoed the abortion ban on Saturday after the General Assembly swiftly advanced the bill to his desk. Republican-led state legislatures across the nation have sought to restrict the procedure in the wake of Roe v. Wade’s reversal last year, while Democratic lawmakers have attempted to stave off similar bans. As North Carolina legislators enacted the ban Tuesday, the South Carolina House of Representative was in the midst of an hourslong debate on a 6-week abortion ban bill after Democratic lawmakers said they filed over 1,000 amendments to it.
    
            The governor had placed pressure on four state Republican lawmakers who had previously vowed to protect abortion rights – state Reps. Ted Davis, John Bradford, Tricia Cotham and Republican state Sen. Michael Lee – by paying visits to their districts and urging them to stand by their comments. 
    
            “We are going to have to kick it into an even higher gear when that veto stamp comes down. If just one Republican in either the House or the Senate keeps a campaign promise to protect women’s reproductive health we can stop this ban,” Cooper said at a rally on Saturday. 
    
            Republicans in the state gained a veto-proof supermajority last month when then-Democrat Cotham switched parties. Cotham, who had campaigned in favor of abortion rights as a Democrat and sponsored legislation earlier in the legislative session to codify Roe v. Wade, was one of the Republicans who voted for the abortion ban. She was joined by the other Republican lawmakers identified by Cooper in voting to overturn his veto.
    
            Cotham defended her vote in a statement Tuesday, arguing that the bill “strikes a reasonable balance on the abortion issue” and provides hundreds of millions of dollars in funding toward programs that support mothers and children. 
    
            “Some may call me a hypocrite since I voted for this bill,” she said, noting that she had an ectopic pregnancy that resulted in a miscarriage. “In fact, Senate Bill 20 affirms the life-saving care I received in that dire situation.” 
    
            The bill – Senate Bill 20, dubbed the “Care for Women, Children and Families Act” – bans any licensed physician from performing surgical abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It provides exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks.
    
            It takes effect July 1.
    
            Under the bill, the procedure could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines an abortion is necessary to avert death – “not including psychological or emotional conditions.”
    
            Under current state law, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. A reduction to 12 weeks is significant but less restrictive than some other GOP-led states that have recently enacted six-week or near-total bans on the procedure.
    
            The bill also prohibits health care providers who object to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.
    
            It also calls for multiple in-person examination by physicians seeking to prescribe or administer abortion-inducing drugs and will prohibit people within the state from mailing such drugs to a pregnant woman. The bill mandates that doctors confirm that the “probable gestational age” of a fetus is no more than 10 weeks before they can sign off on a medication abortion.
    
            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre slammed lawmakers who enacted the legislation Tuesday, calling it “dangerous” and “out of touch with the majority of North Carolinians.” 
    
            Ahead of the House vote Tuesday night, Democratic state Rep. Diamond Staton-Williams spoke on the House floor about her own decision to have an abortion.
    
            She described how in 2002, as a young mom in a committed relationship with her husband, she and her family made the decision to schedule the procedure. 
    
            “It was not an easy decision, at all, it was not made lightly or frivolously,” she said. “I knew that in order for my family to prosper and to continue with the opportunities in front of us, this was the best decision for us.”
    
            She said the ban would take away that “God given right.”

      Pfizer’s maternal RSV vaccine effective at preventing severe infections in newborns, FDA says, but flags potential risk of preterm birth
    ","

    ","
            Pfizer’s vaccine to protect newborns from respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, by vaccinating their moms late in pregnancy cuts the risk that infants will need to see a doctor or be admitted to the hospital with a moderate to severe infection before 6 months of age, according to a new analysis by government regulators.
    
            Many parents have been eagerly anticipating this news, particularly after last year’s long and severe RSV season.
    
             RSV is a major cause of hospitalization in infants and the elderly each year, and it typically hits hardest during the winter months.  
    
             Scientists have been working on an effective RSV for young children for roughly 60 years, so there’s plenty of excitement around the prospect of having a candidate get so close to the finish line.
    
             But the news isn’t all rosy.  Safety data published in an agency analysis Tuesday also showed a slightly higher proportion of preterm birth in babies whose moms got the experimental RSV vaccine compared with those who got a placebo: 5.7% vs. 4.7%, respectively.  
    
             The difference between the groups was not statistically significant, meaning it could have been due to chance. Rates of preterm births in both groups were lower than the rates of early birth reported in the general population, which is about 10%.  And most infants, even when born prematurely, were delivered after 34 weeks of pregnancy, just a few weeks shy of their due dates.
    
            Still, this finding will probably spur discussion this week at meeting of a group of independent experts who advise the US Food and Drug Administration on its vaccine decisions.
    
            Late-stage trials of a similar maternal vaccine for RSV being tested by the drug company GSK were stopped last year over safety concerns. 
    
            GSK later reported that there was a higher risk of preterm births among vaccinated mothers in its study compared with those who got a placebo.  There were 238 preterm births among 3,496 vaccinated moms (6.8%) compared with 86 among 1,739 pregnant women (4.9%) in the placebo group.  There were also 13 neonatal deaths in the vaccine arm, compared with three in the placebo group, according to a recent report in the BMJ.
    
             The FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, will meet Thursday and vote on whether to recommend approval for Pfizer’s maternal RSV vaccine.
    
             In terms of efficacy, FDA reviewers said the vaccine was most effective for the youngest infants, and its protection waned over time.  
    
            For the first three months after birth, the vaccine was 82% effective at preventing severe RSV disease and 57% effective at keeping babies from needing to see the doctor because of an RSV infection.  By six months after birth, the vaccine was 69% effective at preventing severe RSV disease and 51% effective at preventing a doctor’s visit for RSV-related breathing problems.
    
             After six months, the vaccine was about as effective as the placebo at preventing RSV that became severe enough to send babies to the doctor’s office.
    
             For the most part, the vaccine appeared to be safe, with reactions and serious adverse events balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups.  
    
            There were 17 deaths in the main study: five in the group that got the vaccine and 12 in the group whose moms got a placebo. 
    
            The FDA agreed with Pfizer that four of the five deaths in the immunized group were probably unrelated to the vaccine.  The agency said it couldn’t exclude the possibility that one death, in a baby born very prematurely 10 days after its mother was vaccinated, was related to the vaccine.
    
            One infant in the placebo group died of an RSV infection.
    
            Pfizer’s RSV vaccine is made with a key piece of the virus: its F proteins, the part of the virus that docks onto and infects cells.  The vaccine uses F proteins from the two major subgroups of the virus, A and B, making it a bivalent vaccine.  
    
            The vaccine tested in pregnant women is the same dose and structure as the one the company is testing for adults 60 and older.
    
            The FDA has reviewed Pfizer’s vaccine for seniors and is due to make a decision on whether to approve it by the end of the month.
    
             If it is approved, it will become the second RSV targeted at older adults.  The agency recently approved an RSV vaccine for seniors made by GSK.

      Marijuana harms development in first trimester of pregnancy, study finds

    ","
            If you are pregnant and use any form of cannabis product, consider stopping. 
    
            That’s the takeaway from a new study that found a significant health impact of marijuana use on fetal development as early as the beginning of pregnancy.
    
            “That’s why these findings are especially important — people can often be well into the first trimester and don’t even know they are pregnant,” said lead author Beth Bailey, professor of psychology and director of population health research at the College of Medicine at Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant.
    
            “Our study drills down to look very specifically at a specific time point in pregnancy — the first trimester. We found a significant decrease in birth weight of 154 grams. In terms of pounds, it’s about a third of a pound,” she said. 
    
            While one-third of a pound may not seem to be much, such slight decreases in weight have been linked to health problems as children grow, Bailey said. 
    
            “Low birth weight is one of the strongest predictors of a child’s health and development long-term,” she said. “These kids are more prone to developmental delays, higher rates of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), learning disabilities, and have higher rates of emotional problems.”
    
            If marijuana exposure continued during the rest of the pregnancy, birth weight dropped by another 31 grams (0.07 pound), the study found. In addition, the head circumference of the newborn was reduced if marijuana use continued throughout pregnancy. Smaller head circumference could be a sign the brain didn’t develop properly during pregnancy. 
    
            “Even when pregnant people stopped using marijuana by the third trimester, the babies were born with a smaller head circumference of about 1 centimeter (0.4 inch),” Bailey said. “What we are telling women is that it’s not an absolute certainty that your baby’s growth will be impacted if you are using marijuana. But we do know that you are at substantially higher risk for that outcome.” 
    
            While reducing levels of marijuana consumption during pregnancy is beneficial, it may not be enough to protect the developing baby, Bailey said, because scientists do not yet have the research data to see whether there is any level of marijuana use that does not cause fetal harm. 
    
            The safest recourse? “My advice to women is to avoid using marijuana at all during pregnancy and if possible stop using prior to becoming pregnant,” Bailey said.
    
            The study, published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Pediatrics, used data from medical records of 109 pregnant people who delivered at an obstetrics clinic at Central Michigan’s College of Medicine. That data were compared with the data of 171 people who did not use marijuana and served as the control group.
    
            Pregnant people who used marijuana were significantly younger, more likely to be single and covered by Medicaid, and less likely to have an education beyond high school than those who did not use marijuana.
    
            While the study numbers were small, the research was robust because the use of marijuana was verified via urine tests, said Brianna Moore, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora. She was not involved in the study.
    
            “Urinary THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) testing is more objective than self-report, since pregnant people may not want to state that they are using cannabis,” she said. 
    
            According to studies, self-reported cannabis use in pregnancy is around 7%, Moore added. However, a 2019 study that tested umbilical cords for TCH found that cannabis use in pregnancy may be as high as 22.4%.
    
            Many pregnant people may use cannabis to treat pregnancy-related symptoms such as nausea and pain or as a “substitute” for prescription medications like antidepressants, Moore said. 
    
            “However, one study suggests that very few pregnant people (0.5%) use cannabis strictly for medical purposes,” Moore said. “There’s work that needs to be done to understand the contextual, social, or individual factors that influence cannabis use in pregnancy.
    
            “That would help identify techniques and tools to limit cannabis use in pregnancy,” she added, “such as mindfulness techniques to cope with stress or ‘triggers,’ and over-the-counter medications for nausea and the like.”
    
            Use of marijuana during pregnancy is on the rise, Bailey said: “With legalization there seems to be the idea that it must be safe since it’s legal, and so a lot of people continue to use during pregnancy.”
    
            Compounding the problem, studies in the ’90s did not look at specific trimesters and found little overall harm to a fetus from using marijuana, Bailey said. It’s possible some of the older information may be currently distributed on social media.
    
            “Birth weight was just minimally impacted back then and studies showed subtle developmental effects on children long-term,” Bailey said. “However, what we’re seeing with legalization is that people are probably using more heavily, and today we’ve got marijuana strains with stronger THC levels, now that marijuana is commercially grown. We’re seeing very large effects on the fetus in the last 10 years of research.”
    
            The impact can be even worse when negative health behaviors are combined. Prior research has “pretty well established” that smoking cigarettes during pregnancy has a bigger impact on birth weight than exposure to marijuana,” Bailey said.
    
            “But when women combine smoking cigarettes and marijuana, we see an even bigger effect on birth weight than you would get from either of the two alone,” she said.

            A mother in Dallas, Texas, was going to pick up a prom dress with her daughter when she was fatally shot by a stray bullet – just a day before Mother’s Day.
    
            Ana Moreno, 39, was driving with her teenage daughter when she was struck by the bullet at around 4 p.m. Saturday, the Dallas Police Department said in a statement. Individuals in two other vehicles had been shooting at each other while driving, police said.
    
            Three men were also shot in the incident and were in critical condition at local hospitals as of Sunday, police said.
    
            Moreno’s other daughter, Michelle Rodriguez, told CNN affiliate WFAA that her mother was shot while sitting next to Rodriguez’s sister, on their way to pick up her prom dress.
    
            “Anything you would want in a mom, that was her,” Rodriguez said of her mother. “It wasn’t her time, it wasn’t supposed to be her. And it’s over something stupid. How do you do that to someone innocent?”

      One vote to redraw the US abortion rights map

            One vote can change everything, especially when things are close.
    
            Voters outside Charlotte, North Carolina, had every reason to expect their representative would vote to protect abortion rights.
    
            State Rep. Tricia Cotham once shared the story of her own abortion in a speech supporting abortion rights on the state House floor.
    
            Earlier this year, she signed on to a bill that would codify abortion rights under Roe v. Wade in her state. Cotham is still listed as a co-sponsor.
    
            But then, earlier this month, she voted for a ban on most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, about half of what was guaranteed under Roe v. Wade. 
    
            What happened in between is that Cotham switched parties and upended North Carolina’s power balance in the process.
    
            Alienated by Democrats, in particular on the issue of education and her deeply held support for charter schools, Cotham said she no longer felt represented by the party. She became a Republican in April and gave Republicans a veto-proof majority in the state House. Cotham did not respond to a request for comment.
    
            Republicans are now poised to use that majority to change abortion law in the state over Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s objection. Cooper vetoed the bill on Saturday, but a vote to override that veto is now scheduled for Tuesday. 
    
            “If just one Republican in either the House or the Senate keeps a campaign promise to protect women’s reproductive health, we can stop this ban,” Cooper told supporters at a campaign-style rally in Raleigh on Saturday.
    
            Republicans have argued the bill represents compromise – most US abortions occur in the first trimester. But the bill also places new restrictions on women seeking an abortion before that 12-week threshold. Read CNN’s full report.
    
            Another Republican lawmaker, state Rep. Ted Davis, was absent when the abortion bill passed through the North Carolina House.
    
            He has also previously expressed support for leaving North Carolina law where it is, with women able to make their own choice for up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, according to previous comments circulated by the governor’s office.
    
            RELATED: See where abortion is banned, where it’s legal and where it’s in limbo
    
            Nearly all Republican lawmakers these days describe themselves as “pro-life,” but the term can mean drastically different things.
    
            Abortion remains legal in South Carolina for up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, for instance, because five women voted against a near-total abortion ban last month – including three Republican state senators who bucked the rest of the party. The ban was defeated by a single vote.
    
            South Carolina state Sen. Penry Gustafson, who helped defeat that ban, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour this month that she considers herself to be “pro-life,” but that neither she nor most South Carolinians support a total ban.
    
            “The Republican consensus is that we do need restrictions,” Gustafson said. “There’s a range of that between zero weeks and 12 weeks.” She supports a six-week ban in South Carolina and opposes a federal abortion ban. Watch Amanpour’s interview of Gustafson.
    
            South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, has called the state legislature back for a special session Tuesday to take another crack at new abortion legislation. A six-week abortion ban passed by the state in 2021 has been struck down by the state’s Supreme Court. Read more about developments in South Carolina.
    
            The current ban in South Carolina, which makes most abortions illegal after about 20 weeks, exists because another Republican woman, former Gov. Nikki Haley, signed it into law back in 2016. When Roe fell, the law Haley signed went into effect.
    
            Now running for president, Haley supports more restrictions on abortion than the 20-week ban she had signed into law. It was, she said on CBS News on Sunday, “the furthest we could get it at the time.” 
    
            But her focus now is on national consensus rather than imposing a nationwide ban like other likely Republican presidential candidates have suggested.
    
            “Why try and divide people further?” Haley said, noting that neither party will get the 60 votes needed to impose a ban or codify Roe v. Wade. “Why not talk about the fact that we should be trying to save as many babies as possible and support as many mothers as possible? I think the media has tried to divide them by saying we have to decide certain weeks. In states, yes. At the federal level, it’s not realistic. It’s not being honest with the American people.”
    
            She’s right about neither party likely getting 60 votes. And that means the abortion rights map will continue to evolve, and not just in the South.
    
            CNN’s Fredreka Schouten reports that the GOP-controlled legislature in Ohio, dominated by opponents of abortion rights, has scheduled an August election to make it more difficult for voters to change the state’s constitution.
    
            That move by the legislature, conveniently, gets ahead of abortion rights supporters, who are gathering signatures for a ballot measure in November over whether to guarantee abortion rights in the state.

      Antidepressants and pregnancy may be a more nuanced conversation than you think

            For people who have managed anxiety or depression with antidepressants, pregnancy can seem like a terrifying choice between mental health and the well-being of a future child. 
    
            “Some providers and patients alike really come from the perspective that the use of psychiatric medication is not compatible with pregnancy,” said Dr. Allison Deutch, the director of reproductive consultation-liaison psychiatry at NYU Langone Health and clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. 
    
            “Battling that misconception, both from the patient perspective and the provider perspective, is one of the most challenging aspects of doing this work,” Deutch said.
    
            A patient, Blake, said she and her husband sat with Deutch for a long conversation weighing if she should stay on the medication she started during the pandemic  to get back to equilibrium. 
    
            They talked through questions like “Would it affect the baby? Would the baby have withdrawal? Would the baby have any developmental issues? Would the baby have any physical issues? What could happen to the baby?” said Blake, who only wanted to be identified by her first name. 
    
            In the end, Blake decided to stay on her medication. 
    
            “I firmly believe it was best for me because in order to be the best mother you can be, you need to be your best self,” she said. 
    
            In her 28 years as an obstetrician gynecologist, Dr. Maria Sophocles said one thing she had seen over and over is her patients’ willingness to put others first — even to their own detriment. 
    
            The decision of how to treat a person’s depression while they are pregnant isn’t as simple as choosing the well-being of one over the other, said Sophocles, who is also the medical director of Women’s Healthcare of Princeton in New Jersey. 
    
            And with all the shame around mental health and the pressure on expectant parents, it is important to talk about how much more nuanced the conversation around medication to treat anxiety and depression while pregnant is, Sophocles said. 
    
            “Treating mental illness is as important as treating any other condition in pregnancy,” Deutch said. “When done properly with a careful degree of vigilance … many women can go on to have very healthy successful pregnancies, while also on these medications, which are many times really essential to their well-being.”
    
            In many medical circumstances, people make decisions by weighing the risks and benefits. When deciding whether to stay on antidepressants during pregnancy, it’s more like analyzing the risks versus the risks, Deutch said.
    
            “We are weighing what is the risk of medication exposure to both mom and baby against what is the risk of untreated maternal mental illness to both mom and baby,” she added.
    
            When it comes to taking medication, concerns include risks of low birth weight, preterm birth, problems with development and birth defects, said Dr. Rubiahna Vaughn, director of consultation-liaison and emergency psychiatry at the Jack D. Weiler Hospital in Bronx, New York, that’s part of the Montefiore Health System. 
    
            The most common medication to treat depression are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, also known as SSRIs, and the data is largely reassuring that they are safe to use while pregnant, Deutch added. 
    
            A 2022 study found antidepressant use during pregnancy was not associated with autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioral disorders, developmental speech, language, learning, and coordination disorders or intellectual disabilities.
    
            And the risk of giving birth to a baby with birth defects while on SSRIs is lower than the baseline risk, Vaughn said. 
    
            Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are also considered an option during pregnancy, Sophocles added. 
    
            Some medications in the same categories might have less risk than others, so talk with your doctor to find the right one for you, she said.
    
            The risk of complications on antidepressants during pregnancy is low, but nothing is completely without any risk when it comes to poor birth outcomes — not even acetaminophen, Sophocles said. 
    
            “We don’t take treating pregnant women with medications lightly at all,” Vaughn said. “But we also have to weigh that with the real risks of leaving depression untreated and how that can impact not only Mom but also the fetus and the baby as it develops.”
    
            Untreated depression during pregnancy has been associated with risk for lower birth weight and preterm birth, said Vaughn, who is also assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and of obstetrics and gynecology and women’s health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York.
    
            Because people who had depression before pregnancy are at greater risk for postpartum depression, patients should also consider the risk of relapse with a newborn when talking with their doctor about whether to stay on their medication, Deutch said. 
    
            Some of the fear around antidepressants may come from stigma or misinformation, but much of it comes from caring for a future child, Deutch said.
    
            “This is one place where women really feel like ‘if I have an option to white-knuckle it, I would rather suffer than cause undue harm to my baby,’” she added.  But toughing it out may not be the safest option either.
    
            “I think we all intuitively know that in a family system where there is a mother, if the mom is not functioning well, the whole household is not functioning well,” Vaughn said. “There are reams and reams of data to support that idea.”
    
            It would make sense that it would be harder to have a healthy pregnancy if the parents are struggling. 
    
            “You can imagine that if you’re depressed and pregnant, it is pretty hard to make it to a doctor’s appointment … really hard to take that prenatal vitamin, it’s really hard to make sure that you’re getting good adequate nutrition to support your pregnancy,” Vaughn added. 
    
            And there is risk for the baby after birth as well. What infants really need are responsive parents — and being engaged and connected is difficult when people are anxious and depressed, Deutch said. 
    
            “No parent wants to make a decision that is going to harm their baby, and we understand that. We are completely sympathetic to that perspective,” she added. But “a healthy mom makes for a healthy baby.”
    
            For those who are experiencing depression or anxiety for the first time during their pregnancy or in the postpartum period, it might be hard to recognize, Deutch said. 
    
            Many of her patients think it is normal to be worrying about their child’s stages of development, not getting sleep or missing showers with a newborn, she said. 
    
            But when that worry starts to impede on your life or you feel a sense of hopelessness, helplessness or worthlessness, it may be time to speak to your doctor, Vaughn said. 
    
            “I think the question is, how much time are we spending during a day worrying? And to what extent is it impacting our ability to function,” she added. 
    
            Sophocles recommends having conversations with your doctor regularly, and she hopes medical professionals are proactive in talking about mental health. 
    
            Just getting in the door and starting the conversation can help pave the way for a healthier pregnancy, she added. 
    
            And even if you are not yet pregnant but thinking about getting on antidepressants, it is never too early to talk with your doctor about the implications for pregnancy, Vaughn said. 
    
            “Most American women will have at least one pregnancy in their lifetime and close to 50% of pregnancies in the US are unplanned,” she said. Ask: “Is this something that I can get pregnant on? Is this something I can breastfeed my baby? And if it’s not what are the options that I have?” 
    
            But just like not every pregnancy is the same, not every case of anxiety and depression are the same. Some may benefit greatly from medication, some will do very well off medication and with other options such as psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, Vaughn said. 
    
            The primary advice is to talk with your doctor and give yourself permission to make choices that are best for you and your baby, she added.
    
            “It’s not the story for everyone,” Vaughn said. “But I think for women who are really suffering from depression, you want to really set yourself up to have the best possible experience during pregnancy and the postpartum. And it’s hard to do that if you’re depressed.”
    
            Blake’s advice is to “trust your doctor, and trust your instincts.”

      What the 5 stages of grief are, and how to get through them
    ","
			By Kristen Rogers, CNN

    ","
            When someone you love dies, the world as you’ve known it is totally upended. 
    
            One way people cope, psychologist Sherry Cormier said, is by trying to find some sort of certainty. This need for structure is probably one factor behind the popularity that latched onto the “five stages of grief” over 50 years ago and hasn’t yet let up, said David Kessler, who founded grief.com, a resource aiming to help people deal with uncharted territory related to grief. Kessler coauthored “On Grief and Grieving” with the late Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross.
    
            A Swiss American psychiatrist and pioneer of studies on dying people, Kübler-Ross wrote “On Death and Dying,” the 1969 book in which she proposed the patient-focused, death-adjustment pattern, the “Five Stages of Grief.” Those stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. 
    
            “In the actual book, she talked about more than five stages,” Kessler said. “Think about the context of 1969 — doctors and hospital personnel were not talking about the end-of-life process. … Elisabeth really hoped ‘On Death and Dying’ would start the conversation.”
    
            Since then, there has been extensive media coverage of the five stages; use in television shows including “Grey’s Anatomy” and “House”; clinician support; and criticism. Those five stages are what people clung to, Kessler said. 
    
            Grief and psychology experts and academics have criticized the framework for not being thoroughly supported by research, suggesting that the bereaved move through grief sequentially or implying one correct way to grieve. But these suggestions weren’t Kübler-Ross’ intentions, and she stated these caveats on the first page of the book, Kessler said. 
    
            While there’s debate among experts about the stages of grief, “people who are in the pain of grief are just saying, ‘Help me,’ ” Kessler said. Here’s what the five stages of grief are, and how you can consider and process them in whichever order you experience them.   
    
            In denial there is grace, in that we can’t fully register the total pain, shock and disbelief over our loss in one moment or day, so the pain is spread over time, Kessler said. 
    
            While denial in a literal and dysfunctional sense would be trying to convince yourself your loved one isn’t dead, an inability to comprehend the loss for a while is healthy — not something you need to snap out of quickly, he added. 
    
            If you’re struggling with overwhelming denial, you can try to stop fighting the reality you’ve been presented with, said Cormier, who is also a bereavement trauma specialist and consultant.
    
            Anger is another natural reaction to loss, whether it’s anger at the cause of death, the deceased, the god of your religion, yourself or the randomness of the universe, Kessler said. 
    
            “Anger is pain’s bodyguard. It’s how we express pain,” he said. “That stage gives people permission to be angry in healthy ways, and to know it’s not bad.” 
    
            Anger “can be an anchor, giving temporary structure to the nothingness of loss. At first grief feels like being lost at sea: no connection to anything,” according to Kessler’s website. “Then you get angry at someone, maybe a person who didn’t attend the funeral, maybe a person who isn’t around, maybe a person who is different now that your loved one has died. Suddenly you have a structure — your anger toward them.” 
    
            Beneath anger can be feelings of hopelessness or powerlessness, Cormier said, sometimes prompting guilt and blame that some people use to maintain an illusion of control or express frustration. 
    
            “Our minds would always rather feel guilty than helpless,” Kessler said. 
    
            Depending on how your loved one died, one way to overcome guilt- and blame-related anger is by realizing that as horrific as your loss is, it wasn’t personally done to you, Kessler said. 
    
            “The reality is the death rate in families is 100%,” he said. “Everyone is going to die eventually, but our minds just can’t fathom that.”  
    
            Allow yourself to express anger in healthy ways, Kessler advised, whether it’s “grief yoga,” screaming in your car, using a punching bag, running or other forms of exercise.  
    
            Often also stemming from guilt, bargaining after a loss typically involves “if only” statements, focused on regrets about what you did or didn’t do before the person died, Kessler said. 
    
            “We may even bargain with the pain. We will do anything not to feel the pain of this loss,” Kessler’s site says. “People often think of the stages as lasting weeks or months. They forget that the stages are responses to feelings that can last for minutes or hours as we flip in and out of one and then another.” 
    
            Remember that we live in a world where sometimes bad things happen despite our best efforts, Kessler said. 
    
            Depression, or an acute sadness, is when the great loss begins more deeply affecting your life. Maybe the sadness feels as if it will last forever, or you’ve withdrawn from life or are wondering if life is worth living alone. 
    
            Sadness hits people at different times, Cormier said. She has known people who aren’t distraught in the first year after loss, but by year three are consumed with sadness. Why? Because for a time, some can maintain the illusion that a loved one is away on vacation and may be returning, she said. 
    
            Often, the eventual, deep sadness “is really an expression of, ‘my loved one is gone and not coming back,’” Cormier said. 
    
            But those feelings shouldn’t always be labeled as clinical depression, Kessler said. If you think you’re depressed around a death, see a psychiatrist for an evaluation, he advised.
    
            To cope with sadness, you can also seek support from friends, family or grief support groups, and regularly practice self-care, Cormier suggested. 
    
            Acceptance doesn’t mean you’re OK with your loved one being gone. “It just means that I now accept the new reality of my life. I’m a widow, I live alone. I don’t have siblings to call up anymore. I don’t have parents to call up anymore,” said Cormier, who wrote “Sweet Sorrow: Finding Enduring Wholeness After Grief and Loss” after losing her husband and immediate family. 
    
            Acceptance isn’t grief’s end, either. You might have many little moments of acceptance over time, Kessler said, such as when you plan and attend the funeral. 
    
            “One of the questions I get asked most is, ‘When will this grief be over?’” Kessler added. “Very gently, I’ll ask, ‘How long is the person going to be dead? Because if the person is going to be dead for a long time, you’re going to grieve for a long time. It doesn’t mean you will always grieve with pain. To me, the goal of grief work is to eventually remember the person with more love than pain.”
    
            Arriving at acceptance means you’re healing, Cormier said. But if you can’t get there, you need to seek professional help. Intense and persistent grief that causes problems and interferes with everyday functioning, in a way that typical grief doesn’t after some time has passed, is known as prolonged grief disorder, according to the American Psychiatric Association. The disorder was added to the revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders released in March 2022. 
    
            To be diagnosed with prolonged grief disorder, a loved one’s death had to have occurred at least a year prior for adults, and at least six months ago for children and adolescents, according to the association, which publishes the DSM. One symptom is difficulty with reintegration, such as pursuing interests or interacting with friends. 
    
            Cormier doesn’t think we ever “get over” grief. Our task is different than moving on — it’s learning to integrate the loss into our lives so that we can move forward with a new reality, she added. “It’s sort of offensive to grievers to say, ‘Oh, you’ve really moved on.’ No, I don’t think grievers move on. We move forward.” 
    
            After his son died at age 21 nearly five years ago, Kessler wanted something beyond acceptance. He had studied late neurologist, psychiatrist and philosopher Dr. Viktor Frankl’s work on meaning, and wondered how meaning related to grief — which inspired his book “Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief.”  
    
            Meaning didn’t eliminate Kessler’s pain, but it did cushion it, he said. 
    
            Meaning is in what we later do or realize as the bereaved people, Kessler explained. Maybe you recognize the fragility of life, try to change a law or donate money to research so no one dies the way your loved one did, or make a change in your life.

      Supreme Court sides with Alabama inmate who seeks to die by nitrogen gas

            The Supreme Court on Monday sided with a death row inmate in Alabama – whose scheduled execution by lethal injection was called off at the last minute by the state – who seeks to die by nitrogen gas when he is ultimately executed.  
    
            Alabama had asked the high court to intervene – arguing that a lower court that  contravened Supreme Court precedent that requires an inmate to demonstrate that a proposed alternative method is not just “feasible” but able to be “readily implemented.” 
    
            Monday, the court declined. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.
    
            The court’s action comes after the justices divided 6-3 earlier in the term to allow Kenneth Smith’s execution to go forward by lethal injection. The execution was abruptly canceled later in the evening after the state was unable to properly set the IV line before the warrant for execution expired.    
    
            Smith later claimed the execution was botched.   
    
            Smith was convicted for the 1988 murder, with an accomplice, of Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett in a murder-for-hire plot. The two were hired by Sennett’s husband, who was involved in an affair and had taken out a large insurance policy on his wife.  
    
            The case comes after the state paused executions last fall and conducted a review of its execution process after problems with multiple lethal injections came into the national spotlight. In late February, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey called for the state’s executions to resume after the review was completed.   
    
            Smith argued the state should not try to execute him again by lethal injection, but should instead use nitrogen gas. He won his case at the lower court level.  
    
            Alabama asked the Supreme Court to reverse that decision, noting that while the state legislature has approved the use of nitrogen gas, the state has yet to finalize the protocols.

      North Carolina Democratic governor vetoes abortion ban, setting up likely override vote

            North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a controversial bill that would ban most abortions after 12 weeks, setting up a likely override effort from the state legislature, where Republicans have a supermajority.
    
            Cooper’s swift veto comes just over a week after the Republican-controlled state Senate advanced the bill to his desk in a party-line vote.
    
            Speaking to a crowd of supporters at a rally in Raleigh before his veto, Cooper urged those gathered to put pressure on four state Republican lawmakers who had previously vowed to protect abortion rights to stand by their comments and not join any veto override.
    
            “We are going to have to kick it into an even higher gear when that veto stamp comes down. If just one Republican in either the House or the Senate keeps a campaign promise to protect women’s reproductive health we can stop this ban,” Cooper said at the Saturday rally. “But that’s going to take every single one of you to make calls, to send emails, to write letters. Tell them to sustain this veto. Tell them to ask the Republican leadership to stop it.”
    
            Ahead of the veto, Cooper had moved to escalate pressure on the four Republicans – state Reps. Ted Davis, John Bradford, Tricia Cotham and Republican State Sen. Michael Lee – by paying visits to their districts. All four previously vowed to protect abortion rights and held roundtable discussions there on the topic in the hopes of appealing to those lawmakers and their constituents.
    
            CNN has reached out to the lawmakers for comment. Davis declined to comment on his plans, while the others have not responded.
    
            If both chambers approve the override by three-fifths majority, the bill becomes law. If it does not get the votes, then the governor’s veto remains.
    
            Demi Dowdy, a spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, told CNN she is confident lawmakers will override Cooper’s veto and dismissed his efforts to “press these Republican members into voting his way.”
    
            Republicans in the state gained a veto-proof supermajority last month when then-Democratic Cotham switched parties. Cotham, who had campaigned in favor of abortion rights as a Democrat, was one of the Republicans who voted for the bill. She also sponsored legislation earlier this session to codify Roe v. Wade.
    
            State legislators have already shown they are not afraid to use their newfound powers to override Cooper’s vetoes. In March, the state legislature overrode Cooper’s veto on a bill that now makes it legal to purchase a pistol without a permit in the state.
    
            North Carolina had been a haven for women seeking abortion care as Southern states tightened restrictions after the Supreme Court sent the issue of abortion rights back to the states.
    
            If Cooper’s veto is not sustained, the bill – Senate Bill 20, dubbed the “Care for Women, Children and Families Act” – would ban any licensed physician from performing surgical abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It would provide exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks.
    
            Under the bill, the procedure could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines an abortion is necessary to avert death – “not including psychological or emotional conditions.”
    
            Under current state law, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. A reduction to 12 weeks would be significant but less restrictive than some other GOP-led states that have recently enacted six-week or near-total bans on the procedure.
    
            The bill would also prohibit health care providers who objects to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.
    
            It also calls for in-person examination by physicians seeking to prescribe or administer abortion-inducing drugs and would prohibit people within the state from mailing such drugs to a pregnant woman. The bill would mandate that doctors confirm that the “probable gestational age” of a fetus is no more than 10 weeks before they can sign off on a medication abortion.
    
            This story has been updated with additional information.

      Idaho’s murky abortion law is driving doctors out of the state
    ","

    ","
            The state of Idaho is in the beginning stages of a grand exodus. Doctors – specifically, those who care for pregnant women and perform abortions – are fleeing the state due to new abortion restrictions. 
    
            Doctors like Lauren Miller, who has been treating women and performing abortions in Boise for the last five years. Her greatest fear? “Being tried as a felon simply for saving someone’s life,” she told CNN.
    
            Miller specializes in maternal-fetal medicine at the hospital where she works and handles high-risk pregnancies. She treats complications such as ectopic pregnancies, where a fertilized egg is outside the uterus, pre-eclampsia and other dangerous conditions.
    
            After Idaho passed a near-total abortion ban, Miller and other doctors like her say they are unsure about how to continue to do their job. 
    
            Last August, Idaho made abortion illegal, with two exceptions.
    
            An abortion can still be performed if the mother’s life is in danger, and in the case of rape or incest, but only after a police report has been filed and provided to the doctor. Even then, it’s restricted to the first trimester. But Miller says the law is still somewhat murky.
    
            “We have a death exception and that is it without any other guidelines,” she said. “If I don’t act fast enough to save your life, prevent you from getting septic, I could be liable for civil cases … malpractice. But if I act too quickly and I’m not 100% certain that the patient is going to die from the complication she’s sustaining, then I could be guilty of a felony.”
    
            “We don’t know what that bar is and no one wants to be the guinea pig first test case of that,” Miller told CNN.
    
            State Representative Brent J. Crane, the lead negotiator on the bill, characterized the law as “a work in progress,” acknowledging to CNN that lawmakers are going to have to “come back and do more work to define what constitutes a risk to a mother’s life in those highly nuanced situations.”
    
            Complicating matters more, the new law, which went into effect in August 2022, allows certain family members of a patient to sue providers who perform an abortion for at least $20,000 if the procedure breaks the abortion law.
    
            Doctors in those cases also face suspension of their medical license, felony charges and even prison time. 
    
            Beyond that, Idaho’s governor also signed a law that says anyone helping a minor travel out of state to terminate a pregnancy – without parental consent – is guilty of a crime. 
    
            Miller, who is also head of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Reproductive Health, calls it “moral injury.” It saddens her that she cannot provide the care she’s been trained to offer.
    
            “It goes against what we’re taught as physicians to protect the health of our patients,” she said.  
    
            So, she decided to move her practice to Colorado, where abortion is still legal. And she’s not the only one leaving.
    
            Of the 117 doctors she informally surveyed in Idaho, 75 answered “yes” or “maybe” when asked if they were considering leaving the state at least in part because of the abortion laws. 
    
            Dr. Kylie Cooper, who worked alongside Miller, has already moved with her family out of Idaho and is now practicing in Minnesota, where abortion is legal.
    
            “It was a really difficult decision to make … there was a wave of emotions, lots of fear and anxiety for my patients and also for myself…my husband and I had many conversations about what would it actually look like if I was charged with a felony and then went to prison,” she told CNN.
    
            Cooper says she feels much safer after leaving Idaho. 
    
            “To watch somebody get sicker in front of your eyes and not be able to help them is hard to comprehend,” she said. “That is not the way I was trained to practice medicine. We don’t let people get so sick when we have all the tools to help them.”
    
            Back in Idaho, Miller says five of the nine remaining full-time maternal-fetal medicine physicians in the state will have left by the end of this year.  
    
            These are the doctors who deal with the most significant pregnancy complications, an essential service to their patients.   
    
            Jim Souza, the chief physician executive at St. Luke’s Medical Center in Boise, told CNN: “We’re at the beginning of the collapse of an entire system of care.”
    
            He likened it to a Jenga tower: “You can pull out certain planks and the tower still stands,” he said. “But pull out too many planks or certain planks and the whole thing falls … unfortunately that’s the position we’re in right now.”
    
            Souza says that Idaho has already lost many of its maternal-fetal medicine physicians. 
    
            “If the momentum doesn’t shift, and we continue to pull planks out of the Jenga tower of this system of care,” he said, “there’s no question that that there will be bad perinatal outcomes for moms and babies. You need these providers in order to provide the safety net.”
    
            And because there are no ob-gyn residencies in Idaho, finding doctors willing to relocate given the abortion laws on the books is a real challenge. 
    
            Still, Souza told CNN, “I’m an optimist at heart.”
    
            While doctors in Idaho are already warning the public about the risks these abortion restrictions pose to the health of expectant mothers, there won’t be any data to show the real impact these laws have on the maternal mortality rate in Idaho. 
    
            That’s because this July, Idaho’s state legislature is due to sunset the Maternal Mortality Review Committee, which tracks pregnancy deaths.  
    
            In light of that, Miller warned, “We won’t see the bad outcomes that occur secondary to these laws being in place. It’s like we’re trying to hide that information from the public so we can’t see the repercussions of not having access to safe abortion care. I have no doubt that the mortality rate will rise.”

      Opinion: How this animal welfare victory could threaten abortion rights
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler and Elizabeth Joh
		","
  Published
        9:21 AM EDT, Sat May 13, 2023
    ","
            At first glance, the Supreme Court’s recent decision to uphold a California animal welfare law, a victory for both the state and animal welfare activists, doesn’t seem to have much to do with abortion. But the court’s decision could have darker implications for reproductive rights.
    
            Animal welfare advocates will cheer the court’s reluctance to second guess the state’s voters, who in 2018 adopted a ballot initiative to change the standards for eggs, pork and veal sold within the state.  Proposition 12 forbids the sale of pork that comes from breeding pigs confined in crates where they could not move or lie down. In a decision written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court rejected the challenge brought by the pork industry’s representatives, who argued that Proposition 12 unconstitutionally required the nation’s pork producers – most of them outside of California – to change entirely the way they did business.
    
            The central argument of National Pork Producers Council v. Ross focuses on the so-called dormant Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court has long interpreted the US Constitution’s Commerce Clause to bar the states from favoring in-state products over out-of-state products and generally burdening interstate commerce. While Proposition 12 animal welfare restrictions did not openly discriminate against interstate commerce, the challengers argued that the burdens of the law greatly outweighed the moral and health reasons California offered to justify its policy.
    
            While the justices were unable to agree on the legal rationale for their decision, they sided with California — and reinforced every state’s ability to regulate “the sale of an ordinary consumer good within its own borders.” After all, even the challengers in Ross conceded that states could ban in-state sales of products made by child labor on moral or ethical grounds. Why would pork raised in cruel conditions be any different?
    
            But no Supreme Court case is limited to its own facts, and the abortion issue is lurking in the background. That’s what Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested in his separate opinion (which concurred in part and dissented in part from the majority).
    
            If Ross is the law, there appear to be few limits on the kind of moral and policy choices states can make in restricting goods sold within their borders, even if they are made elsewhere. Here’s how that might look if applied to reproductive rights: If California can ban in-state sales of pork if it originated from a cruelly confined sow, can it ban products made by companies that refuse to pay for employees’ birth control or abortions? Can Texas ban the sales of products if produced by companies that pay for employees’ birth control or abortions?
    
            The dormant Commerce Clause, Ross tells us, most clearly stops states from playing favorites, from rigging the rules to give their own products and businesses a leg up. That principle may not do much to protect states that treat abortion access as a protected right. States like California are not trying to help California abortion doctors outcompete providers in Texas; they are trying to protect their own citizens from criminal and civil consequences when they help people traveling from states with bans. 
    
            But some scholars and observers of the case thought that the dormant Commerce Clause stood for more: a strong presumption that states could not constitutionally apply their own laws outside of state lines. That would have made it much harder for states to target doctors, Uber drivers or anyone else whose conduct was legal in progressive states if they chose to help out-of-state abortion seekers in their efforts to terminate a pregnancy.
    
            However, the Supreme Court in Ross decided that the dormant Commerce Clause had never stopped states from applying their laws outside of state lines in this way, leaving the door open for a kind of abortion civil war, with conservative states targeting actors in progressive states, or even vice versa.
    
            That blue states can play the same game as red states should not be reassuring. Kavanaugh is right that just as conservative states could penalize businesses that cover out-of-state travel for abortion, progressive states could go after businesses that refused to do so.
    
            But this balance may get one-sided sooner than later. Thus far, most of the proposals to penalize out-of-state conduct have come from the right, such as Idaho’s recent law making it a crime to help a minor travel out of state for an abortion without parental consent, and allowing lawsuits to be brought against doctors who help those minors, even if the physicians are located out of state. Anti-abortion lawyers have proposed even more aggressive strategies that would limit any interstate travel for abortion. But even if Kavanaugh is right, and we see sniping from blue as well as red states, that is still bad news, just as it was in the years before the Civil War, when interstate conflicts about the rights of enslaved persons fleeing to free states roiled the courts.
    
            We can hope that other constitutional arguments would nip this kind of interstate conflict in the bud. The right to travel, which has an impeccable historical origin story, is clearly at issue. If Alabama tried to prosecute a California doctor for helping an Alabamian get an abortion in California, modern legal principles should dictate that California law applies. Applying Alabama law might even violate the Constitution — by denying the California doctor due process, or failing to give full faith and credit to California’s laws.
    
            If these arguments don’t work, we may end up with a legal free-for-all, with businesses and states going tit for tat, and seeking to impose outcomes that would be deeply unpopular on unwilling voters. No one should celebrate conflicts between states and businesses about matters as fundamental as reproductive health care. If the dormant Commerce Clause won’t be a tool to prevent this kind of conflict, we all should look for a better way.

      Texas woman shot and killed by her boyfriend over an abortion, police say

            A man is suspected of shooting and killing his girlfriend after she reportedly went to another state for an abortion, Dallas police say.
    
            Officers were called to a parking lot Wednesday after Gabriella Gonzalez, 26, was killed, according to a Dallas County arrest warrant.
    
            Surveillance video shows Harold Lavance Thompson walking with her just before the shooting. He tried to put Gonzalez in a chokehold but she got away, police say. 
    
            Thompson then pulled out a gun and shot Gonzalez in the head, said the warrant. He fired several more shots into her as she was on the ground before running away, according to the court documents. Multiple witnesses, including Gonzalez’s sister, told police they saw Thompson try to strangle the woman before they heard the gunshots.  
    
            The two were “in a dating relationship,” the warrant says. There was “an active family violence strangulation warrant” from a March incident in which “Gonzalez was the victim,” court documents said.  
    
            “Further investigation revealed that (Gonzalez) went to Colorado to get an abortion and returned the night before. It is believed that the suspect was the father of the child. The suspect did not want the complainant to get an abortion,” said the warrant.  
    
            “Thompson was arrested after the execution of the search warrant and declined to give a statement,” said court documents. 
    
            Thompson is charged with murder and assault of a family/household member/impeding breath or circulation, Dallas County Jail records show. 
    
            Thompson was denied bond during his first appearance before a judge Thursday and was to be appointed a public defender, court records show.
    
            Gonzalez had three children from a previous relationship, the police report says.
    
            CNN has reached out to the Dallas County Public Defender’s Office.

      Opinion: How a restaurant menu became a metaphor for how America fails its mothers
    ","
			Opinion by Kara Alaimo
		","
  Updated
        8:18 AM EDT, Fri May 12, 2023
    ","
            I was only a few weeks pregnant with my first child when I went out to dinner at a tony Los Angeles restaurant and asked my server whether the cheese in a salad on the menu had been pasteurized.
    
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists warns that foods made with unpasteurized milk can contain listeria, a bacteria which can cause miscarriages and other serious problems in pregnancy. The server responded by saying “oh, so you’re expecting!”— right in front of the two men I happened to be dining with.
    
            Thankfully, those two men were my husband and brother-in-law, who we’d already told I was pregnant because I had been feeling very ill. But I was still thrown – what if I had been out to dinner with work colleagues, prospective employers or even friends who I didn’t want to tell I was expecting so early? That server would have outed me.
    
            Many women prefer to wait until they’re further along to announce they’re pregnant, since there is a significant risk of miscarriages in the first trimester and pregnancy discrimination is commonplace in US workplaces.
    
            There’s a simple solution to avoid situations like mine. Restaurant menus should list the answers pregnant women often need in order to determine whether foods are safe for them. They can work off the Mayo Clinic’s guidelines which explain the things many expecting moms want to know. For example: are certain foods pasteurized? And are they being served raw or cooked?
    
            These accommodations should be common practice. But my experience was also a reminder that restaurants are just one of the many places where our society judges and demands perfection from mothers, while at the same time making motherhood far more difficult than it needs to be.
    
            If I had been visibly pregnant and ordered a glass of wine at that dinner, for example, I can only imagine the social approbation I would have faced, since alcohol isn’t safe for unborn babies.
    
            But when I asked the questions to which I needed answers while I was expecting, I not only had to risk giving away that I was pregnant with telltale questions. I also got plenty of unfriendly reactions from restaurant employees, who made clear they thought I was being high maintenance (a judgment that seems to be mostly reserved for women in our society) and/or crazy. Often, servers didn’t seem to know the answers to questions I asked, and I frequently wasn’t confident that the responses they gave me were accurate.
    
            And the rest of society only piles on. That posh LA restaurant recently sent my husband an email suggesting he make Mother’s Day reservations. I wouldn’t dream of taking our young kids to a place like that because I know I’d get eye rolls if my toddler acted like a toddler.
    
            In fact, the majority of American mothers said they’d been “mom shamed” in a 2017 nationwide poll. We’re judged and criticized by others for everything from how we discipline our kids to, of course, whether we breastfeed or bottle feed.
    
            This isn’t just about menus. It’s about acknowledging – as so many of us consider whether to treat moms to brunch or a bouquet of flowers – that American life is stacked against mothers 365 days a year, and we need to do more to change that.
    
            The stakes couldn’t be higher. The US has the highest maternal mortality rate of any industrialized, wealthy country – and Black and Native American women in the United States have especially appalling rates of death as the result of pregnancy and childbirth. We’re also the only large, rich country not to provide universal health care.
    
            According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the US is the only one of 41 countries that doesn’t ensure parents receive paid leave from work after they have a child. This means many moms have to go back to work soon after giving birth – but struggle to find affordable childcare.
    
            Rich countries spend an average of $14,000 per toddler in public funds on childcare each year. The US spends $500.
    
            And, unlike moms in other countries, we have drills to teach our preschoolers what to do if someone arrives at their school and tries to murder them and their friends. That’s because the number one killer of American kids is guns.
    
            So I think it’s fair to say life is pretty tough for American moms.
    
            American mothers are quite literally up against the motherload of challenges. Some of these problems have to be solved by government. But others – the smaller, more easily fixable moments – can be addressed with common sense.
    
            What if in addition to planning prix fixe meals for Mother’s Day brunch, more restaurants took a hard look at how they could adapt their menus to make eating out while pregnant a little easier? And next time you’re out in public and tempted to judge or shame a mother for her choices, think about all she’s up against – and consider cheering her on instead.

      Ohio Republicans approve August election that could thwart abortion-rights push in state

    ","
            Ohio voters will decide this summer whether to make it more difficult to change the state’s constitution – only months before a potential ballot measure in November over whether to guarantee abortion rights in the state.
    
            Ohio’s Republican-controlled legislature this week approved a resolution that will ask voters in August to increase the threshold needed to change the constitution from a simple majority to 60%. It also would require backers of ballot initiatives to get signatures from voters in all of Ohio’s 88 counties – rather than current 44 – to place something on the ballot. 
    
            Voters also could decide to eliminate the 10-day period during which citizen groups are currently allowed to gather additional voter signatures if their petitions are found to lack the required amount of valid signatures.
    
            The special election will be held August 8. The election measure passed in the form of a joint resolution and does not require the governor’s signature to take effect. 
    
            The move comes after abortion rights supporters in the state won approval to begin collecting signatures to put a measure on the November ballot that would guarantee Ohioans’ access to abortion. If approved by voters, state officials could not prohibit abortion until after fetal viability, the point at which doctors say the fetus can survive outside the womb.
    
            Critics of the August special election say it amounts to an end-run around voters and is part of a broader campaign by opponents of abortion to thwart citizen-approved ballot measures enshrining abortion rights. 
    
            The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year left abortion laws up to the states, and abortion rights groups quickly scored wins on ballot measures in six of them – including in the battleground state of Michigan, where voters protected abortion access, and in the Republican strongholds of Kansas, Kentucky and Montana, where voters defeated efforts to restrict abortions.
    
            In Ohio, a state “fetal heartbeat” law that prohibits many abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy took effect when the US Supreme Court struck down Roe with its decision last June in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. But the law has been put on hold by a judge in Cincinnati.
    
            “These politicians know that their radical views on abortion care can’t win a fair vote, so they’re rigging the system,” Kellie Copeland, spokesperson for Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, said in a statement about the August special election. 
    
            The group is pushing the November abortion-rights initiative.
    
            Supporters say the threshold should be raised to make it harder for deep-pocketed interest groups to push through changes to the constitution through the initiative process.
    
            The main sponsor of the effort to change the ballot initiative rules, Republican state Rep. Brian Stewart, did not immediately respond to a CNN interview request Thursday.
    
            He has pushed back on claims that increasing the threshold unfairly changes election ground rules.
    
            “If any outside group believes its ideas are worthy of inclusion in Ohio’s constitution, then they should be able to earn the widespread public support that a 60% vote margin will require,” Stewart said during floor debate Wednesday.
    
            Unions, abortion rights groups and voting rights activists have formed a coalition, called Vote No in August, to oppose raising the initiative threshold.

      Abortion clinics saw an increase in violence and threats in 2022, report says

    ","
            A new report says there was a “sharp increase” in violence at abortion clinics in 2022, the year when Roe v. Wade was overturned, ending the federal right to an abortion. A disproportionate increase occurred in states that protect abortion rights, according to the National Abortion Federation, a professional association for abortion providers.
    
            In its annual report on violence, the federation says there were more major incidents at abortion clinics, including arson, burglaries, death threats and invasions last year than in 2021. There were decreases in trespassing and assault and battery, which the federation attributes to clinic closures.
    
            There were four cases of arson in 2022 – in Bakersfield, California, in March; Casper, Wyoming, in May; Kalamazoo, Michigan, in July; and Las Vegas in December – an increase from two in 2021.
    
            The report says there were 218 reports of deaths threats or threats of harm, an increase from 182 in 2021 and 57 in 2018.
    
            In 2022, reports of stalking providers and patients grew to 92 from 28 in 2021, and reported burglaries grew to 43 from 13.
    
            For the first time since 2011, facilities reported receiving suspicious letters containing a white powdery substance.
    
            The federation says it has tracked violence and disruption at reproductive health facilities since 1977. It collects monthly reports from facilities – 80% reported data for the new report – and follows up to collect complete reports. Some closed clinics weren’t able to report data in 2022 and others reported for only part of the year.
    
            The 2022 report includes data from the US, Canada and Colombia, while 2021 data also includes Mexico City.
    
            The federation says it does not include incidents that can’t be validated, “which suggests that actual incidents are higher than reported.”

      Opinion: We could all use more certainty in life. Here’s one way we can get it
    ","

    ","
            Elon Musk recently announced that Twitter’s once news-making 20 weeks of paid parental leave would be drastically cut to two weeks. At 2 weeks old, most babies are sleeping 14 to 17 hours a day and waking every two to four hours to eat. Parents who have given birth are still physically hurting, swollen and possibly bleeding.
    
            Because paid family and medical leave is so rare in the United States – according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, just 24% of private-sector workers had access in 2022 to paid family leave to care for a new child and only 4 in 10 have short-term disability insurance to address their own serious health issue – many parents face an unenviable decision: Go back to work or stay home and lose pay.
    
            Currently, federal law only requires some employers (those with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius) to provide unpaid, job-protected leave through the 30-year-old Family and Medical Leave Act. As a result, according to a US Department of Labor-commissioned study, 44% of workers do not even have this basic level of job protection.
    
            Workers in lower-wage and service-sector jobs face particular precarity and always have. Paid leave benefits are even less common, jobs are less stable overall and offer less flexibility and predictability day to day.
    
            Workers’ lack of financial security, along with fears of workplace retribution, contribute to the fact that, per a Department of Labor-commissioned report, an estimated 23% of moms in the US who have given birth have gone back to work within 10 days. Less than 5% of fathers take two or more weeks of parental leave, according to a study published in the journal Community, Work & Family.
    
            But professional, higher-wage workers at companies that have in the past extolled their paid leave benefits, such as those who recently saw their paid leave cut at Twitter, might have assumed they had more security. And with good reason: In the second half of the 2010s, tech and financial services companies tried to distinguish themselves in a bid for talent by offering generous paid leave policies and other benefits to attract and retain sought-after workers. And, to be sure, some still are still motivated to do so. The business research group Just Capital recently recognized six companies’ paid parental leave policies, citing strong evidence that they help boost retention.
    
            However, in reality, security, stability and family-friendly policies have never been guaranteed – and high-wage workers are currently facing a new round of uncertainty. Layoffs in tech and other high-paying professional industries have been widely reported.
    
            Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that tech job cuts were affecting new parents, who had relied on generous paid leave policies when selecting employment only to find that a layoff severed them from access.
    
            In this moment, where both lower- and higher-wage workers have no guarantee of much-needed benefits, there is a new opportunity for mindset change – and policy changes.
    
            It’s time to decouple benefits such as paid leave and child care from employment and start creating systems that allow everyone – no matter their job or employment status – to access the resources they need. A national paid family and medical leave program, with benefits provided through a government fund – similar to Social Security and other paid leave programs that operate in 11 states and the District of Columbia – is one approach. National child care investments that dramatically increase the number of child care slots and offset costs for parents while improving job quality for child care workers is another essential public investment.
    
            Policies that would have done both of these things passed the House of Representatives in 2021, but failed to be considered by the Senate when West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin announced he would join 50 Republicans in opposing the House bill.
    
            Investing in care policies is great unfinished business in America, and it’s in the interest of all working people to demand completion. Fortunately, President Joe Biden has proposed major new investments in paid leave and child care policies in his fiscal year 2024 budget, which – if acted upon by Congress – would fund versions of the programs that passed in 2021. Care policies were featured in the president’s 2023 State of the Union address and in opening ads for his reelection campaign – signaling the administration’s intent to keep pushing.
    
            In Congress, there is a new a bipartisan paid family and medical leave working group urging House leadership in both parties to take action; what that could look like is still under consideration. Temporary child care investments enacted as part of the American Rescue Plan Act will soon face funding cliffs, which means child care providers and families need policymakers to act.
    
            There is an opportunity for voters to come together to demand a little certainty. By guaranteeing access to paid leave for every working person in the US and by making it easier to find affordable, high-quality child care no matter your job, the government would create a modicum of stability that people need and that employers could always improve upon. The ability to care for ourselves and our families is central to who we are. No boss – Elon Musk or anyone else – should be able to take that away, and it’s time for all of us to encourage and hold policymakers accountable for taking action.

      FDA advisers vote unanimously in support of over-the-counter birth-control pill
    ","

    ","
            Advisers for the US Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously on Wednesday in support of making the birth-control pill Opill available over-the-counter, saying the benefits outweigh the risks.
    
            Two FDA advisory panels agreed that people would use Opill safely and effectively and said groups such as adolescents and those with limited literacy would be able to take the pill at the same time every day without help from a health care worker. 
    
            The advisers were asked to vote on whether people were likely to use the tablet properly so that the benefits would exceed the risks. Seventeen voted yes. Zero voted no or abstained.
    
            Opill manufacturer Perrigo hailed the vote as a “groundbreaking” move for women’s health. 
    
            “Perrigo is proud to lead the way in making contraception more accessible to women in the U.S.,” Murray Kessler, Perrigo’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “We are motivated by the millions of people who need easy access to safe and effective contraception.”
    
            The FDA doesn’t have to follow its advisers’ advice, but it often does. It is expected to decide whether to approve the over-the-counter pill this summer.
    
            If it’s approved, this will be the first birth-control pill available over the counter in the United States. Opill is a “mini-pill” that uses only the hormone progestin. 
    
            At Wednesday’s meeting, Dr. Margery Gass of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine thanked the FDA for its consideration of switching Opill to an over-the-counter product. 
    
            “I think this represents a landmark in our history of women’s health. Unwanted pregnancies can really derail a woman’s life, and especially an adolescent’s life,” she said. 
    
            The FDA has faced pressure to allow Opill to go over-the-counter from lawmakers as well as health care providers. 
    
            Unwanted pregnancies are a public health issue in the US, where almost half of all pregnancies are unintended, and rates are especially high among lower-income women, Black women and those who haven’t completed high school. 
    
            In March 2022, 59 members of Congress wrote a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf about OTC contraception. 
    
            “This is a critical issue for reproductive health, rights, and justice. Despite decades of proven safety and effectiveness, people still face immense barriers to getting birth control due to systemic inequities in our healthcare system,” the lawmakers wrote. 
    
            A recent study showed that it’s become harder for women to access reproductive health care services more broadly – such as routine screenings and birth control – in recent years.
    
            About 45% of women experienced at least one barrier to reproductive health care services in 2021, up 10% from 2017. Nearly 19% reported at least three barriers in 2021, up from 16% in 2017.
    
            Increasing reproductive access for women and adolescents was a resounding theme among the FDA advisers. 
    
            “We can take this opportunity to increase access, reduce disparities and, most importantly, increase the reproductive autonomy of the women of our nation,” said Dr. Jolie Haun of the James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital and the University of Utah.
    
            Dr. Karen Murray, deputy director of the FDA’s Office of Nonprescription Drugs, said the agency understands the importance of “increased access to effective contraception” but hinted that the FDA would need more data from the manufacturer. 
    
            Some of the advisers and FDA scientists expressed concern that some of Perrigo’s data was unreliable due to overreporting of “improbable dosing.” 
    
            Murray said the lack of sufficient information from the study poses challenges for approval.
    
            “It would have been a much easier time for the agency if the applicant had submitted a development program and an actual use study that was very easy to interpret and did not have so many challenges. But that was not what happened for us. And so the FDA has been put in a very difficult position of trying to determine whether it is likely that women will use this product safely and effectively in the nonprescription setting,” she said. “But I wanted to again emphasize that FDA does realize how very important women’s health is and how important it is to try to increase access to effective contraception for US women.”
    
            Ultimately, the advisers said, they don’t want further studies of Opill to delay the availability of the product in an over-the-counter setting.
    
            “I just wanted to say that the improbable dosing issue is important, and I don’t think it’s been adequately addressed and certainly leads to some uncertainty in the findings. But despite this, I would not recommend another actual use study this time, and I think we can make a decision on the totality of the evidence,” said Kate Curtis of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Curtis said she voted yes because “Opill has the potential to have a huge positive public health impact.”
    
            Earlier in the discussion, Dr. Leslie Walker-Harding of the University of Washington and Seattle Children’s Hospital said the pill is just as safe as many other medications available on store shelves. 
    
            “The safety profile is so good that we would need to take every other medicine off the market like Benadryl, ibuprofen, Tylenol, which causes deaths and people can get any amount of that without any oversight. And this is extremely safe, much safer than all three of those medications, and incorrect use still doesn’t appear to have problematic issues,” she said.
    
            Dr. Katalin Roth of the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences also emphasized the safety of the pill over the 50 years it has been approved as a prescription drug in the US.
    
            “The risks to women of an unintended pregnancy are much greater than any of the things we were discussing as risks of putting this pill out out over-the-counter,” she said. “The history of women’s contraception is a struggle for women’s control over their reproduction, and we need to trust women.”

      Nebraska lawmaker tries to rekindle effort to further restrict abortion

            A Nebraska Republican lawmaker has introduced an amendment to ban some abortions nearly two weeks after efforts to severely restrict abortion failed in the state.  
    
            State Sen. Ben Hansen introduced the amendment earlier this week to a bill that would ban all gender-altering procedures for individuals under the age of 19, also known as the “Let Them Grow Act.” 
    
            Hansen’s amendment, which seeks to ban abortions after 12 weeks, includes exceptions in cases of sexual assault, incest and medical emergencies. 
    
            Under the state’s constitution, legislation proposed in Nebraska is required to be limited to a single topic. 
    
            But supporters argued that since both issues were related to medical procedures, the proposed legislation didn’t break the single subject rule and could pass, CNN affiliate KOLN reported.
    
            Democratic state Sen. George Dungan disagreed, telling KOLN, “The only two things that I see that these bills have in common is the government standing between a doctor and patients, and I oppose that in pretty much every concept.”
    
            Hansen told CNN that the amendment was based on a compromise after the previous abortion legislation stalled in the legislature.
    
            “It definitely has the possibility of gaining more support, and so far it’s indicated that already. We feel pretty confident in the process that we have an ability to kind of get this through,” Hansen said. 
    
            “A ban is a ban, plain and simple. Whether it be a ban on gender-affirming care, or a ban on abortion. The goal is to take away people’s power over their lives and their futures,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska said in a tweet.
    
            Last month, LB626, or “The Heartbeat Act,” which would have banned most abortions after six weeks, stalled in the legislature after a vote to overcome a filibuster failed to reach a two-thirds majority. Republican state Sen. Merv Riepe, a cosigner to the bill, had proposed an amendment to move the ban to 12 weeks instead of six weeks, but his amendment did not receive a vote.
    
            Nebraska law currently prohibits most abortions starting at 20 weeks.
    
            Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, said he was “profoundly disappointed” in the failed vote and called for the bill to be reconsidered.
    
            During a session earlier this week on the House floor, state Sen. Megan Hunt said lawmakers were attempting “a do over” of “The Heartbeat Act” bill. 
    
            “You all had your chance to vote for Sen. Merv Riepe’s amendment for 12 weeks. If you had, you’d have your little abortion ban and you missed the window,” Hunt said.
    
            The continuous efforts to restrict abortion in the Cornhusker State underscore the ongoing statewide battles over abortion rights that have taken shape since federal protections were removed with the reversal of Roe v. Wade last summer.

      As FDA advisers consider OTC birth-control pill, agency scientists worry it won’t work due to women’s weight and likelihood of following label

            When Caitlyn Pace moved from the United States to Hong Kong three years ago to take a teaching job, she loved the food, the sights and the birth control.  
    
            She was was pleasantly surprised to find that in Hong Kong, she could get oral contraceptives at her neighborhood drugstore without a prescription.  
    
            “My jaw probably dropped the first time I did it. I just walked in and kind of looked around and was like ‘is this really happening?’ ” said Pace, 34. “It’s like buying aspirin.”  
    
            For years, medical organizations have fought to have over-the-counter birth control pills in the US, too.  
    
            On Tuesday and Wednesday, a group of external advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration will discuss an application from a pharmaceutical company to put their prescription birth control pill over-the-counter.  
    
            Although professional organizations including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support over-the-counter sales of the drug, called Opill, the FDA seems skeptical, citing a list of concerns in a 130-page document posted online Friday.  
    
            “I am worried” about the FDA’s decision, said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  
    
            The FDA scientists say they have two main concerns about Opill, a “mini pill” that uses only the hormone progestin. 
    
            One has to do with obesity. The FDA approved Opill as a prescription drug in 1973, and “the prevalence of obesity in adults in the United States has changed dramatically since the original clinical studies were conducted over 50 years ago,” the scientists wrote in the document, citing a 13% obesity rate in 1960 compared with a 42% obesity rate now.  
    
            “The degree to which efficacy of [Opill] is diminished in individuals who are overweight or obese (which together now represent approximately 60% of the U.S. reproductive-aged population … ) remains unknown,” they added.
    
            The agency cited a 2016 report analyzing data from four studies that suggested women who were obese had an increased risk of pregnancy after taking emergency contraception. The data in those four studies was “limited and poor to fair quality,” the authors wrote. 
    
            Brandi said she was surprised by the FDA’s statements.  
    
            In a practice document for its members, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists cites several studies showing that “women with obesity can be offered all hormonal contraceptive method options with reassurance that the efficacy of hormonal contraception is not significantly affected by weight.”  
    
            Brandi, an obstetrician-gynecologist in New Jersey, noted that even though obesity has been on the rise, there has not been a higher rate of failure for birth control pills.  
    
            The FDA scientists were also concerned that studies by Perrigo, the company that manufactures Opill, showed some women didn’t follow the label instructions. They said some women in the study didn’t take the pill within the same three-hour window every day, which is important for efficacy.  
    
             But Brandi said even when doctors prescribe pills, patients don’t always take them properly all the time.  
    
            “They make mistakes, and we know that,” she said. “People are humans, and that’s OK.”  
    
            The Opill label tells women that if they’re more than three hours late taking their pill, they should take a pill as soon as they remember and use an additional form of birth control, such as a condom, for two days.
    
            “I trust patients that they’ll be able to read the instructions and follow the instructions and be able to use the medication safely and effectively,” Brandi said. “I don’t worry, because I trust women. I trust my patients.”  
    
            In a statement, Perrigo said that “data from our eight year development program show that consumers can use Opill safely and effectively as guided by the proposed labelling.”  
    
            The FDA also expressed concern that without counseling from a doctor, women might not realize when Opill wasn’t appropriate for them.
    
            For example, the Opill label states that the drug should not be used by women with a history of breast cancer. But when 205 study subjects with a history of breast cancer read the label, six of them said the pill was right for them.
    
            Women with undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding also are not supposed to use Opill, but in a study, more than half of those with this condition said the pill was appropriate for them.
    
            The FDA is under pressure to allow Opill to go over-the-counter from elected officials as well as health-care providers.  
    
            Unwanted pregnancies are a public health issue in the US, where almost half of all pregnancies are unintended, according to the FDA briefing document, and rates are especially high among lower-income women, Black women and those who haven’t completed high school.  
    
            In March 2022, 59 members of Congress wrote a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf about OTC contraception.  
    
            “This is a critical issue for reproductive health, rights, and justice. Despite decades of proven safety and effectiveness, people still face immense barriers to getting birth control due to systemic inequities in our healthcare system,” the lawmakers wrote.  
    
            Califf responded that the FDA “acknowledges the public health benefits of increased access to oral contraceptives” and that “the Agency’s decision making is guided by the best available science.”  
    
            The FDA advisers are expected to vote Wednesday on whether to recommend that the agency approve Opill going over-the-counter. The agency often follows the recommendations of its advisers but doesn’t always do so.

      House Democrat’s bill is latest proposal aimed at alleged judge-shopping in abortion pill case
    ","

    ","
            A Democratic lawmaker is putting forward the latest effort to tackle so-called judge-shopping – a tactic recently used by foes of the Biden administration to obtain nationwide injunctions on federal policies by filing legal challenges in single-judge courthouses, essentially allowing them to pick who hears their case. 
    
            House Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey on Tuesday rolled out a bill that would require any civil lawsuit seeking a court order that would apply nationwide be filed in a judicial district where there are two or more active judges assigned to hear cases. It’s the second Democratic legislative proposal in recent weeks to address the trend.
    
            The “forum-shopping” strategy used by litigants – on both the left and the right – to file lawsuits in courtrooms where the case is likely to be assigned to a sympathetic judge is not a new strategy. 
    
            But the practice has escalated in the legal battles over President Joe Biden’s agenda as conservatives have focused on judicial divisions – several of them in Texas – where just one judge hears all or most of the cases filed there. 
    
            The lawsuit brought by anti-abortion doctors to challenge the federal government’s approval of medication abortion drugs is perhaps the most prominent recent example. 
    
            One of the groups behind the case, weeks before their lawsuit was filed, incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, where US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk hears all of the lawsuits filed in that federal court. Kacsmaryk agreed with the plaintiffs and sought to cut off nationwide access to the abortion drug, only to have his order paused by the Supreme Court.
    
            The challengers’ lawyer has denied to CNN that they engaged in judge-shopping. Still, the case prompted Sherrill to draft the judge-shopping legislation. 
    
            “You read his opinion and, and it’s not a very well informed one,” Sherrill told CNN. “So to think that conservatives could drive cases to this one judge, and this one extremist court, doesn’t feel like justice.” 
    
            Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has also apparently embraced the tactic. His office – sometimes joined by Republican attorneys general from other states – has filed at least a half dozen lawsuits in the Amarillo division, which is in a far-flung area of northern Texas far from the state’s capital. Paxton’s office also has funneled much of its litigation against the Biden administration through the Victoria, Texas, division, where Judge Drew Tipton is all but guaranteed to hear the civil cases brought there. 
    
            Kacsmaryk and Tipton are Donald Trump appointees who have now issued several rulings against Biden policies, including in challenges to multiple aspects of the president’s immigration agenda. 
    
            In one such immigration case, where the Justice Department tried unsuccessfully to object to Texas’ choice of venue, a lawyer for Paxton’s office admitted they had purposefully filed the lawsuit in Victoria, Texas, in order to get it in front of Tipton, pointing to the judge’s familiarity with other immigration-related litigation.
    
            According to a February DOJ filing in that case, the Texas attorney general has filed at least 18 lawsuits against the federal government “in Divisions where the case would necessarily be assigned to a single, pre-determined judge.” 
    
             Sherrill’s proposal follows a measure from Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. That bill, introduced last month, targets the practice by requiring that civil lawsuits seeking nationwide court orders go through the federal district court in Washington, DC. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin told CNN last month he wanted to take a look at Hirono’s judge-shopping bill. 
    
            “That’s clearly what’s going on in Amarillo, Texas,” said Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.
    
            It’s unclear what kind of traction either measure will get in Congress, with Republicans controlling the House. Nevertheless, the proposals spotlight a source of frustration for the Biden administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote an April 27 letter to the Judge David Godbey – the chief judge of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, under which the Amarillo division sits – calling on him to rework the system by which cases are assigned there. 
    
            Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan has also referenced the practice, alluding to it during oral arguments in a Texas lawsuit against a Biden immigration policy last fall, as she grilled a lawyer for Texas on whether the immigration policy was inflicting the kind of harm on the state that warranted judicial intervention. 
    
            She noted that “in Texas, there are divisions within districts. You can pick your trial court judge.” 
    
            “You know, you play by the rules, that’s fine, but you pick your trial court judge,” Kagan added. The case, which was originally filed in the Victoria division, has not yet been decided by the Supreme Court.
    
            The Justice Department has tried to push back against the strategy in court, by filing requests to move some of the lawsuits brought by Texas against Biden policies out of courthouses where just one or two judges hear all of the cases. 
    
            Kacsmaryk and Tipton both rejected such requests. A third judge, US District Judge James Wesley Hendrix – who hears two-thirds of lawsuits filed in Lubbock, Texas – is still weighing a DOJ bid to move a lawsuit challenging last year’s federal appropriations bill to either the federal court in Washington or in Austin.

      Women should start screening for breast cancer at age 40 instead of 50, health task force says in draft recommendation
    ","

    ","
            The US Preventive Services Task Force is proposing that all women at average risk of breast cancer start screening at age 40 to reduce their risk of dying from the disease, according to a new draft recommendation statement.
    
            It’s an update to the 2016 recommendation, in which the task force recommended that biennial mammograms, which are x-rays of the breasts, start at age 50 and that the decision for women to screen in their 40s “should be an individual one.”
    
            Some groups, such as the American Cancer Society, already have been recommending for women to start mammograms in their 40s.
    
            “Our new task force recommendation is recommending that women start screening with mammography for breast cancer at age 40 and screen every other year until age 74,” said USPSTF Vice Chair Dr. Wanda Nicholson, a senior associate dean and professor at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.  
    
            The USPSTF, a group of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide doctors’ decisions and influence insurance plans, released the proposed update to its breast cancer screening guidance Tuesday. The recommendation is not final but will be available on the task force website for public comment through June 5, along with a draft evidence review and draft modeling report.
    
            The draft recommendation is for all people assigned female at birth, including cisgender women, trans men and nonbinary people, who are at average risk for breast cancer.
    
            Nicholson said that women with dense breasts and those with a family history of cancer generally fall into this category but not women who have a personal history of breast cancer or a family history of genetic mutations, like mutations on the BRCA gene, as they are considered to be at high risk.
    
            The updates would not apply to those at an increased risk of breast cancer, who may already have been encouraged to screen at 40 or earlier. They should continue to follow the screening practices that their doctors have recommended.
    
            Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States, and rates of death are highest among Black women.
    
            The update to the recommendation “will save more lives among all women,” Nicholson said. “And this is particularly important for Black women, who are 40% more likely to die from breast cancer.”
    
            The draft recommendation comes a few weeks after a study in the journal JAMA Network Open found that the rate of breast cancer deaths among women in their 40s was 27 per 100,000 person-years for Black women, compared with 15 deaths per 100,000 in White women and 11 deaths per 100,000 in American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander women. The researchers suggested that Black women start screening at younger ages, around 42 instead of 50.
    
            The USPSTF members are calling for more research into these racial inequities in breast cancer, Nicholson said, and for all women who get abnormal mammogram results to receive equitable follow-up evaluations, additional testing, biopsies and treatment when needed.
    
            “Screening alone is not enough. Once someone screens with an abnormal mammogram, the subsequent steps in care must occur – timely follow-up, biopsies that are indicated – and Black women must have access to equitable treatment,” she said.  
    
            “We’re calling for more research to look across the health systems as to why these inequities occur,” she said, adding that the draft recommendation also calls for more research into whether women with dense breasts should get additional screening and among “women who are 75 years of age and older, whether and how to screen that population.” 
    
            To review and update breast cancer screening guidance, the task force members analyzed data from thousands of study abstracts and hundreds of research papers on screening programs, cancer cases and deaths in the United States.
    
            They found that screening with mammograms every other year provided a moderate benefit to women ages 40 to 74, as the benefits, such as detecting cancer early, outweigh potential harms, such as the risk of a false positive that could lead to unnecessary tests and emotional stress.
    
            The evidence is “insufficient” to determine the risks and benefits for screening in women 75 and older, the group determined.
    
            The task force also noticed that the rate of breast cancer diagnoses has been rising each year among women at younger ages. 
    
            Population-based data “showed that the rate of breast cancer diagnoses was increasing at 2% annually since 2015. So more women than ever before are being diagnosed in their 40s,” Nicholson said. 
    
            An estimated 12.9% of women born in the United States today will develop breast cancer at some time during their lives, according to the National Cancer Institute.
    
            “Within our recommendation, we’re calling for more research to have a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms that may be contributing to breast cancer development in all women, and in particular among Black women,” she said. “We know that Black women continue to have more aggressive tumors.”
    
            A paper published in October in the journal Nature suggests that the incidence of various cancers diagnosed in adults 50 and younger has been rising in many parts of the world since the 1990s.
    
            “The rising incidence of early-onset cancers is probably partially attributable to increasing uptake of screening and early detection before the age of 50 years, to variable degrees across certain cancer types, especially breast, prostate and thyroid cancers,” the researchers wrote. 
    
            “However, increasing incidence of early-onset cancers in several organs, such as colorectal and pancreatic cancers, which might not be fully explained by screening is also apparent,” the researchers wrote. “This trend could reflect increased risk factor exposures in early life and/or young adulthood.”
    
            The draft recommendation appears to be catching up with what other organizations have been recommending for some time.
    
            It aligns more closely – but not entirely – with American Cancer Society recommendations that women ages 40 to 44 have the option to screen with a mammogram every year, women 45 to 55 get mammograms every year, and women 55 and older can switch to a schedule of mammograms every other year. 
    
            “There are some similarities and some differences. So, now, the new task force recommendations has changed from screening at age 50 to age 40. And our recommendations currently are that women should begin to have the opportunity to begin annual screening if they choose beginning at age 40. The big difference there is, we recommend annual screening at that age, while the task force recommends biennial screening,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the USPSTF draft recommendation.
    
            “But the big thing is, I think, a lot of women were being screened probably starting in their 40s, and so this is consistent, I think, with how most women and practitioners have been looking at screening,” he said. 
    
            Both the USPSTF and the American Cancer Society recommendations are for women at average risk. Dahut said that women should talk to their doctors about whether they might have a higher risk for breast cancer and what screening practices would be best for them, including factors like a family history of ovarian or breast cancer or dense breasts, which have less fatty tissue and more connective tissue and have been associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.
    
            “The change in guidelines by the USPSTF to endorse screening mammograms for average risk women 40 and over is warranted, incorporates more modern and ‘real world’ data into the science informing the guidelines and will hopefully prompt payers to provide better coverage for women seeking breast cancer screening,” Dr. Laura Dominici, a breast cancer surgeon at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center, said in an emailed statement. She was not involved in the USPSTF draft recommendation.
    
            “This is particularly important related to racial disparities in screening, as Black women are more likely to develop aggressive cancers at younger ages, contributing to worse outcomes,” Dominici said. “I am glad to see inequities in screening being acknowledged, but more attention to this will be needed in future guidelines.”
    
            Still, the new draft recommendation will not change how Dr. Maxine Jochelson discusses breast cancer risks and the important of screening with her patients, she said.
    
            “Unfortunately, the fact that they’re still recommending every other year rather than yearly screening, and in particular in the younger population, is very disappointing,” said Jochelson, chief of the breast imaging service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who was not involved in the USPSTF draft recommendation. 
    
            “You are going to miss earlier cancers if you’re waiting longer, and younger women and Black women often have more aggressive cancer,” she said. “I’m going to still tell them to have yearly screening.”

      Analysis: Three experts explain America’s gun politics
    ","
			Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN

    ","
            At this point, it’s no surprise that there’s been another mass shooting in America.
    
            The latest tragedy came in Allen, Texas, on Saturday when a gunman opened fire on shoppers at an outlet mall. It was another horrific attack on people simply going about their lives, whether at shops, a bank, parties, schools, places of worship or even at their own homes.
    
            After every shooting, the political rituals are the same. Republicans who have harnessed their party to activists who want to loosen gun laws offer prayers for the victims and talk vaguely about a mental health crisis. Democrats demand more gun control and a ban on fast-firing assault weapons that can kill multiple people in seconds.
    
            But nothing ever changes.
    
            Is there any way out of this endless cycle of death? Or is the political system simply too deadlocked — even though majorities of Americans in most polls favor some kind of reform to gun laws.
    
            Meanwhile asked three expert contributors from CNN’s “Guns in America” unit about the implications of the latest horror and the state of guns politics in the country.
    
            Jennifer Mascia is a senior news writer with “The Trace,” an independent news operation dedicated to covering America’s gun violence epidemic.
    
            Meanwhile: Some state officials in pro-gun Texas have argued that since mass shootings also occur in liberal states with tighter gun laws, more restrictions would be not work. Is this true?
    
            Mass shootings do occur in states with tight gun laws, as we saw with Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay in California earlier this year. But the states with the loosest gun laws still tend to have higher rates of gun death.
    
            According to the most recent CDC figures, the states with the lowest rates of gun death (which includes both homicides and suicides) are Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island; California is 8th. Those states all have gun owner licensing, which means you must get a license or permit before you can even buy a gun. That process typically involves a thorough background check, interviews with law enforcement, character references, mandatory firearm training, and fingerprints. Gun owner licensing, also referred to as permit-to-purchase, is considered the most effective policy at reducing gun deaths.
    
            Meanwhile: What are the states with the most deaths from firearms?
    
            The states with the highest rates of gun death are Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Alabama, and Wyoming; Texas is 28th. With the exception of New Mexico, all of those states (including Texas) have enacted permitless carry, meaning gun owners are not required to get a license or undergo training in order to carry a concealed gun in public. There are 27 permitless carry states now, and studies have shown that gun violence rises after states loosen concealed carry requirements. A study last year from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that the average rate of gun assaults rose 9.5% in the first decade after 34 states relaxed their concealed carry restrictions. Missouri provides an interesting case study: Until 2007, the state required permits to purchase guns, like Massachusetts, California, and a dozen other states do. In the five years after permit-to-purchase was repealed, the murder rate rose 14%, one study found. Missouri further loosened its gun laws, enacting permitless carry in 2017. In 2019, the Kansas City Star found that the firearm death rate in Missouri had risen 58% since 2007, when the state eliminated permit-to-purchase.
    
            Meanwhile: How does the US compare to the rest of the world?
    
            Bottom line: In terms of gun violence, you’re safer in California than you are in Texas. But you’re still safer in other countries than you are in California. That’s because, to quote UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, “California has the strictest gun laws in the US but some of the loosest, most permissive gun laws in the industrialized world.” And that explains why California still has mass shootings: Our strongest gun laws are still no match for those in Canada, the UK, Japan, Switzerland, or Israel, among others. Those countries are very careful who they allow to have guns and the screening process lasts many months. The only system that’s comparable is New York City’s gun permitting process, which is overseen by the NYPD.
    
            Abené Clayton is the lead reporter for The Guardian’s “Guns and Lies in America” team
    
            Meanwhile: Texas officials seemed to be very loath to offer many specific details about the mass shooting at the shopping mall. What is going on here?
    
            I believe that Texas—and most officials who are staunch gun rights and Second Amendment protectors—are working overtime to put distance between guns and the violence that we saw this weekend and continue to see daily. I believe that in addition to wanting to keep their voter base happy, many officials are genuinely afraid of armed resistance from extremists who own guns and are willing to die or create chaos if there is even a hint that there will be limitations put on gun ownership and retention.
    
            I also think that the lack of acknowledgment of broader issues of gun violence is meant to maintain the narrative that mass shootings are the result of spiritual warfare or innate evil. Conveniently for officials, neither of these factors can be legislated so it gives them the opportunity to point to a reason for shootings but take no accountability for supporting and creating solutions that will keep people safe.
    
            Meanwhile: If local state officials won’t enact measures to stop massacres – or at least try to – what are their obligations for example in doing something meaningful to address mental health problems that they always cite – or to help mitigate the trauma of the victims?
    
            There are federal and some state victim assistance programs specifically geared toward people of mass violence and terrorism. (…) I think that state officials need to support, empower, and uplift survivors of mass shootings even though some become politically activated around issues—like red flag laws and assault weapon bans—that may not be palatable for right-leaning legislators’ bases.
    
            Politicians like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — both Republicans — and all the local and state officials that refuse to have good faith arguments about gun violence prevention solutions (outside of more police and school hardening) need to at minimum show genuine care to the people who lose loved ones and are irreparably injured following a shooting.
    
            Stephen Gutowski founded the “The Reload” — a subscriber publication set up to provide sober, informed reporting on gun ownership in the United States.
    
            Meanwhile: Is there any chance that the country’s fractured politics can produce anything to stop this cycle of shootings?
    
            There is broad agreement that more needs to be done to prevent mass shootings. The problem is that there’s little agreement between the parties on how to do that. Democrats generally favor broad gun restrictions and bans. Republicans generally favor stricter enforcement of current gun laws and mental health intervention. There is likely some crossover on either point among voters but little among their elected representatives.
    
            If these high-profile killings continue to increase, and they are happening at a record pace this year regardless of what count you look at, it could increase pressure for new gun restrictions. That’s what led to last year’s federal gun-control law. But there’s little reason to think it could result in a new national ban on AR-15s or other firearms because there is no support for that among congressional Republicans, and there is unlikely to be even 50 votes for it in the Senate since some Democrats also oppose a ban.
    
            Meanwhile: Where is the action to watch on gun policy legislation?
    
            State-level policy is becoming increasingly polarized based on the prevailing politics in each state. Red states are focused on reducing attacks by making it easier for law-abiding citizens to obtain and carry guns. Blue states have turned increasingly to bans on “assault weapons” and ammunition magazines that hold a certain amount of ammunition. “Red Flag” laws that allow officials to temporarily seize guns from people determined by a judge to be a threat to themselves or others have mostly caught on in Democratic strongholds.
    
            But Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee is attempting to address some of those concerns in a new proposal the Republican-controlled legislature is set to debate in a special session. If they can craft a policy addressing gun rights advocates’ concerns, that could create momentum for the policy in other states. That makes this gun policy debate the most noteworthy at the moment.

      Three GOP appointees, including 2 from Trump, will hear the next phase of major abortion pill case

    ","
            The New Orleans-based appeals court panel that will oversee the next stage in the blockbuster legal challenge to the availability of medication abortion drugs is made up of three Republican appointees, including one Trump nominee who has called abortion a “moral tragedy.”
    
            Circuit Judges James Ho and Cory Wilson, both Trump nominees, will hear the oral arguments on May 17, alongside Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod, an appointee of George W. Bush.
    
            The lawsuit was brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations who allege the US Food and Drug Administration broke the law when it approved the medication abortion drug mifepristone more than two decades ago.
    
            Last month, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk agreed with their arguments and ruled that the approval of the drug should be suspended. 
    
            However, his ruling was put on hold by the Supreme Court on April 21 and it will remain on hold until the case goes back to the high court, regardless of how the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals rules on the merits.
    
            Ho, a former Texas solicitor general, is considered one of the most conservative and strident members of the 5th Circuit, having described abortion as a “moral tragedy” in a 2018 concurring opinion.
    
            In a 2019 concurring opinion, Ho also said that a trial judge’s ruling – which struck down a 15-week abortion ban and which was affirmed by the 5th Circuit under the then-standing Roe precedent – displayed “an alarming disrespect for the millions of Americans who believe that babies deserve legal protection during pregnancy as well as after birth, and that abortion is the immoral, tragic, and violent taking of innocent human life.”
    
            The 5th Circuit is considered one of the most conservative in the country has consistently ruled against the Biden Justice Department.
    
            Wilson earlier this year wrote a majority circuit opinion that said that a federal law that bars gun ownership by people under domestic violence was unconstitutional. 
    
            Elrod penned an opinion last month that struck down the federal ban on bump stocks, which are attachments that essentially allow shooters to fire semiautomatic rifles continuously with one pull of the trigger.
    
            The medication abortion case is another hugely consequential case to go through the circuit. Mifepristone – the drug being targeted in the lawsuit – is the first pill in the two-pill regimen for terminating a pregnancy. Medication abortion makes up more than half of all abortions obtained in the United States.
    
            In filings last week, the Justice Department told the 5th Circuit that Kacsmaryk’s conclusions that the drug was unsafe rested “on a series of fundamental errors.”
    
            “While FDA justified its scientific conclusions in multiple detailed reviews, including a medical review spanning more than 100 pages and assessing dozens of studies and other scientific information, the district court swept the agency’s judgments aside by substituting its own lay understanding of purportedly contrary studies, offering demonstrably erroneous characterizations of the record,” the DOJ’s filing said. 
    
            The department’s opponents in the case will file a response later on Monday.

      Montana governor signs slate of bills restricting abortion rights

    ","
            Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed on Wednesday a collection of bills restricting access to abortion, triggering legal action and challenging a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling on the procedure. 
    
            While abortion remains legal in Montana, the legislation specifies that access to the procedure until viability is no longer protected under the right of privacy in the state’s constitution – contradicting the court’s two decades old ruling. 
    
            “For years in Montana, abortion activists have used the cloak of a shaky legal interpretation to advance their pro-abortion agenda. That stops today,” Gianforte said in a statement Wednesday, describing the new laws as “giving a voice to the voiceless.”
    
            The restrictions come as states navigate a new abortion landscape in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, which removed federal abortion protections. Several Republican-led states have enacted restrictions, while some Democratic-led states have passed legislation expanding access to their residents and those seeking care from other states.
    
            One of the new laws Gianforte signed Wednesday establishes a “right of conscience” that allows health care providers or institutions to refuse to perform abortions if it violates their “ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or principles.” 
    
            Another bill, HB625, signed by Gianforte Wednesday, requires health care providers, in the rare case a baby is born alive after an attempted abortion, to give care to the infant or face fines and imprisonment. However, it is already considered homicide in the US to intentionally kill an infant that is born alive.
    
            While Gianforte said that the slate of “pro-family, pro-child, pro-life bills will make a lasting difference in Montana,” Democrats and abortion rights advocates argue that the new laws add “unnecessary” provisions to restrict access. 
    
            Abortion rights advocates secured a preliminary victory Thursday, with a Montana judge temporarily blocking one measure, HB575, that would require a patient to have an ultrasound and get a written determination of viability from a provider in order to get an abortion. 
    
            The state’s Planned Parenthood chapter had filed an emergency relief request Wednesday after the provision took effect, arguing that requiring an ultrasound before a procedure effectively bans telehealth medication abortion. Such procedures have surged since the Supreme Court’s ruling on abortion last summer. 
    
            “Instead of trusting us to make our own decisions about our bodies and lives, Montana lawmakers are once again forcing their way into our exam rooms and blocking our access to essential health care,” said Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana.   
    
            “By adding unnecessary and burdensome red tape to a safe and legal medical procedure, these politicians have made clear that it was never about our health and safety,” Fuller said in a statement Wednesday. “It was always about undermining our personal freedom and shaming people who seek abortions.” 
    
            This move is one of several legal battles related to reproductive rights playing out in state and federal courts. Near-total abortion bans in Indiana and Ohio remain in limbo after judges issued orders halting the restrictions.

      North Carolina advances likely veto-proof abortion ban to governor’s desk

            North Carolina’s Republican-controlled state Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would ban most abortions after 12 weeks.
    
            Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has vowed to veto the bill, but the GOP supermajority in the legislature can override him.
    
            The measure sped through the legislature this week, passing both chambers on party-line votes less than 48 hours after being introduced. The state House had advanced the bill on Wednesday after it was introduced Tuesday night.
    
            Cooper has previously said he plans to veto the “extreme” legislation, but if all members vote along party lines, North Carolina’s Republican state legislators have enough votes in both chambers to override any veto from Cooper.
    
            North Carolina Republicans gained a veto-proof supermajority last month when then-Democratic state Rep. Tricia Cotham switched parties. Cotham, who campaigned in favor of abortion rights as a Democrat, voted for the bill. She also sponsored legislation earlier this session to codify Roe v. Wade.  
    
            In March, the state legislature overrode the governor’s veto on a bill that now makes it legal to purchase a gun without a permit in the state. 
    
            Cooper doubled down on his promise to veto the abortion ban in a video statement posted to Twitter Thursday and called on a handful of Republicans, including Cotham, to keep their campaign promises.
    
            “A number of them promised their constituents that they would protect women’s reproductive rights,” Cooper told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Thursday evening. “We want to hold them to these promises.” 
    
            “This is the kind of thing that happens when you let right-wing politicians into the exam room with women and their doctors,” he said, adding that “we’re going to work the next few days to make sure that we have a Republican that will stand up and vote.”
    
            CNN has reached out to the state House speaker’s office for comment.   
    
            Senate Bill 20, dubbed the “Care for Women, Children and Families Act,” would ban any licensed physician from performing surgical abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It would provide exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks. Under the bill, the procedure could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines an abortion is necessary to avert death – “not including psychological or emotional conditions.”
    
            Under current state law, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. A reduction to 12 weeks would be significant but less restrictive than some other GOP-led states that have recently enacted six-week or near-total bans on the procedure.
    
            Additionally, the bill would prohibit any health care provider who objects to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.
    
            “The refusal of a physician, nurse, or health care provider to perform or participate in these medical procedures shall not be a basis for damages for the refusal or for any disciplinary or any other recriminatory action against the physician, nurse, or health care provider,” it states.
    
            It also calls for in-person examination by physicians seeking to prescribe or administer abortion-inducing drugs and would prohibit people within the state from mailing such drugs to a pregnant woman. The bill would mandate that doctors confirm that the “probable gestational age” of a fetus is no more than ten weeks, before they can sign off on a medication abortion.
    
            This comes as a legal battle over mifepristone, one drug used in many nonsurgical abortions, looms over the US Supreme Court. North Carolina’s proposed legislation also includes significant new penalties for doctors who do not adhere to the new rules.
    
            North Carolina had been a haven for women seeking abortion care as Southern states tightened restrictions after the Supreme Court sent the issue of abortion rights back to the states. 
    
            Democratic leaders across the state had spoken out against the bill and, like Cooper, said it was too extreme. 
    
            US Rep. Deborah Ross said the bill was “extreme and out of touch with the needs of women and the will of the people” of the Tar Heel state. 
    
            The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has praised the legislation, saying it will “lessen abortion tourism in the state.”

      Doctors performed brain surgery on a baby before she was born and now she’s thriving
    ","

    ","
            A team of doctors in Boston successfully performed a novel fetal surgery to treat a rare brain condition known as vein of Galen malformation. 
    
            Although in utero surgery – performed before a baby is born – has been used for other conditions, this ultrasound-guided procedure was among the first for this condition. Details of the procedure, which took place in March, were published in the journal Stroke on Thursday.  
    
            The condition occurs when the blood vessel that carries blood from the brain to the heart, also known as the vein of Galen, doesn’t develop correctly. The malformation, known as VOGM, results in an overwhelming amount of blood stressing the vein and heart and can lead to a cascade of health problems.
    
            “Tremendous brain injuries and immediate heart failure after birth are the two big challenges,” Dr. Darren Orbach, a radiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and expert in treating VOGM, told CNN. 
    
            Typically, infants are treated after they’re born using a catheter to insert tiny coils to slow down blood flow. However, Orbach said, the treatment often happens too late.
    
            Despite advancements in care, “50 to 60 percent of all babies with this condition will get very sick immediately. And for those, it looks like there’s about a 40 percent mortality,” Orbach said. About half of infants that survive experience severe neurological and cognitive issues, he said.
    
            When they learned of their fourth pregnancy, Derek and Kenyatta Coleman of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were surprised and excited. Kenyatta, 36, and Derek, 39, have been married for seven years and were ready to welcome a new addition to their family. 
    
            Kenyatta said nothing seemed particularly notable about the pregnancy. After having three children, Kenyatta thought of ultrasounds as routine appointments.
    
            “Baby was doing well. The anatomy scan came back unremarkable. All of her biophysical profiles were all unremarkable,” said Kenyatta, who spoke to CNN exclusively.  
    
            The Colemans even did genetic testing that characterized Kenyatta’s pregnancy as “low risk,” she said: “We honestly thought that we were in the clear.”
    
            But when Kenyatta went for an ultrasound at 30 weeks into her pregnancy, something was different. She remembers her doctor sitting her down and saying she was worried.
    
            “She shared with me that something wasn’t right in terms of the baby’s brain and also her heart was enlarged,” Kenyatta remembers. 
    
            After more investigation, there was a diagnosis: VOGM. 
    
            But the Colemans had learned about a clinical trial run by Brigham and Women’s and Boston Children’s hospitals that could provide treatment before their baby was born.
    
            Kenyatta remembers being told about the possible risks – preterm labor, or brain hemorrhage for the fetus – but the Colemans felt there was no other option for them. They wanted to join the trial. 
    
            On March 15, exactly one month after the ultrasound that spotted the malformation, Kenyatta underwent surgery.
    
            But for this surgery, there were two patients: Kenyatta and her baby.
    
            Doctors had to make sure the fetus was facing the right position, with its head facing the mother’s abdominal wall. Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, division director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Reproductive Genetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, partnered with Orbach to make sure that the fetus was not only in the right position for the procedure, but stayed there. 
    
            Wilkins-Haug explained they used a technique borrowed from previous in utero cardiac surgeries. Once the fetus is in the optimal position, it “gets a small injection of medication so that it’s not moving and it is also getting a small injection of medication for pain relief,” Wilkins-Haug said.
    
            From there, the doctors inserted a needle through the abdominal wall, carefully threading a catheter through the needle, so that the tiny metal coils can fill up the vein, slow the blood flow and reduce the pressure.
    
            The baby showed signs of improvement immediately, with scans showing decreased blood pressure in key areas.
    
            “It was exhilarating at the moment that we had technical success at doing the embolization,” said Orbach. 
    
            But success wasn’t defined by that moment alone, but rather, what would follow. 
    
            “Will she be able to continuously show progress after? Will she need just additional support after I have her? Will she go into immediate heart failure still?” Kenyatta wondered. 
    
            After the procedure, Kenyatta was slowly leaking amniotic fluid. Two days later, she went into labor at 34 weeks. 
    
            On March 17, Denver Coleman was born, weighing 4 pounds and 1 ounce. 
    
            “I heard her cry for the first time and that just, I – I can’t even put into words how I felt at that moment,” remembers Kenyatta. 
    
            “It was just, you know, the most beautiful moment being able to hold her, gaze up on her and then hear her cry.”
    
            Her doctors were also pleased. “In the immediate new newborn period, she was very stable and didn’t need any of the immediate treatments that they typically need, whether it’s placing coils or whether it’s supporting her heart function with medications,” said Wilkins-Haug. “Our hope is that she won’t need any further coils placed.”
    
            Derek remembers visiting Denver for the first time in the neonatal intensive care unit and doctors asked if he wanted to kiss her. 
    
            “I gave her a kiss and she was just making little baby noises and stuff,” he said. “That was all I needed right there.”  
    
            Now, nearly two months after Denver was born, she continues to thrive, spending most of her time sleeping and eating. She’s not taking any medications for heart failure, and her neurological exam is normal. There’s no indication that she needs any additional interventions. 
    
            “She’s shown us from the very beginning that she was a fighter,” Kenyatta said, “she’s demonstrated … “Hey, I wanna be here.’ “

            Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore signed bills into law Wednesday that enshrine abortion rights and protect gender-affirming care. 
    
            “In our state, no one should ever have to justify their humanity,” Moore said at the signing. “In our state, no one should have to justify their own humanness.” 
    
            The governor’s approval comes as some Democratic-led states have enacted similar protections, while several state legislatures with a GOP majority have moved in the opposite direction to pass near-total bans on abortion and gender-affirming care for minors.
    
            “While other states are dead set on ripping away reproductive rights and attempting to erase the existence of trans and nonbinary individuals, we’re doing the opposite,” Lt. Governor Aruna Miller said in a statement. “We’re making Maryland a state that is welcoming, inclusive, and that safeguards the rights of all people.” 
    
            Along with enshrining abortion as a “fundamental right,” the new measures mandate public colleges and universities “develop and implement a reproductive health services plan,” which includes ensuring that students have access to over-the-counter contraceptives.
    
            Under one measure, judges are prohibited from requiring individuals to provide testimony or evidence in other states’ cases that allege a violation of criminal law for receiving or assisting with health care that is protected in Maryland. 
    
            Another measure regulates the disclosure of medical information to ensure that abortion procedures and care remain confidential. 
    
            At Wednesday’s signing, Moore sent a clear message about the state’s stance on reproductive care following the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, which removed federal abortion protections.  
    
            “I want to say to all the women who are out there who are wondering what will happen, who are worried about their future – please hear me loud and clear: Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access and abortion rights,” Moore said. 
    
            The governor also signed a bill that protects access to gender-affirming care by requiring Medicaid to provide coverage for such care in a “nondiscriminatory manner” starting January 1, 2024. 
    
            Gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender – the gender by which one wants to be known.
    
            While several states, including Minnesota and Colorado, have passed legislation protecting gender-affirming care, it has become a marquee issue within the GOP. More than 120 bills that target health care for transgender patients have been introduced nationwide this legislative session, according to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union.

      A man accused in fatal Florida shooting of 4 people killed after a standoff with police

            A man accused of killing a Florida mom and her three children was shot and killed by officers at a motel early Wednesday after an hours-long standoff with police, according to authorities. 
    
            A manhunt for 38-year-old Al Joseph Stenson was issued after police responding to a medical call Tuesday evening at a Lake Wales apartment complex found a woman and her three children, one adult and two juveniles, dead from apparent gunshot wounds, the Lake Wales Police Department said in a news release. 
    
            Stenson fled to a motel in Sanford, where his brother was staying, authorities said. 
    
            Once Stenson was located – by his vehicle outside the motel – the SWAT team took over negotiations, according to Seminole County Sheriff Dennis M. Lemma.
    
            Negotiations worked “so well,” that at one point the team was able to convince Stenson to exit the motel room.
    
            “We were able to take the brother to safety … and then the negotiations were continuing for hours,” Lemma said. “I mean, the last thing we want have to do is use lethal force. Ideally, we would like to talk somebody and bring them into custody.” 
    
            According to police, Stenson “made statements that he would kill himself or force law enforcement to kill him.”
    
            Ultimately, negotiators convinced Stenson to put a firearm that he was carrying down on the ground and step away from it. As he stepped away from that firearm, the SWAT team deployed a less lethal 40-millimeter foam projectile in an attempt to “neutralize the threat” and allow officers to apprehend the suspect, Lemma said.
    
            “We successfully deployed that, but it had little effect on the suspect, the sheriff said. “The suspect immediately went for the gun on the ground. And at this time, we don’t know if he actually picked the gun up, put it in his hand, but he was going for the firearm, when … three of our SWAT team members, one member of the specialized unit of the Sanford Police Department, opened fire, neutralizing the threat and the suspect is now deceased.” 
    
            A motive for the murders is not clear, however police said the victims were known to Stenson. 
    
            Stenson was being charged with four counts of first-degree murder.

      Opinion: When addressing maternal mortality, ‘we must leave no Black woman behind’
    ","

    ","
            In 2020, Dr. Chaniece Wallace, a pediatrician who was a chief resident at Indiana University School of Medicine, died just two days after giving birth to a daughter, Charlotte.
    
            Shamony Gibson studied at New York University and Medgar Evers College and died in 2019 just 13 days after giving birth to her second child.
    
            In 2017, Dr. Shalon Irving, who was an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a lieutenant commander in the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, died three weeks after giving birth after being ignored when returning to the hospital for care.
    
            In 2016 Kira Johnson, who had two degrees, spoke five languages and was the daughter-in-law of TV’s Judge Hatchett, bled to death after a routine C-Section in a Los Angeles hospital.
    
            These tragic deaths highlight what Black women have known for years: that being well-educated and well-resourced simply are not fully protective factors when it comes to maternal mortality and morbidity. Serena Williams’s near-death experience after giving birth only underscored that.
    
            In 2020, Black women in the US were 2.9 times more likely to die during or after childbirth than white women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More notably, a new study published in January showed that the wealthiest Black moms are more likely to die in childbirth than the poorest white moms. The study uses California administrative data to show how household income alone is not protective from racism’s impact on maternal and infant health outcomes. It is clear Black maternal mortality is not just a low-income problem.
    
            But a current wave of policy and advocacy work is primarily focused on reimbursing doulas and offering needed pregnancy-related services to Medicaid-eligible patients. Doulas, trained birth professionals who serve as educators and advocates to pregnant women, have been shown to be both protective, improving birth outcomes for Black women, but also cost-effective by reducing the hospital expense of preterm births and C-sections.
    
            In Oakland, the innovative Beloved Birth centering program with remarkable outcomes in reducing pre-term birth rates provides a doula, fitness trainer, chef-prepared meals for six weeks postpartum, a pregnancy photo shoot, midwifery-led prenatal visits, and a lactation consultant—but this comprehensive program is currently only available to Black women on Medical, the state’s Medicaid program. In New York City, the first free doula program is focused on marginalized zip codes.
    
            “Just because you are not Medicaid eligible does not mean you can fully afford a doula or any other birth professional that Black women need,” said Tracie Collins, CEO and Founder of the National Black Doula Association (NBDA) and host of the Healthy Girl podcast in an interview via email. “Too many Black women are falling in the gap.”
    
            Doulas are only one piece of a complicated puzzle that ultimately must include cultural change within medical institutions and systemic change overall. For years, much of the research into the rising Black maternal mortality rates treated Black women problematically – conflating income, education, and not getting prenatal care with high rates of preterm birth, low birthweight and maternal deaths.
    
            Now there is more research reflecting the underlying reality that regardless of educational attainment or related factors like income, Black women experience higher maternal mortality rates across the board. So why aren’t more policy and advocacy efforts focused on providing pregnancy and postpartum services for Black women across the economic spectrum?
    
            The misconception and narrative that Black maternal mortality rates are tied to income has already caused harm. Black women professionals, scientists and medical doctors have shared with me their near-death misses in childbirth; several of them also shared that they too considered themselves not at a high risk. “Many Black birthing folks reasoned ‘If the so-called research said the problem is being poor and unable to advocate for yourself and I’m not poor and am educated enough to advocate for myself then I will be ok,’ that’s false and dangerous thinking,” said Chanel Porchia-Albert, the founder and executive director of Ancient Song Doula Services, a Brooklyn-based organization that provides doula services to women of color and marginalized communities.
    
            In my travels advocating for Black and brown patient experience data as a critical tool for systemic change, I meet many middle-class Black women who are not Medicaid eligible but don’t make enough to afford the costs of a doula or at-home postpartum support. Some ask friends and family to chip in and I encourage them to put it on their baby registry as something others can contribute to. But the idea of burdening other family and friends often does not sit well with them, and not every community member thinks of a doula as necessary when a crib, diapers and other essentials are also needed.
    
            To be clear, efforts that focus on the needs of the under-resourced are critical. More than 3.3 million Black women, or one in four nationally, are covered by Medicaid.  According to the National Health Law Program’s Doula Medicaid Project, 11 state Medicaid programs currently reimburse doulas to a modest degree, and nearly a dozen are in some phase of the process to do so. This is an overdue recognition of the value of doulas and critical momentum to make sure they are accessible and paid a living wage.
    
            But Medicaid coverage alone is insufficient to meaningfully address the nation’s Black maternal mortality crisis. This approach is short-sighted and continues to promote a dangerous narrative that research and too much anecdotal evidence has already disproven. “Medicaid covers the majority of births in our community and other payers often follow Medicaid’s lead when it comes to improving payment and coverage so setting the tone within Medicaid makes sense, but it can’t be the end goal,” Dr. Nathan Chomilo, Medical Director for Minnesota’s Medicaid & MinnesotaCare program, told me.
    
            To improve the support Black birthing people receive, more commercial health plans should commit to reimbursing doulas as well. In Massachusetts, both the state Medicaid program known as MassHealth and private health plans are compelled to pay doulas who have met specified training and credentialing criteria.
    
            Employers also need to step up and are positioned to provide access more directly. “Sixty five percent of people who get health insurance from their employer are in a self-funded plan – meaning those employers have a direct financial stake, in addition to the personnel/workforce stake, in keeping employees, including Black women healthy,” Chomilo told me.
    
            The NBDA spearheaded a landmark partnership with Wal-Mart, one of the largest payers for pregnancy-related healthcare in the nation, to offer doula services as an employee benefit.
    
            Policymakers are paying long overdue attention to reducing high rates of mortality and morbidity among Black women. But they must go further to fully address the maternal mortality disparities by addressing racism and bias in care beyond mandating training for healthcare providers without accountability, pushing for cultural and systemic change within medical schools and health systems, funding midwifery care models and birth centers for low-risk pregnancies, and ensuring there is policy advocacy and change across the economic spectrum for Black women.
    
            “We are all at risk when we choose to see the issue of Black maternal health from one side,” said Porchia-Albert.
    
            In practice, principle, research, advocacy and messaging, we must leave no Black woman behind.

      North Carolina Republicans reach deal to limit most abortions after 12 weeks

    ","
            Republican lawmakers in the North Carolina General Assembly have reached a deal on legislation that would place restrictions on most abortions after 12 weeks.
    
            Assuming the agreement holds, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, who has worked to enshrine abortion rights, would be unable to block the legislation due to a veto-proof GOP supermajority in the state that was reached last month after a Charlotte-area Democrat switched parties.
    
            Senate Bill 20, dubbed the “Care for Women, Children and Families Act,” bans any licensed physician from performing surgical abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It provides exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks.
    
            Under current state law, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. A reduction to 12 weeks would be significant but less restrictive than some other GOP-led states that have recently enacted six-week or near-total bans on the procedure.
    
            The bill would additionally prohibit any health care provider who objects to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion. 
    
            “The refusal of a physician, nurse, or health care provider to perform or participate in these medical procedures shall not be a basis for damages for the refusal or for any disciplinary or any other recriminatory action against the physician, nurse, or health care provider,” it states.
    
            It also calls for in-person examination by physicians seeking to prescribe or administer abortion-inducing drugs and prohibits people within the state from mailing such drugs to a pregnant woman. This comes as a legal battle over mifepristone, one drug used in many nonsurgical abortions, looms over the US Supreme Court. 
    
            The House is expected to take up a final vote on the bill Wednesday and the Senate is expected to vote on Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WTVD.
    
            North Carolina has been a haven of sorts for women seeking abortion care as southern states tightened restrictions after the Supreme Court sent the issue of abortion rights back to the states. The anti-abortion lobbying group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America praised the legislative deal, saying it will “lessen abortion tourism in the state.”
    
            Democratic leaders across the state have spoken out in opposition of the bill. In a statement to WTVD, US Rep. Wiley Nickel of North Carolina said, “It’s unfortunate that once again, the Republican majority in Raleigh is pushing extreme restrictions on abortion and working to criminalize women’s health care decisions.”
    
            US Rep. Deborah Ross of North Carolina, a Democrat, said in a tweeted statement that the bill was “extreme and out of touch with the needs of women and the will of the people” of North Carolina.

      Because of Florida abortion laws, she carried her baby to term knowing he would die

            A Florida woman, unable to get an abortion in her state, carried to term a baby who had no kidneys.  
    
            Deborah Dorbert’s son Milo died in her arms on March 3, shortly after he was born, just as her doctors had predicted he would.  
    
            “He gasped for air a couple of times when I held him,” said Dorbert, 33. “I watched my child take his first breath, and I held him as he took his last one.”  
    
            She said her pregnancy was proceeding normally until November, when, at 24 weeks, an ultrasound showed that the fetus did not have kidneys and that she had hardly any amniotic fluid. Not only was the baby sure to die, her doctors told her, but the pregnancy put her at especially high risk of preeclampsia, a potentially deadly complication.  
    
            Her doctors told her it was too late to terminate the pregnancy in Florida, which bans nearly all abortions after 15 weeks. The only options were to go out of state to get an abortion or to carry the baby to full term, and Dorbert and her husband didn’t have the money to travel. 
    
            What followed was an agonizing 13 weeks of carrying a baby she knew would die and worrying about her own health. It left Dorbert with severe anxiety and depression for the first time in her life.  
    
            Florida law allows abortions after 15 weeks if two doctors confirm the diagnosis of a fatal fetal abnormality in writing, but doctors in Florida and states with similar laws have been hesitant to terminate such pregnancies for fear someone will question whether the abnormality was truly fatal. The penalties for violating the law are severe: Doctors can go to prison and face heavy fines and legal fees.   
    
            CNN reached out to Florida state Reps. Erin Grall and Jenna Persons-Mulicka, who co-sponsored the state’s 15-week ban, for comment on Dorbert’s situation.
    
            Grall did not respond. Persons-Mulicka sent a statement.  
    
            “The intent of the law is quite clear. We are providing mothers with the resources they need to raise healthy children, empowering doctors to help their patients make informed decisions, and shifting the conversation to valuing life,” she wrote. 
    
            Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law an even more restrictive measure that would ban most abortions in the state after six weeks, with an exception for fatal fetal abnormalities. The law won’t go into effect until the state Supreme Court overturns its precedent on abortion or tosses out a case challenging state abortion restrictions. 
    
            Deborah met Lee in 2014 while they were working at Publix in Lakeland, Florida, where she was a clerk and he was a team leader in the grocery department. They married three years later, and their son Kaiden was born a year after that.  
    
            Last year, the couple was thrilled when they found out they were going to have a second child. On the day before Thanksgiving, when she was 23 weeks pregnant, Dorbert brought Kaiden to an ultrasound appointment.  
    
            The 4-year-old was enthralled, looking at the screen and following along with the ultrasound technician as she pointed out the baby’s features.  
    
            “He’d go, ‘yeah, there’s the eye’ or ‘there’s the hand,’ ” Dorbert remembered. “He was excited that he could see the baby on the monitor.”  
    
            But abruptly, the technician stopped pointing at the screen and left the room to get the obstetrician.  
    
            Her obstetrician’s ultrasound report that day shows a grim diagnosis: There was no right kidney, and it was unclear whether there was a left kidney. In addition, the baby had too little amniotic fluid, and the heart was swollen. The obstetrician referred Dorbert to a high-risk pregnancy expert.  
    
            Because of the holiday, it took a week before the Dorberts could get in to see the specialist. They said a more detailed ultrasound at that appointment showed that the baby had no kidneys at all and that the lungs were under-developed.  
    
            The condition is called Potter syndrome, and the specialist said it was ” ‘incompatible with life,’ ” Deborah remembers. She says the doctor told her the baby would be stillborn or would die within minutes, or at most hours, after birth.  
    
            In this situation, doctors in states that allow abortions routinely give parents two options, according to Dr. Erika Werner, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts Medical Center and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.  
    
            One is to induce birth and, if the baby is born alive, offer comfort care until death. The other is to carry the baby to full term.  
    
            The Dorberts told the specialist that they wanted to induce birth, terminating the pregnancy, to spare the baby, themselves and their older son from suffering. They said the doctor agreed that this was a sound decision.  
    
            Dorbert says the doctor told her that in all the cases he’d seen, “that was always the outcome – someone’s baby went stillborn – and the ones that did deliver, the babies pass shortly after birth.”  
    
            But the doctor said he would need to check with his administration because of the Florida law that had gone into effect a few months before, banning most abortions after 15 weeks.  
    
            The law makes an exception if “two physicians certify in writing that, in reasonable medical judgment, the fetus has a fatal fetal abnormality,” which the law defines as “a terminal condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, regardless of the provision of life-saving medical treatment, is incompatible with life outside the womb and will result in death upon birth or imminently thereafter.”  
    
            About a month passed without a decision. Finally, Dorbert’s obstetrician informed her that she wouldn’t terminate the pregnancy. By this point, Dorbert was 27 weeks along.  
    
            Dr. Stephanie Ros, a high-risk pregnancy expert in Tampa and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said she’s not surprised that the doctor was unwilling to do the termination, considering that the law does not spell out exactly what would be considered a “terminal condition.” 
    
            “With health care, there are very few black-and-whites. There are so many things that are a little bit nuanced,” she said. “The moment the law came out, I think everyone was scrambling to try to figure out what exactly that language intended to convey.” 
    
            If a doctor is convicted of running afoul of the law, the penalties are severe: up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines, not to mention steep legal fees.  
    
            Ros, an associate professor at the University of South Florida, said that after the law was passed, she and colleagues at Florida academic medical centers wrote a list of conditions they considered fatal fetal abnormalities. Renal agenesis – the absence of kidneys – was on the list.  
    
            For that reason, she said, she would feel comfortable terminating a pregnancy with a fetus with this condition, but she “absolutely understands” why doctors who aren’t at academic medical centers, such as Dorbert’s obstetrician, would refuse.  
    
            “It’s tricky because of how this law was written in the first place,” she said.  
    
            In Dorbert’s situation, part of that trickiness has to do with the pregnancy 10 years ago of a woman she’s never met.  
    
            In 2012, Jaime Herrera Beutler, then a Republican US congresswoman from Washington state, found out she was pregnant with a baby who, like Dorbert’s, had Potter syndrome. The condition affects more than just the kidneys. Functioning kidneys produce amniotic fluid, which a fetus “breathes” into their lungs, and if there’s not enough of it, the lungs don’t develop properly.  
    
            In the womb, the baby can live with underdeveloped lungs because the placenta provides oxygen. But after birth, the baby is on their own.  
    
            During her pregnancy, Herrera Beutler and her husband, Dan, heard the baby’s heartbeat on an ultrasound.  
    
            “That’s pretty convincing. We know she’s still alive,” Dan Beutler told CNN in 2017. “We had this gut feeling of ‘there has to be something.’ ”  
    
            The couple sought out an experimental treatment at Johns Hopkins Medicine in which doctors transfused saline solution into the uterus to help mimic amniotic fluid. After a series of weekly infusions, their daughter, Abigail, was born 12 weeks prematurely. She survived on dialysis until she was big enough for a kidney transplant from her father. 
    
            In a 2019 essay in the Wall Street Journal, Herrera Beutler wrote that Abigail was a “healthy, happy big sister.”  
    
            “Through divine intervention and some courageous doctors we now have Abigail in our lives,” she wrote.  
    
            Herrera Beutler, now a strategic adviser to the Children’s Hospital Association, did not respond to requests for comment on this story.  
    
            Abigail’s parents have said she is the first baby without kidneys to survive childbirth. A 2014 Hopkins news release called Abigail’s survival “a medical marvel.”  
    
            In 2017, Hopkins and several other academic medical centers started a clinical trial to see how well the saline treatment worked.  
    
            In the study, 18 pregnant women whose fetuses did not have kidneys received uterine saline infusions. They went to the researchers one to three times a week, and each time, the doctors inserted a needle into their uterus for the procedure, which could take up to an hour. They made these visits for about 11 weeks.  
    
            Four of those 18 children are still alive, according to Dr. Jena Miller, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy and co-principal investigator of the study.  
    
            One baby was stillborn, and the other 17 were born prematurely and alive. Of those 17 babies, 14 survived to 2 weeks of age. Over the next two years, eight of those 14 children died without ever leaving the hospital.  
    
            The remaining six babies spent an average of about six months in the hospital and then went home. Two later died; the other four are on dialysis. None has received a kidney transplant.  
    
            Miller presented preliminary results from the study at a February meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.  
    
            She noted that in the study, even when babies did survive, they are “medically complex and have required multiple surgeries.”  
    
            “You’re subjecting parents to a very medically complex child, and for some families, they’re happy. They’re OK with doing that,” she said. “The family that chooses that, they’re all in for that. But it’s their choice to make. There are absolutely families that just do not have the resources or the capacity for that journey. They would not choose that journey for themselves or their child.”  
    
            By the time the Dorberts got the news that her doctors wouldn’t terminate Deborah’s pregnancy, she was 27 weeks along.
    
            As the baby grew, Dorbert started having terrible pain in her ribs and back, much worse than anything she’d experienced during her pregnancy with Kaiden. She says her obstetrician explained that without cushioning from the amniotic fluid, the baby had a more direct impact on her body.  
    
            Dorbert says they didn’t have the money to travel out of state to get an abortion. By this time, they’d left their jobs at Publix; she was doing Instacart deliveries, and Lee was working at an insurance company.  
    
            A few weeks later, at 31 weeks pregnant, she had a regular visit with her longtime family physician, Dr. David Berger.  
    
            She told him about how carrying a baby she knew would die had taken a terrible toll.  
    
            “I just got very depressed, and the anxiety was horrible. I just didn’t want to get out of bed most days. I would just break down crying,” Dorbert told CNN. “[I] just didn’t want to do anything but sit on the couch and cry.
    
            “I continued to feel this baby move,” she added, “knowing that I’m going to give birth and watch my child pass.”  
    
            Having to stay pregnant hurt not just her, she said, but also her husband and son.  
    
            “I really stepped back as a mom because I struggled,” she said. “He’s a 4-year-old boy, he wants to have fun, he wants to play, and he wants his mother to play with him.” But instead, she told Kaiden to watch TV as she lay on the couch.  
    
            Lee Dorbert said it was “painful for me to watch” his wife suffer, as there was “nothing I could really do besides just being there for her.”  
    
            Furious about what his patient was experiencing, with Deborah’s permission, Berger published videos on YouTube and TikTok on January 26 and more TikTok videos on February 2 and February 24.  
    
            “This brings me so much sorrow to see that a couple – or anybody – would have to go through something like this. In all honesty, it makes me embarrassed to be a Floridian,” Berger said in the YouTube video.  
    
            Viewers offered the Dorberts money to travel out of state to terminate the pregnancy. But the couple worried that they would get arrested.  
    
            Florida law doesn’t forbid such travel, but the Dorberts were concerned.  
    
            “The thing that scared us [was] we didn’t know if we’d go to jail. We didn’t know if we’d be fined. We still had another son. We couldn’t have anything happen to us, because we have another child,” Deborah said.  
    
            As the weeks passed, Kaiden watched his mother’s belly grow. At first somewhat indifferent to having a sibling, he began to warm up to the idea.  
    
            “As we continued to see my belly grow, he knew there was a baby in there,” she said. As he saw and felt the baby move, “he was getting excited. He’s like, ‘there’s a baby in your tummy!’ ”  
    
            Kaiden was so looking forward to meeting his little sister – they didn’t know the sex at the time, but he assumed it would be a girl – that he urged his mother to “just spit the baby out.” In his mind, he and the baby were already a team, and so when his parents urged him to pick up his toys or eat his vegetables or take a bath, he would say, “my sister told me I don’t have to do that.”  
    
            Unsure of what to tell Kaiden, the Dorberts consulted a therapist and decided it would easier on their son if they waited until just before the baby was born to let him know his sibling wasn’t coming home.  
    
            On February 18, a few weeks before she delivered, the Washington Post published a story about the Dorberts.  
    
            Deborah said it elicited one “hateful” letter, but she took some comfort from many “heartwarming” emails the Washington Post reporter forwarded her from readers who sent “their love and kindness.”  
    
            Once she got to 37 weeks, Dorbert’s obstetrician told her they could induce labor. The night before delivery, they told Kaiden that the baby had died, and he broke down crying.  
    
            The next day, after birth, Milo “looked more on the blue side. He gasped for air, and you could tell he was really trying hard to breathe,” Dorbert remembers.  
    
            His parents and Deborah’s parents cuddled him for 94 minutes before he took his last breath.  
    
            They were “making sure he felt loved, and he wasn’t in pain, even though I knew he was in pain,” Deborah said.  
    
            Lee sang to Milo “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley & The Wailers and read him the book “I’ll Love You Forever” about a polar bear cub – Kaiden’s favorite story.  
    
            “He didn’t open his eyes at all when we held him, and he passed away in my arms,” Deborah said.  
    
            Milo’s tiny hand- and footprints were taken and memorialized inside the front cover of the book.  
    
            She said she knows it would have been emotionally wrenching if the pregnancy had been terminated when her baby’s birth defect was first spotted, at 24 weeks. But being forced to carry the baby for 13 more weeks, knowing that he would die, made it even more horrific.  
    
            Those 13 weeks are what led to the anxiety and depression and debilitating back pain, she said, making it harder on her, Lee and Kaiden.  It was during those 13 weeks that Kaiden got so excited to have a new sibling, only to have that joy taken away.  
    
            She still suffers emotionally and physically from those 13 weeks, and it took a toll on her marriage.  
    
            She and Lee are now in marriage counseling. “We’re making small steps, but it’s going to take time,” she said.  
    
            Deborah is angry at the politicians whom she blames for forcing them to experience those gut-wrenching 13 weeks.  
    
            “I think they need to leave it up to the doctors to treat each and every one of their patients the way they need to be treated,” she said. “I don’t think politicians have a place [in] health care. That’s why we have doctors.”  
    
            Her physicians have reassured her that she’s not at higher risk of having another child with Potter syndrome. Her husband and son want another child, Deborah said, but at this point, she doesn’t.  
    
            “I can’t go through another trauma like this pregnancy,” she said. “I felt the baby the whole time.”

      Judge blocks Utah’s ban on abortion clinics from taking effect

            A Utah judge has blocked the state’s ban on abortion clinics, the day before it was supposed to start taking effect.
    
            The complaint was aimed at House Bill 467, which was signed by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March. The law bans abortion clinics from operating in the state beginning next year, but allows abortions to be performed until 18 weeks of pregnancy at a hospital.  
    
            Under that law, Utah was scheduled to stop granting licenses for abortion clinics after May 2 and abortion clinics would have been prohibited from operating in the state on or after January 1, 2024, “or the last valid date of an abortion clinic license issued … whichever date is later.”
    
            Third District Judge Andrew Stone agreed with Planned Parenthood Association of Utah that the law was discriminatory against abortion clinics.
    
            “The Clinic Ban places a greater burden on licensed abortion clinics by criminalizing abortions performed in such clinics despite the unrebutted evidence that abortions performed in an outpatient clinic are equally as safe as those performed in a hospital,” Stone wrote. “(Planned Parenthood) has advanced a factual record supporting the conclusion that the Legislature’s classification is unreasonable and appears to single out abortion clinics without any justification.”
    
            In a statement, Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the organization was “grateful that the court has blocked this extremely harmful law and granted much-needed relief to Utahns in need of abortion care before it took effect.”
    
            CNN has reached out to the governor’s office for comment.

      NY governor signs two bills aimed at ensuring access to abortion medication and over-the counter contraceptives

    ","
            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday signed two bills into law aimed at increasing access to medication abortion and over-the-counter contraceptives for New Yorkers.
    
            The bills, which passed the New York state legislature earlier this year, “will make the difference between an unwanted pregnancy and a future where they can decide what they want to do,” the Democratic governor said Tuesday.
    
            The first bill seeks to ensure every student enrolled in a State University of New York (SUNY) or City University of New York (CUNY) college will be able to access medication abortion. 
    
            Around 600,000 students are enrolled in the two school systems together, according to SUNY and CUNY.
    
            “College-aged New Yorkers are more likely to inquire (about) abortion care than any other age group” in New York, Hochul said.
    
            The second bill allows pharmacists across the state to dispense contraceptives over the counter. The legislation will increase birth control access for all New Yorkers, Hochul said, but especially those in rural areas, minorities or people living in what she described as “health care deserts.”
    
            The New York Democrat’s actions come amid a surge of GOP-led efforts and legal disputes to restrict abortion procedures and medications across the country since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
    
            In April, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota signed a near-total abortion ban bill into law and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban into law.
    
            Florida’s six-week ban would not go into effect until the state Supreme Court overturns its previous precedent on abortion.
    
            Hochul, however, joins a list of Democratic governors that have recently moved to enshrine abortion rights. Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed legislation last week that further protects the right to abortion and Democratic Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado signed similar legislation in April. 
    
            “As anti-choice extremists and judges continue to roll back abortion rights across the country, we are fighting back here in New York,” Hochul said. “I am proud to sign these landmark pieces of legislation that protect and expand access to abortion and reproductive health care. Under my watch, I will continue to ensure that New York remains a safe harbor for those in need of care.”

      Two hospitals under federal investigation over care of pregnant woman who was refused abortion

            The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is investigating two hospitals that “did not offer necessary stabilizing care to an individual experiencing an emergency medical condition, in violation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA),” according to a letter from US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.
    
            Under EMTALA, health care professionals are required to “offer treatment, including abortion care, that the provider reasonably determines is necessary to stabilize the patient’s emergency medical condition,” Becerra said Monday in his letter to national hospital and provider associations.
    
            The National Women’s Law Center, which said in a statement that it filed the initial EMTALA complaint on behalf of Mylissa Farmer, identified the hospitals as Freeman Hospital West of Joplin, Missouri, and the University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kansas.
    
            The patient was nearly 18 weeks pregnant when she had a preterm premature rupture of membranes, Becerra wrote, but she was told that her pregnancy wasn’t viable.
    
            “Although her doctors advised her that her condition could rapidly deteriorate, they also advised that they could not provide her with the care that would prevent infection, hemorrhage, and potentially death because, they said, the hospital policies prohibited treatment that could be considered an abortion,” Becerra wrote.
    
            Becerra added in a statement Monday, “fortunately, this patient survived. But she never should have gone through the terrifying ordeal she experienced in the first place. We want her, and every patient out there like her, to know that we will do everything we can to protect their lives and health, and to investigate and enforce the law to the fullest extent of our legal authority.”
    
            Abortion is banned in Missouri, with limited exceptions, such as to save the mother’s life. State law requires counseling and a 72-hour waiting period. In Kansas, abortion is generally banned at or after 22 weeks of pregnancy, with a 24-hour waiting period and counseling required.
    
            Passed in 1986, EMTALA requires that hospitals provide stabilizing treatment to patients who have emergency medical conditions, or transfer them to facilities where such care will be provided, regardless of any conflicting state laws or mandates.
    
            Changes to state laws in the wake of the US Supreme Court decision that overturned the right to an abortion have left many hospitals and providers uncertain or confused about the steps they can legally take in such cases. HHS issued guidance last year reaffirming that EMTALA requires providers to offer stabilizing care in emergency cases, which might include abortion.
    
            Hospitals found to be in violation of EMTALA could lose their Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and could face civil penalties. An individual physician could also face civil penalties if they are found to be in violation.
    
            HHS may impose a $119,942 fine per violation for hospitals with more than 100 beds and $59,973 for hospitals with fewer than 100 beds. A physician could face a $119,942 fine per violation.
    
            The National Women’s Law Center says the new actions are the first time since Roe v. Wade was overturned that EMTALA has been enforced against a hospital that denied emergency abortion care.
    
            “The care provided to the patient was reviewed by the hospital and found to be in accordance with hospital policy,” the University of Kansas Health System said in a statement to CNN. “It met the standard of care based upon the facts known at the time, and complied with all applicable law. There is a process with CMS for this complaint and we respect that process. The University of Kansas Health System follows federal and Kansas law in providing appropriate, stabilizing, and quality care to all of its patients, including obstetric patients.”
    
            Freeman Hospital did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    
            An HHS spokesperson told CNN that both hospitals are working toward coming into compliance with the law.
    
            In the law center’s statement, Farmer said she was pleased with the investigations, “but pregnant people across the country continue to be denied care and face increased risk of complications or death, and it must stop. I was already dealing with unimaginable loss and the hospitals made things so much harder. I’m still struggling emotionally with what happened to me, but I am determined to keep fighting because no one should have to go through this.”

      DeSantis signs bill making child rapists eligible for death penalty at odds with US Supreme Court ruling

            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed three “anti-crime” bills into law, one of which would make child rapists eligible for the death penalty with the minimum sentence of life in prison without parole.
    
            “We think that in the worst of the worst cases, the only appropriate punishment is the ultimate punishment, and so this bill sets up a procedure to be able to challenge that precedent,” the Republican governor said at a news conference in Titusville, Florida. 
    
            This bill runs afoul of a 2008 US Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from applying the death penalty for child rape if the victim did not die. The high court ruled in Kennedy v. Louisiana that the Louisiana statute imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause.
    
            “As it relates to crimes against individuals, though, the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was not taken,” then-US Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority ruling.
    
            The action from DeSantis comes as the Florida Legislature’s 60-day session draws to an end this week. In the state’s capital of Tallahassee, GOP lawmakers have been tasked with helping DeSantis rack up policy victories as he nears a run for president in 2024, and he has already signed several high-profile bills, including an abortion ban, a measure to allow Floridians to carry concealed guns in public and an overhaul of the state’s tort laws.
    
            “In Florida, we stand for the protection of children,” DeSantis said. “Unfortunately, in our society, you have very heinous sex crimes that are committed against children under the age of 12 years old.”
    
            “The perpetrators of these crimes are oftentimes serial offenders,” the governor added. “We really believe that part of a just society is to have appropriate punishment. And so, if you commit a crime that is really, really heinous, you should have the ultimate punishment.”

      New approach gets newborns with opioid withdrawal out of the hospital sooner and with less medication

            Rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome surged in recent years, but a newer approach to caring for newborn babies exposed to opioids during pregnancy gets them out of the hospital sooner and with less medication, according to a study published on Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    
            Newborns in opioid withdrawal may experience upset stomach, inconsolable crying, seizures and extreme discomfort. The study looked at the impacts of the Eat, Sleep, Console care approach on 1,300 infants at 26 US hospitals, and compared them with the current standard for caring for infants exposed to opioids. 
    
            Eat, Sleep, Console encourages involvement from parents, and prioritizes care that doesn’t involve medication, such as swaddling, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding. The usual approach involves a nurse measuring a baby’s withdrawal symptoms – such as their level of irritability, pitch of crying, fever or tremors – before providing treatment such as methadone or morphine.
    
            “Compared to usual care, use of the Eat, Sleep, Console care approach substantially decreased time until infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome were medically ready for discharge, without increasing specified adverse outcomes,” the researchers wrote in the study.
    
            The infants assessed with the Eat, Sleep, Console care method were discharged after eight days on average, compared with almost 15 days for the infants who were cared for by the standard approach, the researchers said. Additionally, infants in the Eat, Sleep, Console care group were 63% less likely to receive opioid medication – 19.5% received medication compared with 52% in the group receiving usual care.
    
            The current approach to usual care “is a very comprehensive and nurse-led way of assessing the infant, whereas the Eat, Sleep, Console approach involves the mom in the way that you assess the infant, and allows the mom to take part in trying to soothe the infants and see if the infant is able to be soothed or is able to eat or is able to sleep,” according to Rebecca Baker, the director of the NIH HEAL Initiative, which provides grants to researchers studying ways to alleviate the country’s opioid health crisis.
    
            “So, in that way, it’s a little bit more functional, like looking at the abilities of the infants versus how severely the infant is affected.”
    
            Assessment results determine whether a baby should receive medication to control withdrawal symptoms, Baker said.
    
            “So even with Eat, Sleep, Console, some infants that were exposed to a lot of opioids during a mother’s pregnancy, they’ll still need medication-based treatment for withdrawal. It’s just fewer of them need it and when they need it, they need less medication to manage the withdrawal symptoms,” she said.
    
            The Eat, Sleep, Console method was developed about eight years ago, and some hospitals have already implemented it. But Baker said the study’s findings could change how more hospitals practice caring for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which primarily occurs in infants who were exposed to opioids while in utero.
    
            “The rise of really powerful fentanyl, the synthetic opioid, means that if a mother has used drugs during pregnancy, the baby will be exposed to more powerful drugs, which likely has an effect. We haven’t had a chance to study it in detail yet, but it will affect how they feel when they’re born and separated from the mom,” Baker said.
    
            Findings from the study, which were presented at the PAS 2023 Meeting on Sunday, could have a big impact on hospitals by freeing up bed space in the neonatal intensive care unit and boosting morale among nurses at risk of burnout.
    
            “We trained over 5,000 nurses as part of the study. They felt really empowered to help the mom care for the infant to help the infant recover, and so I think from a morale perspective, that’s incredibly important and valuable,” Baker said. “And as you know, nurses are facing really severe staffing shortages and morale challenges so having this tool available to them where they are kind of able to do something positive in the life of the infant and the connection with the mom is really important.”
    
            The researchers are currently following up with a subgroup of the infants from the study for up to two years to see how they grow and develop.
    
            “One of the things that we want to be really sure of is that there are no negative consequences associated with taking less medication, so we’ll be looking for that,” Baker said.
    
            The United States has seen an explosion in the number of infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome in recent years, swelling by about 82% between 2010 and 2017, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of maternal opioid-related diagnoses is also on the rise, increasing by 131% during that same time frame.
    
            Nearly 60 infants are diagnosed with NAS each day, based on data from the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2020.
    
            The United States’ opioid epidemic has been expanding in recent years and opioid deaths are the leading cause of accidental death in the US. 
    
            More than a million people have died of drug overdoses – mostly opioids – in the two decades since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collecting that data. Deaths from opioid overdoses rose more than 17% in just one year, from about 69,000 in 2020 to about 81,020 in 2021, the CDC found.
    
            Most are among adults, but children are also dying, largely after ingesting synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Between 1999 and 2016, nearly 9,000 children and adolescents died of opioid poisoning, with the highest annual rates among adolescents 15 to 19, the CDC found.
    
            Opioid use during pregnancy has been linked to maternal mortality and risk of overdose for the mother, according to the CDC, while infants risk preterm birth, low birthweight, breathing problems and feeding problems.

      GOP presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson says he would sign federal abortion ban but supports exceptions

    ","
            Republican presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson said Sunday he would sign a federal abortion ban if he were elected president but would support exceptions.
    
            “I would support the restrictions, and I would advocate for the exceptions of the life of the mother and the cases of rape and incest,” the former Arkansas governor said on CNN’s “State of the Union” in an interview with Dana Bash. “I believe that’s where the American public is. I don’t think anything will come out of Congress without those exceptions. And I certainly would sign a pro-life bill, but I would expect those exceptions to be in place.”
    
            As governor in 2021, Hutchinson signed a near-total abortion ban into law that did not include exceptions for rape and incest. He told CNN at the time that he signed the measure because he hoped the US Supreme Court would eventually take up the legislation and overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide. 
    
            A year later, the Supreme Court did just that, allowing various state restrictions on the procedure to move forward, including in Arkansas. Hutchinson told CNN last year before Roe was overturned that he believed the Arkansas law should be “revisited” to provide exceptions for instances of rape or incest. 
    
            Hutchinson said Sunday that unless Republicans earn supermajority status in Congress, “we’re going to keep this issue in the states.”
    
            Republicans have been wrestling with the issue of abortion, which has become a political landmine for their party and has hurt conservative candidates in recent elections. CNN previously reported that House Republicans have abandoned a yearslong push by their party to pass a federal abortion ban and are exploring other ways to advance their anti-abortion agenda.
    
            Still, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Sunday that Republicans need to directly take on abortion issues in order to appeal to independents. 
    
            “Abortion was a big issue in key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania so the guidance we’re going to give to our candidates is to have to address this head-on,” she said on “Fox News Sunday,” adding that Republicans need to “fight back” against Democratic attacks. 
    
            “You need to say, ‘Listen, I’m proud to be pro-life. We have to find consensus among Democrats and Republicans,’” she added.
    
            Hutchinson formally kicked off his campaign in Bentonville, Arkansas, last week, touting his experience and record as a “consistent conservative.” 
    
            Asked by Bash on Sunday if there’s any appetite for his brand of Republicanism, Hutchinson said, “Absolutely. I wouldn’t be in this race if I didn’t believe it.” 
    
            The former governor also took a swing at a potential GOP rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, over his yearlong fight with Disney, saying, “I don’t understand a conservative punishing a business that’s the largest employer in the state.”
    
            “It’s not the role of government to punish a business when you disagree with what they’re saying or a position that they take,” Hutchinson said.
    
            DeSantis’ clash with Disney dates back to the entertainment giant’s opposition to a Florida measure that restricts certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. The law was dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by opponents, and Disney vowed to help overturn it. 
    
            The Florida governor has defended the state’s actions against Disney, which include taking over the company’s special taxing district.
    
            “In reality, Disney was enjoying unprecedented privileges and subsidies,” DeSantis said recently. “It’s certainly even worse when a company takes all those privileges that have been bestowed over many, many decades, and uses that to wage war on state policy regarding families and children.”

      How to support your loved one during the infertility journey

            “Bobby and Sara are having twins!” 
    
            I remember my husband coming into the bathroom where I was taking a bath to tell me about his childhood best friend’s happy news. 
    
            We had been trying to get pregnant for several months at that point, and we were going through rounds of intrauterine insemination, better known as IUI.
    
            I wanted to genuinely give a nice response, but I just sank down further in the tub, my eyes welled up with tears. I felt nauseous and angry. I let out a mumble: “Great.” But what I wanted to do was scream, “Why them and not us?!”
    
            I carried around such bitterness and resentment throughout our yearslong struggle to start a family. 
    
            As it turns out, we were in the same boat as millions of people all over the world. 
    
            Infertility affects about 1 in 6 people, according to a recent report from the World Health Organization previously covered by CNN. Rates of infertility — meaning the inability to conceive after 12 months of having sex without protection — are similar across all countries and regions, according to the WHO report.
    
            During our fertility treatments to get pregnant with our first child, Leo, I kept our fertility treatments a secret from my family and friends. I didn’t want to have to deal with answering any questions or let anyone down if the procedures didn’t result in a baby. 
    
            But it was difficult to mask my overwhelming despair. At one point during my first round of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, I finally saw a psychologist. I’m not sure if it had to do with the copious amounts of fertility drugs, the daily injections or the months of failed treatments — but it was a perfect emotional storm. I needed validation that what I was feeling was, in fact, normal. 
    
            As it turns out, lots of people feel this way. Receiving a psychiatric diagnosis, most commonly anxiety or depression, is something up to 40% of women affected by infertility face, according to the American Psychiatric Association.
    
            “During the journey, there are often long wait times with appointments or providers. Waiting to get test results, waiting to hear something was effective, waiting for next steps. All that waiting can really put us in a non-ideal mental health space,” psychologist Dr. Heather Tahler told CNN. She is the mental health services lead at women and family telemedicine startup Maven Clinic in New York City.
    
            “I think another big stressor people feel is the societal pressure for family building to look a certain way. We don’t talk enough about all the different paths that people go through to build their family.”
    
            This kind of distress can be severe. Dr. Elizabeth A. Grill, associate professor of psychology at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, equates the stress of an infertility diagnosis to that of a terminal illness.
    
            “The research shows that the distress levels of those going through infertility are equal to patients diagnosed with heart disease, cancer and HIV,” Grill said.
    
            Part of my sadness was how isolating it all felt. When my husband and I initially began tracking my ovulation and good old-fashioned sex wasn’t working, I would talk to my girlfriends and certain family members, who would brush my worries aside and tell me the key to getting pregnant was to lower my stress levels. “Just have a glass of wine before sex,” one friend said. “Take a trip,” a relative suggested. They were trying to be helpful, but it was hurtful.
    
            To find out what could be helpful for others, I talked to several people for their advice on what to do and not do when supporting a loved one going through infertility.
    
            Talk less and listen more, advised Grace Bastidas, the editor-in-chief of Parents. She regularly covers the topic of infertility and recently published a piece about how to help people going through infertility. 
    
            “If a friend or a relative tells you they’re having a tough time conceiving, try not to minimize it by saying, ‘Just try to relax.’ That’s really not helpful,” Bastidas said. 
    
            “It really doesn’t validate how they are feeling in the moment,” she said. “If you don’t know what to say, sometimes just listening and being that ear or that shoulder and letting them know they can count on you is what you can do.” 
    
            It sounds awful but for more than a year, I found it very difficult to be happy for anyone becoming pregnant. I’d get invites to baby showers and dread having to go. I’d see pregnant women in the checkout aisle at the grocery store and feel pangs of sadness. 
    
            It felt like every woman on the planet was pregnant, except me. 
    
            Elizabeth Angell, editor-in-chief of Romper, a website for millennial moms, advises people not to hide your happy news but have grace and understanding for the ones around you who are struggling.
    
            “Events like baby showers and christenings can be minefields for anyone going through infertility. I would take your cues from them,” said Angell, who has a section at Romper dedicated to trying to conceive. 
    
            “You should invite your good friends to any such celebration, but don’t be offended if they choose not to come. It doesn’t mean they aren’t happy for you. Give them the space to grieve and reassure them that you’re there for them when they’re ready to talk about it.” 
    
            Stepping up for your loved one, whether that means taking them to doctor’s appointments or sending a small gift can go a long way, Grill told me. 
    
            “If the person you are trying to support is open to ideas, try to think of what you would do for a friend diagnosed with any other illness,” Grill said. “Call or text to ask how they are doing, bring them dinner, offer to take them to appointments. 
    
            “Let them know you love them and are there for them. Learn to listen, support and show trust more than offering advice. Most importantly, validate their experience and learn to sit with them in the discomfort of their pain.”
    
            Angell agreed. “Infertility treatments are often physically taxing. If that’s something your friend is going through, send food or a nice bathrobe or pajamas — something they can use when they’re resting and recuperating.”
    
            Although well intended, “seemingly innocuous questions of curiosity … can trigger feelings of devastation and anxiety for those trying to conceive,” Grill told CNN. 
    
            Nora DeBora, who hosts The Ultimate Pregnancy Prep Podcast, has been open about how her desire to start a family hasn’t happened yet.
    
            “As a single woman in my late 30s who deeply desires a family, it can be off-putting and uncomfortable when people ask ‘when are you going to have a baby?’ There is a lot of pressure that women put on themselves already while feeling like their biological clock is ticking with each passing year.”
    
            Some days you might be handing your loved one a tissue, and others they may seem closed off.
    
            “Being present for someone on their journey means meeting them where they are at,” Tahler said. “Some days it could be talking, some days it could be a hug. There are a variety of emotional responses day-to-day. It is best to remind yourself of this, so you don’t take it personally.” 
    
            It has been liberating but sometimes incredibly vulnerable ever since my husband and I first began sharing our story in 2018. 
    
            Recently, I went on the Pregnantish podcast with host Andrea Syrtash, who told me that the stigma around infertility is still very prevalent. That’s why she is compelled to feature stories of people who go the distance to create their families and how their relationships are impacted. 
    
            “‘First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby carriage’ is an outdated narrative for millions of people,” she told me. 
    
            “Modern family building and infertility impact every relationship we have. With our partners, friends, family, workplace and most importantly, the relationship we have with our bodies and ourselves.”

      Anti-abortion bills fail in GOP-controlled Nebraska and South Carolina

            Measures that would have severely restricted abortion failed Thursday in Nebraska and South Carolina, which both have Republican-controlled legislatures, a reflection of the growing unease among Republicans over the political popularity of strict bans.
    
            In Nebraska, a “Heartbeat Act” would have banned most abortions after six weeks except in cases of rape or incest or to preserve the life of the mother once a “fetal heartbeat” was detected, but it stalled in the legislature. A vote to overcome a filibuster of the bill failed by a vote of 32-15, with two senators abstaining, including Republican state Sen. Merv Riepe – leaving the measure one vote shy of the two-thirds majority needed for full consideration. Riepe, a cosigner to the bill, had proposed an amendment to move the ban to 12 weeks instead of six weeks, but his amendment did not receive a vote Thursday. 
    
            Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, said he was “profoundly disappointed” in the vote and called for the bill to be reconsidered.
    
            “It is unacceptable for senators to be present not voting on such a momentous vote,” Pillen said in a statement on Thursday. “I call on Senator Merv Riepe to make a motion to reconsider and stand by the commitments to life he has made in the past.”
    
            Nebraska law currently prohibits most abortions starting at 20 weeks.
    
            On Thursday afternoon, the South Carolina state Senate failed to pass the “Human Life Protection Act,” which would have banned abortions in the state, in a 22-21 vote with five women voting against it – including three Republicans. The bill previously passed in the state House and included exceptions for incidents of rape or incest.
    
            The bill will now be carried over to next year’s legislative session, which begins in January.
    
            “Once a woman became pregnant for any reason, she would now become property of the state of South Carolina if the ‘Human Life Protection Act’ were [to] come into law,” Republican state Sen. Katrina Frye Shealy, who voted against the bill, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “She could no longer make decisions on her own or at the advice of her well-trained doctor. Every female, regardless of her age, would suddenly become subject to the power of a code book regarding her health.”
    
            Penry Gustafson, another Republican South Carolina state senator who voted against the bill, told CNN’s Boris Sanchez on Friday while she is in favor of a six-week abortion ban and is against abortion rights, she voted against the bill because she did not believe it would pass the state’s Supreme Court. Gustafson also said she disagrees with support for a nationwide 15-week abortion ban that has been promoted by some Congressional Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.
    
            “I’ve talked with some of my colleagues, especially my female colleagues, and we think it’s a bad idea. If you are going to send the decision-making to the states, we need to do that. We need to legislate on behalf of our states,” she said on “CNN News Central.” 
    
            Vicki Ringer, director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement, “the government should never force a person to carry a pregnancy or give birth against their will” and that the state legislature is “hellbent on controlling the decisions of women.”
    
            In the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, many Republican-led states have enacted sweeping abortion restrictions. But unpopularity, demonstrated in some instances by electoral evidence, over severe restrictions has prompted Republicans to reconsider the political wisdom of enacting near-total bans on the procedure, and House Republicans have recently stepped away from pushing a federal abortion ban.

      Systemic racism is contributing to rise in induced labor among Black and Latina mothers, new study says
    ","

    ","
            A new study by researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder found that Black and Latina mothers in the US may have been induced into labor based on the needs of White pregnant women and not their own.
    
            The study, published Wednesday in the American Sociological Association’s Journal of Health and Social Behavior, suggests systemic racism may be shaping obstetric care in the United States.  
    
            An analysis of more than 40 million birth records from the National Vital Statistics Systems showed that births in the US in which labor was induced nearly tripled between 1990 and 2017, the study says.  
    
            When comparing the experiences of Black, Latina and White women in labor, researchers found all the three groups had similar increased rates of induced labor but said the decisions about the women’s care were likely only driven by how White pregnant women were treated.  
    
            “There are norms, assessments, behaviors and institutional practices that might be taking their cues from the White population and then being sort of indiscriminately applied to the Black and Latina childbearing population,” Ryan Masters, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in a statement. 
    
            “That’s incredibly worrisome because it’s effectively institutional level racism manifesting down in these obstetric clinical practices,” he added. 
    
            The study was based on a sample of 41.1 million single, first births across the country, including 26.4 million of White women, 6.2 million of Black women and 8.4 million Latinas. Data from births among White women was from all 50 states but data from Black and Latina women only included 43 and 47 states, respectively. All groups were represented in Washington, DC, the study says. 
    
            Gestational tobacco use, maternal diabetes, maternal hypertension, and high gestational weight gain were considered as factors for high-risk pregnancies. Researchers said more White women were induced into labor when there was evidence of risk factors in that population. 
    
            But there was not a strong link between an increased number of Black and Latina women being induced into labor and the presence of risk factors within their race or ethnic group, the study says. 
    
            “The results suggest systemic racism may be shaping U.S. obstetric care whereby care is not ‘centered at the margins’ but is instead responsive to characteristics in states’ White populations,” the study says. 
    
            The study’s authors said their findings may be limited but are consistent with “an extensive literature documenting health care inequity” in the US. The study provides strong evidence that obstetric care “has not been centered on the needs of Black and Latina childbearing populations.” 
    
            “I hope it is convincing evidence for clinical practitioners and others to heed the calls of others to be sensitive to the ways that whether they are malicious or not. The ways that our institutional practices can perpetuate unequal treatment,” Masters said.

      Justice Alito says he has ‘pretty good idea’ who was behind leak of draft abortion opinion
    ","

    ","
            Justice Samuel Alito said that he has a “pretty good idea” who was responsible for the unprecedented disclosure of a draft opinion of a Supreme Court ruling last year, suggesting it was someone who opposed reversing the Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights nationwide.
    
            In an interview published Friday by The Wall Street Journal in its opinion section, Alito dismissed the idea that the draft was leaked by one of the five conservative justices who were in the majority of the ruling.
    
            “That’s infuriating to me,” Alito said of the speculation. “Look, this made us targets of assassination. Would I do that to myself? Would the five of us have done that to ourselves? It’s quite implausible.”
    
            He acknowledged in the interview, which took place in mid-April, that he didn’t have the level of proof about who was behind the leak that would make it appropriate to name the person he thinks was responsible. The final opinion overturning Roe in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization largely tracked with the draft.
    
            “It was a part of an effort to prevent the Dobbs draft … from becoming the decision of the court,” Alito said. “And that’s how it was used for those six weeks by people on the outside – as part of the campaign to try to intimidate the court.”
    
            Alito has previously condemned the leak, as have other justices. The Supreme Court in a January statement called the disclosure a “grave assault on the judicial process.”
    
            The statement was issued with a public version of a report summarizing the investigation into the leak conducted by the marshal of the court, Gail Curley. The release said that the investigative team had “to date been unable to identify a person responsible by a preponderance of the evidence.”
    
            Politico obtained and published the draft in early May, several weeks before the court released the final opinion at the end of its term.
    
            In his latest comments to the Journal, Alito said the marshal “did a good job with the resources that were available to her” and agreed with her decision not to publicly identify a culprit. He condemned the threats and hostility facing the court, including an alleged assassination attempt against Justice Brett Kavanaugh last summer.
    
            Alito took swipes in the interview at those he said have criticized the court “unfairly,” and he griped about how some pockets of the legal profession were playing a role in the criticism rather than defending the high court.
    
            “The idea has always been that judges are not supposed to respond to criticisms, but if the courts are being unfairly attacked, the organized bar will come to their defense,” he said, adding, “If anything, they’ve participated to some degree in these attacks.”
    
            Alito declined to weigh in on the public scrutiny that Justice Clarence Thomas is under for alleged ethical lapses, but he defended the way Kavanaugh handled accusations during his confirmation process that he, as a high schooler, sexually assaulted a teenage girl.
    
            “After Justice Kavanaugh was accused of being a rapist during his Senate confirmation hearings, he made an impassioned speech, made an impassioned scene, and he was criticized because it was supposedly not judicious, not the proper behavior for a judge to speak in those terms. I don’t know – if somebody calls you a rapist?” Alito said.

      The 150-year-old chastity law that may be the next big fight over abortion
    ","

        2:13 PM EDT, Fri April 28, 2023
    ","
            A law passed 150 years ago that banned the mailing of contraceptives, lewd materials and drugs that induce abortions could provide a pathway for effectively banning abortion nationwide – even in states where the procedure is legal.
    
            When the Supreme Court last summer reversed Roe v. Wade and eliminated constitutional protections that guaranteed abortion rights nationwide, the conservative majority fashioned its ruling as returning the matter of abortion policy-making to elected officials, particularly in state legislatures. 
    
            But the battle lines now being drawn around the Reconstruction-era federal law – the Comstock Act – are an example of how the picture after Roe v. Wade is far more complicated as abortion opponents are challenging the means of abortion, such as the drug mifepristone, in court.
    
            The most sweeping Comstock Act arguments from anti-abortion activists could at the very least end the availability of medication abortion, which make up the majority of abortions in the US today, and could have the effect of eliminating surgical abortions as well by restricting the shipment of medical instruments and supplies used in the procedure.
    
            “Comstock is really the backdoor way to remove access to abortion across the whole country,” said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh Law School professor who specializes in abortion law.
    
            A fight over the reach of the law and how it can be deployed is beginning to brew in court. It has also been on the radar of state and local officials. But the end goal is a GOP-led federal government willing and empowered to wield the law in a way that could make it impossible for abortion providers to operate.
    
            If the current proxy legal battles over the statute’s meaning unfold in the way abortion opponents hope, enforcement of the law could be a central issue in the 2024 White House race and congressional campaigns, given federal lawmakers’ power to repeal it.
    
            The Comstock Act, first passed in 1873, is named after Anthony Comstock, who was a special agent of the US Postal Service and an anti-vice crusader. 
    
            The law’s critics say it’s discriminatory against women, pointing out that at the time of its adoption, women could not vote and the Supreme Court had not yet interpreted the Constitutional Equal Protection Clause to prohibit sex discrimination. 
    
            The statute bans the mailing of articles or things “designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use,” and in a separate section, describes its prohibition as being on “any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” 
    
            Prosecutions under the law were bought in the first few decades after its passage, but by the 1930s, courts began whittling down some of its provisions and enforcement of the law ceased. Congress meanwhile amended it in the 1970s to remove its ban on mailing birth control. 
    
            Anti-abortion activists contend, however, that the part of the statute having to do with abortion-inducing drug remains good law, even if there was no appetite for enforcing it while the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent – which protected abortion rights nationwide – was on the books. That precedent was overturned by the high court’s conservative majority last June. 
    
            “Now that Roe is gone, the law springs back into life,” said Roger Severino, the vice president of domestic policy at the conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, who also served as a top civil rights lawyer in the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration. 
    
            Severino argued that, at least when it comes to the Comstock Act’s prohibitions on mailing abortion pills, Congress is well within its powers to regulate those shipments.
    
            While prominent anti-abortion lawyers are focused on how the law applies to the mailing of abortion drugs, the maximalist interpretations being put forward by some abortion foes would mean that tools and medical instruments that facilitate surgical abortions that are shipped in the mail to clinics and other facilities would be caught in the Comstock Act’s net. 
    
            “If Comstock comes to life, it has power to ban abortion nationwide. … It’s not just pills,” Donley said. “Any abortion provider in the country is going to use the mail to get the things that they need for the provision of abortion.” 
    
            Already, the Comstock Act has played a cameo role in the ongoing, high-stakes lawsuit over the US Food and Drug’s Administration regulation of abortion pills, which made it up to the Supreme Court once and is likely to land with the justices again. 
    
            The Supreme Court froze lower court orders that would have curtailed access to a medication abortion drug, but litigation over its use will continue, raising the possibility that the Comstock Act could play a more central role in that case. Depending on how the legal battle plays out, it could empower the Justice Department in a possible future Republican administration to bring prosecutions under the law, which could complicate – or perhaps even end – access to abortion. 
    
            In the meantime, the anti-abortion movement appears to be looking for ways to tee up disputes over whether the law is enforceable and how far it reaches. 
    
            “The Supreme Court is going to have to address this issue, sooner rather than later,” said Mark Lee Dickson, an anti-abortion activist who has been involved in local efforts to seize upon the US law. He sees the Comstock Act as a “de facto federal abortion ban.”
    
            Both sides of the abortion debate acknowledge that the clearest test of what the Comstock Act means likely wouldn’t emerge until a Republican takes the White House and puts in place Justice Department leadership that would be willing to enforce the law. 
    
            The Biden administration has adopted a legal posture that takes a narrow view of the law’s applicability, arguing that it does not prohibit the mailing of abortion drugs if they’re not intended for an unlawful use. 
    
            If the Supreme Court endorses the broad interpretation of the law put forward by anti-abortion activists, it would raise the stakes “significantly” for the 2024 election, said Mary Ziegler, a UC-Davis School of Law professor and author of “Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present.” 
    
            “You would have essentially on the ballot the question of both Comstock enforcement and also potentially Comstock repeal,” Ziegler said. 
    
            “Do I think, under a Trump presidency, they’re going to confiscate surgical gloves because they could be adapted for use in abortion? No, I don’t think that’s probably going to happen,” Ziegler added. “But the language is so broad that it really would be the license to go after a lot of things beyond just abortion pills.”
    
            The Biden administration, in an internal advisory opinion released by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, argues that the law does not apply to the mailing of abortion pills if they’re not being sent with the intent of unlawful use. The opinion pointed to how 20th century courts had interpreted it narrowly as excluding drugs mailed with legitimate intent. 
    
            (OLC opinions dictate how executive branch agencies approach legal questions but do not have any binding effect in the court of law.) 
    
            The opinion was rolled out just before the FDA unveiled new rules around abortion pills that allow pharmacies to dispense the drug. 
    
            The Comstock Act has been invoked in the challenge to the FDA’s 2000 approval of the medication abortion drug mifepristone, where the plaintiffs – anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations – are arguing that the FDA broke the law by failing to take its criminal prohibitions into account when approving the drug.  
    
            There are also questions about whether the law applies not just to medication abortion, but to the tools used for surgical abortions as well. A lawyer representing the anti-abortion doctors in the current FDA case told CNN they’re not focused on that question while their assertions about mailing abortion pills play out in court. 
    
            The challenge to the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug used for medication abortion is not the only case where courts are being asked to expound upon the Comstock Act’s reach. 
    
            Several towns, some in New Mexico and elsewhere, have passed local ordinances that cite the Comstock Act and prohibit business within those jurisdictions from shipping or receiving items used for abortions in the mail, as covered by the Comstock Act. Dickson, who is director of Right to Life of East Texas and has advocated for the passage of the ordinances, said part of the focus in where the ordinances are being passed is towns in the border regions of blue states that abortion clinic organizations may be eying for new facilities. 
    
            The lawsuits in New Mexico state court that those ordinances have prompted may provide for another opportunity for courts to elaborate on what the Comstock Act means. The state Supreme Court is dominated by Democratic justices. But getting multiple courts to interpret the law and create judicial disagreement about its meaning appears to be part of the anti-abortion movement’s strategy for encouraging the US Supreme Court to weigh in. 
    
            One case is a challenge to some of the ordinances that New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed to the state Supreme Court early this year. His briefs argue that the Comstock Act is irrelevant to the questions before the high New Mexico court, and he is asserting that the ordinances run afoul of state law and the state constitution. 
    
            However, a second case has been brought by the city of Eunice – a New Mexico town near the Texas border that passed its own ordinance that was not covered in Torrez’s lawsuit. Eunice is asking for a court ruling that would interpret the Comstock Act as outlawing “all shipment and receipt of abortion pills and abortion-related paraphernalia throughout the United States, regardless of whether the sender” intends the items to be used unlawfully. The city argues that the ordinance should be allowed to stand because the federal 1873 law trumps New Mexico law and the state constitution.
    
            In Texas, the Comstock Act has been raised in a wrongful death lawsuit that a man has filed against friends of his ex-wife who allegedly helped her procure abortion drugs to terminate a pregnancy. The lawsuit claims that the manufacturer of the pills has criminal liability under the law while alleging that criminal liability extends to the two people who are accused of helping the ex-wife procure the pills. 
    
            Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of Texas’ ground-breaking civil enforcement six-week abortion ban, is involved in both the Texas wrongful death case and the lawsuit Eunice has brought. 
    
            A coalition of Republican state attorneys general, meanwhile, invoked the Comstock Act in a February letter to pharmacy chains, warning the companies that private litigation could be used to enforce the law against them if the pharmacies seek to dispense abortion pills in their states. 
    
            “I really believe the abortion industry is going to find themselves Comstock-ed, one way or the other,” Dickson said. “They’re going to find these federal statutes coming down upon them one way or the other.” 
    
            While those cases percolate, the case against the FDA for its approval of mifepristone will move forward and is almost guaranteed to land back before the Supreme Court. The lawsuit, however, does not make for the perfect vehicle for settling the questions about the Comstock Act’s prosecutorial potency, as the FDA plays no role in enforcing the law. 
    
            Instead, the plaintiffs are using the Comstock Act to argue that the FDA should have never approved the drug, which has been on the marketplace for nearly 23 years, in the first place.
    
            “The FDA went above and beyond just approving the drug,” Erik Baptist, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, told CNN while pointing to the distribution plan submitted to the FDA at the time showing how the drugs would be shipped. “It actually requires something of the drug manufacturer that is explicitly illegal.” 
    
            At least in the very conservative pockets of the judiciary where the first two rounds of the litigation over the abortion pill’s FDA approval played out, the anti-abortion movement has gotten some traction with its assertions about the Comstock Act’s breadth.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who issued a now-frozen ruling that would have halted the approval of the drug, agreed with the plaintiffs’ assertions about the Comstock Act, calling the narrower reading of the law being pushed by the DOJ “unpersuasive.” 
    
            The US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals – when it put some aspects of Kacsmaryk’s ruling on hold but left untouched parts of the order that blocked FDA’s policy allowing the drugs to be mailed to patients – suggested it was inclined to view the law the same way, even as it stopped short of fully adopting Kacsmaryk’s holding that mailing the drugs violated the 1873 law. 
    
            The Supreme Court, in the emergency order it issued last week, did not say anything about the Comstock Act. But legal experts anticipate that abortion foes will continue to tout the law in this and other cases.
    
            “They are going to use every effort to try to get the question of the Comstock Act before the Supreme Court,” said David Cohen, a professor at the Drexel Kline School of Law and co-author of the book “Obstacle Course: The Everyday Struggle to Get an Abortion in America.”

      Minnesota governor signs bills further enshrining abortion, gender-affirming care into law

            Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed legislation Thursday that further enshrines the right to abortion and gender-affirming care into law and another that bans so-called conversion therapy.
    
            The new legislation enhances existing state law that makes access to abortion and gender-affirming care legal and opposes conversion therapy.
    
            Walz previously signed an executive order restricting conversion therapy in the state in 2021. And earlier this year, the Democratic governor codified the right to abortion in the state and signed an executive order in March directing state agencies to protect and support access to gender-affirming health care across the state.
    
            “In Minnesota, we’re protecting rights – not taking them away,” Walz said in a statement on Twitter after signing the bills.
    
            The laws Walz signed Thursday include the reproductive health care and gender-affirming care bills, HF366 and HF146, which will shield people from legal action that other states may levy over such care.
    
            The legislation banning conversion therapy, HF16, which garnered only two Republican votes in the Senate, outlaws organized attempts to convert people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning into straight or cisgender people.
    
            The latest bills out of Minnesota stand in stark contrast with bills cracking down on gender-affirming care and abortion pushed by Republican-led states across the country and follows a trend of blue states enacting shield laws to become havens for those seeking abortions and gender-affirming treatment who may be traveling from states where the practices are banned.
    
            Walz’s approval of the trio of bills adds to the list of progressive legislation the state’s Democratic trifecta has been able to pass this session. Walz also signed legislation earlier this year restoring the voting rights of thousands of convicted felons in Minnesota and is expected to sign legislation that would legalize recreational marijuana and expunge marijuana convictions if it passes out of the state Senate, possibly as early as this week.

      Texas woman denied an abortion tells senators she ‘nearly died on their watch’

    ","
            A woman who is suing the state of Texas after being denied an abortion told lawmakers Wednesday that not receiving abortion care harmed her mental health and might prevent her from having children in the future. 
    
            Addressing her senators, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, Amanda Zurawski said her “horrific” experience was a result of policies they support. “I nearly died on their watch,” she said. 
    
            “We’ve heard a lot today about the mental trauma and the negative harmful effects on a person’s psychological well-being after they have an abortion, supposedly, and I’m curious why that’s not relevant for me as well,” Zurawski said in the hearing of the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the impact of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.
    
            “Because I wasn’t permitted to have an abortion and the trauma and the PTSD and the depression that I have dealt with in the eight months since this happened to me is paralyzing,” she said. “On top of that, I am still struggling to have children.”
    
            Zurawski previously told CNN she was denied abortion care after she had pregnancy complications. Eighteen weeks into her pregnancy, Zurawski’s water broke, which put her at high risk for a life-threatening infection. Zurawski’s baby, named Willow, was sure to die. Willow still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.
    
            Zurawski told lawmakers Wednesday that she received an emergency abortion only after her condition worsened and she went into septic shock – adding that she may have been one of the first patients affected in the state of Texas after Roe was overturned, removing the federal right to an abortion.
    
            “I wanted to address my senators Cruz and Cornyn, neither of whom regrettably are in the room right now, but I would like for them to know that what happened to me I think most people in this room would agree was horrific. But it’s a direct result of the policies that they support,” Zurawski said. “I nearly died on their watch, and furthermore, as a result of what happened to me, I may have been robbed of the opportunity to have children in the future.”
    
            Zurawski is one of five women suing the state of Texas over its restrictive abortion laws, claiming they experienced pain and suffering because they were denied abortion care when they faced emergency complications in their pregnancies. The lawsuit was filed in March by the nonprofit Center for Reproductive Rights.
    
            Texas, which has arguably the most aggressive abortion restrictions in the country, has been the site of several legal battles over abortion since before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June.
    
            The language in Texas’ abortion laws is “incredibly vague, and it leaves doctors grappling with what they can and cannot do, what health care they can and cannot provide,” Zurawski said, bristling at the implication that her doctors were at fault for misinterpreting the state’s abortion bans. “And if they make the wrong the decision, they face up to 99 years in prison and/or losing their license.” 
    
            South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the committee, asked GOP witness Dr. Ingrid Skop, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Texas and vice president and director of medical affairs for the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute, to weigh in on what happened to Zurawksi. 
    
            “I am so sorry at your loss,” Skop said to Zurawski. 
    
            “And I am so sorry that your doctors misunderstood Texas law,” Skop said. “Every single law allows an exclusion for a doctor to use their reasonable medical judgment to determine when to intervene in a medical emergency, which is usually defined as a threat to the life of the mother or permanent irreversible damage to an organ or an organ system.” 
    
            Skop said that even before the Supreme Court reversed Roe, doctors were aware of how to assess medical emergencies where abortions should be offered and that the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has in place guidance instructing providers to offer abortions or delivery for patients in Zurawski’s situation, acknowledging that the risk of infection is high, which can become life-threatening sepsis.
    
            “Either one should have been offered and could have been offered to Amanda,” Skop said.
    
            Cornyn, a Texas Republican who sits on the committee, later suggested that a medical malpractice lawsuit against her doctors is the legal route Zurawski should consider. 
    
            Later in the hearing, Zurawski said she wanted to respond to comments from Skop and Cornyn.
    
            “Dr. Skop is not my physician. She has never been my physician. She has never treated me. She has not seen my medical records,” Zurawski said. 
    
            “Quite frankly, my physician and my team of health care professionals that I saw over the course of three days, while I was repeatedly turned away from health care access, made the decision to not provide an abortion because that’s what they felt they had to do under Texas’ law,” Zurawski said. “And that will continue to happen and it is continuing to happen, and it’s not a result of misinterpretation. It’s the result of confusion and the confusion is because the way the law is written.”

      Post-Roe, abortion access has dropped in the US, but support has not, survey finds

            The US Supreme Court decision that revoked the federal right to an abortion led to significant restrictions to abortion access, but hasn’t affected public support, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center.
    
            About a year after the court’s Dobbs decision, 80% of US adults say that their views on abortion have not changed. More than 6 in 10 say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while about a third say that it should be illegal in all or most cases. This divide has changed little over the past few decades, Pew data shows.
    
            Most adults nationwide say that it would still be easy to get an abortion where they live, but that has dropped significantly over the past four years – especially in states where abortions are currently banned. 
    
            Now, more than 70% of adults in states where abortion is prohibited say that it would be difficult to get one in their area, up from 50% in 2019. In states where there are restrictions or ongoing legal disputes, more than half (56%) of adults say that it would be difficult to get an abortion, up from 41% in 2019. In states where abortion is legal, however, this number has stayed consistently around 20%.
    
            At the same time, a growing share of adults support easier access to abortions where they live, including more than a quarter of those living in states where it is legal.
    
            Other research has shown that the average travel time to get an abortion more than tripled after the Dobbs decision, as states enacting complete or partial bans on abortion effectively cut the number of active facilities by a tenth.
    
            The partisan divide on abortions is wide and growing, Pew survey data shows.
    
            About 40% of Republicans say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, holding relatively consistent since 2007. Democrats are more than twice as likely to support legal abortion, growing from 63% support in 2007 to 84% in 2023.
    
            Nearly half of Democrats say that it should be easier for someone to get an abortion in the area where they live, while nearly as many Republicans say that it should be harder for someone to get an abortion where they live.
    
            And perceptions of local laws differ by party. In states where abortion is currently banned, more than 8 out of 10 Democrats say that it would be difficult for someone to get an abortion, compared with about 6 out of 10 Republicans. A similar gap exists in states where abortion is restricted or facing ongoing legal dispute.
    
            Overall, however, there is widespread confusion about abortion laws. An earlier survey from KFF found that nearly half of adults in the US – including 2 out of 5 women of childbearing age – were unsure whether medication abortion is legal in their state.
    
            But most demographic groups have held steady in their views on abortion since last year.
    
            According to the Pew survey, conservative Republicans are most likely to say that abortion should be illegal in all or most cases – about twice as likely as moderate or liberal Republicans.
    
            Also, younger adults are more likely than older adults to say that abortion should be legal, and Black and Asian adults are more likely than White or Hispanic adults to say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.
    
            The Pew survey is based on a representative sample of more than 5,000 adults in the US who were interviewed between March 27 and April 2, before the recent federal rulings on medication abortion. States were classified by the legal status of abortion as of April 14; under state laws, abortion was considered prohibited in 13 states, restricted or in legal dispute in 11 states and legal in 26 states, as well as in Washington, DC.

      Gender-affirming care, a ‘crucial’ process for thousands of young people in America
    ","

    ","
            More than a dozen states have passed laws and more than a dozen are considering laws that ban the gold standard of care for people who identify as transgender, even though every major medical association recommends such care and says it save lives.
    
            Gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender – the gender by which one wants to be known.
    
            By one estimate, more than 58,000 transgender youth 13 and older across the US are facing restricted access or proposals, and could soon lose access to gender-affirming care. 
    
            Those 58,000 live in 15 states that have enacted or are considering laws to restrict access by, in some cases, even penalizing health care providers and families who try to get such care, according to UCLA’s Williams Institute, which conducts independent research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy. These states are home to nearly a third of the nation’s transgender youth.
    
            In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate any instances of certain procedures used in such care, on the grounds that it is now considered child abuse according to an opinion issued by state Attorney General Ken Paxton. A Texas judge granted the ACLU’s request for a temporary restraining order, preventing the state from enforcing the order for now.
    
            Despite the legislative push to end this kind of treatment, gender-affirming care is a recommended practice for people who identify as transgender, meaning they identify with a gender that is different than the one assigned at birth, or gender-diverse, with a gender expression that doesn’t strictly match society’s traditional ideas about gender.
    
            Major medical associations – including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry – agree that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults.  
    
            The World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s guidelines, which are considered the gold standard and guide gender-affirming care around the world, say it should be a way for people to create “effective pathways to achieving lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves, in order to maximize their overall health, psychological well-being and self-fulfillment.” 
    
            People who identify as transgender or gender-diverse often face significant health disparities, as well as serious marginalization and discrimination in health care settings. In 2015, 1 in 4 adults who identified as transgender avoided a needed doctor’s visit because they feared being mistreated, according to the US Transgender Survey from the National Center for Transgender Equality. 
    
            Research shows that gender-affirming care can address some of these issues and greatly improve a person’s mental health and well-being.
    
            For children, gender-affirming care is defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics as developmentally appropriate, nonjudgmental treatment that’s provided in a safe clinical space. The care is individualized and based on peer-reviewed scientific studies that show its effectiveness.
    
            This kind of care takes a multidisciplinary approach. Providers work with counselors and the person’s family, as well as the person themselves. They may also work with the child’s school and community. 
    
            When someone needs this care really depends on the person. Some children have a sense about their true gender as early as 3 years old, experts say, others as they move into puberty and still others much later. 
    
            A growing number of clinics across the country have been created to specifically provide gender-affirming care, including for children. Many use a similar approach that involves a multidisciplinary team of experts who can tailor make the program to the patient and their needs. 
    
            At the Gender Identity Program at Columbia University Medical Center, Director Melina Wald says, the process usually starts with a phone call. The family speaks with an intake coordinator and completes a brief screening to give an initial assessment of where the child is in their development. Depending on the age of the child, they may also participate. 
    
            Next, the clinic schedules the family for a couple of visits with the team’s mental health care professionals. At the first appointment, the team gauges the family’s and child’s needs. 
    
            “It’s to really get a better sense of what’s bringing them into the clinic,” Wald said. “We are also looking to understand the child’s understanding of their own gender, gender expression, and a history related to that.” 
    
            The team also determines whether there are any additional mental health needs. A 2018 study on transgender youth found that the prevalence of mental health problems was sevenfold higher than among their cisgender peers. A 2019 study of transgender adults found that they had higher levels of anxiety and depression. And a 2019 survey found that 54% of transgender and nonbinary youth in the US reported considering suicide that year, and 29% made an attempt. 
    
            The mental health problems don’t stem from their identity itself but often happen because of social discrimination and what’s known as minority stress, a growing number of studies show. Stigma, marginalization, discrimination, bullying, harassment and even violence can lead to feelings of isolation and rejection.
    
            At Wald’s clinic, after the initial screening and appointments, staffers offer feedback and their clinical impressions to the child and family. They then offer a specific treatment plan tailored for that child, based on who they are, how they identify and where they are developmentally. 
    
            “That treatment plan can include individual therapy. It can include parent support. We have an adolescent group for trans and nonbinary teens, and we also have a parent support group run by one of the psychologists on our team,” Wald said. 
    
            This part of the care will help with the social transition, said Dr. Madeline Deutsch, medical director of the UCSF Gender Affirming Health Program. 
    
            At this point, the child could start using a chosen name and pronoun. They may wear different clothing. This practice helps the young person have the confidence to present in the way that feels more genuine to them, Deutsch said. 
    
            “It’s very individualized and usually involves a mix of decision-making by parents and guardians and then maybe other stakeholders, like if the parents are accessing mental health care or if the school becomes involved to kind of help talk things through,” Deutsch said. “Usually, it’s like a no-harm-done thing. So some of it depends on the parent’s level of comfort and the community that they’re living in.”
    
            Deutsch said that when children get to a certain stage of puberty – diagnosed by a medical provider – and still have a persistent, well-documented sense of that their gender does not align with the one assigned at birth, depending on the child’s age, they may move forward with reversible pubertal suppression, commonly called puberty blockers. 
    
            Originally, these gonadotrophin-releasing hormones were used to delay puberty for people with what’s known as precocious puberty, which is when a child’s body changes into that of an adult too soon. 
    
            “That just basically puts everything on pause, and children can be on that for a couple of years without any ill effects, and it’s totally reversible,” Deutsch said. “If it’s stopped, then everything just continues where you left off.”
    
            Puberty blockers can reduce the distress that may happen when a child develops secondary sexual characteristics such as breast growth, protrusion of the Adam’s apple or voice change. Studies show that transgender adolescents who used puberty blockers were less likely to have suicidal thoughts than those who wanted the treatment but did not get it.
    
            This part of the process may also include hormone therapy that can lead to gender-affirming physical change, but again, the care plan is flexible, Deutsch said. 
    
            “I think one of the big myths out there is that there’s a sense that kids are rushed into decisions related to medical care, like hormone therapy or surgery. That’s just not the case,” Wald said. 
    
            Deutsch agreed: “Kids don’t make stuff up about this, wanting to become trans because it’s trendy or something,” she said. “Trans youth and trans people in general do not have access to a hormone vending machine.”
    
            With gender-affirming care, the team of experts will work with the young person and the family throughout the process to decide what treatment is appropriate. 
    
            The process can take several years, or it can move faster if a child is in the “throes of puberty” and has been struggling for a long time, Deutsch said. There is still an assessment of what’s needed. 
    
            Other options include voice and communication therapy. There are also gynecological and reproductive options, but most people get these treatments when they are older, if they opt to have surgery at all. Gender-affirming surgery could include facial feminization or what’s known as facial gender surgery.
    
            Some may choose what’s commonly called top surgery, which for transgender men and nonbinary people removes breast or chest tissue, or genital reconstructive procedures, also known as bottom surgery. Generally, these are not procedures adolescents would need, Wald said. 
    
            Legal interventions can include a change in name or gender on a person’s legal documents. 
    
            How easy this is, or if it’s even possible, depends on where the person lives. The rules vary by state. 
    
            Changes to documents can include a person’s birth certificate, Social Security card, passport or driver’s license. 
    
            “For transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents, early gender-affirming care is crucial to overall health and well-being,” the US Health and Human Services Department Office of Population Affairs says. Delaying care can exacerbate stressors and health problems for kids. 
    
            Some critics of the process suggest that children should wait until adulthood to transition, but the American Academy of Pediatrics says this is an outdated approach. It assumes that gender identity is fixed at a certain age, but research shows that it’s healthier to value a child for who they are rather than for what they will become.
    
            The association says this approach helps children feel safe “in a society that too often marginalizes or stigmatizes those seen as different” and strengthens family resiliency.
    
            Wald says that waiting to transition can create additional psychological distress for a child and can raise a child’s risk of depression, suicidality, self-harm or substance misuse. 
    
            “Withholding intervention means that the child is going to go through a puberty that is discordant with their gender identity and would ultimately mean that later, at the age of 18, there would be changes to their body that they would make it even more difficult,” Wald said.  
    
            Gender-affirming treatment builds self-esteem and improves overall quality of life, according to the US Office of Population Affairs, and studies show that the care improves general well-being. 
    
            And although they’re at higher risk of mental health issues, not all transgender or nonbinary youth have them. If they do, they don’t have to struggle with these issues for life if they can get the right kind of care and have supportive adults around them.  
    
            “These children and teens can be incredibly resilient,” Wald said. “With support and access to care, they will thrive and can be just as successful as any kid.”

      North Dakota governor signs law banning nearly all abortions in the state

            Republican Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota signed a near-total abortion ban bill into law Monday.
    
            Senate Bill 2150, which passed in the state’s legislature last week, defines abortion as “the act of using, selling, or prescribing any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other substance, device, or means with the intent to terminate the clinically diagnosable pregnancy of a woman.”
    
            The law is one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the US and only allows exceptions for rape or incest within the first six weeks of pregnancy.
    
            Exceptions are permitted in the case that the procedure is “deemed necessary based on reasonable medical judgment which was intended to prevent the death or a serious health risk to the pregnant female.” 
    
            Efforts to treat an ectopic or molar pregnancy would also be permissible at any stage of pregnancy under the law.
    
            Abortion rights activists have furiously objected to similar bans, saying most women do not know they are pregnant at six weeks.
    
            The bill joins other GOP-led legislation aimed at restricting abortion access that has become law in a post-Roe v. Wade world. Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Texas have also passed six-week abortion bans, sparking legal challenges. 
    
            North Dakota’s new law follows a legal battle over a 2007 trigger law that was blocked by a district judge last year.
    
            The state’s Supreme Court upheld that ruling in March.
    
            The trigger abortion ban was set to take effect last August and would have made it a felony to perform an abortion in the state but it did allow exceptions in cases of rape or incest. 
    
            With the trigger ban on pause, North Dakota law had allowed abortion up until 20 weeks or more post-fertilization.
    
            In a statement to CNN, Burgum said SB 2150 “clarifies and refines existing state law which was triggered into effect by the Dobbs decision and reaffirms North Dakota as a pro-life state.” 
    
            Physicians who violate the new law could be charged with a felony. In addition, an abortion can’t be performed until a woman is offered the opportunity to see an “active ultrasound” at least 24 hours before the scheduled procedure.
    
            Any physician who fails to comply could face a misdemeanor charge. 
    
            Last week, Burgum signed a bill banning gender-affirming care for most minors with the possibility of a felony for health care professionals who provide it.

      Kamala Harris to make the case for Biden’s reelection at abortion rights rally

            Vice President Kamala Harris will make the case for President Joe Biden’s reelection bid Tuesday at a political rally on reproductive freedom, a Harris adviser told CNN, saying that “finishing the job” for 2024 is about fighting to protect abortion access among other rights facing nationwide restrictions.
    
            Harris will “highlight the extremism of elected Republicans and the unrelenting attacks on women and healthcare providers state by state,” the adviser said.
    
            The vice president will speak at a major rally on the same day Biden announced his reelection bid, drawing an immediate contrast with Biden who is likely to shun more campaign-style events in the coming months. Earlier, a Biden adviser previously told CNN, “He’s just gonna keep doing his schedule.”
    
            The reproductive freedom rally at the vice president’s alma mater Howard University will be a high-profile moment for Harris, crystallizing her role as the administration’s lead messenger in its efforts to safeguard access to abortion on a day where all eyes are on the White House following Biden’s announcement. Abortion rights protests were featured prominently in Biden’s long-awaited reelection campaign announcement video, in which he made the implicit case that he needed another term to restore the nation’s character. 
    
            But Biden and Harris face significant political headwinds in their bid for a second term, including low approval numbers and an unenthusiastic American electorate. A majority of voters, recent polling shows, does not want Biden to seek a second term, citing age as a major factor. 
    
            Still, the president’s said in his Tuesday video “the question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer,” a clear indication that issues like abortion will loom large in his argument for American voters to vote against “MAGA extremists,” and secure him a second term. Abortion rights were a motivating issue for Democrats during the 2022 midterm election and Biden officials hope to utilize the same energy in 2024.
    
            “It’s a winning issue for them,” a source close to the vice president’s office told CNN.
    
            Harris was also featured heavily in Biden’s announcement video, appearing 13 times over the course of the three-minute spot. The centrality of the vice president in the video’s imagery appeared to serve multiple purposes: to emphasize a younger generation of Democrats in Biden’s world, even as he enters his 80s; to underscore the importance of Black support; and to bolster Harris herself, who has been dogged by questions about her political operation, acumen and whether she should remain on the 2024 ticket over the course of her vice presidency.
    
            Harris’ remarks will track closely with Biden’s campaign video message. Harris is expected to “describe the moment we’re in,” according to the adviser, in which reproductive rights are “under attack.” Harris will call out “extremist” Republicans who seek to make abortion bans federal law. She’ll also discuss book bans, voting rights and gun safety, the adviser said.
    
            This will be the vice president’s second appearance at a rally on abortion in the last two weeks. In Los Angeles earlier this month, Harris made a surprise stop at a reproductive rights, calling on demonstrators to fight for access to abortion and “fundamental rights” after the Texas ruling on the abortion pill mifepristone.
    
            “When you attack the rights of women in America, you are attacking America,” Harris said at a rally in front of LA City Hall on April 15.
    
            Harris’ Tuesday remarks also come less than a week after the Supreme Court issued a brief protecting access to medication abortion and blocking a court ruling that revoked FDA approval of the drug mifepristone while an appeal works its way through lower courts.
    
            The vice president is set to join leaders from Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the ACLU and Emily’s List at a Tuesday rally at 6 p.m. ET.  
    
            Harris’ advisers say she, like Biden, will mostly maintain her regular schedule in the coming months, leveraging the power of the vice presidency and bully pulpit during her official White House events and travel outside of Washington that in recent months has focused on abortion rights, climate and upholding democracy broadly in effort to tout the administration’s agenda and draw contrast with the right.
    
            Before the rally, Harris will host South Korea President Yoon for a visit to the NASA Space Flight Center and tour Goddard facilities, receive briefings from scientists on cooperative efforts regarding space exploration and addressing the climate crisis, and discuss both the present and the future of the countries’ partnership in space. They will also meet with Korean-American space experts, according to a White House official.

      Haley courts moderates with anti-abortion speech as GOP struggles with the issue

            Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday acknowledged the steep challenge Republicans face in trying to enact hardline national restrictions but said she believed the federal government should play a role in regulating the procedure and called for a “constructive conversation” on the polarizing issue.
    
            She argued that the next president of the United States would need to find “national consensus” on abortion.
    
            “No Republican president will have the ability to ban abortion nationwide,” Haley said at the SBA Pro-Life America headquarters in Arlington, Virginia – a group that has said it will oppose any presidential candidate who doesn’t support a 15-week national abortion ban. “We have to face this reality. The pro-life laws that have passed in strongly Republican states will not be approved at the federal level.”
    
            Haley, who emphasized she is “unapologetic” and “unhesitant” about her anti-abortion views, notably did not endorse a 15-week ban or specify what kind of national ban she would support.
    
            Her remarks came as abortion emerges as a central issue among 2024 Republican hopefuls, who want to attract GOP base voters who favor strict anti-abortion policies without alienating more moderate voters ahead of the general election.
    
            “I do believe there is a federal role on abortion,” Haley said. “Whether we can save more lives nationally depends entirely on doing what no one has done to date – finding consensus. That’s what I will strive to do.”
    
            She pointed to a bill she signed as governor of South Carolina that made it illegal for a woman in the state to obtain an abortion after her pregnancy reaches 20 weeks.
    
            “My record on abortion is long and clear,” she said.
    
            Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade last summer, the Republican Party has struggled at times to maneuver the politics of abortion. Democrats had a stronger-than-expected showing in the 2022 midterms as they tapped into supporters of abortion rights, who were motivated in the wake of the high court’s ruling and as several conservative states moved to ban or severely restrict abortion. Conservative candidates have lost several competitive races, including a Wisconsin Supreme Court election earlier this month, in which abortion was a key issue.
    
            A recent CBS poll showed that 58% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, which includes 62% of independent voters and 29% of Republicans.
    
            On Tuesday, Haley noted in the wake of the US Supreme Court ruling that there is no constitutional right to an abortion different states in the nation have veered in sharply different directions on abortion.
    
            “That’s what the founders of our country envisioned,” she said.
    
            Since former President Donald Trump’s early entry into the race last year, anti-abortion advocates have called on Republican presidential hopefuls to address the issue head on and plainly state their position, arguing that not doing so will repeat the losses in 2022, during which candidates ignored and flubbed their answers on abortion. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel spoke in a recent speech about the importance of directly addressing the issue.  
    
            Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, warned that the organization will oppose any candidate who doesn’t support restricting abortion on the federal level at 15 weeks or less of pregnancy. The influential group, however, understands that it may take candidates some time to define their position and does not plan to announce who it will support until after the GOP primary debates.
    
            “Anyone who wants to run for president or any federal office will have to satisfy that requirement or they won’t get the support of this movement,” she told CNN. “That healthy debate on that debate stage is where this will all be worked out in terms of who the candidate should be, and may the best man or woman win.”
    
            Already, in a sign of SBA Pro-Life’s sway, Trump’s campaign on Friday backed off of its stance that abortion should be decided at the state level following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. A day after criticism from Dannenfelser, the Trump campaign said that the former president “believes it is in the States where the greatest advances can now take place to protect the unborn” and highlighted his appointments of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court.
    
            Dannenfelser told CNN that Trump’s shift was “a movement in the right direction.”
    
            As the 2024 Republican presidential field forms, abortion is emerging as a key issue that could differentiate GOP candidates as they battle it out for their party’s nomination – with the clearest divide over whether there should be a federal ban on abortion.
    
            Trump so far has not made abortion a key issue in his campaign and did not mention it once in his reelection launch speech in November. The former president has instead been preoccupied with his legal entanglements and ongoing grievances over the 2020 presidential election.
    
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce a presidential bid in the coming months, made his state one of the most restrictive in the country for abortion access by signing a bill banning most abortions after six weeks. The day after signing the bill during a private late-night ceremony, he avoided specifically mentioning it during a short speech at the conservative Baptist school Liberty University.
    
            But the move attracted approval from another expected 2024 contender, former Vice President Mike Pence.
    
            “I want to commend Florida and their governor for moving the heartbeat bill,” he said during an interview on Fox News.
    
            Pence’s position on the issue long has been very clear. He told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer last month that “of course” he supports a six-week federal ban. He was the only Republican presidential hopeful to almost immediately comment on the Texas judge’s ruling on the abortion pill, issuing a statement celebrating the decision, when many in the GOP were silent on the matter. 
    
            On Monday, Pence also pushed back on the idea that Republicans will pay a political price for passing restrictive abortion laws.
    
            “I really believe if we meet this moment with principle and compassion, and you look at races around the country, men and women that did that did well in 2022, and I believe we can lead on it and win in 2024 if we stand for life,” he told NewsNation.
    
            Ahead of her speech, Haley had been reluctant to identify a detailed abortion policy she would support if elected president, saying in Iowa earlier this month that she didn’t want to “get into that game” of defining at what point in a pregnancy she would support an abortion ban. She also said that states should take the lead on the sensitive topic but didn’t fully discount supporting a federal ban at some point.
    
            Meanwhile, in his announcement of his exploratory committee, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott vowed to “protect our most fundamental right, the right to life itself,” but has recently given multiple different answers when asked about specifics.
    
            In an April 12 interview with CBS, he was evasive about whether he’d support a federal abortion ban. But a day later, he told New Hampshire station WMUR that he’d “definitely” sign a 20-week ban on abortion. And most recently, Scott said he would sign the most restrictive bill that can pass Congress.
    
            Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, another 2024 contender, told Fox News that he would sign a 15-week ban if he were elected president, but added that he prefers that the states resolve the issue.
    
            “I’ve always signed pro-life bills and if a pro-life bill comes to me that sets reasonable restrictions but also has the appropriate exemptions, yes I would sign it,” he said. He supports exceptions for life of the mother and in cases of rape and incest.
    
            But some Republicans who identify as “pro-life,” including biotech founder Vivek Ramaswamy, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have decidedly squashed the idea of a federal abortion ban, saying regulating abortion should be left to the states.
    
            In an interview with CNN over the weekend, Ramaswamy said he was against a federal ban. 
    
            “This has always been an issue for the states. Roe v. Wade got it wrong, now we’ve got it right and we have to stand on principle. Now it’s an issue for states,” he said. Later this week, in South Carolina, Ramaswamy will hold what his campaign is calling a “life town hall” at the Carolina Pregnancy Center, which hosted several of the GOP presidential candidates in 2016.
    
            Sununu, who’s weighing a run for president, argued on CNN last week that abortion is “not a presidential issue” and said that the GOP should instead focus on other matters such as inflation, mental health access and border security.
    
            On CNN, Sununu criticized his party for being “awful” with its messaging on abortion and said that when Republicans discuss more restrictive laws, they alienate voters and lose elections.
    
            “I support that a state should be able to design their path, right? We shouldn’t have national abortion bans. I disagree with six weeks vehemently, of course, that’s a horrible position to be. And it’s upsetting a lot of folks, because a lot of Republicans are realizing it’s going to hurt our message and hurt our ability to win states,” he said in interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett last week.
    
            He had signed a 24-week ban on abortion within the state’s 2021 budget that includes exceptions for fatal fetal diagnoses and the life of the mother.
    
            Asked about SBA Pro-Life America’s litmus test, Christie told CNN, “For 50 years, we’ve argued that this isn’t a constitutional right, and it isn’t, that we should let the states decide. … We now have that opportunity because of Dobbs and I think that’s what we should do.”
    
            In her interview with CNN, Dannenfelser said that “unless there is a strong federal role” in limiting abortion, “then we will in the end lose,” arguing that abortion rights activists have mobilized to halt states from passing restrictions.
    
            “There is no Republican candidate that will get the support of the pro-life movement, evangelicals, Catholics and secular people who support the pro-life cause who rejects such a limit (of 15 weeks),” Dannenfelser told CNN.

      Advocacy groups sue to block an emergency rule limiting gender-affirming care that’s expected to go into effect this week in Missouri

    ","
            Advocacy groups sued the Missouri Attorney General Monday after he announced an “emergency rule” limiting transgender care for minors and adults – a rule that is expected to go into effect this week, his office announced this month.
    
            Gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender, the gender by which one wants to be known. 
    
            The new rule claims people often take “life-altering interventions,” like pubertal suppression or gender transition surgery, “without any talk therapy at all,” and that the emergency action is “needed because of a compelling governmental interest and a need to protect the public health, safety, and welfare” of Missourians. 
    
            Among other stipulations, the rule says it’s “unlawful” for individuals or health care providers to provide gender-affirming care without confirming that a patient has “for at least the 3 most recent consecutive years … exhibited a medically documented, long-lasting, persistent and intense pattern of gender dysphoria.”  
    
            The rule is expected to go into effect Thursday and will expire February 6, 2024, a release from Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office reads.
    
            Petitioners sued to stop the rule, asking the Circuit Court of Saint Louis County to declare it invalid “due to the Attorney General’s lack of statutory authority to promulgate it” in addition to other legal arguments, according to the petition filed by advocacy groups representing Southampton Community Healthcare in St. Louis and several providers and patients.
    
            “The Rule targets gender-affirming care with unprecedented and unique restrictions so onerous that it effectively prohibits the provision of this necessary, safe, and effective care for many, if not most, transgender people in Missouri,” the petition says.
    
            The suit also seeks a stay on the rule’s expected Thursday start date and requests that the court award reasonable fees and expenses as well as any relief the court deems just and proper, the petition says. 
    
            “Our regulation enacts basic safeguards for interventions that an international medical consensus has determined to be experimental,” Bailey said in a statement to CNN. “Rather than ensure that patients are protected by common sense safeguards, these organizations are racing to court in an effort to continue their ideologically-based procedures masquerading as medicine.”
    
            The attorney general’s office said earlier Monday that the regulation “is based on dozens of scientific studies and reports, which are cited in endnotes.”
    
            Civil rights organization Lambda Legal fired back at Bailey’s statement.
    
            “This emergency rule is an unprecedented attempt to prevent broad categories of transgender people – including adults – from being able to obtain gender-affirming care, which is evidence-based, supported by the overwhelming medical consensus of major medical organizations, and in no way ‘experimental’,” a statement from Lambda Legal attorney Nora Huppert said. “And any ‘race’ to obtain relief against this rule is purely a result of the Attorney General’s decision to implement sweeping, draconian regulations that threaten trans people’s access to medically necessary care, even decades into their transition, on two weeks’ notice.” 
    
            An organization that focuses on issues in transgender health, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, and one of its affiliates, the United States Professional Association for Transgender Health, have said the rule is based in part on “flawed reports.”
    
            “The emergency regulation issued by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is based upon manipulated statistics, flawed reports, and incomplete data, and prevents the provision of medically necessary care,” the associations said last month, reacting to an earlier announcement from Bailey’s office about the forthcoming regulation.
    
            The petition filed Monday says transgender patients at Southampton Community Healthcare – one of the plaintiffs – “have expressed to its providers that they fear they will be denied continuation of their hormone therapy if they share symptoms of other mental health issues.” 
    
            “Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s emergency order is a baseless and discriminatory attempt to limit the healthcare options for transgender individuals, who already face several barriers accessing necessary and life-saving medical care,” Southampton Community Healthcare’s Dr. Samuel Tochtrop said in a statement. “It’s our privilege as Southampton Community Healthcare to fight this rule on behalf of transgender Missourians.” 
    
            The president and CEO of the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD called the measure “an unprecedented attempt to restrict an entire group of people.”  
    
            “The rule issued by Missouri’s attorney general includes outright lies and falsehoods about best practice care supported by every major medical association,” Sarah Kate Ellis said in a news release. “This is an unprecedented attempt to restrict an entire group of people from being able to make informed medical decisions in order to live and thrive.”  
    
            “Health care decisions need to remain between patients, their doctors, and their loved ones – not subject to the whim of craven politicians looking to score political points,” Ellis said. “GLAAD is sending all of our support to our organizational partners and activists in Missouri, who are working hard to undo this unconstitutional directive as soon as possible. Transgender people belong, and this rule will not stand.” 
    
            The action in Missouri comes after North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill this week banning gender-affirming care for most minors with the possibility of a felony for health care professionals who provide it. Indiana and Idaho enacted their own bans on gender-affirming care for youths this month, and several other states have signed into law restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors in the past few years.

      Amid contradictory laws, hospitals in one state were unable to explain policies on emergency abortion care, study finds

    ","
            Oklahoma’s laws restricting abortions have created a confusing, contradictory environment that may have a chilling effect on health care, new research says.
    
            After the US Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion last year with the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, several states quickly passed laws that restricted such procedures. A report released Tuesday and described in the medical journal the Lancet finds that the laws in at least one state left workers at many hospitals confused about how to proceed.
    
            When the court made its decision, the Oklahoma law that criminalized abortion in 1910 went back into effect, according to the state’s attorney general. Lawmakers then created multiple overlapping laws that further criminalized abortion and increased penalties for those who performed or assisted in an abortion procedure, according to the new report from Physicians for Human Rights, Oklahoma Call for Reproductive Justice and the Center for Reproductive Rights. 
    
            The Oklahoma laws allow abortion in the case of a medical emergency, but one doesn’t define a medical emergency. Another says it allows for the “preservation of life in a medical emergency,” defined as causing “substantial and irreversible body of bodily impairment” – which is not a medical term, experts say. 
    
            To understand exactly how well Oklahoma hospitals understood the laws, the researchers used a “secret shopper method,” study co-author Dr. Michele Heisler said.
    
            Researchers posed as prospective patients and called 34 hospitals to ask about the emergency pregnancy care they offered.
    
            Heisler said that when the researchers designed the study, she expected the hospitals to tell the patients that they could get help in an emergency but that a second provider might have to sign off on an abortion or that a doctor would have to get the decision past an “onerous” hospital oversight committee. 
    
            “What we weren’t expecting is that there would be so much confusion and contradictory information and really not clear information,” said Heisler, who is medical director at Physicians for Human Rights and a professor of internal medicine and public health at the University of Michigan. 
    
            The researchers said that none of the hospitals they contacted in Oklahoma was totally able to articulate clear, consistent policies for emergency obstetric care to potential patients.
    
            Specifically, 65% – 22 of the 34 hospitals – were unable to provide information about policies, procedures or the support provided to doctors when it is clinically necessary to terminate a pregnancy to save the life of a pregnant patient.
    
            In 14 of the 22 cases, hospital representatives provided unclear and/or incomplete answers about whether doctors require approval to perform a medically necessary abortion.
    
            Three of the hospitals said they do not provide abortions at all, even though it remains legal in the case of a medical emergency or to “preserve the life” of the pregnant person. Four others provided information that was factually wrong, the report says.  
    
            Four hospitals said they had formal approval processes that clinicians must go through if they have a situation in which it is medically necessary to terminate a pregnancy; they cannot make that decision on their own.
    
            Three hospitals indicated that they have policies for these situations but refused to share any information about them.
    
            “Unfortunately, it is being just left up to individual health systems and clinicians to try to make sense of these laws and provide guidance and support,” Heisler said.
    
            The Oklahoma Hospital Association said it has been in conversations with Oklahoma’s medical licensure boards to seek clarity about the state’s conflicting abortion laws.
    
            The association sent guidance to its members in September to explain what it interpreted as “saving the life of a pregnant woman” and what the laws would mean for a person made pregnant through rape or incest, among other issues. The guidance explains that the state’s criminal laws do not make an exception for these circumstances unless it is to save the life of someone who is pregnant in a medical emergency. 
    
            The guidance also warns that a person convicted of “administering, prescribing, advising, or procuring a woman to take any medicine drug or substance, or a person convicted of using or employing any instruction or ‘other means whatever,’ with the intent to procure an abortion, shall be guilty of a felony punishable by two (2) to (5) years imprisonment. From August 27, 2022, forward, a person convicted of performing or attempting to perform an abortion shall be guilty of a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) and/or imprisonment not to exceed ten (10) years.”
    
            The guidance says the “persons potentially liable” are the provider, not the pregnant person.
    
            Study co-author Rabia Muqaddam, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights who is working on multiple cases challenging the abortion bans in Oklahoma, called the overlapping laws a “bizarre” situation. 
    
            “Aside from the fact that there are so many of them is that they all conflict,” she said. “All of the laws have inconsistent definitions, which is where a lot of the confusion comes from for health care providers. What’s most dangerous for patients is the fact that the definitions of medical emergency and life-preserving abortions is unclear and inconsistent.” 
    
            “If I was the hospital general counsel and I was looking at these laws, I have absolutely no idea what my physician could or could not do in any particular circumstance,” she said.
    
            When there is a lack of clarity and when penalties are involved, “what you get is massive chill.”
    
            “Physicians are terrified. They’re terrified that if they make the wrong decision, they’re going to go to jail. They’re going to lose their license. And at the other end of that is that patients are being seriously harmed,” Muqaddam said. 
    
            Sonia M. Suter, a professor of law at George Washington University who was not involved in the new research, said recent abortion laws have created “such a mess.”
    
            “You are telling physicians that they have two conflicting obligations,” said Suter, whose scholarship focuses on issues at the intersection of law, medicine and bioethics, with a particular focus on reproductive rights. 
    
            There is an obligation to stabilize patients in emergencies that may not always qualify as “life-threatening,” but doctors and hospitals could also risk being sued because the doctors are not following the standard of care, “which you can’t do with how some of these exceptions are worded.”
    
            She said hospitals also don’t know how the laws will be applied. Lawyers typically will instruct institutions to interpret the law as conservatively as possible, and physicians may be equally conservative because they don’t want to risk their licenses or face stiff penalties. 
    
            “It’s just devastating for everybody,” Suter said. “It’s just cruel.”
    
            Molly Meegan, general counsel for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said state laws to restrict abortion with emergency exceptions are not comprehensive. 
    
            “They can’t be applied in a medical situation. They just aren’t practical,” she said. “They have an ethical and personal duty to their patients to do what is best for their patients. It can at times be in direct conflict with whatever the laws are, especially if they’re vague, and most of the ob/gyns throughout the country, including in Oklahoma, are in an impossible situation.”
    
            Meegan and Suter both believe the confusion will lead to the deaths of more women. Those who survive may be left with dire health problems, including losing the ability to have children in the future. 
    
            “They already have horrific maternal mortality and infant mortality rates,” Suter said. “It feels like the end of evidence-based medicine.”
    
            According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Oklahoma persistently ranks among the states with the worst rates of maternal deaths, even before the new abortion laws went into effect. The state had a maternal mortality rate of 25.2 deaths per 100,000 live births for 2018-20, well above the national average. 
    
            For communities of color, the rate is significantly worse, according to the Oklahoma Health Department. 
    
            White women had 23.2 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births for 2018-20, the lowest rate overall in Oklahoma. The rates for Black women and Native American women were about twice as high: 49.4 and 44.4, respectively.
    
            Oklahoma is not alone. The 13 states where most abortions are banned generally have some of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the country, Heisler said. Even more states could be restricting abortion access soon, the experts believe, with potentially more problems to come.
    
            “The hostile climate many states are creating for the health care field by enacting criminal and other penalties for abortion care is an outcome whose reverberations we are only just beginning to see,” said Kelly Baden, vice president for public policy at the reproductive health nonprofit Guttmacher Institute. 
    
            Heisler noted that the researchers don’t blame the hospitals or the doctors for this confusion. Overall, she said, the staffers who talked to the researchers “were wonderful,” despite the circumstances.
    
            “They were empathetic. They said, ‘I completely understand.’ They tried to give answers. They acted in good faith. But really, none of the hospitals were really able to say what we were hoping for, which is to unequivocally state that they would stand behind their clinicians and that clinicians at their facilities would be able to use their best clinical judgment for the individual case and that it would be made as medical decisions should be in collaboration with the patient, taking into account to their needs, their preferences and their values,” she said. 
    
            “We are recognizing that hospitals and clinicians are in an untenable situation,” Heisler added.

      A Texas family fought for weeks to regain custody of their newborn. Experts say the case shows how Black parents are criminalized.

    ","
            A Black Texas couple has been reunited with their newborn daughter after authorities removed the baby and placed her in foster care last month citing a doctor’s concerns about how they were treating a jaundice diagnosis. 
    
            Rodney and Temecia Jackson of DeSoto, Texas, regained custody of their daughter, Mila, on April 20 following a nearly month-long battle with the state’s Child Protective Services, according to The Afiya Center, a reproductive justice advocacy group.
    
            A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Family Protective Services, which includes CPS, confirmed to CNN that the office had recommended a dismissal of the case to an assistant district attorney. Mila’s release was granted on Thursday, according to a court filing. 
    
            The Jacksons had been pleading for Mila’s return in videos posted to social media, and news conferences as reproductive justice activists protested and rallied behind the family. 
    
            The removal, the Jacksons say, was sparked by their decision to let their midwife treat Mila’s jaundice instead of taking her to the hospital for care as their doctor had recommended. Temecia Jackson said during a news conference earlier this month that she gave birth to Mila at home on March 21 with the help of a midwife and wanted that same trusted midwife to provide medical care for her baby. But Mila’s pediatrician disagreed with this decision and ultimately contacted CPS, Temecia Jackson said. 
    
            “We’ve been treated like criminals,” Rodney Jackson said during the news conference. “This is a nightmare that I wouldn’t wish on anyone.” 
    
            Reproductive justice advocates say Mila’s removal is just the latest example of the criminalization of Black parents, who lose their children to the child welfare system at disproportionate rates. In the US in 2018, Black children made up 23% of youth in foster care, but only 14% of the nation’s child population, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Additionally, one study found that between 2003-2014, 53% of Black children were the subjects of child welfare investigations by the time they reached age 18.
    
            Marsha Jones, executive director of The Afiya Center – a Dallas, Texas, based non-profit that advocates for Black women and girls –  said there is a systemic problem with the child welfare system that unfairly targets Black parents. In many cases, Black families have their first experiences with the criminal justice system in family court, Jones said. 
    
             “It’s almost unspoken and unseen because there is just this thought that Black women are not good parents and that we are criminalized because of poverty,” Jones told CNN. “This is not new.”
    
            Jones said the center stepped in last month to support the Jackson family and put pressure on public officials to return Mila home. She believes this played a role in reuniting the family last week. 
    
            “There’s no reason this baby should have been removed from her home,” Jones told CNN. “This family was not being heard. The Black midwife wasn’t being heard.”
    
            Rodney and Temecia Jackson could not be reached for comment.
    
            In a letter to CPS obtained by CNN affiliate WFAA, the family’s pediatrician, Dr. Anand Bhatt, who is with the Baylor Scott & White healthcare system, wrote that while the Jacksons “are very loving and they care dearly” about Mila, “their distrust for medical care and guidance has led them to make a decision for the baby to refuse a simple treatment that can prevent brain damage.”
    
            “I authorized the support of CPS to help get this baby the care that was medically necessary and needed,” the letter continued. 
    
            CBS News, which obtained a copy of the affidavit filed by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, reported that Bhatt reached out to a DFPS investigator on March 25 and indicated that Mila’s bililrubin test showed levels of 21.7 milligrams. 
    
            A bilirubin test can screen for jaundice and other conditions. That level was “cause for a lot of concern,” Bhatt told the investigator, according to CBS News, and could lead to brain damage, he said, “because the bilirubin can cross the blood brain barrier.” 
    
            Bhatt said he reserved a bed for Mila at Children’s Medical Center of Dallas and asked the Jacksons to take her there or he would call police for a welfare check, according to court documents obtained by CBS News. WFAA reported that Bhatt wanted Mila to receive phototherapy – a common treatment for jaundice. 
    
            But court documents, according to CBS News, say Rodney Jackson told Bhatt he and Temecia Jackson planned to treat their baby “naturally” and didn’t believe in “modern medicine.” 
    
            The midwife, Cheryl Edinbyrd, told CBS News the family had ordered a blanket and goggles to provide light therapy to treat Mila’s jaundice. 
    
            When the Jacksons didn’t show up at the hospital, a CPS investigator and police went to the Jackson’s home at 4 a.m. on March 25 but Rodney Jackson declined to speak with them, according to court documents obtained by CBS News. An hour later, authorities returned with an ambulance and fire truck and Rodney Jackson still denied them entry. 
    
            Authorities returned to the home on March 30 with a warrant and arrested Rodney Jackson on charges of preventing the execution of a civil process, according to CBS News. Police entered the home and took Mila from Temecia Jackson. According to CBS News, the Jacksons’ other two children were not removed. 
    
            Temecia Jackson said in a press conference that when she asked to see the affidavit, she noticed it had the name of a different mother on it. 
    
            “Instantly I felt like they had stolen my baby as I had had a home birth and they were trying to say that my baby belonged to this other woman,” Temecia Jackson. 
    
            Marissa Gonzales, a spokesperson from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, said in an email to CNN that her department was given an incorrect name for the initial affidavit. The mistake, she said, was corrected in the case filings. 
    
            Gonzales declined an interview with CNN to discuss the case further, citing “state confidentiality restrictions.”
    
            “It is always the goal of DFPS to safely reunite children with their parents,” Gonzales also said. “The decision about when that happens rests with the judge who ordered the removal.”
    
            CNN’s request to interview Bhatt was also denied by Baylor Scott & White. 
    
            “In respect of patient privacy, it is inappropriate to provide comment on this matter,” the health system said in an emailed statement. “We do abide by reporting requirements set forth in the Texas Family Code and any other applicable laws.”
    
            Advocates say the racial bias of professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers has created inequity in the child welfare system.
    
            Dorothy Roberts, a law professor and sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said decisions to report neglect and abuse are largely shaped by racist stereotypes of Black families. 
    
            The child welfare system, she said, needs to consider the trauma inflicted on children when they are separated from their families. 
    
            “We have to ask whether there is a better way of addressing children’s medical needs instead of the system we have now where doctors are reporting suspicions, which we know is highly biased, and investigating families, which we know is very traumatic,” said Roberts, author of “Torn Apart: How the Child Welfare System Destroys Black Families – and How Abolition Can Build a Safer World.” “Hospitals should not be places of fear for parents.”
    
            Roberts said there is also a longstanding cultural conflict between the healthcare system and midwives who are often devalued. Black midwives provided care for mothers for hundreds of years, delivering the babies of enslaved women and even slave owners’ wives. But as medicine became more professionalized in the late 1800s, male doctors wanted to take control of childbirth, with some suggesting midwives were unfit, according to a report by Vox. 
    
            Monica Simpson, executive director of Sistersong, a reproductive justice organization advocating for women of color, said many Black women are choosing midwives because they have lost trust in doctors and hospitals. 
    
            Much of that is driven by the harrowing statistics: Black women are 2.6 times likelier to die of pregnancy-related complications than White women, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
    
            Black infants also die at more than twice the rate of White infants, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
    
            Simpson said the child welfare system is broken. She said racism has played a part in the continued criminalization and separation of Black families.
    
            “There’s been this narrative that Black women can’t parent their children properly,” Simpson said. “We have been battling these narratives for decades. The way that Black women are criminalized around their motherhood, it’s horrible.”

      Japan approves first abortion pill, decades after other countries
    ","

    ","
            A panel in Japan’s health ministry has approved the country’s first abortion pill, in a major step for reproductive rights decades after other countries made abortion medication widely available.
    
            The ministry’s pharmaceutical board granted approval on Friday to the MeFeego Pack, an abortion pill manufactured by British pharmaceutical Linepharma, according to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. 
    
            The ministry had first convened in January to review the drug, before asking for the public to submit their opinions through an online portal. It will now go to the health minister for final approval.
    
            The medication consists of two types of pill, and can be used within nine weeks of pregnancy, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. In a clinical trial in Japan, 93% of participants had a complete abortion within 24 hours, NHK reported.
    
            The medication combines mifepristone and misoprostol, which the World Health Organization has included in its Essential Medicines List, described as safe and effective for pregnant people.
    
            To date, only surgical abortion is available in Japan through two methods: the curettage method, which removes tissue inside the uterus with a metal instrument, and the evacuation method, which sucks out tissue through a tube, according to NHK.
    
            The WHO has described curettage as an “obsolete” method that is less safe and much more painful, and has called for it to be replaced by the evacuation method or by medication like abortion pills.
    
            The move also comes as abortion and reproductive rights have gained revived attention worldwide, with the US Supreme Court reversing overturned Roe v. Wade last year – ruling that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion. 
    
            Since then, a number of states have restricted access to abortions, while others moved to increase access.
    
            The Japanese panel’s decision on Friday was celebrated by the country’s medical experts online. 
    
            Kanako Inaba, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, wrote on Twitter that the approval of abortion pills was an opportunity to spread greater sex education and awareness about contraceptive methods. 
    
            Japanese activists have been pushing for years for approval of the pills, with similar medications made available decades ago in other countries as Japan lagged ever further behind. 
    
            For instance, mifepristone was first approved in France in 1988, and in the US in 2000.
    
            But others also pointed to the long road ahead, calling for greater protection for women. 
    
            Mihyon Song, another well-known Japanese obstetrician and gynaecologist, pointed to Japan’s controversial abortion laws, which require spousal consent – which activists have long argued denies women the right to make decisions on their own body.
    
            Under Japan’s existing laws, women can only receive an abortion if a pregnancy “may significantly damage the person’s physical health due to bodily or economic reasons” or if they became pregnant due to rape.

      Governor: Massachusetts didn’t wait for the SCOTUS abortion medication ruling. It protected women’s reproductive rights
    ","
			Opinion by Maura T. Healey
		","
  Updated
        9:20 PM EDT, Sun April 23, 2023
    ","
            The Supreme Court made the right call with its order last week that mifepristone, a widely used abortion medication, can remain on the market for the time being. Unfortunately, the decision won’t stop attacks on reproductive freedom.
    
            In states such as Massachusetts that protect civil rights and women’s health, we will be ready.
    
            Every American should be deeply concerned that one extreme, Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas came close to overturning the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, which has been used safely and effectively for more than 20 years.
    
            Mifepristone is used in nearly half of abortions in my state. The judge’s decision, which ran contrary to science, medicine and the law, was an attack on women and on our health care system. And it would have disproportionately harmed those who already face the highest barriers to care and are less able to travel elsewhere to access it — people of color, immigrants, the LGBTQ community and people with disabilities.
    
            It’s alarming that in the interest of advancing its nationwide crusade against reproductive freedom, the anti-abortion movement was willing to challenge the FDA’s independent, trusted and science-based process for approving medications.
    
            Elements of this anti-women and anti-science movement have pushed for stringent abortion bans around the country as well as restrictions on insurance coverage for abortion. They’ve encouraged lawmakers to impose unwarranted restrictions on providers of reproductive health care, including the imposition of burdensome mandatory waiting periods for abortions.
    
            The ban on mifepristone, had it remained in place, would have set yet another dangerous precedent: Which lifesaving, FDA-approved medication would they try to ban next? Which new, innovative medications wouldn’t come to fruition because of these assaults on the FDA’s regulatory process?
    
            That’s why hundreds of prominent leaders in the drug and biotech industries raised the alarm. Their companies don’t make mifepristone, but they knew that if the ruling by the judge in Texas were allowed to go into effect, it would have had devastating consequences for the regulation of all medications.
    
            As the governor of Massachusetts, the nation’s hub for life sciences, my opposition to the court ruling in Texas was rooted in concern over the negative impact it would have on women, doctors, our health care system, innovation and our economy.
    
            That’s why I took action even before the ruling came down. In Massachusetts, we weren’t going to let one extremist judge restrict access to care for women in our state. At our request, the University of Massachusetts purchased 15,000 doses of mifepristone this month that providers across the state can access.
    
            Other health care providers purchased their own supplies, and we provided funding to assist state-contracted providers with the purchases. In total, we have enough doses in our state to last well over a year.
    
            I also took executive action to protect patients and providers who access these doses. Last year, following the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, Massachusetts passed a law that protects patients and providers from facing civil or criminal liability for receiving or performing an abortion in the state.
    
            And after the ruling in Texas, I signed an executive order confirming that these protections include medication abortion and medical management of miscarriage. This ensures that providers, including pharmacists, can continue to use, prescribe, dispense and administer mifepristone and will protect providers and patients from criminal and civil liability for accessing this essential care.
    
            The bottom line: As a result of the Supreme Court’s order staying the Texas judge’s decision, mifepristone remains safe, legal and available nationwide. And because of the action we took, it will remain that way in Massachusetts regardless of the final outcome of this case — or any future attacks on reproductive freedoms.
    
            We might have avoided the worst possible outcome for now, but we know the anti-abortion movement isn’t letting up. But neither will we. Already more than 20 million women have lost access to abortion in their states because of the overturning of Roe. Republican legislatures across the country are imposing cruel abortion bans and penalties on providers for doing their jobs. Clinics have been forced to close, and many of those that remain are overwhelmed with need.
    
            This attack on women’s freedoms is unacceptable. We will never stop protecting and expanding access to reproductive health care, including abortion. Democratic governors are going to continue leading this charge. We have the power to ensure that our states remain beacons of health, equity and hope — including welcoming those from states that are restricting abortion. We will always stand for civil rights and freedom.
    
            Medications should be approved based on their safety and efficacy — on science, not politics. Patients in Massachusetts will continue to have access to abortion care. And providers in our state — without fear of legal repercussions — will be able to give their patients the essential care that they need and deserve.

      These women ran an underground abortion network in the 1960s. Here’s what they fear might happen today

            The voice on the phone in 1966 was gruff and abrupt: “Do you want the Chevy, the Cadillac or the Rolls Royce?” 
    
            A Chevy abortion would cost about $200, cash in hand, the voice explained. A Cadillac was around $500, and the Rolls Royce was $1,000.
    
            “You can’t afford more than the Chevy? Fine,” the voice growled. “Go to this address at this time. Don’t be late and don’t forget the cash.” The voice disappeared. 
    
            Dorie Barron told CNN she recalls staring blankly at the phone in her hand, startled by the sudden empty tone. Then it hit her: She had just arranged an illegal abortion with the Chicago Mafia.
    
            The motel Barron was sent to was in an unfamiliar part of Chicago, a scary “middle of nowhere,” she said. She was told to go to a specific room, sit on the bed and wait. Suddenly three men and a woman came in the door. 
    
            “I was petrified. They spoke all of three sentences to me the entire time: ‘Where’s the money?’ ‘Lie back and do as I tell you.’ And finally ‘Get in the bathroom,’” when the abortion was over, Barron said. “Then all of a sudden they were gone.”
    
            Bleeding profusely, Barron managed to find a cab to take her home. When the bleeding didn’t stop, her bed-ridden mother made her go to the hospital.
    
            At 24, Barron was taking care of her ailing mother and her 2-year-old daughter when she discovered she was pregnant. Her boyfriend, who had no job and lived with his parents, “freaked,” said Barron, who appears in a recent HBO documentary. The boyfriend suggested she get an abortion. She had never considered that option. 
    
            “But what was I to do? My mom was taking care of my daughter from her bed while I worked — they would read and play games until I got home,” Barron said.”How was either of us going to cope with a baby?
    
            “Looking back, I realize I was taking my life in my hands,” said Barron, now an 81-year-old grandmother. “To this day it gives me chills. If I had died, what in God’s green earth would have happened to my mom and daughter?”
    
            Women in the 1960s endured restrictions relatively unknown to women today. The so-called “fairer sex” could not serve on juries and often could not get an Ivy League education. Women earned about half as much as a man doing the same job and were seldom promoted. 
    
            Women could not get a credit card unless they were married — and then only if their husband co-signed. The same applied to birth control — only the married need apply. More experienced women shared a workaround with the uninitiated: “Go to Woolworth, buy a cheap wedding-type ring and wear it to your doctor’s appointment. And don’t forget to smile.”
    
            Marital rape wasn’t legally considered rape. And, of course, women had no legal right to terminate a pregnancy until four states — Alaska, Hawaii, New York and Washington — legalized abortion in 1970, three years before Roe v. Wade became the law of the land. 
    
            Illinois had no such protection, said Heather Booth, a lifelong feminist activist and political strategist: “Three people discussing having an abortion in Chicago in 1965 was a conspiracy to commit felony murder.”
    
            Despite that danger, a courageous band of young women — most in their 20’s, some in college, some married with children — banded together in Chicago to create an underground abortion network. The group was officially created in 1969 as the “Abortion Counseling Service of Women’s Liberation.” 
    
            But after running ads in an underground newspaper: “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Call Jane,” each member of the group answered the phone as “Jane.” 
    
            “We were co-conspirators with the women who called us,” said 75-year-old Laura Kaplan, who published a book about the service in 1997 entitled “The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service.” 
    
            “We’ll protect you; we hope you’ll protect us,” Kaplan said.  “We’ll take care of you; we hope you’ll take care of us.”
    
            What started as referrals to legitimate abortion providers changed to personalized service when some members of Jane learned to safely do the abortions themselves. Between the late 1960s and 1973, the year that the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade, Jane had arranged or performed over 11,000 abortions. 
    
            “Our culture is always searching for heroes,” said Kaplan. “But you don’t have to be a hero to do extraordinary things. Jane was just ordinary people working together — and look what we could accomplish, which is amazing, right?”
    
            Even after several members were caught and arrested, the group continued to provide abortions for women too poor to travel to states where abortion had been legalized. 
    
            “I prayed a lot. I didn’t want to go to jail,” said 80-year-old Marie Learner, who allowed the Janes to perform abortions at her apartment.
    
            “Some of us had little children. Some were the sole breadwinners in their home,” Learner said. “It was fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds.”
    
            The story of Jane has been immortalized in Kaplan’s book, numerous print articles, a 2022 movie, “Call Jane,” starring Elizabeth Banks and Sigourney Weaver, and a documentary on HBO (which, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery). 
    
            Today the historical tale of Jane has taken on a new significance. After the 2022 Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade and the mid-term takeover of the US House of Representatives by Republicans, emboldened conservative lawmakers and judges have acted on their anti-abortion beliefs. 
    
            Currently more than a dozen states have banned or imposed severe restrictions on abortion.  Georgia has banned abortions after six weeks, even though women are typically unaware they are pregnant at that stage. In mid-April, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would ban most abortions after six weeks. It won’t go into effect until the state Supreme Court overturns its previous precedent on abortion. Several other states are considering similar legislation. In other states, judicial battles are underway to protect abortion access.  
    
            “It’s a horrific situation right now. People will be harmed, some may even die,” said Booth, who helped birth the Jane movement while in college.
    
            “Women without family support, without the information they need, may be isolated and either harm themselves looking to end an unwanted pregnancy or will be harmed because they went to an unscrupulous and illegal provider,” said Booth, now 77. 
    
            A key difference between the 60s and today is medication abortion, which 54% of people in the United States used to end a pregnancy in 2022. Available via prescription and through the mail, use of the drugs is two-fold: A person takes a first pill, mifepristone, to block the hormone needed for a pregnancy to continue.  A day or two later, the patient takes a second drug, misoprostol, which causes the uterus to contract, creating the cramping and bleeding of labor.
    
            In early April a Texas judge, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk – a Trump appointee who has been vocal about his anti-abortion stance — suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone despite 23 years of data showing the drug is safe to use, safer even than penicillin or Viagra. 
    
            On Friday, the Supreme Court froze the ruling and a subsequent decision by the Fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals at the request of the Justice Department and the drug manufacturer. The action allows access to mifepristone in states where it’s legal until appeals play out over the months to come.
    
            However, 15 states currently restrict access to medication abortion, even by mail.
    
            The actions of anti-abortion activists, who have been accused of “judge shopping” to get the decisions they want, is “an unprecedented attack on democracy meant to undermine the will of the vast majority of Americans who want this pill — mifepristone — to remain legal and available,” Heather Booth told CNN. 
    
            “This is a further weaponization of the courts to brazenly advance the end goal of banning abortion entirely,” she added. 
    
            If women in her day could have had access to medications that could be used safely in their homes, they would not have been forced to risk their lives, said Dorie Barron, thinking back to her own terrifying abortion in a sketchy Chicago motel.
    
            “I’m depressed as hell, watching stupid, indifferent men control and destroy women’s lives all over again,” she said. “I really fear getting an abortion could soon be like 1965.”
    
            Chicago college student Heather Booth had just finished a summer working with civil rights activists in Mississippi when she was asked to help with a different kind of injustice.
    
            A girl in another dorm was considering suicide because she was pregnant. Booth, who excelled at both organization and chutzpah, found a local doctor and negotiated an abortion for the girl. Word spread quickly.
    
            “There were about 100 women a week calling for help, much more than one person could handle,” Booth said. “I recruited about 12 other people and began training them how to do the counseling.”
    
            Counseling was a key part of the new service. This was a time when people “barely spoke about sex, how women’s bodies functioned or even how people got pregnant,” Booth said. To help each woman understand what was going to happen to them, Booth quizzed the abortion provider about every aspect of the procedure.
    
            “What do you do in advance? Will it be painful? How painful? Can you walk afterwards? Do you need someone to be with you to take you home?” The questions continued: “What amount of bleeding is expected, and can a woman handle it on their own? If there’s a problem is there an urgent number they can call?”
    
            Armed with details few if any physicians provided,  the counselors at Jane could fully inform each caller about the abortion experience. The group even published a flyer describing the procedure, long before the groundbreaking 1970 book “Our Bodies, Ourselves” began to educate women about their sexuality and health.
    
            “I don’t particularly like doctors because I always feel dissatisfied with the experience,” said Marie Learner, who spoke to many of the women who underwent an abortion at her home.
    
            “But after their abortion at Jane, women told me, ‘Wow, that was the best experience I’ve ever had with people helping me with a medical issue.’”
    
            Eileen Smith, now 73, was one of those women. “Jane made you feel like you were part of this bigger picture, like we were all in this together,” she said. “They helped me do this illegal thing and then they’re calling to make sure I’m OK? Wow!
    
            “For me, it helped battle the feeling that I was a bad person, that ‘What’s wrong with me? Why did I get pregnant? I should know better’ voice in my head,” said Smith. “It was priceless.”
    
            Many of the women who joined Jane had never experienced an abortion. Some viewed the work as political, a part of the burgeoning feminist movement. Others considered the service as simply humanitarian health care. All saw the work as an opportunity to respect each woman’s choice.
    
            “I was a stay-at-home mom with four kids,” said Martha Scott, who is now in her 80s. “We knew the woman needed to feel as though she was in control of what was happening to her. We were making it happen for her, but it was not about us. It was about her.”
    
            Some volunteers, like Dorie Barron, experienced the Jane difference firsthand when she found herself pregnant a few years after her abortion at the hands of the Mafia.
    
            “It was a 100% total reversal — I had never experienced such kindness,” Barron said. Not only did a Jane hold each woman’s hand and explain every step of the process, “they gave each of us a giant supply of maternity sanitary pads, and a nice big handful of antibiotics,” she said. “And for the next week, I got a phone call every other day to see how I was.”
    
            Barron soon began volunteering for Jane by providing pregnancy testing for women in the back of a church in Chicago’s Hyde Park.
    
            “It wasn’t just abortion,” Barron explained. “We also said, ‘You could consider adoption,’ and gave adoption referrals. And if the woman wanted to continue with her pregnancy, we said, ‘Fine, please by all that is holy make sure you get prenatal care, take your vitamins, and eat as best you can.’ It was women helping women with whatever they needed.”
    
            Most of the women who contacted Jane were unable to support themselves, in unhealthy relationships, or already had children at home, so the service was a way of “helping them get back on track,” said Smith, who, like Barron, had begun working for Jane after her abortion.
    
            “We were telling them ‘This isn’t the end of the world. You can continue to leave your boyfriend or your husband or continue to just take care of those kids you have.’ We were there to help them get through this,” said Smith, who later became a homecare nurse.
    
            Diane Stevens says she came to work for Jane after experiencing an abortion in 1968 at the age of 19. She was living in California at the time, which provided “therapeutic abortions” if approved in advance by physicians. 
    
            “I’d had a birth control failure, and I was coached by Planned Parenthood on how to do this,” said Stevens, now 74. “I had to see two psychiatrists and one doctor and tell them I was not able to go through with the pregnancy because it would a danger to both my physical and mental health.
    
            “I was admitted to the psychiatric ward, although I didn’t really know that — I thought I was just in a hospital bed. But oh no, ‘I was mentally ill,’ so that’s where they put me,” said Stevens, who later went to nursing school with Smith. “Then they wheeled me off for the abortion. I had general anesthesia, was there for two days, and then I was discharged. Isn’t that crazy?”
    
            Sakinah Ahad Shannon, now 75, was one of the few Black women who volunteered as a counselor at Jane. She joined after accompanying a friend who was charged a mere $50 for her abortion. At that time, Jane’s fee was between $1 and $100, based on what the woman could afford to pay, Shannon said.
    
            “When I walked in, I said, ‘Oh my God, here we go again. It’s a room of White women, archangels who are going to save the world,’” said Shannon, a social worker and member of the Congress of Racial Equality, an interracial group of non-violent activists who pioneered “Freedom Rides” and helped organize the March on Washington in 1963.
    
            What she heard and saw at her friend’s counseling session was so impressive it “changed my life,” Shannon said. She and her family later opened and operated three Chicago abortion clinics for over 25 years, all using the Jane philosophy of communication and respect.
    
            “It was a profoundly amazing experience for me,” she said. “I call the Janes my sisters. The color line didn’t matter. We were all taking the same risk.”
    
            It wasn’t long before the women discovered a “doctor” performing abortions for Jane had been lying about his credentials.  There was no medical degree — in the HBO documentary, he admitted he had honed his skills by assisting an abortion provider. 
    
            The group imploded. A number of members quit in horror and dismay. For the women who stayed, it was an epiphany, said Martha Scott. Like her, several of the Janes had been assisting this fake doctor for years, learning the procedures step by step. 
    
            “You’d learn how to insert a speculum, then how to swap out the vagina with an antiseptic, then how to give numbing shots around the cervix and then how to dilate the cervix. You learned and mastered each step before you moved on to the next,” said Laura Kaplan, who chronicled the procedure in her book.
    
            By now, several of the Janes were quite experienced and willing to do the work. Why not perform the abortions themselves? 
    
            “Clearly, this was an intense responsibility,” said Judith Acana, a 27-year-old high school teacher who joined Jane in 1970. She started her training by helping “long terms,” women who were four or five months along in the pregnancy.
    
            “Remember, abortion was illegal (in Illinois) so it could take weeks for a woman to find help,” said Arcana, now 80. “Frequently women who wanted an abortion at 8 or 10 weeks wound up being 16 or 18 weeks or more by the time they found Jane.”
    
            The miscarriage could happen quickly, but it rarely did, she said. It usually took anywhere from one to two days.  
    
            “Women who had no one to help them would come back when contractions started,” Arcana said. “One of my strongest memories is of a teenage girl who had an appointment to have her miscarriage on my living room floor.” 
    
            The group also paid two Janes to live in an apartment and be on call 24/7 to assist women who had no one to help them miscarry at home, said Arcana, a lifelong educator, author and poet. “But many women took care of it on their own, in very amazing and impressive and powerful ways,” she said.
    
            Any woman who had concerns or questions while miscarrying alone could always call Jane for advice any time of the day or night.
    
            “People would call in a panic: ‘The bleeding won’t stop,’” Smith recalled. “I would tell them, ‘Get some ice, put it on your stomach, elevate your legs, relax.’ And they would say ‘Oh my gosh, thank you!’ because they were so scared.”
    
            For women who were in their first trimester, Jane offered traditional D&C abortions — the same dilation and curettage used by hospitals then and today, said Scott, who performed many of the abortions for Jane.  Later the group used vacuum aspiration, which was over in a mere five to 10 minutes.  
    
            “Vacuum aspiration was much easier to do, and I think it’s less difficult for the woman,” Scott said. “Abortion is exactly like any other medical procedure. It’s the decision that’s an issue — the doing is very straightforward. This was something a competent, trained person could do.”
    
            It was May 3, 1972. Judith Arcana was the driver that day, responsible for relocating women waiting at what was called “the front” to a separate apartment or house where the abortions were done, known as “the place.” 
    
            On this day, a Wednesday, the “place” was a South Shore high-rise apartment. Arcana was escorting a woman who had completed her abortion when they were stopped by police at the elevator.
    
            “They asked us, ‘Which apartment did you come out of?’ And the poor woman burst into tears and blurted out the apartment number,” Arcana said. “They took me downstairs, put cuffs on me and hooked me to a steel hook inside of the police van.”
    
            Inside the apartment on the 11th floor, Martha Scott said she was setting up the bedroom for the next abortion when she heard a knock at the door, followed by screaming: “You can’t come in!”
    
            “I shut the bedroom door and locked it,” Scott said, then hid the instruments and sat on the bed to wait. It wasn’t long until a cop kicked the door in and made her join the other women in the living room.
    
            “We tell this joke about how the cops came in, saw all these women and said, ‘Where’s the abortionist?’ You know, assuming that it would be a man,” Scott said.
    
            By day’s end, seven members of Jane were behind bars: Martha Scott, Diane Stevens, Judy Arcana, Jeanne Galatzer-Levy, Abby Pariser, Sheila Smith and Madeleine Schwenk. Suddenly what had been an underground effort for years was front page headlines. 
    
            “Had we not gotten arrested, I think no one would ever have known about Jane other than the women we served,” Scott said.  
    
            An emergency meeting of Jane was called. The turnout was massive — even women who had not been active in months showed up, anxious to know the extent of the police probe, according to the women with whom CNN spoke.
    
            Despite widespread fear and worry, the group immediately began making alternate plans for women scheduled for abortions at Jane in the next few days to weeks. The group even paid for transportation to other cities where abortion had already been legalized, they said.
    
            News reports over the next few days gave further details of the bust: There was no widespread investigation by the police. It was a single incident, triggered by a call from a sister-in-law who was upset with her relative’s decision to have an abortion, they said.
    
            “It wasn’t long after I was arrested that I came back and worked for quite a few months,” said Scott, one of the few fully trained to do abortions.
    
            “I like to think I was a good soldier,” Scott said. “I like to think what did made a difference not only to a whole bunch of people, but also to ourselves. It gave us a sense of empowerment that comes when you do something that is hard to do and also right.”
    
            As paranoia eased, women began to come back to work at Jane, determined to carry on.
    
            “After the bust, we had a meeting and were told ‘Everybody needs to start assisting and learn how to do abortions.’ I was like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa!’” said Eileen Smith, who had not been arrested.  “But you felt like you really didn’t have much of a choice. We had to keep the service running.”
    
            The preliminary hearing for the arrested seven was in August. Several of the women in the apartment waiting for abortions the day of the arrest suddenly developed amnesia and refused to testify. According to Kaplan’s book, one of the women later said, “The cops tried to push me around, but f**k them. I wasn’t going to tell on you.”
    
            It didn’t matter. Each Jane was charged with 11 counts of abortion and conspiracy to commit abortion, with a possible sentence of up to 110 years in prison. 
    
            As they waited for trial, the lawyer for the seven, Jo-Anne Wolfson, adopted delaying tactics, Kaplan said. A case representing a Texas woman, cited as “Jane Roe” to protect her privacy, was being considered by the US Supreme Court. If the Court ruled in Roe’s favor, the case against the Jane’s might be thrown out. 
    
            That’s exactly what happened. On March 9, 1973, three months after the Supreme Court had legalized abortion in the US, the case against the seven women was dropped and their arrest records were expunged. 
    
            Later that spring, a majority of Janes, burned out by the intensity of the work over the last few years, voted to close shop. An end of Jane party was held on May 20. According to Kaplan’s book, the invitation read:
    
            “You are cordially invited to attend The First, Last and Only Curette Caper; the Grand Finale of the Abortion Counseling Service. RSVP: Call Jane.”
    
            Today, most of the surviving members of Jane are in their 70s and 80s, shocked but somehow not surprised by the actions of abortion opponents. 
    
            “This is a country of ill-educated politicos who know nothing about women’s bodies, nor do they care,” said Dorie Barron. “It will take generations to even begin to undo the devastating harm to women’s rights.”
    
            In the meantime, women should research all available options, keep that information confidential, seek support from groups working for abortion rights, and “share your education with as many women as you can,” Barron added.
    
            As more and more reproductive freedoms have been rolled back over the past year, many of the Janes are angry and fearful for the future. 
    
            “This is about the most intimate decision of our lives — when, whether and with whom we have a child. Everyone should have the ability to make decisions about our own lives, bodies, and futures without political interference,” said Heather Booth, who has spent her life after leaving Jane fighting for civil and women’s rights.
    
            “We need to organize, raise our voices and our votes, and overturn this attack on our freedom and our lives.  I have seen that when we take action and organize we can change the world.”

      Minnesota Democratic governor expected to sign bills further protecting abortion and gender-affirming care
    ","
			By Sydney Kashiwagi and Camila Bernal, CNN

    ","
            Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz is expected to sign a series of bills that would further enshrine the right to abortion and gender-affirming care into state law while banning so-called conversion therapy.
    
            The Democratic-led state Senate passed three bills Friday after their Democratic colleagues in the House advanced the legislation earlier this year.
    
            The reproductive health care and gender-affirming care bills, HF366 and HF146, seek to shield people from any legal action that other states may levy over such care. 
    
            The legislation banning conversion therapy, HF16, which garnered only two Republican votes, outlaws organized attempts to convert people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning into straight or cisgender people. 
    
            “If anyone doubts that we can take meaningful action to protect our kids, I’ve got two words for you: Watch us,” Walz said in a tweet Friday about legislation banning conversion therapy.
    
            A spokesperson for the governor, Claire Lancaster, told CNN that Walz would sign the bills next week. 
    
            The measures follow a pattern set in Minnesota since it became the first state to codify abortion via legislative action since Roe v. Wade was reversed last year. 
    
            It stands in stark contrast with the bills cracking down on gender-affirming care and abortion pushed by Republican-led states across the country and follows a trend of blue states enacting shield laws to become havens for those seeking abortions and gender-affirming treatment who may be traveling from states where the practices are banned. 
    
            Some Republicans in Minnesota said that extending laws beyond the state’s borders could be unconstitutional.  
    
            “This legislation pushes Minnesota towards extensive litigation over constitutional issues with other states,” Republican state Sen. Paul Utke said of HF366 on the Senate floor Friday. “We are getting into telling them what they can and cannot do in how we are going to protect people.”
    
            Utke warned that the bill could make Minnesota taxpayers liable for legal challenges and expensive payouts.
    
            But the Democratic author of the abortion bill argued that Minnesota needed to act to protect abortion as more states seek to ban it.  
    
            “Without our action they will reach within our borders following patients and preventing them from receiving lifesaving medical care or punishing them for receiving such care, and penalizing the Minnesota professionals that continue to legally provide it,” state Sen. Kelly L. Morrison said during debate Friday. 
    
            The Minnesota legislation comes at a time when the future of medication abortion remains unknown. 
    
            The abortion rights community and its allies in the Biden administration secured a striking victory from the conservative-majority Supreme Court with an order Friday night that stopped restrictions on a medication abortion drug from taking effect.
    
            But there is much still to play out in the litigation and Friday’s order is unlikely to be the justices’ final word on the Food and Drug Administration’s approach to regulating the drug.
    
            On the state level, Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a trio of bills earlier this month that further protect the rights to abortion and gender-affirming services, setting Colorado up to be a haven for people from states with more restrictive laws.
    
            And last month, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, Colorado’s blue neighbor to the south, signed legislation that prohibits local municipalities and other public bodies from interfering with a person’s ability to access reproductive or gender-affirming health care services in the state.

      Abortion dominates as GOP 2024 hopefuls court evangelical voters in Iowa
    ","

    ","
            Republican presidential hopefuls seeking support from evangelical voters in Iowa again staked out their positions on abortion Saturday in the wake of a Supreme Court order that shielded access to abortion pills, less than a year after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
    
            The event in Clive, Iowa, hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition’s spring kickoff – one of the state’s leading conservative political advocacy groups – gave former Vice President Mike Pence and others a chance to define their stances amid an intensifying 2024 primary.
    
            Pence sought to draw a contrast between himself and Donald Trump over abortion after the former president received backlash recently from anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. A Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement to The Washington Post that abortion was an issue that should be decided at the state level. But following the criticism, the campaign softened its stance, saying that Trump believed “it is in the States where the greatest advances can now take place to protect the unborn.”
    
            “I do think it’s more likely that this issue is resolved at the state level, but I don’t agree with the former president, who says this is a states-only issue,” said Pence, who told CBS News in an interview clip that aired Saturday that he will announce whether he plans to run for president “well before late June.”
    
            “We have an opportunity to advance the sanctity of life, move it ever closer to the center of American law,” the former vice president said in Iowa. “People should look to their statehouses to make that change but I think looking to the Congress of the United States, creating a minimum protection, fifteen weeks that is supported by some 70% of the American public at the federal level, I think these are all ideas that ought to be a part and parcel of the debate.” 
    
            “The Supreme Court didn’t turn the issue of abortion over to the states, they turned it over to the American people,” Pence said. 
    
            The backlash Trump received reflects the frustration among anti-abortion activists that the former president has not made abortion a key policy area of his reelection campaign and the tightrope that many Republicans are walking on the issue. Trump did not mention abortion last fall in a speech kicking off his third presidential run and later said he believed the “abortion issue,” which he argued was “poorly handled by many Republicans,” was to blame for the GOP’s underperformance in the November midterms. 
    
            Trump, who pleaded not guilty earlier this month in Manhattan criminal court to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records, addressed the Iowa forum virtually on Saturday. He touted the hundreds of anti-abortion federal judges that were confirmed during his administration and the three Supreme Court justices he appointed. 
    
            Tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who launched his long-shot campaign for the GOP nomination in February, told CNN he did not endorse a federal abortion ban – staking out a position on an issue that many GOP 2024 hopefuls have shied away from.
    
            “This has always been an issue for the states. Roe v. Wade got it wrong. Now we’ve got it right, and we have to stand on principle. Now its an issue for states,” Ramaswamy said.
    
            Other declared GOP presidential candidates who spoke at the event included former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, conservative talk radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who launched a presidential exploratory committee earlier this month, also spoke, as did former Texas Rep. Will Hurd and former Hawaii congresswoman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, Jeff Kaufmann, served as moderators.
    
            Notably absent from the list of speakers are Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is fueling speculation about a presidential run. Haley spokesperson Ken Farnaso cited scheduling conflicts, and a DeSantis spokesperson pointed to a Utah GOP convention on Saturday where the Florida governor delivered the keynote address when asked why he wasn’t attending.
    
            The Republican Party has struggled at times since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to maneuver the politics of abortion. Democrats had a stronger-than-expected showing in the 2022 midterms as candidates tapped into supporters of abortion rights who were motivated in the wake of the high court’s ruling. Conservative candidates have lost several recent competitive races, including a Wisconsin Supreme Court election earlier this month, in which abortion was a key issue.
    
            “There is a spectrum of pro-life, and they’re all going to have to find their way, and I will guarantee you, by the time we are done and we have our field and it’s September or October, you are going to have some space and some gradation in a pro-life stance,” Kaufmann told CNN on Friday before the event. 
    
            “Certainly, you are going to see variations of the pro-life stance when it comes to exceptions,” he added. “And each of the candidates are going to have to weigh where they’re at personally and how they decide to package and message that to individuals.”
    
            Conservative states across the nation have moved to ban or severely restrict abortion since the Supreme Court eliminated federal protections last summer. DeSantis signed a bill last week behind closed doors that would ban most abortions in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many even know they are pregnant.
    
            Pence commended DeSantis for signing the bill and praised the ruling earlier this month by a Texas federal judge to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the medication abortion drug mifepristone, which the medical community has deemed safe and effective. The US Supreme Court on Friday protected access to the drug as the appeals process play out by freezing the Texas decision and a subsequent appellate ruling that placed restrictions on its usage. 
    
            Haley, who is slated to give a speech focused on abortion on Tuesday in Virginia, said this week in Iowa that she didn’t want to “get into that game” of defining at what point in a pregnancy she would support an abortion ban. Scott, who has formed a presidential exploratory committee, has said he would sign legislation banning abortion at 20 weeks if he were elected president. 
    
            When pressed by NBC News whether he would support a six-week abortion ban, Scott said, “If I were president of the United States, I would literally sign the most conservative pro-life legislation that they can get through Congress.

      The Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade now takes it slow on abortion
    ","
			Analysis by Joan Biskupic, CNN Senior Supreme Court Analyst

    ","
            The Supreme Court that erased a constitutional right to abortion 10 months ago took a breath on Friday.  
    
            In a brief order, over only two publicly dissenting justices, the majority preserved the current law and present-day access to medication abortion. That is the predominant method, in contrast to surgical abortion, used by women in the US seeking to end a pregnancy in the early stages.  
    
            The majority separated itself from individual lower court judges – all appointees of former President Donald Trump – who this month had demonstrated a zeal to further reduce access to abortion across the country.   
    
            The Supreme Court’s order Friday night reflected a willingness to step back – at least for now – in the dispute that tests the US Food and Drug Administration’s expertise, as well as the premise of the court’s own decision last June that individual states may make their own determinations on the legality of abortion. 
    
            Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito were the only justices who noted their dissent, and Alito, alone, explained his view. 
    
            Alito, the author of last June’s decision reversing the 1973 Roe v. Wade, derided the Biden administration’s warnings about the regulatory chaos that would arise if the abortion drug was suddenly restricted. 
    
            He also claimed that “the Government has not dispelled legitimate doubts that it would even obey an unfavorable order,” an assertion that was outright contrary to Biden administration officials’ comments that they would follow court orders even as they continued to appeal. 
    
            No other justice signed onto Alito’s four-page statement. 
    
            Last June, the Alito majority emphasized the role of individual states in the abortion rights dilemma. “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s representatives,” Alito had written in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. 
    
            Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a separate concurring statement that insisted judges would no longer be engaged in the “difficult moral and policy questions” of abortion.  
    
            “To be clear, then,” Kavanaugh had added, “the Court’s decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States.”  
    
            But without the mifepristone drug option at the center of the new controversy, access to abortion would be significantly undermined in wide swaths of the US. 
    
            While states regulate abortion, and a majority continue to make it legal, the federal FDA has the authority for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the medication that is used to end a pregnancy. 
    
            The justices on Friday granted a request by the Biden administration and drug manufacturer Danco to suspend the effect of the lower court rulings that sought to overturn or cut back FDA’s approval for mifepristone, the first pill of a two-drug abortion protocol. FDA authorization of mifepristone traces back to 2000, and since the high court reversed Roe v. Wade last June and some states began instituting bans on the procedure, the drug’s availability has become even more crucial for women’s ability to terminate a pregnancy. 
    
            The three other justices who had joined Alito and Thomas in reversing Roe last summer – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – were silent on Friday. 
    
            At least one of them would have been needed to constitute the requisite majority of five justices, if combined with the three liberals who have supported abortion rights (Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson) and with Chief Justice John Roberts. Last summer, Roberts tried to persuade his fellow conservatives to hold off on reversing Roe even as he agreed with their move to uphold a groundbreaking Mississippi state ban on abortions at 15-weeks. 
    
            Friday’s action in the new case may represent a measure of success for Roberts in the divisive area of reproductive rights.  
    
            The chief justice had failed to bring together the right and left sides of the court in Dobbs, writing then, “Both the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share. … I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after 15 weeks.” 
    
            Roberts on Friday declined to record his vote or views publicly, but he likely favored the slower approach to litigation that constitutes a major attack on the FDA’s approval process for all drugs. Many polls have shown the court’s overall public approval plunging as the conservative majority has rolled back decades-old precedent. 
    
            The only justice who put his full sentiment down on paper was Alito, who had controlled the sweeping decision overturning nearly a half century of women’s privacy rights related to pregnancy.   
    
            He spurned the Biden administration’s arguments about the chaos and harm that would arise if the use of mifepristone were curtailed. The combined lower court orders in the case would have prevented the drug from being prescribed after seven weeks of pregnancy. It now extends to 10 weeks of pregnancy. The lower court action also would have reinstituted a requirement that women pick up the drug in-person, rather than obtain by mail after consulting with health care providers. Further, new restrictions on dosage would have been put in place and a generic drug that now accounts for most of the market would have been eliminated. 
    
            Alito minimized those possible changes, stressing that mifepristone would remain the market. However, the FDA had said that if certain restrictions were imposed, mifepristone would be rendered mislabeled and misbranded – a situation that would take months to remedy. 
    
            US district court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an enduring opponent of abortion rights, had handled the first phase of the lawsuit and laid bare his policy and moral preferences. He shunned the widely used term “fetus,” which the justices themselves have invoked, and instead referred to the “unborn human” and “unborn child.”  
    
            Kacsmaryk had been specifically sought out by anti-abortion physicians and medical groups who filed the lawsuit in his Amarillo, Texas, district.  
    
            In his April 7 decision invalidating FDA approval of mifepristone, he rejected the agency’s 23-year determination that the pill was safe and effective. “The Court,” Kacsmaryk wrote of his findings, “does not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly. But here, FDA acquiesced in its legitimate safety concerns – in violation of its statutory duty – based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions.”  
    
            The FDA, physicians and drug makers widely disparaged Kacsmaryk’s usurping of the agency’s scientific expertise.  
    
            A panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld significant portions of Kacsmaryk’s ruling, by a 2-1 vote. Most importantly, it agreed that anti-abortion physicians and medical groups could challenge the drug even though they do not prescribe it, brushing aside the Biden administration’s arguments that the challengers lacked legal “standing” to sue. 
    
            The 5th Circuit has set a May 17 date for a full airing of the lawsuit against the FDA, and that proceeding is on schedule. The difference now is that full FDA approval and regulations since 2016 that enhanced access to the drug will remain in place during the litigation.  
    
            The high court’s order, siding with the FDA at this preliminary point, may newly influence how lower court judges regard the litigation and shift the emphasis in this new chapter of America’s ongoing abortion wars.

      Supreme Court protects access to widely used abortion drug
    ","

            Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest on the Supreme Court order here or read through the updates below.
    
            The Supreme Court handed a win to the defenders of the medication abortion drug mifepristone by pausing lower court rulings that would have disrupted access to the drug as a result – from a lawsuit filed by anti-abortion doctors seeking to wipe away the US Food and Drug Administration’s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone. 
    
            That means FDA’s current regulatory scheme around the drug remains in place, ensuring that access to medication abortion — in the states where it is legal — is maintained at least for the next couple weeks, and likely longer. 
    
            What comes next in the case? 
    
            There is much still to play out in the litigation and Friday’s Supreme Court order is unlikely to be the justices’ final word on the FDA’s approach to regulating the drug. 
    
            The case now travels back to the Fifth Circuit federal appeals court, which has set an expedited briefing schedule to give a fuller review of Kacsmaryk’s ruling. A three-judge panel from the Fifth Circuit will hold a hearing on May 17 and issue another decision sometime after. (There is no deadline for the Fifth Circuit to rule.)
    
            The majority of judges on the Fifth Circuit are conservative, but it is unknown who the three judges will be. Notably, the three judges who will hear that step of the appeal will likely be different from those that issued the appellate order last week. 
    
            The Supreme Court’s Friday order maintains the status quo around the drug’s regulations until that Fifth Circuit process plays out and until the justices have another chance to weigh in on how it handled the case. 
    
            What do we know about how the justices are thinking about the dispute? 
    
            The Supreme Court did not show its cards in the order it issued Friday night. 
    
            While Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito made their dissents public, it is not otherwise clear how the justices voted or what the exact vote count was. The support of five justices is required for the court to grant a stay.
    
            Only Alito wrote additionally to explain his dissent and stressed he was not expressing any views on the merits of whether the FDA broke the law in how it approached mifepristone. 
    
            Instead, he aired grievances about how the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been criticized for handling the emergency disputes — on its so-called shadow docket — in the past. He also cast doubt on the claims by the government and the manufacturer that the Fifth Circuit order would have caused mass disruption to access to the drug.

            Justice Samuel Alito, in his dissent Friday, said he voted to deny the request for a stay because the Fifth Circuit federal appeals court has scheduled such an expedited hearing on the merits of the dispute.
    
            He suggested that allowing the restrictions to remain in place would not lead to “any real harm during the presumably short period at issue.”
    
            Alito wrote that the stay would not “remove mifepristone from the market” but would have simply restored “the circumstances that existed” from the time the drug was approved in 2000 to when the FDA passed new regulations to ease access to the pill starting in 2016.
    
            No other justice joined his dissent.
    
            It’s almost guaranteed the case on medication abortion restrictions will land back before the justices of the Supreme Court after Friday’s order protected access at least until legal appeals play out.
    
            The next step in the litigation will be a hearing in front of the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit federal appeals court on May 17. Regardless of that outcome, it is very likely the losing side will appeal again to the Supreme Court.
    
            “The case could well come back to the justices once the Fifth Circuit rules,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
    
            But nothing will change in regard to access to mifepristone unless the justices decide to consider the lawsuit’s merits and then side with the challengers, Vladeck continued.
    
            “That’s not going to happen for a long time – if ever,” he said. 
    
            Reaction poured in Friday evening from Democratic officials and lawmakers after the Supreme Court issued an order protecting access to a widely used abortion drug until the legal appeals process plays out.
    
            Here’s what some had to say:
    
            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer: The New York lawmaker issued a statement saying, “extreme MAGA Republicans will continue to pursue their nationwide abortion ban until they impose their anti-choice agenda on all Americans.”
    
            “Democrats won’t stop fighting and we will prevail,” Schumer vowed.
    
            California Gov. Gavin Newsom: “For now, the Court has followed science, data, and the law rather than an extreme and out of touch political agenda. Medication abortion is available and accessible here in California and we will continue to fight to protect people’s freedom to choose,” Newsom wrote in a statement. 
    
            HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra: “Today’s action from the Supreme Court is an important step in the right direction as we vigorously fight to defend the FDA’s independent, expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of prescription drugs,” the secretary for the US Health and Human Services Department said in a statement. “We are confident the law is on our side and remain focused on prevailing in court.” He added: “We will never stop fighting to preserve women’s rights to access the health care they need and Americans’ rights to access safe and effective medicine.”
    
            North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper: “We must not be complacent as we continue to fight the legal and political attacks on women’s health and freedom,” Cooper tweeted Friday.
    
            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul: “We will continue the fight to protect reproductive rights and keep New York a safe harbor for all,” Hochul tweeted. “Under my watch, abortion — including medication abortion — will always be protected and available in New York.”
    
            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: “We need to be clear about why this case came before the court in the first place: a fringe, extreme minority that refuses to follow science or respect Americans’ freedoms is judge shopping to impose their agenda on women,” Whitmer tweeted. 
    
            Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker: “The Justices have recognized that this safe, tested drug should continue to be available to provide the gold standard of reproductive care and not be restricted based on a single ruling by an ideologically motivated judge,” Pritzker tweeted. 
    
            A lawyer for the group of doctors that brought the abortion drug lawsuit downplayed Friday’s Supreme Court order that protects access to the pill at least until appeals play out.
    
            As the case moves forward in federal appeals court, Baptist said the FDA “must answer for the damage it has caused to the health of countless women and girls and the rule of law by failing to study how dangerous the chemical abortion drug regimen is and unlawfully removing every meaningful safeguard, even allowing for mail-order abortions.”
    
            About the drug’s safety: Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone, the medication abortion drug at the heart of the Texas abortion lawsuit, is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra.
    
            Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
    
            Vice President Kamala Harris applauded a Supreme Court ruling Friday temporarily protecting access to mifepristone, a medication abortion pill.
    
            Prior to the ruling, Harris said in an interview airing on Telemundo Friday that the wave measures in red states restricting access to abortions could “criminalize doctors and nurses.”
    
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists praised the US Supreme Court’s order to freeze a lower-court ruling that would restrict access to a medical abortion drug but said the legal battle has created confusion for healthcare providers.
    
            Even though the Texas federal judge’s ruling has been on hold for the past several weeks, meaning that mifepristone has been available, the back and forth has left “clinicians uncertain as to whether and where they could prescribe the medication for abortion and miscarriage management,” said Iffath Abbasi Hoskins, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Maureen G. Phipps, the CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
    
            In light of the US Supreme Court protecting the use of mifepristone, Planned Parenthood is warning that while the drug will stay on the market for now, its availability to millions of women should not “be at the mercy of the court system.”
    
            Critics argue that if the original ruling by a federal judge in Texas is upheld – along with the Fifth Circuit’s limitations on the use of mifepristone – it would validate a decision of a single judge or panel with no medical expertise over standards of science and clinical analysis. 
    
            Mifepristone has been safely prescribed since the FDA approved it two decades ago. But anti-abortion doctors and medical associations argued in the case that the agency violated the law in how it approved the drug for abortions in 2000. 
    
            “Planned Parenthood will continue to fight so that everyone can make their own decisions about their bodies, lives, and futures,” Johnson said.
    
            The immediate effects of the Supreme Court’s order on medication abortion access is a return to the status quo, said Elizabeth Cohen, CNN’s senior medical correspondent.
    
            The order means that the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug mifepristone will remain in place while appeals play out, potentially for months to come. Mifepristone is the first of a two-drug combination used in the majority of abortions in the US, and also used off-label to treat miscarriages.
    
            Cohen said Friday’s order clears things up for doctors who had been navigating their care decisions based on “haphazard, random decisions on a Friday night,” referring to previous rulings that put the drug’s access in doubt.
    
            President Joe Biden responded Friday to a Supreme Court ruling protecting access to medication abortion as appeals play out in lower courts, saying the original ruling blocking FDA approval of mifepristone “would have undermined FDA’s medical judgment and put women’s health at risk.”
    
            Biden urged Americans “to use their vote as their voice, and elect a Congress who will pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v Wade.”
    
            The Supreme Court’s decision to protect access to mifepristone, a drug used in medical abortions, while the appeals process plays out is a victory for the Biden administration and abortion rights activists.
    
            The court’s Friday brief, unsigned order did not explain why it granted the request by the Biden administration and a manufacturer of the drug to intervene. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito publicly dissented.
    
            The case is the most important abortion-related dispute to reach the high court since the justices overturned Roe v. Wade, triggering conservative states nationwide to either ban or severely restrict the procedure. How the dispute over medication abortion is ultimately resolved could make it more difficult for women to obtain an abortion, even in the states that still allow it.
    
            At issue is the scope of the FDA’s authority to regulate mifepristone, a drug that the medical community has deemed safe and effective. Millions of women across the country have used mifepristone in the more than two decades that it has been on the market.
    
            The next step in the litigation will be a hearing in front of a New Orleans-based federal appeals court on May 17.
    
            The issue of access to a widely used abortion drug will now proceed through the appeals process, CNN legal analyst Steve Vladeck said, following the US Supreme Court’s decision to freeze lower-court rulings that placed restrictions on mifepristone.
    
            Vladeck said the order from the justices is not necessarily the court weighing in on how they are leaning on legal arguments, but more about allowing the case to go through the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
    
            Earlier this month, a federal judge in Texas ruled to change the FDA’s rules for use of the medication abortion drug. Vladeck said if this ruling was allowed to go into effect on Friday, without the Supreme Court stepping in, it would have created confusion for providers and women around the country.
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone, the medication abortion drug at the heart of the Texas abortion lawsuit, is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That’s a death rate of 0.0005%.
    
            Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin — a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia — is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra — used to treat erectile dysfunction — is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA.
    
            “[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. “Its safety is very well established.”
    
            Weighing medication abortion against the alternatives: Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
    
            The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion.
    
            “It reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,” she said.
    
            It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications — like hemorrhages or infections — for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a 2015 study conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications.
    
            The likelihood of serious complications via procedural abortion — performed second-trimester or later — is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And childbirth by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%.
    
            The Supreme Court on Friday protected access to a widely used abortion drug by freezing lower-court rulings that placed restrictions on medication abortion.
    
            As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug mifepristone — and subsequent actions that made it more easily accessible — will remain in place while appeals play out, potentially for months to come.
    
            Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito publicly dissented. 
    
            A federal appeals court has already announced a briefing schedule with oral arguments to be heard mid-May.
    
            Mifepristone is a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that has been shown to be safe and effective for more than two decades.
    
            The lawsuit from anti-abortion advocates claims that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn’t study it enough to approve it.
    
            Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery.
    
            Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it’s sometimes known as RU 486.
    
            Here are some key things to know: 
    
            How mifepristone works: Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus.
    
            Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents.
    
            Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions.
    
            The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period.
    
            This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show.
    
            How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country’s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, which signed an amicus brief in the Texas case.
    
            This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries.
    
            Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. That means the death rate is 0.0005%.
    
            Mifepristone’s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show.
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra – used to treat erectile dysfunction – is nearly 10 times higher.
    
            Side effects of mifepristone: Mifepristone usually doesn’t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones.
    
            Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA.
    
            Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are “exceedingly rare,” happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations’ amicus brief.
    
            How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US.
    
            Preliminary data published February 2022 from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, showed that medication abortion accounted for 53% of all abortions in the US.

            Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Wednesday temporarily extended a hold on a lower court ruling that would have imposed restrictions on access to an abortion drug, a move meant to give the justices more time to consider the issue.
    
            In a similar order last week, Alito had said the court would rule by 11:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The new order – called an “administrative stay” – moved that deadline to tonight, Friday, April 21.
    
            The order was written by Alito because he has jurisdiction over the lower court that ruled in the dispute.
    
            The case is the most important abortion-related dispute to reach the high court since the justices overturned Roe v. Wade last term, triggering conservative states across the country to either ban or severely restrict the procedure. How the dispute over medication abortion is ultimately resolved could make it more difficult for women to obtain an abortion, even in the states that still allow it.  
    
            At issue is the scope of the US Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate a drug, mifepristone, that the medical community has deemed safe and effective. 
    
            Mifepristone has been used by millions of women across the country in the more than two decades that it has been on the market. 
    
            Anti-abortion doctors and medical associations argue that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) violated the law in how it went about approving mifepristone for abortions in 2000. They filed their lawsuit in November in Amarillo, Texas, where US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk – a Trump appointee who has previously issued major rulings against the Biden administration – was guaranteed to hear the case.
    
            Kacsmaryk issued a sweeping ruling on April 7 that embraced the challengers’ arguments – which have been refuted by the mainstream medical community – that mifepristone was unsafe and halted the FDA’s 23-year-old approval of the pill.
    
            The Biden administration, along with mifepristone manufacturer Danco Laboratories, took the dispute to the 5th Circuit, which issued an emergency order just before midnight last Wednesday. The 5th Circuit reinstated the drug’s approval, but said aspects of the lower court ruling that blocked the FDA’s more recent regulatory actions could go into effect.
    
            Those actions include 2016 changes to mifepristone’s instructions that extended the window of use from seven to 10 weeks into the pregnancy, that reduced the number of in-person clinic visits required under the regimen from three to one, and that allowed non-doctors to administer the drug. The appeals court order also would reverse FDA’s later elimination of the requirement for in-person pick up of the drug– allowing it to be shipped to patients via the mail – as well as its 2019 approval of a generic version of mifepristone.
    
            In filings with the Supreme Court, the Justice Department said that implementing those changes would “deny women lawful access to a drug FDA deemed a safe and effective alternative to invasive surgical abortion,” while putting the FDA and the entities it regulates “in an impossible position.”
    
            The pill’s challengers, meanwhile, argue that the 5th Circuit’s ruling was a “reasonable order” and that the lower courts are justified in the actions they are taking against the FDA.
    
            The federal district judge who first suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the so-called abortion pill mifepristone failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation process two interviews on Christian talk radio where he discussed social issues such as contraception and gay rights.
    
            In undisclosed radio interviews, Matthew Kacsmaryk referred to being gay as “a lifestyle” and expressed concerns that new norms for “people who experience same-sex attraction” would lead to clashes with religious institutions, calling it the latest in a change in sexual norms that began with “no-fault divorce” and “permissive policies on contraception.”
    
            Kacsmaryk, a Trump-appointed federal district judge, made the unreported comments in two appearances in 2014 on Chosen Generation, a radio show that offers “a biblical constitutional worldview.” At the time, Kacsmaryk was deputy general counsel at First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit religious liberty advocacy group known before 2016 as the Liberty Institute, and was brought on to the radio show to discuss “the homosexual agenda” to silence churches and religious liberty, according to the show’s host.
    
            Federal judicial nominees are required to submit detailed paperwork to the Senate Judiciary Committee ahead of their confirmation process, including copies of nearly everything they have ever written or said in public, in order for the committee to evaluate a nominee’s qualifications and personal opinions. Neither interview is listed in the paperwork Kacsmaryk provided to the Senate during his judicial nomination process, which first began in 2017.
    
            The radio interviews were not included in the 22 media works Kacsmaryk disclosed, which included three radio appearances and 19 written pieces.
    
            A spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN the interviews weren’t in their archived files from Kacsmaryk’s confirmation, which included all paperwork submitted for his nomination.
    
            In a statement sent to CNN, Kacsmaryk said he did not locate the interview when searching for media to disclose and he did not recall the interview.
    
            Read more here. 
    
            Key senators say discussions on a legislative solution to secure access to abortion pills are not happening yet. 
    
            Sen. Dick Durbin, Democratic Whip and Judiciary chairman told CNN on Wednesday that there are “not yet” conversations on how or if they might try to handle the issue legislatively if the Supreme Court rules to limit access to the medication abortion drug mifepristone.
    
            Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a supporter of abortion rights, said that she isn’t currently working with Democrats on any legislation specific to the abortion medication. She did say she’s having talks about what “options might be out there.”
    
            French biochemist Dr. Étienne-Émile Baulieu, the inventor of mifepristone, said blocking access to the drug used in medication abortions would be “immoral.”
    
            Baulieu and researchers from the pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf synthesized mifepristone in 1980, just a few years after the Roe v. Wade decision made abortion legal in the United States. 
    
            The medication is now at the center of a legal battle after a federal judge in Texas said the drug should not have been approved by the US Federal Drug Administration in 2000.
    
            When asked about the possibility of the United States banning the medication, Baulieu said, “It is unbelievable that it could happen.”
    
            Using mifepristone, he argued, should not be considered an abortion but rather a “pregnancy interruption,” as it keeps pregnancy from developing. 
    
            Baulieu said he wanted to develop mifepristone because it would “help women to have a better life, a more pleasant life” and “to better associate having babies and being happy.”

      What comes next after the Supreme Court blocked – for now – restrictions on abortion pills
    ","

    ","
            The abortion rights community and its allies in the Biden administration secured a striking victory from the conservative Supreme Court with an order Friday night that stopped restrictions on medication abortion drugs from taking effect. 
    
            The Supreme Court’s brief, unsigned order came in an emergency dispute over lower court rulings that would have curtailed access to the drug, mifepristone. At the request of the Justice Department and a mifepristone manufacter, the high court placed a hold – known as a stay – on the lower court rulings while the appeals process plays out. 
    
            Only Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito publicly indicated their dissent from the Supreme Court’s move. 
    
            Here’s what to know about the Supreme Court’s move. 
    
            The Supreme Court handed a win to the defenders of the medication abortion drugs by pausing lower court rulings that would have disrupted access to the drug as a result from a lawsuit from anti-abortion doctors seeking to wipe away the US Food and Drug Administration’s two-decade old approval of mifepristone. 
    
            That means FDA’s current regulatory scheme around the drug remains in place, ensuring that access to medication abortion – in the states where it is legal – is maintained at least for the next couple weeks, and likely longer. 
    
            Friday’s order is the latest dramatic twist in the lawsuit that was filed in November. The legal volleying ramped up two weeks ago, when US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump – issued a ruling that would have a halted the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug.
    
            The dispute landed at the Supreme Court’s doorstep after the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals weighed in last week, and paused the parts of Kacsmaryk’s ruling that would have suspended the approval while leaving undisturbed Kacsmaryk’s move to also halt the FDA’s subsequent efforts to make the drug easier obtain. 
    
            Had the Supreme Court not intervened in the way that the Biden administration had asked, the 5th Circuit’s order would have put in place restrictions on how the abortion drug could be used. Those limits would have shortened the gestational period that the drug is available, and would have required patients to obtain the drugs in-person from their provider and make two other clinical visits as part of the protocol. 
    
            There is much still to play out in the litigation and Friday’s Supreme Court order is unlikely to be the justices’ final word on the FDA’s approach to regulating the drug. 
    
            The case now travels back to the 5th Circuit, which has set an expedited briefing schedule to give a fuller review of Kacsmaryk’s ruling. A three-judge panel from the 5th Circuit will hold a hearing on May 17 and issue another decision sometime after. (There is no deadline for the 5th Circuit to rule.)
    
            The majority of judges on the 5th Circuit are conservative, but it is unknown who the three judges will be. Notably the three judges who will hear that step of the appeal will likely be different from those that issued the appellate order last week. 
    
            The Supreme Court’s Friday order maintains the status quo around the drug’s regulations until that 5th Circuit process plays out and until the justices have another chance to weigh in on how it handled the case. 
    
            The Supreme Court did not show its cards in the order it issued Friday night. 
    
            While Justices Thomas and Alito made their dissents public, it is not otherwise clear how the justices voted or what the exact vote count was. The support of five justices is required for the court to grant a stay.
    
            Only Alito wrote additionally to explain his dissent, and stressed he was not expressing any views on the merits of whether the FDA broke the law in how it’s approached mifepristone. 
    
            Instead, he aired grievances about how the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been criticized for handling the emergency disputes – on its so-called shadow docket – in the past. He also cast doubt on the claims by the government and the manufacturer that the 5th Circuit order would have caused mass disruption to access to the drug.

      Supreme Court protects access to abortion pill

    ","
            The Supreme Court on Friday protected access to a widely used abortion drug by freezing lower-court rulings that placed restrictions on its usage as appeals play out.
    
            As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug mifepristone and subsequent actions that made it more easily accessible will remain in place while appeals play out – potentially for months to come.
    
            The Friday night move is a striking victory for the Biden administration and its allies in the abortion rights community, which suffered a withering defeat at the Supreme Court last year when the conservative majority reversed the Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights nationwide.  
    
            The court’s brief, unsigned order did not explain why it granted the request by the Biden administration and a manufacturer of the drug to intervene. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito publicly dissented; the votes of the other justices were not disclosed.
    
            The case is the most important abortion-related dispute to reach the high court since the justices overturned Roe v. Wade, triggering conservative states across the country to either ban or severely restrict the procedure. How the dispute over medication abortion is ultimately resolved could make it more difficult for women to obtain abortion, even in the states that still allow it.    
    
            At issue is the scope of FDA’s authority to regulate mifepristone, a drug that the medical community has deemed safe and effective. Mifepristone has been used by millions of women across the country in the more than two decades that it has been on the market.  
    
            The next step in the litigation will be a hearing in front of a New Orleans-based federal appeals court on May 17.
    
            “The case could well come back to the justices once the Fifth Circuit rules, but nothing is going to change with respect to mifepristone access until and unless the court both takes the case on the merits and sides with the challengers,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “That’s not going to happen for a long time – if ever.”
    
            President Joe Biden praised the order. 
    
            “As a result of the Supreme Court’s stay, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe and effective use while we continue this fight in the courts,” Biden said in a statement Friday evening. 
    
            Biden also urged Americans “to use their vote as their voice, and elect a Congress who will pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v Wade.”
    
            A lawyer for the group of doctors who brought the challenge downplayed the order. “As is common practice, the Supreme Court has decided to maintain the status quo,” Erik Baptist, a lawyer for Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a statement.
    
            “Our case seeking to put women’s health above politics continues on an expedited basis in the lower courts,” Baptist added. “We look forward to a final outcome in this case that will hold the FDA accountable.”
    
            In his dissent, Alito said he voted to deny the request for a stay because the 5th Circuit has scheduled such an expedited hearing on the merits of the dispute.   
    
            He suggested that allowing the restrictions to remain in place would not lead to “any real harm during the presumably short period at issue.”
    
            Alito wrote that the stay would not “remove mifepristone from the market” but would have simply restored “the circumstances that existed” from the time the drug was approved in 2000 to when the FDA passed new regulations to ease access to the pill starting in 2016.
    
            “The Government has not dispelled legitimate doubts that it would even obey an unfavorable order in these cases, much less that it would choose to take enforcement action to which it has strong objections,” Alito wrote.
    
            No other justice joined his dissent. 
    
            Danco Laboratories, the manufacturer of the drug that intervened in the case to defend mifepristone’s approval, cheered the Friday order for preserving “crucial access to a drug relied on by millions of patients.” 
    
            “The lower courts’ reversal of longstanding FDA approvals has caused widespread chaos among providers, patients, and healthcare systems. Today’s order provides continuity to all concerned as we litigate the underlying issues in this case,” Jessica Ellsworth, Danco’s attorney, said in a statement.  
    
            The other manufacturer of the drug, GenBioPro, did not intervene in the lawsuit, but the FDA’s approval of their product – the generic version of the abortion pill – would have been suspended had the Supreme Court left the lower court rulings in effect. 
    
            “Today’s Supreme Court ruling keeps mifepristone lawful and available,” the company’s CEO Evan Masingill said in a statement responding to Friday night’s order. “GenBioPro is continuing to serve its customers and is committed to providing our evidence-based, essential medication to all who need it.” 
    
            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the order was ” an important step in the right direction” as the administration “vigorously” fights “to defend the FDA’s independent, expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of prescription drugs.”  
    
            “We are confident the law is on our side and remain focused on prevailing in court,” he said. The Justice Department declined to comment.
    
            The legal controversy began last November when a group representing doctors who oppose abortion filed suit, arguing that the FDA had not done enough to ensure the safety of the drug some two decades earlier.  
    
            US District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, issued a broad ruling on April 7 that blocked the approval of the drug, as well as changes the FDA made in subsequent years to make the drug more accessible. He, however, delayed the effective date of his ruling by seven days to give time for an appeal.  
    
            Rejecting the consensus of the medical community, Kacsmaryk raised questions about the safety of the drug, peppering his opinion with jargon that is often used by opponents of abortion. He labeled doctors who perform the procedure “abortionists” and explained that he would reject the term “fetus” in favor of the more inflammatory “unborn human.” Instead of referring to the procedure as a “medication abortion,” he insisted on calling it a “chemical abortion.”   
    
            The FDA, Kacsmaryk contended at one point, “acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns – in violation of its statutory duty – based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions.”   
    
            Mainstream medical associations have rebuked his assertions about the dangers of the drug, and mifepristone has been shown to be safer than common medicines like penicillin and Viagra.  
    
            On a key threshold issue, the judge insisted that the plaintiffs – doctors who do not use or prescribe the drug – had the legal right to be in court to make their case because they allege that the use of the drug could “overwhelm” the medical system.   
    
            Stunned by the breadth of the decision, the Biden administration and Danco, a manufacturer of the drug, filed an appeal with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.   
    
            The appeals court ultimately let stand the government’s approval of the drug, but agreed with Kacsmaryk that access could be limited.   
    
            A divided three-judge panel ordered a return to the stricter, pre-2016 FDA regime around the drug, which prevents mailing the pill to patients who obtained it through telehealth, or virtual visits with their providers, rather than traveling to a clinic or hospital to obtain the drug in person. It also effectively revokes the 2019 approval of the generic version of the drug. The restrictions also affect the instructions on the label for the medication, shortening the window of obtaining the pill to seven weeks into pregnancy as opposed to 10.  
    
            It’s possible however that even with the ruling in effect, some providers could go “off-label” and continue to prescribe mifepristone up until 10 weeks. 
    
            The 5th Circuit claimed that the FDA’s rules for the drug created “an exceedingly unusual regime,” and that the anti-abortion doctors had the right to sue over it because they would “necessarily be injured by the consequences” of the FDA’s decision “to cut out doctors from the prescription and administration of mifepristone.”  
    
            The appeals court said that the statute of limitations likely barred the plaintiffs from challenging the 2000 approval, but that they were likely to succeed in their claims against the FDA’s more recent moves to adjust the rules around the drug.  
    
            The court accused the FDA of having an “ostrich’s-head-in-the-sand approach” to the drug that was “deeply troubling.”  
    
            Biden last week decried how those lower courts had handled the case. 
    
            “I think it’s outrageous what the court has done, relative to concluding that they’re going to overrule the FDA on whether something is safe or not,” he said. “I think it’s out of their domain.” 
    
            The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene last week, with court filings from Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar citing “unprecedented lower court orders countermanding FDA’s scientific judgment and unleashing regulatory chaos by suspending the existing FDA-approved conditions of use for mifepristone.”    
    
            Implementing the changes to mifepristone’s rules ordered by the lower courts would “deny women lawful access to a drug FDA deemed a safe and effective alternative to invasive surgical abortion,” while putting the FDA and the entities they regulate “in an impossible position.” 
    
            Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of the brand-name version of the drug that had intervened in the case to defend FDA’s approval of mifepristone, also requested the high court to step in. 
    
            Leaving the lower court rulings in place, the company’s attorney said in filings, would “irreparably harm Danco, which will be unable to both conduct its business nationwide and comply with its legal obligations.” 
    
            “The lack of emergency relief from this Court will also harm women, the healthcare system, the pharmaceutical industry, States’ sovereignty interests, and the separation-of-powers,” the attorney, Ellsworth, told the justices.    
    
            The anti-abortion doctors who had brought the case meanwhile told the justices that the restrictions the appeals court placed on the drug were “reasonable.” 
    
            “The lower courts’ meticulous decisions do not second-guess the agency’s scientific determinations; they merely require the agency to follow the law,” the challengers argued.

            The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor’s visit.
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone — the first drug in the medication abortion process — is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That’s a death rate of 0.0005%.
    
            Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin — a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia — is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra — used to treat erectile dysfunction — is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA.
    
            “[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. “Its safety is very well established.”
    
            Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion.
    
            “It reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,” she said.
    
            It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications — like hemorrhages or infections — for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a 2015 study conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications.
    
            The likelihood of serious complications via procedural abortion — performed second-trimester or later — is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And childbirth by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%.
    
            Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said.
    
            In a study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol.
    
            Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen.
    
            “It’s clear people can use these medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, at home even without the help of a medical professional very safely,” said Aiken.
    
            Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it’s readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN in April.
    
            However, a lesser-effective method means more people will likely have unsuccessful abortions.
    
            “It’s possible that it might not work for some people, and it will prolong their abortions,” said Upadhyay. “Then by the time they get back to the clinic, they’re seeking abortion later in pregnancy.”

      What to watch for with the Supreme Court and medication abortion on Friday

    ","
            All eyes are on the Supreme Court as it could say at any moment before midnight Friday how it will handle a blockbuster medication abortion case that landed on its doorstep late last week. 
    
            The Supreme Court is deciding whether to let lower court rulings that would restrict access to a medication abortion drug go into effect. Justice Samuel Alito, who oversees emergency disputes in the region from where the lawsuit arises, has paused those rulings until midnight Friday, giving the court a two-day extension to consider the case. Final briefs in the case were filed overnight going into Wednesday morning.
    
            The case is a challenge to the US Food and Drug Administration’s approach to regulating mifepristone, the first drug in the two-pill regimen used to terminate pregnancies in medication abortions. 
    
            At stake is what kind of access abortion-seekers will have to the drugs, even in states where abortion is widely permitted, as the lawsuit brought by anti-abortion activists moves forward. The case also raises wide-reaching questions about the authority courts have to second-guess the determinations by FDA experts about a drug’s safety. 
    
            Here is what to know about the order the Supreme Court is expected to hand down on Friday.
    
            The Supreme Court has been asked by the federal government and a mifepristone manufacturer to put on hold lower court orders changing the FDA’s rules for use of the medication abortion drug. 
    
            The justices are reviewing a decision last week from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ordering the FDA to reverse moves it’s made over the last seven years that have made mifepristone easier to obtain. The 5th Circuit said that FDA’s approval of mifepristone could stay in force, as it paused parts of a district court’s order that would have suspended that approval. 
    
            Mifepristone’s defenders have argued to the Supreme Court that even the 5th Circuit’s order returning the drug’s rules to the stricter, pre-2016 protocol would cause mass disruption, putting access to abortion pills in jeopardy. They have noted that following the 5th Circuit’s order would put the FDA at odds with a ruling earlier this month from a district judge in Washington state – in a separate case brought by Democratic attorneys general – that barred the FDA from taking any action that would reduce access to mifepristone in the 18 liberal jurisdictions behind that lawsuit, which seeks to expand access to the drug.
    
            Anti-abortion doctors and medical associations argue that the FDA violated the law in how it went about approving mifepristone for abortions in 2000. They filed their lawsuit in November in Amarillo, Texas, where US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk – a Trump appointee who has previously issued major rulings against the Biden administration – was guaranteed to hear the case. 
    
            Kacsmaryk issued a sweeping ruling on April 7 that embraced the challengers’ arguments – which have been refuted by the mainstream medical community – that mifepristone was unsafe and halted the FDA’s 23-year-old approval of the pill. 
    
            The Biden administration, along with mifepristone manufacturer Danco Laboratories, took the dispute to the 5th Circuit, which issued an emergency order just before midnight on April 12. The 5th Circuit reinstated the drug’s approval, but said aspects of the lower court ruling that blocked the FDA’s more recent regulatory actions could go into effect.
    
            Those actions include 2016 changes to mifepristone’s instructions that extended the window of use from seven to 10 weeks into the pregnancy, that reduced the number of in-person clinic visits required under the regimen from three to one, and that allowed non-doctors to administer the drug. The appeals court order also would reverse FDA’s later elimination of the requirement for in-person pick up of the drug– allowing it to be shipped to patients via the mail – as well as its 2019 approval of a generic version of mifepristone. 
    
            In filings with the Supreme Court, the Justice Department said that implementing those changes would “deny women lawful access to a drug FDA deemed a safe and effective alternative to invasive surgical abortion,” while putting the FDA and the entities it regulates “in an impossible position.”
    
            The pill’s challengers, meanwhile, argue that the 5th Circuit’s ruling was a “reasonable order” and that the lower courts are justified in the actions they are taking against the FDA. 
    
            The anti-abortion lawsuit has arrived at the high court via its so-called shadow docket, the term for emergency disputes the justices deal with outside their formal calendar for hearing and deciding cases. The Supreme Court had not held a hearing in the medication abortion case, and the paper filings addressing the lower court rulings have been filed in an extremely expedited manner. 
    
            The next move by the Supreme Court could be just a one-line, unsigned order saying whether those lower court rulings can go into effect. 
    
            It’s also possible that the Supreme Court says that it will take up the case now for a formal review, stepping ahead of the appeals court, which is still in the process of fully reviewing the district judge’s decision. 
    
            The Justice Department and Danco asked the Supreme Court to put Kacsmaryk’s and the 5th Circuit’s orders on hold – effectively keeping the status quo around the drug’s regulations – while the appeal moves forward on the merits. The 5th Circuit has scheduled expedited briefing and a May 17 hearing as it fully reviews Kacsmaryk’s decision. 
    
            The Justice Department and Danco told the justices that alternatively, they could take up the case for review now, before the lower courts reach their final judgment. 
    
            The government’s opponents asked the high court to leave the lower court orders undisturbed. They said if the justices were to take up the case now, it should consider additional legal requests about how FDA went about approving the drug as well as whether the Comstock Act – an 1873 chastity law – allows for the mailing of abortion drugs.
    
            Whether the Supreme Court takes up the case now or lets the lower court process play out, the dispute is almost guaranteed to get a more comprehensive review from the Supreme Court, which reversed national legal protections for abortion rights last year. 
    
            Beyond the implications for abortion, the medication abortion case also has consequences for what kind of authority and discretion the FDA has to determine a drug’s safety and appropriate rules for use. 
    
            While the conservative majority has generally been skeptical of executive branch power, it has deferred to FDA determinations in the past – specifically in a Trump-era dispute where the court sided with the FDA over challengers seeking looser rules for mifepristone’s administration. 
    
            This story has been updated with additional information.

      Supreme Court faces Friday deadline in case that could shape abortion access and the future of American health care
    ","
			Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN

        3:44 PM EDT, Fri April 21, 2023
    ","
            A deadline looms at midnight Friday for the most critical abortion case before the Supreme Court since its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last summer.
    
            The future of a widely used medication drug to end pregnancies is the specific issue before the court. But nothing less than the health care options of American women and even the viability of US regulatory approvals for routine drugs are in question.
    
            Justice Samuel Alito earlier this week granted the high court more time to consider a ruling by a Texas judge that would block approval of mifepristone and to extend a temporary hold on a subsequent appeals court ruling, which would let the government’s approval of the drug stand but agreed access could be limited.
    
            The extension for the Supreme Court’s impending order is until 11:59 p.m. ET Friday, and until then, the drug remains available.
    
            But the precarious waiting period has been a study in microcosm of the deep uncertainty about the continued availability of abortion in some states nearly a year after the court’s conservative majority overturned the constitutional right to the procedure. It reflects the way that the post-Roe anti-abortion movement has escalated its effort to eradicate abortion rights everywhere. The current case also shows that President Joe Biden’s administration is ready to intervene aggressively in the courts to try to protect abortion rights. 
    
            The fallout from the Texas ruling, which blocked Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug, is also thrusting abortion back into the Washington political storm in a way that has been a liability for the Republican Party with more moderate and swing voters – an ironic consequence of conservatives’ decadeslong campaign against Roe.
    
            There’s another irony to this all-consuming legal collision. Alito wrote in his majority opinion overturning Roe last summer that the 1973 decision was wrong because justices had usurped the Constitution and taken away from lawmakers the duty of deciding matters related to abortion rights. But the power play by the Trump-appointed Texas judge in this case, which swiftly rose to the high court, shows that Alito and his colleagues are going to be embroiled in deciding abortion law for years to come.
    
            As with most things about the Supreme Court, the reasoning behind Alito’s extension of the temporary hold was unclear to outsiders. He could simply have been providing his colleagues more time to consider an extraordinarily complex legal and clinical issue. Or it may be that there is no current majority on the bench for any course of action. The court is considering both the ruling by District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to halt the approval of mifepristone and a 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals decision that allowed the FDA’s certification of the drug to stand but limited its use. 
    
            The Supreme Court might uphold either ruling, reject them, cobble together a middle path or extend the stay on Kacsmaryk’s ruling pending litigation in what could be a fateful case. There is also an order contradictory to Kacsmaryk’s, from a judge in Washington state, requiring the FDA to keep mifepristone available in 18 liberal jurisdictions, which is further adding to the legal imbroglio.
    
            Former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers said on “CNN News Central” on Wednesday that the fact that the court didn’t order a longer stay than the current two days could mean justices “are seriously thinking about affirming some of what the Fifth Circuit said.”
    
            “If they agree with the Fifth Circuit as to which parts of Judge Kacsmaryk’s (order) could survive or could be rejected, it would mean that women would have to go in person, multiple times, to their doctor and could only get mifepristone up to seven weeks (into a pregnancy),” Rodgers said.
    
            The decisions that the justices could make will have wide-ranging implications beyond the simple question of if and when mifepristone can be used.
    
            — The Supreme Court could potentially deliver a ruling that would effectively allow a single judge – in this case, in a red corner of Texas – to influence the medical choices and restrict the freedoms of millions of American women, not just in states where abortion is banned but also in more liberal areas where it is legal.
    
            “This was an unelected judge making a decision – a federal decision basically on this,” GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina told CNN’s Manu Raju on Wednesday.
    
            This sweeping use of judicial power not only appears to offend the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling last year on allowing legislators to decide abortion rights. The ruling by Kacsmaryk, a long-time opponent of abortion rights, exemplifies the ambition of parts of the anti-abortion rights movement in the post-Roe era. 
    
            But it could also open the way for liberal judges to use their power in the same way, and create a thicket of litigation that could also end up at the Supreme Court. The judiciary’s nominal reputation for restraint and staying out of partisan politics is already being threatened.
    
            — The Supreme Court’s eventual ruling could also have a sweeping impact on how mifepristone is prescribed – often as part of a two-drug regimen to end pregnancies and after miscarriages – and, in some cases, on the availability of abortion services to millions of women. As with the aftermath of the repeal of Roe v. Wade, the justices’ ruling here could mean that women’s rights and freedoms to make their own health care decisions could be more curtailed in some states than others.
    
            Katie Watson, an associate professor at Northwestern University, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday that even a partial loss of access could have grave consequences. “Approximately a half million women used this drug in recent years and they depend on it,” she said.
    
            — Critics argue that if Kacsmaryk’s ruling is upheld – along with the Fifth Circuit’s limitations on the use of mifepristone – it would validate a decision of a single judge or panel with no medical expertise over standards of science and clinical analysis. Mifepristone has been safely prescribed since the FDA approved it two decades ago. But anti-abortion doctors and medical associations argued in the case that the agency violated the law in how it approved the drug for abortions in 2000. By filing their suit in Amarillo, Texas, they guaranteed that Kacsmaryk would hear the case. 
    
            “They basically have said, these two judges, hey we know better than the FDA,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar told Tapper. 
    
            Such a precedent could create chaos in the pharmaceutical industry and in medicine and threaten the regulatory system for clearing new treatments. It might also prompt other judges to take aim at approved drugs – for instance, birth control pills or even treatments for common ailments and pain killers. Such a scenario would directly undermine the entire premise of federal government. 
    
            “The impact, even if they say the Washington order can stand and the Texas order can stand, is that the FDA cannot regulate federally. … The impact is enormous,” Watson said.
    
            — The justices’ deliberations may also have a profound effect on the reputation of the court. Many moderate Americans increasingly see the conservative majority as a group of unelected right-wingers flouting public opinion on issues like abortion, which majorities do not want to be banned outright, according to many polls. While the conservative justices insist that they are simply interpreting the Constitution as written and returning issues to the states, a decision that causes massive upheaval could harm the court’s image at a time when it is also reeling from ethics questions surrounding conservative Justice Clarence Thomas.
    
            — A decision to ban mifepristone could cause shockwaves like those set off by the overturning of Roe, which hurt Republicans in last year’s midterm elections and most recently galvanized voters in support of a liberal candidate in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race earlier this month. Advocates who believe abortion is immoral may not care about partisan implications. The repeal of a constitutional right to an abortion validated a half-century-long campaign by the anti-abortion movement in one of the most significant political victories in modern American history. But the Republican Party risks paying a price in next year’s presidential and congressional elections. Liberals might have been complacent in a belief that Roe would never be overturned, but they have effectively leveraged the issue ever since.
    
            “Our Republican colleagues, for the most part, have been silent on this,” said Klobuchar, referring to the cases currently being considered by the Supreme Court. “We are standing up, the Democratic Party, President Biden, for women’s rights, to say women have a right to make their own health care decisions.” 
    
            Mace, the South Carolina Republican from a competitive district, delivered a warning on Wednesday that the GOP’s position could cost it the House majority in 2024.
    
            “It’s a purple district, and as a bellwether for the rest of the country, it’s one of the reasons why we will not win the popular vote in ’24 if we continue down this path of extremism,” Mace said of her Charleston-area seat. “That is not where the American people are, and we need to have a conversation, where are we and where is the middle ground?”
    
            The Supreme Court’s deliberations come as abortion is already at the center of federal, local and state government policy debates and is stretching the court system with dueling rulings that are further politicizing the legal system. 
    
            In the six months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, there were about 32,000 fewer abortions than expected in the US, according to a new study by the Society of Family Planning. And CNN reported Wednesday that fewer medical students are applying to ob/gyn residency programs, with the decline most marked in states with the strongest restrictions. 
    
            And a patchwork of laws related to abortion, and its restricted access, is emerging across the country. On Wednesday, for instance, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed new bills that he said will enshrine a “culture of life” by widening a safety net for foster children and expanding adoptions and resources for women who discover they are pregnant. 
    
            Last week, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill outlawing most abortions in the state after six weeks – a point by which many women do not know they are pregnant. The potential presidential candidate’s reluctance to publicize his move, which was announced late at night, reflected the tug of war in the GOP between the desire to go all in on banning abortion and a recognition that doing so could alienate more moderate voters in a national election.

      Details about multimillion-dollar stock holding concealed in abortion pill judge’s financial disclosures
    ","
			By Casey Tolan and Isabelle Chapman, CNN

        3:34 PM EDT, Fri April 21, 2023
    ","
            The federal judge who issued a nationwide ruling blocking the approval of a common abortion medication redacted key information on his legally mandated financial disclosures, in what legal experts described as an unusual move that conceals the bulk of his personal fortune. 
    
            In his 2020 and 2021 annual disclosures, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk wrote that he held between $5 million and $25 million in “common stock” of a company – a significant majority of the judge’s personal wealth. The name of the company he held stock in is redacted, despite the fact that federal law only allows redactions of information that could “endanger” a judge or their family member. 
    
            CNN obtained a previous financial disclosure for Kacsmaryk – which is not available online – from 2017, when he was a judicial nominee. 
    
            On that unredacted form, Kacsmaryk reported owning about $2.9 million in stock in the Florida-based supermarket company Publix. It’s not clear whether that’s the same holding as the redacted stock, although Publix’s share price had significantly increased by 2020 and 2021 and the company is no longer listed on his more recent disclosures.
    
            Redactions are approved by a judicial committee. The redacted holding accounted for at least 85% of Kacsmaryk’s total reported wealth in 2021, and potentially more.
    
            “The whole point of a disclosure is to explain where you have conflicts,” said Michael Lissner, the executive director of the Free Law Project, a nonprofit that has published judicial disclosures. “If you have stock and you’re not saying what it’s in and it’s this much of your personal wealth, that’s a conflict you have. The public deserves to know.”
    
            In a statement to CNN, Kacsmaryk said the “Administrative Office of the United States Courts approved the redaction after reviewing the relevant rules and applicable threats.”
    
            “It is a private corporation headquartered and operated outside of Texas, outside the Fifth Circuit. It has never been a party in any case in the Northern District of Texas,” Kacsmaryk wrote of the company he holds stock in. “The Clerk’s Office has the name of the entity, actively screens incoming cases, and I would be automatically recused from any cases involving this entity.”
    
            The redaction is the latest example of Kacsmaryk not being fully transparent as a judge and judicial nominee, even as he has become one of the most controversial judges in the country. 
    
            CNN reported Thursday that Kacsmaryk failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation process two interviews in which he discussed contraception and gay rights. And The Washington Post reported last week that Kacsmaryk removed his name in 2017 from a pending law review article criticizing protections for transgender people and those seeking abortions as he was being nominated.
    
            Kacsmaryk, who worked as a lawyer for a conservative religious freedom advocacy group before joining the bench, was first nominated by former President Donald Trump in 2017 and confirmed in 2019. In recent years, he has become a significant legal thorn in the side of the Biden administration, issuing sweeping rulings and nationwide injunctions on issues like immigration and protections for LGBTQ workers, even before his abortion ruling this month. 
    
            In several instances, including the abortion pill case, conservative groups seem to have strategically filed their lawsuits in Kacsmaryk’s Amarillo-area jurisdiction in order to guarantee he hears their cases. 
    
            The redacted stock that Kacsmaryk reported on his disclosure form was significantly larger than any other financial holding he disclosed, the largest of which in 2021 were two mutual and index funds that he listed as between $100,001 and $250,000 each. 
    
            The stock earned Kacsmaryk between $50,001 and $100,000 in dividend income in 2020 and between $100,001 and $1,000,000 in 2021, the reports state. Federal judges are only required to report financial holdings in ranges, and don’t have to provide exact figures. 
    
            According to a note in his 2020 disclosure, the stock was previously held in a trust fund named for Kacsmaryk, which was dissolved in 2020, and Kacsmaryk now holds the stock personally. 
    
            Publix stock is not publicly traded, and only Publix employees and members of its board of directors can buy it, according to the company. One possible source of the Publix stock Kacsmaryk reported in 2017 is the judge’s grandmother. According to her obituary, Mary Kacsmaryk “joined the Publix team early in its history and worked 25+ years” and was well-known for “her passion and pride for being a Publix team member.”
    
            Notably, no other judges in Kacsmaryk’s district, the Northern District of Texas, redacted the name of a company they held stock in in their most recently available financial disclosures. Lissner, whose organization has published thousands of financial disclosure forms, said that while redactions aren’t especially uncommon, the size of the holding Kacsmaryk redacted and the fact that the name of the company was hidden were unusual. 
    
            Redactions are approved by a committee of the Judicial Conference, which oversees the federal court system. According to federal statute, disclosures can only be redacted if the committee concludes that “revealing personal and sensitive information could endanger that individual or a family member of that individual.” A report may be redacted “for as long as the danger to such individual exists.” 
    
            The US court system’s Guide to Judiciary Policy lays out more specific reasons for redaction, such as the potential for information in reports to be used for identity theft or reveal a judge’s place of residence. The 2023 copy of the guide states that “it would be unusual for a request for the redaction of the identity of a stock or other security to be granted,” although that statement doesn’t appear in earlier versions of the document. 
    
            Virginia Canter, a former government ethics lawyer who now works for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that “it’s of utmost importance to protect the judges and their family members.” Federal judges were the target of thousands of threats in 2022, according to the US Marshals Service, and one federal judge, Esther Salas, was targeted in a 2020 attack that killed her son and left her husband injured.
    
            “If it would reveal where a family member was working, you could make the argument (for redaction), but I think that would be one of the limited circumstances,” Canter said. She added that that argument would be harder to make for common stock in a large company with many locations and employees, such as Publix. 
    
            Judges generally submit requests for redaction, although it is possible for the committee to redact information without a judge’s request, the guide states.
    
            In 2020 and 2021, less than 4% of officials required to file judicial financial disclosures requested redaction, according to reports from the Administrative Office of the US Courts. Almost all redaction requests were granted, and most were approved because the information could reveal “the physical presence of filers or members of their families at unsecured locations,” the reports said. 
    
            A spokesperson for the Judicial Conference said she could not comment about any specific financial disclosure report or redaction requests for confidentiality reasons. 
    
            Federal law requires judges to recuse themselves from cases in which they have a financial interest – but they haven’t always done so. In 2021, for example, the Wall Street Journal found that 131 federal judges heard cases involving firms in which they or their family members held stock, a violation of the law. 
    
            Publix, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, does not appear to have been a party in any cases before Kacsmaryk.
    
            In any case, experts said, the judge’s redacted report prevents transparency that litigants deserve. 
    
            “The redaction of his single largest investment in common stock makes it impossible to know if he’s complying with his recusal obligations,” said Steven Lubet, an emeritus professor at Northwestern Law School who studies judicial ethics. “If the stock ownership isn’t disclosed, there’s no way to know.”
    
            Lubet said that the idea that revealing the name of the stock would reach the level of endangering Kacsmaryk or a family member was “certainly questionable.”
    
            Kacsmaryk is also in the spotlight as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas faces his own controversies over failure to disclose international trips and a real estate deal involving a right-wing billionaire, following reporting by the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica.
    
            Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in government ethics, said Kacsmaryk’s redactions were not in the same category as Thomas’ apparently willful failure to disclose required information over many years. But she said that in general, judges’ failure to be transparent about their finances could undermine “public trust in the courts.”
    
            “He has successfully hidden his single largest reportable asset,” Clark said of Kacsmaryk. “We don’t know what it is … or what’s the justification for redacting it. It’s very strange.”

      Judge who suspended abortion pill failed to disclose interviews that discussed social issues

            The federal district judge who first suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the so-called abortion pill mifepristone failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation process two interviews on Christian talk radio where he discussed social issues such as contraception and gay rights.  
    
            In undisclosed radio interviews, Matthew Kacsmaryk referred to being gay as “a lifestyle” and expressed concerns that new norms for “people who experience same-sex attraction” would lead to clashes with religious institutions, calling it the latest in a change in sexual norms that began with “no-fault divorce” and “permissive policies on contraception.”   
    
            Kacsmaryk, a Trump-appointed federal district judge, made the unreported comments in two appearances in 2014 on Chosen Generation, a radio show that offers “a biblical constitutional worldview.” At the time, Kacsmaryk was deputy general counsel at First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit religious liberty advocacy group known before 2016 as the Liberty Institute, and was brought on to the radio show to discuss “the homosexual agenda” to silence churches and religious liberty, according to the show’s host. 
    
            Federal judicial nominees are required to submit detailed paperwork to the Senate Judiciary Committee ahead of their confirmation process, including copies of nearly everything they have ever written or said in public, in order for the committee to evaluate a nominee’s qualifications and personal opinions. Neither interview is listed in the paperwork Kacsmaryk provided to the Senate during his judicial nomination process, which first began in 2017.  
    
            The radio interviews were not included in the 22 media works Kacsmaryk disclosed, which included three radio appearances and 19 written pieces. 
    
            A spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN the interviews weren’t in their archived files from Kacsmaryk’s confirmation, which included all paperwork submitted for his nomination. 
    
            In a statement sent to CNN, Kacsmaryk said he did not locate the interview when searching for media to disclose and he did not recall the interview. 
    
            “I used the DOJ-OLP manual to run searches for all media but did not locate this interview and did not recall this event, which involved a call-in to a local radio show,” he told CNN. “After listening to the audio file supplied by CNN, I agree that the content is equivalent to the legal analysis appearing throughout my SJQ and discussed extensively during my Senate confirmation hearing. Additionally, the transcript supplied by CNN appears to track with the audio and accurately recounts my responses during the phone call—when quoted in full.” 
    
            The Washington Post reported last week that Kacsmaryk removed his name in 2017 from a pending law review article criticizing protections for transgender people and those seeking abortions during his judicial nomination process, a highly unusual move for a judicial nominee. 
    
            Kacsmaryk did not respond to the Post’s request for comment, but a spokesperson for his old employer First Liberty claimed Kacsmaryk’s name had been a “placeholder” on the article and that Kacsmaryk had not provided a “substantive contribution,” despite the final version being almost identical to the one submitted under Kacsmaryk’s name according to the Post. 
    
            Kacsmaryk later submitted supplemental material in 2019 to the committee to reflect interviews and events he participated since in 2017, but neither of the 2014 radio interviews were included. 
    
            Democratic senators grilled Kacsmaryk on his positions on abortion and LGBTQ rights during both his nomination hearing and in written questions in 2017. 
    
            While Kacsmaryk worked at First Liberty, one of his colleagues, general counsel Jeff Mateer, was also nominated for a federal judgeship. But Mateer came under scrutiny in 2017 for comments unearthed during his confirmation process in which he once compared the US to Nazi Germany on Chosen Generation – the same radio program Kacsmaryk appeared on and whose interviews he did not disclose. 
    
            Mateer’s nomination was later rescinded; Kacsmaryk was later confirmed in 2019.  
    
            The interviews were shared by Kacsmaryk’s employer, the Liberty Institute, at the time on social media. A guest from First Liberty appeared once a week, according to the show’s radio host in the broadcast and archives available online.
    
            In one interview from February 2014, in response to a question on the “homosexual agenda,” Kacsmaryk expressed concerns that new social norms surrounding “same-sex marriage” and “people who experience same-sex attraction” would lead to clashes with religious institutions. 
    
            “I just want to make very clear, people who experience a same-sex attraction are not responsible individually or solely for the atmosphere of the sexual revolution,” Kacsmaryk said. “You know it. It’s a long time coming. It came after no-fault divorce. It came after we implemented very permissive policies on contraception. The sexual revolution has gone through several phases. We just happen to be at the phase now where same sex marriages is at the fore.” 
    
            “But through that progression or regression, I think you can see five areas where there will be a clash of absolutes between the traditional Judeo-Christian understanding of marriage and the revisionist, redefined vision of marriage that you saw in last term’s Supreme Court opinions,” he said before outlining those areas as over tax exempt statuses, adoption services, federal government programs, and discrimination at universities. 
    
            He appeared on the program to discuss the federal government’s view of same-sex marriage and opponents of it following the court ruling striking down the Defense of Marriage Act. The host suggested opponents of same-sex marriage could be viewed as “hostile” enemies of the government in line with al-Qaeda, which Kacsmaryk agreed with.  
    
            “Yeah, and I can speak from immediate firsthand experience,” he said, citing his work formerly in the Justice Department. “That is very much in vogue now in the federal government to characterize opposition to same sex marriage and related issues as irrational prejudice at best and a potential hate crime at worse,” he continued.  
    
            “It really has infused the entire federal service top to bottom as the administration has declared that they will join this culture war, that there’s one side that is destined to win and that you’re on the wrong side of history in the federal government if you are on an opposing side,” he added.  
    
            Kacsmaryk also appeared on the program in July 2014 to discuss an executive order signed by then-President Barack Obama that banned federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity which did not exempt faith-based groups.  
    
            Kacsmaryk linked changes in Democrats’ views on the issue of religious freedom to the “emergence of this very powerful constituency in the LGBT community,” which he said the Obama administration made campaign promises to fulfill. Kacsmaryk said religious organizations entering into contracts with the federal government would have risk under the executive order and face a “real burden” for dissenting from “the new sexual orthodoxy” on gay rights. 
    
            The new rules, Kacsmaryk suggested, were poorly written and didn’t differentiate between gay people who lived “celibate” lives and those who made being gay “a lifestyle,” in a discussion of how religious groups would comply with the new rules.  
    
            “If you look at the letter that was issued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, they point out that the category sexual orientation is problematic because it’s not defined,” he said. “Most Abrahamic faith traditions will draw a distinction between someone who experiences the same sex attraction but is willing to live celibate and somebody who experiences the same sex attraction and makes it a lifestyle and seeks to sexualize that lifestyle. Those are two different categories that most Abrahamic faith traditions recognize.”

      Most adults value reproductive rights when deciding where to go to college, poll shows
    ","
			By Madeline Holcombe, CNN

        6:16 AM EDT, Thu April 20, 2023
    ","
            Class sizes, available majors and extracurriculars aren’t the only things going into college decisions this year. 
    
            A new poll shows that incoming and current college students are also thinking about whether their school is in a state with reproductive health access.
    
            Among adults in the United States ages 18 to 59 who are not enrolled in a college and do not have a degree, 60% said reproductive health laws are at least somewhat important to their decision about whether to enroll in a particular college or university, according to the latest Lumina Foundation-Gallup State of Higher Education 2022 study, which was released Thursday. 
    
            Nearly three-quarters of enrolled students say their decision to stay at their college or university is at least somewhat affected by their state’s reproductive health laws, the poll showed.
    
            “That’s a large percentage of people saying, ‘You know what, if they had those restrictive reproductive care [laws], I don’t think I would attend a school in those states,’ ” said Courtney Brown, vice president of strategic impact and planning at Lumina, a foundation that promotes access to post-secondary education. 
    
            In June, the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling ended the federal right to an abortion. Legislation around reproductive health has since varied across the country; some states have restricted access to abortion, and others have moved to increase access.
    
            “The reality of abortion being banned in all or most scenarios is a growing reality for many,” said Brandon Crawford, an assistant professor of applied health science at Indiana University who wasn’t involved in the survey. 
    
            “Although there was already significant variation in reproductive health policies across states, [Roe v. Wade] provided a ‘floor’ to legislation, meaning that abortion generally couldn’t be banned before viability,” Crawford wrote in an email. “With the Dobbs decision, that floor is gone.”
    
            Crawford and Indiana University professor of sexual health Kristen Jozkowski have been leading a multiyear study on US adults’ attitudes on abortion. Much of the results don’t surprise them, said Jozkowski, who also was not involved in the latest survey.
    
            Their results have shown that abortion and reproductive health are more salient to younger generations but also point out more nuanced perspectives generally.
    
            “We find that people may be more inclined to tolerate abortion than to necessarily support or oppose it, meaning that restricting it entirely, as many states have post-Dobbs, seems misaligned with the public sentiment,” Jozkowski wrote in an email.
    
            The new survey, which is part of Gallup and Lumina’s work on pressing issues facing higher education, has gone out annually since the Covid-19 pandemic started in 2020. The data was collected from October 26 to November 17. 
    
            Questions were added with the recent developments on access to abortion, Brown said. 
    
            “If you go to a state that doesn’t allow you to have autonomy over your body, then that that is not only not appealing, that is offensive to many women,” she said. 
    
            The results show some similarity among demographics.
    
            When asked whether they would be more likely to enroll in a college if it was in a state that allowed greater access to reproductive health services, most people said yes, Brown said. 
    
            “The overwhelming majority of every single subpopulation – women, men, older, younger and, most importantly, party identification – the overwhelming majority said, ‘yes, greater access to reproductive health,’ ” she added.
    
            That means respondents who identified as Republican as well as those who identified as Democrat showed a preference for attending a college in a state with less restriction on reproductive health. And it wasn’t just the youngest cohort that felt that way, Brown said. 
    
            “The fact that 74% of Republican unenrolled adults say, ‘I would consider enrolling a state that had greater access’ is, I think, a really impressive number,” she said. 
    
            Enrollment in colleges and universities has been dropping since 2017, and the problem has been getting worse – especially after the pandemic began, Brown said. 
    
            Since 2017, the US has seen a 14% decline in enrollment, she added. 
    
            The survey results may foreshadow a particular problem for states that are hostile to reproductive rights, Brown said. The data shows that students may be more likely to consider leaving their state for college or ruling out going to school in a state that otherwise would have been a contender. 
    
            “That’s a problem for the economic development in the states, because you want the students to learn about the local universities and then stay and get jobs in those states,” Brown said. “Once they leave to go to another state to attend college or university, they’re less likely to come back.”
    
            That can mean losing the educated talent that everyone is looking for, she added. 
    
            It’s also a problem for the people who are already often disadvantaged in college enrollment and reproductive rights, including Black, Latino, Native American and low-income students, Brown said. “They are going to face more criminal charges, if it becomes criminal, or they don’t they don’t have the funds to actually leave the state and go to another state if they actually need health care.
    
            “Basically, we’re concerned about them being able to continue their college pathway if they’re up against both legal as well as monetary barriers to taking care of themselves,” Brown said.

      Senate upholds VA rule on abortion access

            The Senate on Wednesday rejected a GOP-led effort to overturn a recently adopted Veterans Affairs rule that allows the department to provide abortions if the health or life of the veteran is in danger, or when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest.
    
            The resolution authored by Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville failed 48-51. GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine crossed party lines, joining Democrats in defending the administration’s rule. One Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted with most of the Republicans.
    
            The Senate vote comes at a time of heightened attention to abortion access in the US. Following the Supreme Court’s decision to reverse Roe v. Wade last year, states across the country have passed law restricting access to abortion and a high-profile legal battle is now playing out over medication abortion. 
    
            Ahead of the vote, President Joe Biden vowed to veto the resolution if the rule was overturned. 
    
            “The VA’s policy is consistent with my longstanding support of the Hyde Amendment and my opposition to using federal funds for abortions, expect when the life, or health of the mother would be endangered, or when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest,” Collins said in a statement to CNN. 
    
            The Hyde Amendment blocks federal funding for most abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman’s life is in danger.

      Opinion: The reason Americans are getting killed in driveways
    ","
			Opinion by Jill Filipovic

        6:09 PM EDT, Wed April 19, 2023
    ","
            It’s another Only in America news cycle: Four young people, in three different states, shot by strangers – all reportedly because they had the bad luck to approach the wrong house or the wrong car. And all because America allows far too many people to arm themselves with deadly weapons.
    
            Ralph Yarl, just 16, apparently thought he was ringing a friend’s doorbell in Kansas City, Missouri, when Andrew Lester, an 84-year-old White man, shot Yarl, who is Black, through the front door, and then shot him again in the head. Yarl miraculously survived, but his life will never be the same. Lester told police he and Yarl exchanged no words before Lester fired.
    
            Kaylin Gillis, a White 20-year-old, was in the car with her friends in rural upstate New York when they accidentally turned up the wrong driveway. The homeowner, 65-year-old Kevin Monahan, also White, shot her dead as the car was leaving, according to a local sheriff.
    
            And in Texas, police said two teenage cheerleaders were shot by Pedro Tello Rodriguez Jr., a 25-year-old Latino man, after one mistook Rodriguez’s car for her own in a grocery store parking lot and opened the door.
    
            Many Americans, particularly leading Republicans, like to point out that most gun owners are law-abiding citizens – not people who buy guns with the intention of committing a crime. The problem, though, is that any society as gun-saturated as ours isn’t going to see senseless violence just from criminals. It’s going to see senseless violence from people who were law-abiding citizens, until they used a gun to kill or maim someone.
    
            No one knows what these shooters were thinking when they purchased their firearms. But I feel virtually certain it wasn’t “I’m going to shoot a kid in my driveway.” I suspect these men considered themselves law-abiding citizens who simply wanted to protect themselves, and perhaps their families or their property. Or maybe they even wanted to have a gun just to have one.
    
            But because the US allows nearly anyone to arm themselves, we as a society create and enable a situation in which average, often untrained citizens are handed the ability to swiftly end others’ lives. And it’s a vicious cycle: Many conservatives who object to regulating guns also paint a picture of a violent society in which every person has to be prepared to use deadly force, and a huge majority of gun owners themselves say they own a gun because they’re afraid of crime. But of course, when few limits are placed on gun ownership, guns are more common and gun crime becomes more pervasive; when guns are ubiquitous in a society, so is gun violence.
    
            In other words, the very gun violence created by lax gun laws and mass gun ownership fuels the kind of fearfulness that leads to gun ownership.
    
            America very obviously needs to make a change. Owning a gun should be significantly more difficult than owning a car: Our laws should require extensive training, the passing of a strict test, reasonable limits on what type of weapon one can own, insurance mandates, safety rules and regular checks of one’s mental health and physical abilities. If you can’t see well enough to drive a car, you can’t see well enough to responsibly own a firearm.
    
            At this point, the public can’t know whether any of these shooters would have passed these benchmarks. But these basic regulations could save a great many lives. And the same way a driver’s test makes the rules of the road clear to drivers – and hopefully sends the message that, if drivers break the law, ignorance is no defense – a stricter gun ownership process could emphasize to gun owners that their weapon is their responsibility, and if they fire first and ask questions later, that’s going to be on them, in criminal court.
    
            In the US, of course, this is not always how it works. Over and over, gun owners make radically irresponsible and dangerous choices, whether that’s having a gun in the home when they know that their child is emotionally disturbed or violent, killing someone hastily and claiming a “stand your ground” defense or shooting at a stranger over a knock at the front door or the chime of a doorbell.
    
            In 1984, the Bernie Goetz case in New York City made headlines when Goetz shot four unarmed teenagers on the New York City subway after one approached him and either asked for or demanded $5. While all four teens survived, one was left paralyzed and with brain damage. Goetz claimed that he had been the victim of a previous violent robbery in a city beset by violent crime, and so his reaction to pull out a gun and fire was a reasonable one given his state of mind. It was an absurd argument, especially given the allegations of racist comments from Goetz. But a jury bought it. Goetz got off on the attempted murder and assault charges and was convicted only of gun charges. After the appeals process, Goetz ended up serving just eight months in prison.
    
            But the case briefly captivated the public’s attention, in part because it raised crucial questions: When judging an individual’s actions as criminal or not, do we default to what that individual believed was reasonable? Or do we insist that there is some baseline standard of a reasonable person that, no matter the individual’s particular background or perspective, one should have to abide by? And how much force is too much to defend one’s property?
    
            These are questions we continue to face. Do we want to live in a country where deadly force is wielded according to the judgment of people like Goetz or the three men who shot first in Missouri, New York and Texas? Or do we want to live in a county with laws and rules, where people can make honest mistakes and not pay for it with their lives?
    
            Pro-gun conservatives continue to stress that most gun owners are responsible, reasonable and law-abiding. So it should be easy for them to prove it through a tough but fair licensing process. And when they behave irresponsibly with a weapon that they know full well was designed to kill, then we must hold them fully accountable – including with criminal charges and serious jail time. Truly reasonable, responsible and law-abiding people would accept no less.

      Generic abortion pill maker GenBioPro sues FDA over its response to orders halting drug’s approval
    ","

        5:32 PM EDT, Wed April 19, 2023
    ","
            The US manufacturer of the generic version of a medication abortion drug sued the Biden administration Wednesday, the latest legal development in the dramatic court fight over abortion pills.
    
            The company GenBioPro alleges that the US Food and Drug Administration has violated the Constitution’s Due Process Clause and other laws in how the agency has responded to recent court orders halting the approval of the generic version of the drug, mifepristone. 
    
            GenBioPro is seeking a court order that would require the FDA to go through certain procedural steps laid out under federal law before declaring its mifepristone product unapproved. The company is also asking the court to bar the federal government from taking enforcement actions against the company before the FDA had gone through statutory process of withdrawing or suspending the drug.
    
            The new lawsuit was filed in federal court in Maryland and sets up a third legal battlefront over access to abortion pills. 
    
            The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to freeze the court orders that emerged from a separate lawsuit, filed by anti-abortion activists in Texas, that would undo the 2019 approval of the generic version of the drug and reverse other steps the FDA has taken in recent years to make abortion pills easier to obtain. Those orders have been paused by Supreme Court until 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday, while the justices decide whether the Texas case rulings should be kept on hold for a longer period of time.
    
            It is unclear how the new lawsuit will impact the other legal flashpoints over mifepristone. GenBioPro is not a party in the lawsuit in front of the Supreme Court. In a third case, filed in Washington state by Democratic state attorneys general, a federal judge ordered the FDA to not take any steps that would reduce mifepristone in the 18 jurisdictions behind the lawsuit, which seeks to expand access to abortion pills.
    
            The new lawsuit provides a behind-the-scenes view of the fallout from the anti-abortion litigation in Texas. The complaint zeroes in on how the federal government has said in court filings in that case that recent court orders have the effect of making GenBioPro’s product “misbranded” and leave the generic version of the drug “without an effective drug approval.”
    
            The company argues that the FDA is causing GenBioPro “imminent, catastrophic, and irreparable harm” by making those characterizations while ignoring the “statutory and regulatory procedures” for withdrawing a drug.
    
            The lawsuit describes several attempts by GenBioPro to get assurances from the FDA that it would go through the multistep withdrawal process mandated by Congress before pulling the drug from the market. The company alleges that the agency did not offer those assurances, nor did it respond to the company’s requests for a non-enforcement directive that would shield the company, its business partners and its customers from any FDA enforcement actions based on the court orders in the Texas case.
    
            “GenBioPro faces a credible, serious threat of FDCA enforcement if it attempts to continue producing and marketing mifepristone,” the lawsuit says, referring to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which sets out how the FDA goes about its regulatory process. “With the specter of criminal prosecution looming, GenBioPro may be obligated to undertake recalls, cancel contracted manufacturing and hold or destroy perishable inventory.”
    
            GenBioPro’s lawsuit names as its defendants the FDA, the Justice Department and Department of Health and Human Services. 
    
            The FDA and the Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit. HHS referred CNN to the response from the FDA.

            Medication abortions provided by virtual-only providers accounted for an increasing share of total abortions in the United States, since the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, according to a new report by the Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit focused on abortion and contraception.  
    
            While total abortions decreased by 2% from April to December 2022, medicated abortions via telehealth increased by 136%. In April, there were less than 4,000 medicated abortions provided virtually, and in December, there were more than 8,500.
    
            Medication abortions already accounted for more than half of all US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The new data from the Society of Family Planning suggests that rate likely increased in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision.
    
            The US Supreme Court has temporarily extended access to mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process, until April 21, a move meant to give the justices more time to consider the issue. 
    
            The Supreme Court has paused a federal appeals court ruling to freeze parts of a Texas judge’s ruling that would have suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone. The federal appeals court would have allowed the pill to be available in the United States, but would have made it harder to get. The appeals court had ruled that the judge’s suspension of several revisions to the drug’s rules since 2000 — including one that makes the pills available by telehealth and in the mail — could go into effect. 
    
            The Society of Family Planning collects data from abortion providers nationwide including from clinics, private medical offices, hospitals and virtual providers. More than 80% of providers the nonprofit identified participated in the analysis. Data from popular overseas telehealth provider Aid Access medication abortion is not included in the report, since it is not part of the formal US healthcare system. However, a study from last November found that there were about 6,500 requests made per month to Aid Access for medication abortion.
    
            Before the Dobbs decision, 5% of all abortions were provided via telehealth, and after the ruling, that rate grew to 9%. While the share of telehealth abortions dropped off in a few states, including Georgia and Wyoming, it surged in 27 states across the country last year.
    
            Wyoming by far recorded the highest rate of telehealth abortions both before and after the Dobbs ruling of any state. Before the ruling, 92% of abortions in Wyoming were provided via telehealth, and in the months following the decision, that rate dropped to about 80%. 
    
            Despite the heavy dependence on virtually provided medication abortions, Wyoming became the first state to explicitly ban the use of abortion pills with a law that takes effect on July 1.
    
            In Idaho, 17% of all abortions that took place before the ruling were provided through virtual-only services. In the months that followed, that rate jumped to 43%. That’s an increase of 26 percentage points — the largest of any state.
    
            Several of the 17 Democratic-led states involved in the Washington lawsuit that sued to expand access to abortion pills, such as Colorado and Maine, also recorded some of the most substantial increases in telehealth abortions as a percent of all abortions. In those states, and the District of Columbia, 8% of abortions before the Dobbs ruling were provided virtually. And afterward, the rate increased to nearly 13%.

      After fall of Roe, future doctors show less interest in training in states with abortion bans or as ob/gyns
    ","

    ","
            The Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal right to an abortion created a patchwork of laws across the United States and widespread uncertainty. Among those with questions are the nation’s future doctors. 
    
            Morgan Levy, a medical school student at the University of Miami, said the impacts of the ruling immediately became a point of discussion among her peers. She’ll be applying to residency training programs this fall, and now has to assess whether the new laws will affect what she’s taught and how. 
    
            “More than ever, I recognize the importance of good, comprehensive, evidence-based reproductive health care,” said Levy, who plans to train as an ob/gyn. In some states, though, it has become “all but impossible” to get formal family planning training, including abortion practices. 
    
            “There is definitely a consideration of making sure that the training programs that I’m applying to are going to be able to provide the kind of training that I’m going to need in order to be able to do that for my patients,” she said.
    
            And new data suggests that these restrictions are having an impact on where – and what – future doctors plan to practice. 
    
            The number of medical school students who applied to residency training programs ticked down last year, and applications to programs in states with abortion bans dropped the most, according to a new analysis from the Association of American Medical Colleges. 
    
            Interest in the ob/gyn speciality took a notable dip, with applications dropping 5% nationwide and twice as much in states where abortion is banned. Emergency medicine also saw a significantly large drop in applications. 
    
            Despite the decline in applications, all ob/gyn residency positions and most others were filled. So while there’s no immediate shortage of physicians in-training, experts say the shift is reason for concern. 
    
            “I worry about exacerbating these maternal health care and abortion deserts that already exist. We already have a gap,” said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn in New Jersey and chair of the board of directors for Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Because of that, we need more ob/gyns to join the field to help build up practice in places where we’re losing providers for other reasons.”
    
            More than a third of US counties have limited or no access to maternity care, according to a recent report – and there’s notable overlap between maternity care deserts and states where abortion access is limited.
    
            Most physicians stay in the area that they trained. If programs in states with abortion bans shift to less desirable training plans, more and more students could prioritize being in less restrictive states for residency – and eventually to practice.
    
            Long-term, that could create a “tiered system of health care,” Brandi said. 
    
            However, experts say it will be important to track the preferences for medical school students in the years to come. Last year’s graduating class applied to residency programs just months after the Supreme Court’s ruling. They had to make decisions before seeing exactly how the programs would react and adjust. 
    
            “For the next year or two, things are gonna be really uncertain for people. And I think that many people didn’t want to engage in that uncertainty, not knowing what they were signing up for,” Brandi said. 
    
            For Levy and others, perhaps more important than the specific location of a program is evidence that there is a strong and well-established commitment to training around family planning.
    
            “That’s really a green flag to me when programs have a really formal plan in place,” Levy said.  
    
            The Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell has long participated in the Ryan Residency Training Program that offers a specific focus on abortion and family planning. 
    
            Dr. Nagaraj Gabbur, who is the director of the ob/gyn residency program there, said that this specialized curriculum is usually one of the top reasons applicants give for why they want to practice there – and especially in the latest round of interviews. 
    
            For programs outside of “haven states” like New York, this could involve an out-of-state rotation.
    
            But for Brandi, rotational programs are just a “Band-Aid” that don’t address the underlying issues challenging reproductive health care – and don’t consider the livelihood of the individual trainee.
    
            Also, most of the physicians in the ob/gyn field are women. Even if certain training programs suffice, there might be personal concerns about living in states where abortion is banned, she says. 
    
            “This may impact not only the care that they want to provide as physicians, but also the care they can receive themselves,” Brandi said. 
    
            As Levy and her peers consider a major step forward for their lives and career, discussions on the topic are constant – and complicated.
    
            “It’s not a black or white or red versus blue kind of issue,” Levy said. 
    
            There are a lot of mixed emotions as people weigh many different factors, including clinical interests, logistics of the role, personal preference for location and broader implications. 
    
            Some feel strongly that they should train in a state that has preserved access to abortion, while others, like Levy, feel that there may be opportunity for advocacy in more restrictive environments.
    
            “It’s almost less so about the state itself and more so about the program’s attitudes and responses to the decision and the ways in which they’ve affirmed their commitment to making sure great care is provided in their states,” Levy said.

      Supreme Court temporarily extends access to abortion drug, sets Friday night deadline

    ","
            Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Wednesday temporarily extended a hold on a lower court ruling that would have imposed restrictions on access to an abortion drug, a move meant to give the justices more time to consider the issue.  
    
            In a similar order last week, Alito had said the court would rule by 11:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The new order – called an “administrative stay” – moves that deadline to Friday, April 21.
    
            The order was written by Alito because he has jurisdiction over the lower court that ruled in the dispute.  
    
            “Today’s order tells us nothing about how the full Court is going to rule other than that it’s likely there will be some kind of writing, whether by the majority or by Justices who might be writing separate concurrences or dissents,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “But it’s impossible to know which way that ruling is going to go; all we know for sure is that we’ll know more by the end of the evening on Friday.”
    
            The case is the most important abortion-related dispute to reach the high court since the justices overturned Roe v. Wade last term, triggering conservative states across the country to either ban or severely restrict the procedure. How the dispute over medication abortion is ultimately resolved could make it more difficult for women to obtain abortion, even in the states that still allow it.   
    
            At issue is the scope of the US Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate a drug, mifepristone, that the medical community has deemed safe and effective. Mifepristone has been used by millions of women across the country in the more than two decades that it has been on the market.  
    
            The legal controversy began last November when a group representing doctors who oppose abortion filed suit, arguing that the FDA had not done enough to ensure the safety of the drug some two decades earlier. 
    
            US District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, issued a broad ruling on April 7 that blocked the approval of the drug, as well as changes the FDA made in subsequent years to make the drug more accessible. He, however, delayed the effective date of his ruling by seven days to give time for an appeal. 
    
            Rejecting the consensus of the medical community, Kacsmaryk raised questions about the safety of the drug, peppering his opinion with jargon that is often used by opponents of abortion. He labeled doctors who perform the procedure “abortionists” and explained that he would reject the term “fetus” in favor of the more inflammatory “unborn human.” Instead of referring to the procedure as a “medication abortion,” he insisted on calling it a “chemical abortion.”  
    
            The FDA, Kacsmaryk contended at one point, “acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns – in violation of its statutory duty – based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions.”  
    
            Mainstream medical associations have rebuked his assertions about the dangers of the drug, and mifepristone has been shown to be safer than common medicines like penicillin and Viagra. 
    
            On a key threshold issue, the judge insisted that the plaintiffs – doctors who do not use or prescribe the drug – had the legal right to be in court to make their case because they allege that the use of the drug could “overwhelm” the medical system.  
    
            Stunned by the breadth of the decision, the Biden administration and Danco, a manufacturer of the drug, filed with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.  
    
            The appeals court ultimately let stand the government’s approval of the drug, but agreed with Kacsmaryk that access could be limited.  
    
            A divided three-judge panel ordered a return to the stricter, pre-2016 FDA regime around the drug, which prevents mailing the pill to patients who obtained it through telehealth, or virtual visits with their providers, rather than traveling to a clinic or hospital to obtain the drug in person. It also effectively revokes the 2019 approval of the generic version of the drug. The restrictions also affect the instructions on the label for the medication, shortening the window of obtaining the pill to seven weeks into pregnancy as opposed to 10. 
    
            It’s possible however that even with the ruling in effect, some providers could go “off-label” and continue to prescribe mifepristone up until 10 weeks.
    
            The 5th Circuit claimed that the FDA’s rules for the drug created “an exceedingly unusual regime,” and that the anti-abortion doctors had the right to sue over it because they would  “necessarily be injured by the consequences” of the FDA’s decision “to cut out doctors from the prescription and administration of mifepristone.” 
    
            The appeals court said that the statute of limitations likely barred the plaintiffs from challenging the 2000 approval, but that they were likely to succeed in their claims against the FDA’s more recent moves to adjust the rules around the drug. 
    
            The court accused the FDA of having a “ostrich’s-head-in-the-sand approach” to the drug that was “deeply troubling.” 
    
            Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar urged the justices to intervene in legal papers citing “unprecedented lower court orders countermanding FDA’s scientific judgment and unleashing regulatory chaos by suspending the existing FDA-approved conditions of use for mifepristone.”   
    
            This story has been updated with additional details.

      Anti-abortion doctors urge Supreme Court to keep mifepristone restrictions in place

            A group of doctors opposed to abortion asked the Supreme Court Tuesday to restrict access to a key medication abortion drug while other legal challenges play out, as Wednesday night’s deadline for the court to act approaches.
    
            The filing means that after the Justice Department files a response expected Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, the court may rule at any time as the legal battle over mifepristone continues, nearly two weeks after a federal judge in Texas said the drug should not have been approved in 2000.   
    
            Last week, Justice Samuel Alito granted a request of the Biden administration and a manufacturer of the drug to put a temporary hold on the decision to give the justices more time to review the case. Alito asked to hear from the doctors and said the court would make its final determination by 11:59 p.m ET on Wednesday. 
    
            In the filing, the doctors asked the justices to ultimately deny the request from the Biden administration, arguing that for “nearly a quarter-century” the government and a manufacturer of the drug “have brazenly flouted the law and applicable regulations, disregarded holes and red flags in their own safety data, intentionally evaded judicial review, and continually placed politics above women’s health.” 
    
            Erik C. Baptist, a lawyer for the doctors, said that the US Food and Drug Administration had not done enough to study the safety of the drug.  
    
            “Across decades, the agency has stripped away every meaningful and necessary safeguard on chemical abortion, demonstrating callous disregard for women’s well-being, unborn life, and statutory limits.” 
    
            He said that the government’s argument amount to a “sky-is-falling-argument that compares chemical abortion to drugs like ibuprofen” and that the lower court rulings that restrict access to the drug were “meticulous decisions” that, he argued, “merely require the agency to follow the law.  “

      Opinion: Mifepristone saved my life
    ","
			Opinion by Roxanne Jones

        7:30 AM EDT, Tue April 18, 2023
    ","
            The ruling earlier this month by a Texas federal judge to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a drug that is used frequently for medication abortions, is very personal for me.  
    
            That’s because I took mifepristone years ago during a miscarriage, and it saved my life. 
    
            When I was prescribed mifepristone, it had not yet taken center stage in America’s abortion wars. I did not have to make a rushed road trip across state lines to get my medicine, unlike many women who need the drug but live in one of the many states that have restricted access to medication abortion or passed near-total bans on abortion. 
    
            I was not forced to set up a secret meet-up with a stranger in order to buy my medicine on the black market, as several women I spoke to recently said they planned to do. Nor did I have to order mifepristone online and find myself navigating the many scammers taking advantage of the current patchwork of state abortion laws in the US. 
    
            Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion and the other, misoprostol, was not subject to the ruling by the Texas judge. The two drugs can be administered to someone having a miscarriage, allowing them to terminate the pregnancy when the fetus is not viable. 
    
            It happened some years ago: After experiencing more than a day of hemorrhaging during the first trimester of my pregnancy, I visited my ob-gyn, who explained after examining me that my blood pressure was dropping rapidly and the heavy bleeding I was experiencing was an unmistakable sign of a miscarriage. 
    
            For many women, being prescribed mifepristone is part of their routine medical care. Not so in my case: As my doctor explained, I was facing a dire medical emergency. I was grateful for the medication that saved my life.
    
            My miscarriage took me by surprise. I had loved being pregnant the first time around, about a decade earlier. And as a healthy woman, I had no reason for fear when I became pregnant again. By the time I was administered mifepristone, I was losing a life that I had already begun to love. And like many other women, despite my level of education or economic status, I could not outrun the statistics that put Black women at higher risk. 
    
            Up to one in four known pregnancies will end in a miscarriage. And for Black women, the numbers are alarmingly higher. According to an analysis of 4.6 million pregnancies in seven countries, the risk of a miscarriage for Black women is 43% higher than for White women.
    
            In the Black community, women have traditionally been taught to bear their burdens silently — keep your business to yourself — even after something as devastating as pregnancy loss. We are conditioned to do as I did back then, and keep it moving as we try to outrun the long list of statistics that tell us our lives are in danger from every direction, whether it be from health care risks to societal injustices or other stressors. 
    
            During my miscarriage, I was a woman who was afraid, hemorrhaging and in excruciating pain, in desperate need of safe, emergency medical care. Thanks to the administration of mifepristone, I was allowed dignity during my miscarriage. It’s what every woman deserves — whether it be facing a potentially life-threatening miscarriage or seeking an abortion.
    
            I learned from my experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access to whatever medicines and counseling we need to help us heal and that includes mifepristone. What we don’t need is to be criminalized by politicians and punitive reproductive laws that have long been out of step with public opinion. Despite the continuing political attacks on women’s reproductive rights, more than 61% of US adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research Center. 
    
            After the US Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued a temporary order to preserve the status quo, ensuring access to the drug while giving the justices more time to study the issue.
    
            I am hoping the justices can put politics aside and focus on the science surrounding the safety of mifepristone, a drug that, thankfully, I had access to when my life was in danger. Mifepristone, a synthetic steroid, is even safer than common prescription drugs including penicillin and Viagra.
    
            Following the science demands that, regardless of where you stand on the issue of abortion, consideration must be made for cases like mine and the millions of other women who for years have safely used this medication for complications surrounding miscarriages. 
    
            We do not know how the legal fight over medication abortion will unfold. But women across the nation – in blue and red states alike  – are watching. Punitive laws like the one signed last week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seek to criminalize reproductive care providers. And worse, they are stripping us of rights that men take for granted – it’s unlikely they will be prohibited by the law from making health care decisions about their own bodies. 
    
            It must end. And I’m betting that whether it be with our voice or our votes, women will have the last word.

      A Detroit grandmother is left to raise 12 children after daughter dies during childbirth

            Patricia Pouncey feels numb whenever she thinks about her daughter Nikita Washington’s tragic death last December. 
    
            Washington, a Black mother from Detroit, died at Harper University Hospital one day after giving birth via cesarean section to her 12th child, a boy named Nathaniel. 
    
            Pouncey, who is now raising Nathaniel and her daughter’s 11 other children, says the pain of her loss has been made worse by confusion about what led to her death. 
    
            “I just have a lot of questions right now,” Pouncey said. “I ask myself all the time, ‘What went wrong?’”
    
            Pouncey says her daughter went to the hospital alone to give birth because her husband is incarcerated, and she had to stay home caring for her other grandchildren.
    
            Pouncey now regrets not accompanying her daughter to the hospital, she says.
    
            Washington was treated for high blood pressure at the hospital, she told her family, and went in for a cesarean section the night of December 22. After several hours went by with no news, Washington’s sister went to the hospital to check on her, Pouncey said.
    
            The following morning, the family learned that the baby was born healthy. However, while doctors were treating Washington for a loose stitch and excessive bleeding, she passed away, Pouncey said. 
    
            A death certificate from the Wayne County Clerk reviewed by CNN indicates that Washington, 35, died from “postpartum hemorrhage” and “complications from multiple cesarean sections.” 
    
            But Pouncey says she wonders if the doctors did everything to save her daughter.
    
            “I haven’t talked to anyone from the hospital. I have not received anything from them. All I have is the death certificate,” Pouncey said.
    
            A spokesman for Detroit Medical Center, which operates Harper University Hospital, released a statement to CNN saying it could not comment on Washington’s death. 
    
            “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family for the loss of their loved one,” the statement said. “We cannot discuss specifics regarding the treatment of any individual due to patient privacy laws.”
    
            The nation’s maternal death rate rose significantly in 2021, with Black women dying at a rate 2.6 times higher than White women, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
    
            As part of Black Maternal Health Week (April 11-17), events are being held across the nation to raise awareness of this issue, including a five-city tour sponsored by Irth, a social change app that provides reviews from Black and brown women of doctors and hospitals that offer prenatal, birthing, postpartum and pediatric care. Also this week, Baby Dove launched a new Black Doula Directory to connect expecting moms with Black doulas. Doulas are trained professionals who provide an extra layer of support and advocacy for women during pregnancy. 
    
            Pouncey is urging family members of pregnant, and birthing women to help advocate for their loved ones, ask questions, and demand that doctors and nurses break down medical terminology.
    
            “I’m worried about every mother,” Pouncey says. “Don’t ever, ever make the mistake that I made, letting your child go (to the hospital) alone. We need to give more attention to what’s going on.” 
    
            Pouncey is leaning on her faith to move forward and raise Washington’s children, ages three months to 19, she said. And she’s thankful for the donations that helped the family buy a bigger home and a reliable vehicle.
    
            She wants her daughter to be remembered as a sweet, giving person who enjoyed doing hair, music, and being with family. 
    
            “God’s got us,” Pouncey said.

      Colorado governor signs bills further enshrining rights to abortion and gender-affirming care

    ","
            Democratic Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado signed a trio of bills Friday that further protect the rights to abortion and gender-affirming services in the state, as access to the so-called abortion pill across the country remains in limbo and some neighboring conservative states have moved to restrict such procedures.
    
            Polis’ signature comes a year after he signed a measure to codify the right to abortion into Colorado law, months before the US Supreme Court eliminated federal protections for abortion rights by overturning Roe v. Wade. At the same time, conservative neighboring states Oklahoma and Wyoming have passed strict abortion bans, while in Utah, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill earlier this year banning hormone treatment and surgical procedures for minors seeking gender-affirming care.
    
            One of the bills Polis signed, SB23-188, sets Colorado up to be a haven for people from states with more restrictive laws who are seeking access to abortion and gender-affirming treatment. 
    
            The new law bars Colorado courts or judicial officers from issuing subpoenas in connection with a proceeding in another state that involves a person who receives or “performs, assists, or aids” an abortion or gender-affirming treatment in Colorado, both of which are legally protected in the state. 
    
            Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, Colorado’s blue neighbor to the south, also signed legislation last month that prohibits local municipalities and other public bodies from interfering with a person’s ability to access reproductive or gender-affirming health care services in the state. 
    
            “I’m proud to sign these pro-freedom laws to further uphold Colorado’s value of protecting access to reproductive health care,” Polis told CNN in a statement. “[Here] in Colorado, we value individual freedoms and we stand up to protect them.”
    
            Another bill Polis signed into law directs large employers to provide coverage for the total cost of abortion care starting next year. 
    
            The third law will make it a “deceptive trade practice” for an entity to advertise that it “provides abortions, emergency contraceptives, or referrals for abortions or emergency contraceptives” when it does not, according to a bill summary. A health care provider would also be subject to disciplinary measures if it “provides, prescribes, administers, or attempts medication abortion reversal” in violation of any related rules by state authorities.
    
            The three bills passed the state’s Democratic-controlled state legislature earlier this month.
    
            Republicans have criticized the new laws, with state House Minority Leader Mike Lynch saying they deny a woman the right to choose “alternative options other than to end her pregnancy.”
    
            As Polis signed the bills into law Friday, the fate of access to the abortion drug mifepristone continued to play out in the courts after a US district judge in Texas said last week that he would suspend the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion pill. 
    
            US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday extended a hold on that lower-court ruling in an effort to give justices more time to consider the issue.
    
            Parts of the Texas ruling had been set to go into effect Saturday at 1 a.m. ET, but Alito’s hold puts off that deadline in the fast-moving dispute until 11:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday.
    
            The case centers on the scope of the FDA’s authority to regulate a drug that is used in the majority of abortions today in states that still allow the procedure.

      Justice Samuel Alito temporarily extends access to abortion drug while Supreme Court considers case

    ","
            Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday extended a hold on a lower court ruling that would have imposed restrictions on access to an abortion drug, a temporary move meant to give the justices more time to consider the issue.
    
            Alito said the order is stayed until 11:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday. He also asked plaintiffs to respond on or before noon ET Tuesday. 
    
            The case is the most important abortion-related dispute to reach the high court since the justices overturned Roe v. Wade last term. It centers on the scope of the US Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate a drug that is used in the majority of abortions today in states that still allow the procedure.
    
            Alito issued a so-called administrative stay on the ruling while the high court considers an emergency appeal filed by the Biden administration and a manufacturer of the drug, mifepristone. The move does not reflect the final disposition of the case.
    
            Parts of the ruling by US District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that restricted access to the drug were set to go into effect Saturday at 1 a.m. ET,  but the latest development puts off that deadline in the fast-moving dispute.
    
            Alito issued the order because he has jurisdiction over the federal appeals court involved in the case.
    
            Hours after the temporary freeze was ordered, a significant number of “friend of the court briefs” flowed into the high court. 
    
            These included briefs from Democratic-led states, 253 members of Congress, pharmaceutical companies, food and drug scholars, former FDA officials, and over 200 reproductive health organizations.
    
            “The perils of this unwarranted judicial intervention into science-based determinations can hardly be overstated,” the members of Congress wrote. 
    
            Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said in the filing from Biden’s Justice Department earlier Friday that it “concerns unprecedented lower court orders countermanding FDA’s scientific judgment and unleashing regulatory chaos by suspending the existing FDA-approved conditions of use for mifepristone.”
    
            She said that if the ruling were allowed to stand it would “inflict grave harm on women, the medical system, the agency, and the public.”
    
            President Joe Biden echoed those remarks early Saturday morning upon returning from his trip to Ireland. 
    
            “I think it’s outrageous what the court has done, relative to concluding that they’re going to overrule the FDA on whether something is safe or not,” he said. “I think it’s out of their domain.”
    
            Danco, a manufacturer of the drug, also asked the justices to step in on an emergency basis before Friday, with an attorney for the company saying in its filing that leaving the lower court opinion in play will “irreparably harm Danco, which will be unable to both conduct its business nationwide and comply with its legal obligations under the FDCA nationwide.”
    
            “The lack of emergency relief from this Court will also harm women, the healthcare system, the pharmaceutical industry, States’ sovereignty interests, and the separation-of-powers,” the attonrey, Jessica L. Ellsworth, told the justices.  
    
            The controversy began when Kacsmaryk issued a broad ruling last week that blocked the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug, as well as changes the FDA made in subsequent years to make the drug more accessible.
    
            Late Wednesday, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals froze part of the ruling. The court said the drug, that was approved in 2000, could stay on the market, but agreed with Kacsmaryk that access could be limited.
    
            The appeals court ordered a return to the stricter, pre-2016 FDA regime around the drug, which prevents mailing the pill to patients who obtained it through telehealth, or virtual visits with their providers rather than traveling to a clinic or hospital to obtain the drug in person.
    
            The restrictions also affect the instructions on the label for the medication, shortening the window of obtaining the pill to seven weeks into pregnancy as opposed to 10. It’s possible however that even with the ruling in effect, some providers could go “off-label” and continue to prescribe mifepristone up until 10 weeks. Mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication as opposed to surgery.
    
            Prelogar, the solicitor general, argued in her filing to the Supreme Court that the FDA’s expert judgment should not be challenged.
    
            “FDA has maintained that scientific judgment across five presidential administrations, and it has modified the original conditions of mifepristone’s approval as decades of experience have conclusively demonstrated the drug’s safety,” she wrote, reminding the justices that currently, “more than half of women in this country who choose to terminate their pregnancies rely on mifrepristone to do so.”
    
            She highlighted a key threshold issue in the case, arguing that the doctors opposed to abortion who are behind the suit do not have the legal right to be in court. That is because, she said, they neither “take nor prescribe” the drug, and the FDA’s approval “does not require them to do or refrain from doing anything.”
    
            CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck, who is a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the 5th Circuit’s ruling “froze the craziest, most harmful parts of Kacsmaryk’s ruling,” but that access to mifepristone is still significantly limited.
    
            “The panel ruled that the challenge to the 2000 approval of mifepristone itself is likely time-barred, so it froze that part of the ruling,” he wrote on Twitter. “But it *didn’t* freeze Kacsmaryk’s block of the 2016 and 2021 revisions that (1) make mifepristone available up to 10 weeks; and (2) by mail.”
    
            Medication abortion has emerged a particularly heated flashpoint in the abortion legal battle since the Supreme Court last year overturned the Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights nationally.
    
            In November, anti-abortion doctors and plaintiffs brought the lawsuit challenging the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug and targeting how the agency has since changed the rules around its use in ways that have made the pill easier to obtain.
    
            A split 5th Circuit panel said in its order that it was reinstating the approval of the drug because of certain procedural obstacles the plaintiffs face in challenging it. But the appeals court said that the abortion pill’s defenders had not shown that they were likely to succeed in defeating the plaintiffs’ claims against the FDA’s more recent regulatory actions toward mifepristone.
    
            The appellate order was handed down by Circuit Judges Catharina Haynes, a George W. Bush nominee, and Kurt Engelhardt and Andrew Oldham, both Donald Trump nominees. Haynes, however, did not sign on to some aspects of the order.
    
            The FDA approved mifepristone after a four-year review process. It has shown to be a safe and effective way to terminate a pregnancy in the two-plus decades it’s been on the market. But anti-abortion doctors and medical associations allege that the agency ran afoul of the law by not adequately taking into account the drug’s supposed risks.

      Ohio governor delays 3 more executions amid inability to obtain lethal injection drugs

    ","
            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Friday delayed the executions of three death row inmates amid continued struggles to find pharmaceutical suppliers for the state’s lethal injection method.
    
            DeWine’s office said in a statement he was “issuing the reprieves due to ongoing problems involving the willingness of pharmaceutical suppliers to provide drugs to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (DRC), pursuant to DRC protocol, without endangering other Ohioans.”
    
            The state’s last execution was in 2018.
    
            In 2019, when he postponed a killer’s execution, DeWine’s office said prison officials couldn’t find a drug manufacturer for the method, after a judge ruled the previous protocol was cruel and unusual punishment.
    
            Pharmaceutical companies told the state it would stop selling their drugs to Ohio altogether if they suspected any of their products were being used in executions, DeWine’s office said then.
    
            Refusing other drugs was a danger to Ohio residents, DeWine said.
    
            Friday’s action postponed the executions of three killers from August, September and October of this year to separate dates in 2026.
    
            DeWine, a Republican, has issued similar delays for other inmates in previous years since the judge’s order. He put an “unofficial moratorium” on capital punishment in 2020 over the lack of drugs, affiliate WXIX reported. He said lawmakers should find another method of execution.
    
            “The bottom line: Ohio’s death penalty is a farce and a broken promise of justice – and it must be fixed,” Republican Attorney General Dave Yost said after a bipartisan group of legislators introduced a bill to ban it last month.
    
            The use and imposition of the death penalty in America saw a continued decline in 2022 as polls showed public support for capital punishment stayed near historic lows, according to a year-end report by the Death Penalty Information Center.

      The Parkland school shooter got a life sentence. Now Florida is poised to require fewer jurors to agree on death penalty than any other state

            Tony Montalto sat in a Florida courtroom and watched in disbelief as his 14-year-old daughter’s killer received a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole after a jury was unable to reach unanimous agreement that her murderer should be put to death. 
    
            “It was the third worst thing that’s ever happened to me,” Montalto said of the decision six months ago. The first was learning his daughter Gina was among the 17 people killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, he said. The second was seeing her body. 
    
            “Quite frankly, for me personally, it put me right back to the beginning, to see the justice system fail,” he told CNN, characterizing the shooter’s sentence as the latest in a cascade of failures by the school system and law enforcement, who did not prevent the shooting despite numerous red flags, leaving Gina unprotected. 
    
            “Then our hope for justice through our legal system failed. It failed to punish a cold, cruel, heinous and atrocious murderer to the fullest extent of the law.”
    
            Montalto hopes no family will endure the same disappointment, as Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign into law legislation changing the requirement a Florida jury be unanimous to recommend a death sentence, reducing the number of jurors needed from 12 to 8 – the lowest threshold of any state still practicing capital punishment. 
    
            The effort found broad support among Florida lawmakers, with the legislation’s sponsors framing it as an attempt to curtail the influence of “activist jurors” who, critics say, lie about their openness to considering the death penalty when questioned during jury selection. The bill leaves in place requirements a jury be unanimous to find guilt, and Florida judges will still be allowed to overrule a death recommendation and impose a life sentence instead. 
    
            But some are opposed, fearing the new law is a constitutionally questionable reaction to a single case that could lead to more death sentences.  
    
            “While the Parkland tragedy is unimaginable, we really cannot and should not be making important legislative decisions based on one case,” Maria DeLiberato, executive director of Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, told CNN. 
    
            For Montalto, however, whose “wonderful, bright and bubbly daughter” – a straight-A student and Girl Scout involved in her church’s youth group – was brutally murdered, the new law is not about sending more people to death row. It’s about ensuring fairness to victims in a process that already affords protections to convicted killers. 
    
            “We cannot just look at the perpetrators and the effects of this law on them,” said Montalto, who said he testified in support of the bills before state House and Senate committees. “We have to look at the victims and the effect of this law on their prospects for justice.” 
    
            “If the system could stop for Gina, the system could not work properly for this killer, then surely the system had to change,” he said, stressing he spoke only for himself and not on behalf of other Parkland families. “We know it’s not going to affect the Parkland shooter; it’s not going to affect my family. But future families – why should they suffer like we have?”   
    
            Nearly all 27 states that have the death penalty require a unanimous jury to recommend or sentence a capital defendant to death. The sole exception, currently, is Alabama, where a judge can impose a death sentence if 10 of 12 jurors recommend it.  
    
            Florida has, in the past, required as few as seven jurors to recommend a death penalty, but that changed in recent years due to a series of court rulings. Still, Florida’s capital sentencing process remains a complicated one, requiring multiple unanimous findings. 
    
            After the Parkland shooter pleaded guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder, the trial moved to a separate penalty phase, where the court examined the crime and the defendant’s history to decide whether death was an appropriate sentence.  
    
            Prosecutors argued there were aggravating factors, saying the shooting was especially heinous and cruel, and premeditated, detailing the gunman’s thorough planning and comments he made sharing his desire to commit a mass killing. The killer’s public defenders, meanwhile, presented 41 possible mitigating circumstances – reasons his life should be spared. Among them were claims he was exposed to alcohol and drugs in utero and had a neurodevelopmental disorder and intellectual deficits.  
    
            The jurors unanimously agreed with prosecutors on the aggravators, the first step necessary for a death sentence, making the defendant eligible for death. But they were unable to unanimously agree that the aggravators outweighed the mitigating circumstances.  
    
            One juror was a “hard ‘no’” due to the killer’s history of mental illness, the jury foreman told CNN affiliate WFOR. Two others voted the same way, resulting in a 9-3 vote for death. That meant life without parole, a sentence the judge was bound by law to impose.
    
            The victims’ families – many of whom supported a death sentence – were stunned, disappointed and angry. Some wondered aloud who the death penalty was for if not the Parkland shooter. 
    
            Montalto has struggled to understand the jury’s conclusion, which followed days of heart-wrenching victim impact statements and a jury walkthrough of the high school building where the shooting occurred, preserved as it was the day of the shooting.  
    
            In his eyes, the trial was unfair to the victims. The families had to remain composed to ensure fairness to the shooter, and he said they were allowed to show just one photograph of their loved one during victim impact statements, while the jury saw numerous of the killer over the years. And the families’ statements – their chances to illustrate the magnitude of their loss and the lasting impact of the killer’s actions – were “minimized,” he said, when the jury was told not to consider them during deliberations as aggravating factors. 
    
            “He had a tough life,” Montalto said of the shooter. “Does one individual’s tough life justify the taking of another, let alone 17?”  
    
            DeSantis, who has touted Florida as a “law and order” state, expressed his own disappointment after the sentence. He raised the issue again in January, when he offered a preview of coming legislation to the Florida Sheriff’s Association Winter Conference, saying the sentence did not represent the “sense of the community.”  
    
            “I do think there are people who get on these juries who never intend to administer capital punishment,” he said. “Bottom line is that can probably be changed by statute. I mean, obviously a majority of the jury has to (recommend the death penalty), maybe a super majority … Maybe 8 out of 12 have to agree, or something. But we can’t be in a situation where one person can just derail this.” 
    
            The legislation does just that, though it leaves in place the unanimity requirements for guilt and aggravating factors, something supporters point to as safeguards against wrongful death sentences. It also requires a judge explain if they choose to override a jury’s recommendation of death to impose a life sentence, which remains a potential backstop.
    
            The sentence received by the Parkland shooter loomed over debate surrounding the proposed new law. 
    
            “What happened in Parkland was abhorrent,” state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, the lead sponsor of SB 450, said moments before it passed the Florida Senate. “What happened in Parkland was a tragedy that will forever stain this state. We all grieve for the families of Parkland and that community. But what that verdict did do was expose a flaw in the current system.” 
    
            “If a monster like that, who commits heinous crimes like that, does not deserve and get the death penalty,” he asked, “then what do we have a death penalty for?” 
    
            Support for the new law, however, is far from unanimous, with critics like DeLiberato of FADP – a group which is opposed to capital punishment generally – fearing it will lead to more death sentences and raise the chances of an innocent person being executed.
    
            “I definitely don’t think we need a death penalty. However, if Florida is going to have a death penalty … then it should be reliable and accurate, as reliable and accurate as a human criminal justice system can be,” she told CNN. “This return to non-unanimity is just devastating in terms of reliability.”
    
            DeLiberato agrees the system is flawed for myriad reasons, but removing the unanimity requirement will make it worse, not better: Florida already leads the country in the number of people exonerated from a state’s death row, with 30 exonerations, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. At least 29 were the result of non-unanimous juries.  
    
            DeLiberato, herself a capital defense attorney, also fears the new law will lead to more people on death row, making it easier for juries to recommend a death sentence and making prosecutors feel more compelled to seek one for victims’ families, knowing the required threshold is lower. 
    
            Jury unanimity is a “fundamental right,” she said, pointing to Ramos v. Louisiana, in which the US Supreme Court ruled unanimous verdicts are required to convict someone of a serious offense. 
    
            “Yet to execute you … it can be now 8-4? That’s just unheard of,” she said. “No other state in the country has ever done that other than Florida.”
    
            The Sunshine State once required just a simple majority, or 7-5, vote for a death sentence. But the Supreme Court ruled the state’s sentencing process unconstitutional in 2016, because a judge was allowed to overrule a life recommendation and impose death.  
    
            That was followed by a Florida Supreme Court ruling that found the jury must be unanimous to impose death, and Florida lawmakers adopted the unanimity requirement soon after. But the Florida Supreme Court reversed that ruling in 2020, and while acknowledging the legislature had already changed the law, the ruling gave the legislature discretion to revise the statute.  
    
            Still, DeLiberato believes the new law is at risk of being found unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court, even if the Florida courts say it’s OK. But she doesn’t believe someone would “sneak on a jury” to spend several months listening to “horrific testimony,” only to vote against death.
    
            She acknowledged the pain of Parkland’s families, saying she could not fault anyone for seeking justice for their loved one. But she dismissed the idea justice requires the highest possible penalty.  
    
            “Let’s be clear, life without the possibility of parole is a severe punishment,” she said. “You are condemned to die in a Florida prison.”
    
            Asked about criticism of the legislation, Montalto emphasized the goal is not securing more death sentences. Trials need to be fair, he said, and he does not feel every convicted murderer deserves to be put to death.  
    
            “This bill is a victim’s rights bill. We want to believe in our justice system. Our justice system can’t be halted by one individual. We need consensus, collaboration, deliberation to take place, and that was halted by one individual in our case,” he said, referring to the juror who was a “hard ‘no.’” 
    
            Additionally, Montalto stressed there remain ample protections for capital defendants. That includes a unanimous finding of guilt and, in Florida, an automatic appeal to the Florida Supreme Court for someone sentenced to death.
    
            Even if the conviction and sentence is upheld, many capital cases are subject to years of appeals in both state and federal courts – often up to the US Supreme Court – before someone is executed.  
    
            “The convicted murderers have a lot of stuff in place to ensure the fairness of the trial to them,” he said, “but what is in place that assures the fairness to the victims?”  
    
            “You need fairness,” he said, “but the victims deserve the fairness, too.”  
    
            Opponents will use whatever avenues are available to challenge the law, if it’s changed, Montalto said. And while he feels the judicial system failed his family, he still believes in it.  
    
            “I can’t control that,” he said. “What I can control, though, is trying to make sure  that other victims’ families are provided the opportunity of justice.”

      DeSantis, on cusp of presidential campaign, defies national abortion sentiments with signing of six-week ban
    ","

        12:49 PM EDT, Fri April 14, 2023
    ","
            Floridians woke up Friday morning to discover Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed into law a six-week abortion ban overnight, meeting behind closed doors with a select group of invited guests to give final approval to a bill that had just passed the state legislature earlier in the day.
    
            In backing a six-week ban, DeSantis fulfilled a campaign pledge to block abortion after the detection of a heartbeat – just before he is expected to launch his 2024 presidential bid. But as he inches toward a national campaign, DeSantis, who rarely sidesteps cultural clashes, has also become oddly muted on abortion since the fall of Roe v. Wade and has avoided laying out a federal platform before jumping into the race.
    
            Speaking Friday morning to an overwhelmingly pro-life audience at Liberty University, a deeply conservative Baptist college in Virginia, DeSantis didn’t mention the bill he had signed the night before.
    
            The late-night private signing also stood in stark contrast to the celebratory event exactly a year prior, when DeSantis, surrounded by women and children and in front of hundreds of onlookers, enacted a 15-week abortion ban at a Orlando-area megachurch as news cameras captured the scene.  
    
            The six-week ban “is going to cause a lot of problems for him,” said Amy Tarkanian, the former chairwoman of the Republican Party in Nevada, where voters have cemented abortion protections in the state constitution. “And I’m pro-life, but I can see the writing on the wall.”
    
            The US Supreme Court decision last June that ended a federal right to abortion access has throttled the national political landscape, energizing Democrats and leaving Republicans grasping for a message that can blunt the fallout. The latest harbinger of trouble for the GOP came last week from Wisconsin, a presidential swing state where liberals took control of the state Supreme Court in an election fought over the future of abortion access.
    
            But with DeSantis on the verge of entering the GOP presidential primary – for which abortion is often a litmus test for candidates – Republican state lawmakers delivered their leader a political victory, flexing their super majorities in both Florida chambers to swiftly push through the new restrictions. The law will take effect if the state Supreme Court overturns its past precedent protecting abortion access, which is widely expected. When that happens, Florida, once a sanctuary for Southern women whose states had made it difficult to legally end a pregnancy, will become one of the hardest states in the country to obtain an abortion.
    
            In an early sign of how Democrats intend to paint DeSantis, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement called Florida’s bill “extreme and dangerous” and said it “is out of step with the views of the vast majority of the people of Florida and of all the United States.”
    
            A Republican fundraiser close to the governor’s political operation told CNN that the six-week ban would play “great in primary,” where DeSantis would face former President Donald Trump, who appointed three of the justices that voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, but acknowledged it was “not good in general” election.
    
            “But you got to get to the general,” the adviser added.
    
            In the year following the Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Democrats have rattled off a series of victories built in part on voters mobilized by abortion. In solidly red Kansas, voters last year blocked a referendum that would have amended the state constitution to make abortion illegal. In key states like Pennsylvania and Nevada, Democrats pummeled Republican Senate candidate over their views on abortion – with great success, as the party held the US Senate. In battlegrounds like Arizona and Michigan, Democratic gubernatorial candidates won by vowing to lift longstanding state abortion bans that predated the Roe decision.
    
            Whether the issue continues to animate general voters remains to be seen, but opinions on the Dobbs decision do not appear to have shifted. A Marquette Law School poll last month found two-thirds of voters opposed the ruling, nearly identical to the results in its survey following the November midterms.
    
            Amid the national outcry to the SCOTUS decision, the typically outspoken DeSantis has remained uncharacteristically reserved on the topic. Unlike other issues, like eliminating college diversity programs and curbing legal protections for the media, he has elevated with staged news conferences and frequent messaging on conservative media, DeSantis has offered vague commitments to protect life but repeatedly declined to say where Florida should draw the line on abortion access.
    
            In his lone debate last year against Democratic gubernatorial opponent Charlie Crist, DeSantis wouldn’t say what abortion restrictions he would pursue if reelected for a second term. Asked at a March news conference if he supported exceptions for victims rape and incest, DeSantis called it “sensible” and said he would “welcome pro-life legislation,” then quickly pivoted to another topic.
    
            DeSantis signed the bill at 10:45 p.m. ET Thursday in a closed-door ceremony after returning from a political event in Ohio, a rare-late night action by a governor who often times his actions to maximize exposure.
    
            “I can’t speculate on his mental processes and what he decides to speak on,” said John Stemberger, president of Florida Family Policy Council, a conservative Christian organization that supported the bill. “I’m concerned not with words but with action and he is a man of action.”
    
            Some Republican operatives believe DeSantis is better positioned than others to stave off primary attacks from the right without alienating swing voters. In a series of posts on Twitter, Jon Schweppe, director of policy and government affairs at the conservative American Principles Project, suggested that by supporting some exceptions for rape and incest, DeSantis would neutralize a key Democratic talking point.
    
            “What moves voters the most? What did Democrats spend $500M talking about in the 2022 midterms? EXCEPTIONS,” Schweppe said. “Voters want exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. That’s the most important issue. Outside those exceptions, voters are fairly pro-life.”
    
            Schweppe had previously raised the alarm that “Republicans need to figure out the abortion issue ASAP” after last week’s defeat of a conservative judge in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.
    
            The exceptions offered by Florida’s proposed six-week ban, though, are limited to 15 weeks after conception and require victims of rape and incest to show a police report or other evidence of their assault to obtain an abortion. Similarly, two doctors would have to sign off that a mother’s health is at serious risk or a fetal abnormality is fatal before a woman can end a pregnancy after 15 weeks.
    
            Bill McCoshen, a veteran GOP consultant in Wisconsin, acknowledged that Democrats have campaigned effectively on abortion there in recent races. But he said it will be harder to attack DeSantis on abortion in his state, where the current law, passed in 1849 and reinstated after the fall of Roe, bars abortion without exceptions.
    
            “To voters here, the perception of his answer will be that it’s better than the 1849 law,” McCoshen said. “If he signs that law, that will be an improvement of the law that’s here. It may not be as middle of the road as some states, but it’s better than what we currently have in many people’s minds.”
    
            Still unclear, though, is how DeSantis will navigate new pressures from conservative voters, many of whom will expect their next nominee to use the powers of the presidency to end abortion nationwide. DeSantis, who has not yet declared but is laying the groundwork for a campaign, has so far not faced any questions about what abortion restrictions he would pursue if elected to the White House.
    
            It’s a question that has already tripped up one potential rival for the nomination. A day after sidestepping a question earlier this week, Republican Sen. Tim Scott said on Thursday that it should be up to states to “solve that problem on their own” – but also said he would sign a federal 20-week ban if it reached his desk.
    
            Nor has DeSantis weighed in on the ongoing legal saga surrounding mifepristone, one of the drugs that has been used safely for more than 20 years to provide abortions via medication.
    
            “Right now, DeSantis represents his state and he has to be the voice of his state, but this is a tightrope he has to walk if he’s serious about running for president,” Tarkanian, the Nevada Republican said. “A lot of people don’t even realize they’re pregnant at seven weeks and if you’re pro-choice that’s a scary thought.”
    
            Katie Daniel, the state policy director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said Republican candidates risk looking inauthentic if they try to obfuscate their position on abortion. She pointed to Pennsylvania Senate candidate and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who during the GOP primary called abortion “murder” at any stage but in the general election said he supported exceptions for rape, incest or if the mother’s life is at risk. Later, in a debate, Oz said, “I want women, doctors, local political leaders” to decide the issue at the state level.
    
            “Our message to candidates is define yourself or other candidates will define it for you and you’re not going to like their version of you,” Daniel said. “The ostrich strategy of burying your head in the sand is not going to work.”

      Mother of 6-year-old who shot teacher turns herself in on child neglect charge, her attorney says

            The mother of a 6-year-old student who shot his first-grade teacher in a classroom in Newport News, Virginia, earlier this year turned herself in Thursday on charges of child neglect and recklessly leaving a firearm so as to endanger a child, her attorney said.
    
            Deja Taylor surrendered to the Newport News Sheriff’s Office and was later released on $5,000 bond, attorney James Ellenson told CNN.
    
            The indictments against Taylor, 26, were announced Monday in a press release from the office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney.
    
            Ellenson said in a statement Tuesday his client has no criminal record, has cooperated since the shooting occurred and planned to turn herself in before the end of the week.
    
            “As always, first and foremost is the continued health and wellbeing of all persons involved in the incident at Richneck Elementary School, to include both the teacher and Deja’s son,” the statement said.
    
            The charges were handed down three months after the shooting at Richneck Elementary School in which the 6-year-old shot his teacher, 25-year-old Abigail Zwerner. She suffered gunshot wounds to her hand and chest but survived.
    
            The gun was purchased by Taylor and was kept on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, secured by a trigger lock, Ellenson told CNN in January. The child brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said.
    
            The child will not be criminally charged, Newport News Commonwealth’s Attorney Howard Gwynn said last month.
    
            The Commonwealth’s Attorney said the office has asked the Circuit Court to empanel a special grand jury to investigate “any security issues that may have contributed to the shooting.”
    
            Zwerner filed a lawsuit this month alleging school administrators and the school board were aware of the student’s “history of random violence” and did not act proactively amid concerns over a firearm in the boy’s possession the day of the shooting.
    
            In the lawsuit, which seeks $40 million in compensatory damages, an attorney for Zwerner alleges the 6-year-old was required to be accompanied by a parent during the school day “because of his violent tendencies.” But that day, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied without a one-on-one companion during the school day,” the complaint says.
    
            The suit also alleges the school’s then-assistant principal ignored concerns and warning signs flagged by several teachers and staff members, including that the 6-year-old may have had a firearm in his possession in the hours leading up to the January 6 shooting.
    
            A guidance counselor and administrator at the elementary school said assistant principal Ebony Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his “mother would be arriving soon to pick him up,” the complaint says.
    
            The boy has an “acute disability” and was under a care plan which required a parent to attend school with him, though he was unaccompanied on the day of the shooting, the family has said in a statement. “We will regret our absence on this day for the rest of our lives,” the statement read.
    
            The disturbing shooting drew harsh criticism from parents and led the school board to vote to oust superintendent George Parker III. Ebony Parker, the assistant principal, resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal, Briana Foster Newton, was reassigned to another school, though the district did not say where.
    
            CNN has requested comment from Ebony Parker about the lawsuit but has not heard back.
    
            Last month, Zwerner told NBC she can’t forget the look on the child’s face as he aimed the gun at her.
    
            “I remember him pointing the gun at me, I remember the look on his face,” Zwerner said. “I remember the gun going off.”
    
            She said her recovery has been “challenging.”
    
            “Some days are not-so-good days where I can’t get up out of bed,” she told NBC. “Some days are better than others where I’m able to get out of bed and make it to my appointments. But from going through what I’ve gone through, I try to stay positive.”

      Florida Gov. DeSantis signs 6-week abortion ban
    ","

    ","
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after six weeks, according to a release from the governor’s office late Thursday night.
    
            The six-week ban would not go into effect until the state Supreme Court overturns its previous precedent on abortion. 
    
            “We are proud to support life and family in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said in the release. 
    
            The law would make Florida one of the most restrictive states in the country to obtain an abortion and follows moves by other Republican-led states to swiftly curb the procedure since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. The measure passed the state Senate on April 3 and the Florida House on Thursday before heading to DeSantis’ desk for his signature.
    
            Under the law, most abortions in Florida would be banned after six weeks. Opponents of the legislation have argued that six weeks is before many women know that they are pregnant.
    
            “Let’s be clear about the silent part: You just don’t want women to have choice,” House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell, a Tampa Democrat, said Thursday during debate on the bill.
    
            Victims of rape, incest and human trafficking could obtain an abortion up to 15 weeks into a pregnancy, under the legislation, if the woman provides a restraining order, police report, medical record or other evidence.
    
            The bill would also ban doctors from prescribing an abortion via telehealth and require medication for abortion be dispensed by a physician, not by mail.
    
            Supporters of the bill said they were protecting life.
    
            “A woman’s right to choose, I’ve heard people talk about that. Well, that right to choose begins before you have sex,” state Rep. Kiyan Michael, a Jacksonville Republican, said Thursday. “It should not be after you have sex. “
    
            Debate on Thursday began shortly after 9 a.m. and lasted for more than seven hours as Democrats, who are firmly in the minority in Florida’s legislature, filed dozens of amendments intended to blunt the bill’s impact and to protest the likely end of tens of thousands of legal abortions in the state each year. Each amendment failed, and Republicans flexed their supermajority to pass the bill on a 70-40 vote.
    
            Following the bill’s passage by the state Senate last week, demonstrations broke out at the state Capitol in Tallahassee, leading to the arrest of Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Nikki Fried and Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book.
    
            Thursday’s vote comes as the national debate on abortion has once again intensified after a Texas judge ordered the suspension of the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a medication abortion drug. A federal appeals court has frozen parts of the order, and the Department of Justice is asking the US Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute. The Florida vote also follows a decisive victory by a liberal candidate in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race earlier this month in which the future of abortion access took center stage and mobilized Democratic turnout. 
    
            Though DeSantis has signaled his support for further restrictions on abortion in Florida, the typically outspoken governor has remained uncharacteristically reserved about where he thinks lawmakers should draw the line. Asked at a March news conference if he supported exemptions for rape and incest until 15 weeks, DeSantis called it “sensible” and said he would “welcome pro-life legislation,” but quickly pivoted to another topic.
    
            As a candidate for governor in 2018, DeSantis indicated he would support legislation that prohibits abortion after a heartbeat is detected.
    
            DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban into law last year, which did not include exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. Under the law, a pregnancy cannot be terminated after 15 weeks unless the mother is at serious risk or a fatal fetal abnormality is detected. Two physicians must confirm the diagnosis in writing. 
    
            Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups sued to overturn the law. The case is currently before the Florida Supreme Court, which declined to block the law in the meantime. 
    
            For decades, courts in Florida have blocked legislative attempts to restrict abortion in the state. The state Supreme Court in 1989 determined that a privacy clause in the state constitution “is clearly implicated in a woman’s decision of whether or not to continue her pregnancy.”
    
            Those protections for years made Florida a sanctuary for women seeking abortions throughout the South as neighboring states over time moved to restrict the procedure. In 2020, Florida saw 19.1 legal abortions per 1,000 women, the highest rate of any state in the country. 
    
            However, the makeup of the Florida Supreme Court has shifted considerably in recent years, and it is now heavily shaped by DeSantis’ conservative influence. He appointed four of the six sitting justices and will name a fifth to succeed Justice Ricky Polston, who resigned last month.
    
            The state does not publish data on the number of pregnancies terminated during the first six weeks. There were more than 82,000 abortions in Florida in 2022, according to the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, and the overwhelming majority took place during the first trimester.

      DOJ will take emergency dispute over medication abortion rules to the Supreme Court

    ","
            The Justice Department will take an emergency dispute over medication abortion drugs to the Supreme Court, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday.
    
            Garland’s announcement comes after a federal appeals court overnight froze parts of a Texas judge’s order that would have suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a medication abortion drug. But the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals only partially granted the request by the Justice Department and the drug’s manufacturer to put US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s ruling on hold, with the appellate panel effectively making the drug harder to obtain by leaving in place aspects of Kacsmaryk’s ruling that will reverse moves by the FDA that expanded access to medication abortion pills.
    
            In the new statement, Garland indicated that the Justice Department will ask the Supreme Court to intervene now in the emergency dispute over how the FDA has approached the drug, mifepristone.
    
            “The Justice Department strongly disagrees with the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA to deny in part our request for a stay pending appeal,” Garland said, referring to an appellate ruling that left parts of the judge’s ruling in place while reinstating the FDA’s approval for the drug, mifepristone.  
    
            He added, “We will be seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to defend the FDA’s scientific judgment and protect Americans’ access to safe and effective reproductive care.”
    
            Danco Laboratories, a mifepristone manufacturer that intervened in the case to defend the drug’s approval, also plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, a lawyer involved told CNN. 
    
            The appeals court ordered a return to the stricter, pre-2016 FDA regime around the drug, which prevents mailing the pill to patients who obtained it through telehealth, or virtual visits with their providers rather than traveling to a clinic or hospital in person to obtain the drug.
    
            The restrictions also affect the instructions on the label for the medication, shortening the window of obtaining the pill to seven weeks into pregnancy as opposed to 10. It’s possible however that even with the ruling in effect, some providers could go “off label” and continue to prescribe mifepristone up until 10 weeks. Mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication as opposed to surgery. 
    
            CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck, who is a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the ruling “froze the craziest, most harmful parts of Kacsmaryk’s ruling,” but that access to mifepristone is still significantly limited. 
    
            “The panel ruled that the challenge to the 2000 approval of mifepristone itself is likely time-barred, so it froze that part of the ruling,” he wrote on Twitter. “But it *didn’t* freeze Kacsmaryk’s block of the 2016 and 2021 revisions that (1) make mifepristone available up to 10 weeks; and (2) by mail.”
    
            Medication abortion, which makes up the majority of abortions obtained in the United States, has emerged a particularly heated flashpoint in the abortion legal battle since the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights nationally. 
    
            Last Friday, Kacsmaryk issued a ruling that would have halted the FDA’s 23-year-old approval of the drug, mifepristone. Under the appeals court’s new order, the approval will stay in effect and the drug will remain on the market while an expedited appeal plays out.
    
            However, the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is leaving in place parts of the ruling that halted changes the FDA made to the rules around the drug that expanded access to medication abortion pills. Those changes include the FDA’s end of the requirement that mifepristone be picked up in person, the agency’s approval of a generic version of the drug, and adjustments the FDA made to the label instructions for the drug’s use.
    
            When issuing his ruling last week, Kacsmaryk delayed it taking effect by seven days to give the government time to appeal. 
    
            In November, anti-abortion doctors and plaintiffs brought the lawsuit challenging the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug and targeting how the agency has since changed the rules around its use in ways that have made the pill easier to obtain. 
    
            A split 5th Circuit panel said in its new order that it was reinstating the approval of the drug because of certain procedural obstacles the plaintiffs face in challenging it. But the appeals court said that the abortion pill’s defenders had not shown that they were likely to succeed in defeating the plaintiffs’ claims against the FDA’s more recent regulatory actions toward mifepristone. 
    
            The appellate order was handed down by Circuit Judges Catharina Haynes, a George W. Bush nominee, and Kurt Engelhardt and Andrew Oldham, both Donald Trump nominees. Haynes, however, did not sign on to some aspects of the order.
    
            The judge said she would have granted the expedited appeal but would have issued an administrative stay on Kacmsaryk’s ruling – a temporary hold that would have lasted a “brief period of time” – and deferred the question of whether it should be frozen longer term to the judges hearing the expedited appeal. 
    
            That panel will be a different make-up from the panel that considered the DOJ and Danco’s request that the ruling be paused in the interim.
    
            Much of the 5th Circuit’s 42-page order was devoted to analyzing whether the plaintiffs face procedural issues in bringing their case. The appeals court was sympathetic to a large swath of the plaintiffs’ allegations about the drug’s safety, which have been rebuked by leading medical associations. 
    
            The 5th Circuit said the current FDA rules around the drug made for “an exceedingly unusual regime” because the agency “chose to cut out doctors from the prescription and administration of mifepristone.” 
    
            “In fact, as far as the record before us reveals, FDA has not structured the distribution of any comparable drug in this way,” the panel said. 
    
            The FDA approved mifepristone after a four-year review process. It has shown to be a safe and effective way to terminate a pregnancy in the two-plus decades it’s been on the market. But anti-abortion doctors and medical associations allege that the agency ran afoul of the law by not adequately taking into account the drug’s supposed risks. 
    
            Meanwhile, a federal judge in Washington state made clear on Thursday that the FDA must comply with his previous order barring the agency from taking any steps to reduce the abortion drug’s availability in 17 states and the District of Columbia.
    
            Judge Thomas O. Rice’s order from last week applied to the 18 Democrat-led jurisdictions that brought a separate lawsuit seeking to expand access to mifepristone. But it seemed to conflict with Kacsmaryk’s order that would have suspended the drug’s FDA approval nationwide.
    
            The Biden administration on Monday asked the Washington judge to clarify how to comply with his ruling and the one out of Texas. Then the 5th Circuit partially blocked Kacsmaryk’s ruling in the Texas case, which is now headed to the Supreme Court.
    
            In his response on Thursday, Rice doubled down, citing the 5th Circuit’s order and telling the government that because his court “has jurisdiction over the parties before it and limited its preliminary injunction only to the Plaintiff States and the District of Columbia, this Court’s preliminary injunction was effective as of April 7, 2023 and must be followed by Defendants.”

      Medication abortion drug may be harder to get after court ruling, but it won’t be impossible
    ","

    ","
            Mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortion, faces tighter restrictions than it has in years after a federal appeals court ordered a return to the rules that were put in place when the drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2000. 
    
            In the decades since, research and clinical evidence has led to expanded options for the medication’s administration. The FDA has approved changes that extended its use from up to seven weeks gestation to 10 weeks, as well as allowing virtual dispensing and administration. 
    
            A reversal of these guidelines creates a complicated medical and legal landscape for medication abortion in the United States, and health care experts are uncertain about how things will play out. 
    
            Although the court ruling may make mifepristone harder to get, however, it is still legal to use in the US. 
    
            A recent poll from KFF found widespread confusion around medication abortion more than six months after the US Supreme Court issued the Dobbs decision, overturning Roe v. Wade and revoking the federal right to abortion. Nearly half of adults – including 2 out of 5 women of childbearing age – were unsure whether medication abortion was legal in their state.
    
            “We are now in a post-Dobbs world. So it’s not only figuring out how to manage an FDA-approved medication, it’s figuring out how to manage an FDA-approved medication in a dramatically fractured national landscape of state laws around abortion,” said Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project.
    
            “The intention is to create as much chaos and confusion in the system,” she said. “That’s going to lead to cruelty, because people will be turned away from care or think that they can’t get care.” 
    
            For now, one option for providers is to prescribe the drug “off-label,” which is legal and common practice. Even if the drug label on mifepristone is changed to reflect the regulations from the original FDA approval, with a maximum gestational age of 49 days, physicians can still prescribe it for later-term abortions. 
    
            One out of every 5 prescriptions that are written for any drug are for off-label use, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. 
    
            However, some parts of the mifepristone label are subject to a set of additional regulations from the FDA, known as a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. 
    
            “Think of it as an extra layer of safety checks for riskier medications that potentially could have side effects or issues,” said Dr. Jennifer Lincoln, an ob/gyn and executive director of Mayday Health, a nonprofit focused on education around reproductive health. “That sounds fine and good when it’s a really concerning medication, but it makes no sense for mifepristone, which we know is a remarkably safe drug.”
    
            Bucking REMS requirements could have more severe consequences for providers. For mifepristone, some of the regulations that would fall under this category are the need for in-person dispensing and follow-ups. These restrictions could pose potentially significant barriers to telehealth, which has become an increasingly sought-after option. 
    
            “This is absolutely a health equity issue, and it will harm those who’ve already had difficult access,” Lincoln said. Telehealth has helped provide options for people seeking abortions in states where it is banned, as well as for those who don’t have the means to travel for an abortion. 
    
            Still, questions – and possible paths forward – remain. 
    
            Melissa Grant, chief operating officer for Carafem, a national provider of reproductive health services including a virtual abortion clinic, is confident that they will continue to find ways to provide care. 
    
            Shield laws in some states could offer workarounds, she said. Abortion laws have become more fractured since the Dobbs decision, and this may be an additional step down that path.
    
            The new court ruling is also an unprecedented challenge to the FDA’s authority. A response from the federal agency could greatly affect what happens next. 
    
            The FDA had no comment on the issue Thursday. 
    
            Medical professionals emphasize the science behind the safe and effective use of mifepristone. 
    
            “Judges and lawmakers should not be substituting their own opinion for the experience, expertise, and authority of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nor should they ignore the substantial weight of scientific evidence from hundreds of studies and millions of patients confirming the safety and effectiveness of mifepristone, which has been used for decades in both medication abortion and miscarriage management,” Dr. Jack Resneck Jr., president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement. 
    
            “The appellate court order, if allowed to stand, creates more barriers to care, harms patients and physicians, and exacerbates the maternal mortality crisis, especially for historically marginalized communities. It also opens a pandora’s box for similar politically motivated, unscientific attacks by judges with no medical or scientific training against the FDA’s scientific, evidence-based approvals of countless other medications.”

      How the appeals court ruling makes medication abortion access more complicated
    ","

    ","
            The federal appeals court ruling Wednesday night that is keeping medication abortion drugs available is likely to complicate abortion access across the country, even in places where the procedure is legal.
    
            Since the Supreme Court overturned of Roe v. Wade last year, abortion pills – and the US Food and Drug Administration’s rules that allowed patients to obtain them without an in-person visit to an abortion provider – have become a crucial tool for mitigating some of the burdens abortion clinics have felt after the Roe reversal sent them a flood of patients from states where abortion is now illegal. 
    
            Since the FDA approved mifepristone in 2000, it has tweaked the rules around how the pills are administered – in keeping with updated knowledge around the science and evidence around the drug. The appeals court is now ordering a return to the stricter, pre-2016 FDA regime around the drug.
    
            Only in very recent years have patients been able to obtain the pills without picking them up from a provider in person.  
    
            The requirement was first paused during the Covid-19 pandemic amid litigation during the end of the Trump administration – though the Supreme Court let the restriction go back into effect just before former President Donald Trump left office. The Biden administration then took its own steps to halt and later formally remove the in-person pick up requirement. 
    
            The access abortion seekers have had to medication abortion via telehealth – i.e. with virtual visits with their providers rather than traveling to a clinic or hospital in person to obtain the drug – came as telehealth became a more popular option for medical care generally during the pandemic. The ability to dispense the pills by mail has also relieved the pressure on brick-and-mortar clinics in Democratic-leaning states that have become overwhelmed with patients from Republican-led states where the procedure is banned or severely restricted. 
    
            According to one newly published study, 9% of all abortions obtained between July and December 2022 were telehealth abortions, the study’s author, University of California-San Francisco Professor Ushma Upadhyay, told CNN. 
    
            The ruling might also have an effect on the number of providers who are able to prescribe mifepristone. Because of the administrative and bureaucratic hassles of stocking mifepristone at hospitals and other facilities, some doctors were unable to dispense mifepristone when the in-person pickup requirement was previously in effect, according to court filings submitted in a separate case concerning the mandate. Removing the requirement is believed to have expanded the number of providers able to prescribe abortion pills. 
    
            The appeals court is also keeping in place parts of the judge’s ruling that will reverse the 2016 changes the FDA made to its instructions for prescribing mifepristone.  
    
            Those instructions include how late into the pregnancy mifepristone should be prescribed (from seven weeks to 10 weeks), the dosage amount and whether the patient must be physically with their provider when the drug is administered. 
    
            That aspect of the appeals court order is likely to have less of an effect on the drug’s use than the revival of the in-person dispensing requirement, which is a mandate related to a specific program – known as the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy – used to regulate mifepristone.  
    
            The 2016 changes were to mifepristone’s label. Providers typically have discretion to deviate from a drug’s label. For instance, mifepristone is commonly prescribed to manage miscarriages, but that is an off-label use of the drug.  
    
            However, a handful of states have laws forcing providers to prescribe the drug as stipulated on the FDA’s label.

      When children are told they were born via assisted reproduction can affect outcomes, study finds
    ","
			By Sandee LaMotte, CNN

    ","
            At age 14, Helen wasn’t bothered by the fact she was born via surrogacy.
    
            “My mum is still my mum. My dad is still my dad,” she told UK researchers conducting a study on the mental health and well-being of children born through egg donation, sperm donation and surrogacy. Helen is not her real name.
    
            “I was talking to someone at school and they said they were an accident,” 14-year-old Simon (also not his real name) told the researchers. “I know I was no accident, I was really wanted, and it makes me feel special.” 
    
            Parents worried their children may experience difficulties as a result of learning they were conceived by assisted reproduction can stop fretting — the kids are just fine, according to the study published this week after two decades in the making. 
    
            “When we began this study more than 20 years ago, there was concern the absence of a biological link between the child and the parents could have a damaging effect on their relationship and on the well-being of the child,” said lead author Susan Golombok, professor emerita of family research and former director of the Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge in the UK.
    
            However, at age 20, children born via egg or sperm donation and surrogacy were psychologically well-adjusted, the study found, especially if parents told the children about their birth history before age 7.
    
            “What this research means is that having children in different or new ways doesn’t actually interfere with how families function. Really wanting children seems to trump everything — that’s what really matters,” Golombok said. 
    
            Clinical psychologist Mary Riddle, an associate professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University called the study “important, in that it represents research conducted over a long period of time.”
    
            However, Riddle, who was not involved in the study, said the results aren’t completely applicable to the United States because surrogacy can be practiced differently in the UK in several ways.
    
            Called “tummy mummies” by some of the children, surrogates in the UK may become part of the family, participating in the upbringing of the child they helped bring into the world, according to Golombok’s 2020 book, “We Are Family: The Modern Transformation of Parents and Children.”
    
            “In the UK, intended parents often know their surrogate prior to the surrogate pregnancy whereas in the US, commercial surrogates are often matched through agencies and don’t have prior relationships with the families for whom they carry babies,” Riddle said.
    
            It’s also more common in the UK to use “partial” surrogacy, in which surrogates are impregnated with the sperm of the intended father and are therefore the biological mother of the child, Riddle said. 
    
            “Here in the US, gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother has no genetic connection to the child she is carrying, is far more common and thought to be potentially less fraught with psychological and legal pitfalls,” she added.
    
            The study, published Wednesday in the journal Developmental Psychology, followed 65 children — 22 born by surrogacy, 17 by egg donation and 26 by sperm donation — from infancy until age 20. Another 52 families who did not use any assistance were also followed. Researchers spoke to the families when the children were 1, 2, 3, 7, 10 and 14.
    
            Young adults who learned about their biological origins before age 7 reported better relationships with their mothers, and their mothers had lower levels of anxiety and depression, the study found.
    
            However, children born through surrogacy had some relationship issues around age 7, “which seemed to be related to their increased understanding of surrogacy at that age,” Golombok said. 
    
            “We visited the families when the children were 10, and these difficulties had disappeared,” she said. “Interestingly, the same phenomenon has been found among internationally adopted children. It may have to do with having to confront issues of identity at a younger age than other children.”
    
            Developmentally, children begin to notice and ask questions about pregnancy between the ages of 3 and 4, said clinical psychologist Rebecca Berry, an adjunct faculty member in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.
    
            “To satisfy their curiosity they’ll begin to ask questions about babies and where they came from as a way of trying to understand why they are here,” said Berry, who was not involved with the study.
    
            Children as young as 7 will already have a basic understanding of genetics, and can be surprised when they learn they aren’t genetically connected to one or both parents, said Lauri Pasch, a psychology professor at the University of California San Francisco, who specializes in infertility and family building.
    
            “Our current thinking is that it is best for parents to share the story of donor conception with their children at a very early age, so that if I were to ask their child when they are an adult when they learned that they were donor conceived, they would respond that they ‘always knew,’” said Pasch, who was also not involved in the study, via email.
    
            “This allows the child to grow up with the information, as opposed to learning it later in life, when it comes as a surprise or shock and can hurt their trust in their parents and their identity development,” she added.
    
            When it came to maternal anxiety and depression, there were no differences between families formed by surrogacy and egg or sperm donation and families with children born without assisted conception. Nor were they any differences in the mothers’ relationships with their partners at home, the study found.
    
            However, mothers who had babies via donor eggs reported less positive family relationships than mothers who used sperm donation, likely due to insecurities about lack of a genetic connection to their children, Golombok said.
    
            Young adults conceived by sperm donation reported poorer family communication than those conceived by egg donation, the study found. That’s perhaps due to a greater reluctance on the part of fathers to disclose they are not a genetic parent, Golombok said. 
    
            Only 42% of parents who had conceived via sperm donor had revealed the child’s birth history by the time their children were age 20, compared to 88% of egg donation parents and 100% of  parents who used surrogacy.
    
            When asked, many of the children said they weren’t concerned about how they were conceived. 
    
            “A lot of the children said ‘It’s not a big deal. I’ve got more interesting things going on in my life,’ while others said ‘Actually it’s something a bit special about me. I like talking about it,’ Golombok said. “I think it’s really nice to hear from the children themselves and I don’t think any other study has done this.”
    
            Once told, a child needs to revisit the birth history from time to time, so parents should be sure any conversation is an ongoing one, Golombok said.
    
            “There is this idea parents will tell the child and that is it. But you need to keep having these conversations to give the child a chance to ask questions in an age appropriate way as they grow older,” she said.
    
            “Many of the parents in our study use children’s books that were specifically designed for this purpose,” Golombok added. “Then they could bring the child’s own story into the narrative.”

      Concerned about the courts, some states and universities are stockpiling abortion drugs
    ","
			By Jen Christensen, CNN

        5:49 PM EDT, Wed April 12, 2023
    ","
            With an eye on the courts, a growing number of Democratic-led states are stockpiling the pills that can be used for a medication abortion, the most common form of the procedure in the US.
    
            The officials want to be prepared, in case US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s decision to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone goes through, so medication abortions would still be available in their states for some period of time. But they’re taking different approaches to the idea.
    
            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Tuesday that her state’s Department of Health would buy 150,000 doses of misoprostol, the other of the two drugs typically used in a medication abortion.
    
            Misoprostol can be used off-label for an abortion, without mifepristone, but patients often have to use more of it. It would not be covered by the court case, and if Kacsmaryk’s decision stands, the New York City’s Health Department tweeted, it will change to using this medication only.
    
            “Medication abortion continues to be available at our Sexual Health Clinics and NYC Health + Hospitals locations. Should mifepristone become unavailable, we will continue to make medication abortion accessible to all in NYC by shifting to a misoprostol-only treatment regimen,” the tweet said. 
    
            The state says the 150,000 doses should represent a five-year supply of pills.
    
            “Anti-choice extremists have shown that they are not stopping at overturning Roe, and they are working to entirely dismantle our country’s reproductive health care system, including medication abortion and contraception,” Hochul said. “New York will always be a safe harbor for abortion care, and I am taking action to protect abortion access in our State and continue to lead the nation in defending the right to reproductive autonomy.”
    
            California is also stocking up on misoprostol.
    
            “While California still believes Mifepristone is central to the preferred regimen for medication abortion, the State negotiated and purchased an emergency stockpile of Misoprostol in anticipation of Friday’s ruling by far-right federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to ensure that California remains a safe haven for safe, affordable, and accessible reproductive care,” Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said in a release Monday.
    
            California plans to purchase up to 2 million pills through CalRx, a state initiative set up to make drugs more affordable. 
    
            The governor’s office said the state now has more than 250,000 pills on hand, which it purchased for about $100,000. 
    
            California said it shared the terms of its purchase agreement with other members of the Reproductive Freedom Alliance, a nonpartisan coalition of 21 governors who are committed to protecting reproductive rights, and who might also be interested in taking such action.
    
            Another member of that alliance, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, announced last week that his state bought a three year-supply of mifepristone, the drug at the center of Kacsmaryk’s ruling. 
    
            Inslee directed the state Department of Corrections – which has a pharmacy license and is legally able to buy medications – to buy the drug last month, he said, and the shipment was delivered March 31. The University of Washington also purchased 10,000 doses. 
    
            Lawmakers are introducing a bill to authorize officials to distribute or sell the medication to licensed providers throughout the state.
    
            “This Texas lawsuit is a clear and present danger to patients and providers all across the country. Washington will not sit by idly and risk the devastating consequences of inaction,” Inslee said. “Washington is a pro-choice state, and no Texas judge will order us otherwise.”
    
            In the meantime, its attorney general, Bob Ferguson, is helping lead a multistate lawsuit to protect access to mifepristone. 
    
            On Friday, the same day Kacsmaryk’s ruling came down, a federal judge in Washington ordered the US not to make any changes that would restrict access to mifepristone in the territories that brought the lawsuit: 17 states and the District of Columbia. 
    
            On Monday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura T. Healey announced that at her request, the University of Massachusetts and health care providers have also taken action to stockpile doses of mifepristone.
    
            The governor’s office said last week that the university bought about 15,000 doses of mifepristone, enough to cover the commonwealth for about a year, and the pills are expected to arrive this week. Local health care providers have agreed to buy more, and the government agreed to set aside $1 million to pay for those doses.
    
            The Massachusetts governor also signed an executive order confirming protections for medication abortion under existing law. 
    
            “Here in Massachusetts, we are not going to let one extremist judge in Texas turn back the clock on this proven medication and restrict access to care in our state,”  Healey said. “The action we are taking today protects access to mifepristone in Massachusetts and protects patients and providers from liability. In Massachusetts, we stand for civil rights and freedom. We will always protect access to reproductive health care, including medication abortion.” 
    
            Danco Laboratories, the manufacturer of the brand-name version of mifepristone, says that orders for the drug have increased substantially in recent months and are significantly higher than they were at this time last year. 
    
            Demand for mifepristone is up across all types of customers, including clinics, pharmacies and individual providers, said Abby Long, Danco’s director of public affairs. But Massachusetts is the only state that has requested an especially large number of pills from the company.
    
            Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who called the Texas decision “reckless” and a “fundamental assault on women’s rights,” said Monday that her administration is evaluating its options, “including procuring mifepristone if needed, to protect access to medication abortion for Maine women.” 
    
            The Connecticut governor’s office said Wednesday that it is also monitoring the situation. 
    
            Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek’s office said in an email Wednesday that she has directed the Oregon Health Authority to “explore all available avenues for ensuring Oregon is prepared should Mifepristone become less available. That includes evaluating the supply of Mifepristone and Misoprostol and consulting with providers to better understand the potential impact on the provision of abortion and reproductive health care and what additional support might be necessary.”

      Appeals court can rule at any time in dispute over suspending FDA approval of medication abortion drug

    ","
            The Justice Department and a manufacturer of abortion pills have submitted the final round of court briefs in the emergency dispute over whether an appeals court should freeze a judge’s ruling that would suspend the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of medication abortion drugs.
    
            Now that the filings have been submitted, the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals Court could rule at any time on whether to put a hold on the order from US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk.
    
            Kacsmaryk on Friday night said he was halting the FDA’s approval of the drug mifepristone but that he was delaying the order by seven days to give the pill’s defenders time to appeal the case. The Justice Department has asked the appeals court to act by 12 p.m. CT Thursday on its request that Kacsmaryk’s ruling be paused, to give the government time to seek a Supreme Court intervention if need be. The 5th Circuit is not obligated to meet that deadline.
    
            The Justice Department wrote in its new filing that Kacsmaryk purported “to be acting in a restrained manner … but there is nothing modest about upending the decades-long status quo by blocking access nationwide to a safe and effective drug.”
    
            “Effectively requiring Danco Laboratories and GenBioPro to cease distribution of mifepristone after more than two decades would upend the status quo, severely harming women, healthcare systems, and the public,” the Justice Department said, referring to the two US manufacturers of mifepristone.
    
            The Justice Department filing pushed back on the assertions by the challengers, made in their filing overnight in the emergency dispute, that the 5th Circuit did not have the authority to hear the appeal of Kacsmaryk’s ruling. The Justice Department also called out Kacsmaryk and the challengers for relying on anonymous blog posts to claim mifepristone is unsafe.
    
            Danco Labroratories, which intervened in the case to defend mifepristone’s approval, wrote in its new filing with the appeals court that if the ruling is not frozen, “women across the nation will face serious, unnecessary health risks from the elimination of access to a drug FDA has repeatedly deemed safe and effective and that is the standard of care.”
    
            In an overnight filing, the anti-abortion doctors who sued to ban medication abortion drugs told a federal appeals court that it should leave in place the ruling that will halt the drug’s FDA approval.
    
            The anti-abortion doctors defended Kacsmaryk’s ruling called it a “meticulously considered” ruling that “paints an alarming picture of decades-long agency lawlessness – all to the detriment of the women and girls FDA is charged to protect.”
    
            Mifepristone has been approved by the FDA for terminating pregnancies for nearly 23 years. Leading medical associations have rebuked the claims by the approval’s legal challengers and by the judge that the drug is unsafe.

      Biden administration will propose new privacy safeguards for women seeking abortions
    ","

        9:00 AM EDT, Wed April 12, 2023
    ","
            The US Department of Health and Human Services will propose a new rule on Wednesday, aimed at safeguarding privacy and prohibiting the prosecution of individuals who seek abortions. 
    
            The new rule proposal comes as Vice President Kamala Harris is set to convene an interagency taskforce meeting on reproductive rights at the White House. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra will also attend.
    
            In a call with reporters, senior administration officials previewed the notice of proposed rulemaking from the Biden administration, issued in response to a Texas federal judge’s ruling late last week to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of medication abortion drug mifepristone.
    
            “Specifically, this NPRM proposes to strengthen privacy protections by prohibiting the use or disclosure of protected health information by regulated entities, such as health insurance plans, providers and others, specifically for a criminal, civil or administrative investigation into proceeding against a person in connection with seeking, obtaining, providing or facilitating reproductive health care where such health care is lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided,” a senior administration official said.
    
            The senior administration official called it a “step further” from existing guidance issued in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s ruling last summer that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the right to an abortion nationwide. The current guidance, still in effect, protects HIPAA privacy rights by not requiring the disclosure of patient information under certain circumstances. But officials said they found that some providers would still “get fearful,” about following the guidance when subpoenaed. 
    
            This proposed rule, they said, providers further cover “to not provide that information, if it’s not for the specific purpose articulated in the role.”
    
            The US Department of Education is also issuing guidance to remind over 20,000 school officials of their obligations to student privacy, according to a statement from the White House, among other new administration efforts.
    
            The Biden administration is issuing these limited actions after the Texas ruling rocked the country last week. The minimal reach of the proposed rules and guidance illustrate the lack of options the administration can take to protect access to this abortion pill, should the ruling take effect and be pulled from the market. The Justice Department and the manufacturer of mifepristone have already appealed, asking the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to put on hold the judge’s ruling that could make the drug unavailable nationwide starting Friday at midnight.
    
            But before Wednesday, the White House had yet to outline what other steps it could take to secure its availability. The administration took similar limited steps to protect access to abortion after the Dobbs decision, but Friday’s ruling set off calls from frustrated progressive Democrats for the FDA and Biden administration to ignore the ruling – a request that the administration has said would set a “dangerous precedent.” 
    
            A separate and conflicting abortion pill ruling in Washington on the same day, created arguably the most contentious and chaotic legal flashpoint over abortion access since last summer.
    
            Those rulings prompted a fresh scramble from administration officials, who had been bracing for the Texas ruling to come down, and officials convening behind closed doors to work through a response. After the decision dropped Friday, a senior administration official said the White House immediately began engaging allies on the next steps.
    
            “We’ve had very close contact with the Hill with members both in the House and the Senate, and staff, with groups who are focused on abortion, women’s groups, health care providers,” a second senior official told CNN. “We’ve also been in close contact, of course, with allies on the state level, state legislators, attorneys general etc. And we will continue to do all of that.”
    
            Harris, in her remarks at the taskforce meeting on Wednesday, will reiterate President Joe Biden’s pledge to fight the ruling. 
    
            The vice president, a third senior administration official said, will “highlight the administration’s unwavering commitment to protecting reproductive rights in the midst of a health care crisis.” 
    
            “The vice president will also point out that this unprecedented decision is not only an attack on women’s freedom to make decisions about her own body, but it also threatens our nation’s system of drug approvals and the rights of Americans across the country who expect that a medication approved by the FDA and prescribed by their doctor will be available to them when they need it,” the official continued.
    
            Harris has led the administration’s response on abortion rights. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, she has hosted dozens of roundtable discussions about reproductive rights, including access to contraception and medication abortion, while meeting with state legislators across the country.

      5 things the Supreme Court might take into account in medication abortion case

            As the Supreme Court prepares for yet another controversial abortion case to come its way, the justices will pore over District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s ruling last week to block the government’s approval of the key medication abortion drug at issue. 
    
            Here are five issues that could attract the attention of the high court:
    
            Court watchers like to jump right to the heart of a dispute to consider “the merits” of a particular controversy.
    
            Judges do not.
    
            Their first step is always to determine whether a case is properly before the court. Is it a true “case or controversy” as required under the law? Here, the plaintiffs – physicians and organizations opposed to abortion that are representing physicians – say the FDA should have never approved the drug more than 20 years ago. But can those plaintiffs show that they have the legal injury necessary to bring the case? Kacsmaryk, of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, said they could.
    
            “Here, the associations’ members have standing because they allege adverse events from chemical abortion drugs can overwhelm the medical system and place enormous pressure and stress on doctors during emergencies and complications,” he wrote.
    
            But others question whether that amounts to the “concrete and particularized” injury the plaintiffs need to get in the courthouse door.  
    
            “Vague speculation that someday, somewhere, some unspecified doctor will be overwhelmed by an onslaught of patients coming into the ER after taking mifepristone does not establish that these particular doctors face an imminent risk of a concrete and particularized harm,” Adam Unikowsky, a lawyer and former clerk of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, wrote in his newsletter. 
    
            As for the Biden administration, it told the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that “plaintiffs lack standing to challenge FDA’s approval of a drug they neither take nor prescribe; their challenge to FDA actions dating back to 2000 is manifestly untimely; and they have provided no basis for second-guessing FDA’s scientific judgment.”
    
            The justices care about these issues, because they impact far more than just the case at hand.
    
            “These questions of whether the plaintiffs have the kind of real-world injury that is necessary to get into court, and whether their claim was timely or filed too late apply across the board in federal lawsuits,” said Supreme Court litigator Andrew Pincus.
    
            “There are serious questions on whether the Supreme Court is willing to endorse the district’s court’s very broad approach to those questions,” he said.
    
            Some of the members of the high court could see this case as less about abortion, and more about the authority of a federal agency to assess public health and the regulatory landscape in general.
    
            “The current conservative majority has generally been very skeptical of how much authority various agencies exercise,” said CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck who is a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “The one place where they have been less skeptical though, has been an agency’s authority, which is predicated on long settled and well developed technical and scientific expertise” he added. 
    
            Back in January 2021, Chief Justice John Roberts discussed the FDA’s authority in a case related to medication abortion and said, “My view is that courts owe significant deference to the politically accountable entities with the background, competence and expertise to assess public health.”
    
            In addition, leaders of pharmaceutical and biotech companies condemned Kacsmaryk’s opinion in a sign that they are worried it could impact other drugs and destabilize the regulatory landscape. Those arguments won’t be lost on the justices. 
    
            “As an industry we count on the FDA’s autonomy and authority to bring new medicines to patients under a reliable regulatory process for drug evaluation and approval,” the companies wrote in a statement released Monday. “Adding regulatory uncertainty to the already inherently risky work of discovering and developing new medicines will likely have the effect of reducing incentives for investment, endangering the innovation that characterizes our industry,” they said.
    
            But lawyers for the anti-abortion doctors behind the challenge said in court filings Tuesday that the FDA had broken the rules. They said the district court order “paints an alarming picture of decades-long agency lawlessness — all to the detriment of the women and girls FDA is charged to protect.”
    
            As he often does, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately last June to explain his thinking in voting to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
    
            “To be clear, then,” he wrote “the Court’s decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States,” he said. “On the contrary, the Court’s decision properly leaves the question of abortion for the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process,” he added. 
    
            For his part, Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, announced that, “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.”
    
            But Kacsmaryk’s decision, if allowed to go into effect, would severely cut back on abortion even in states that allow it. In addition, in its filing brief, the Justice Department also emphasized that mifepristone is used for other purposes besides abortion. 
    
            “This harm would be felt throughout the country, given that mifepristone has lawful uses in every state,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton wrote.
    
            The Supreme Court might also take issue with the relief that Kacsmaryk ordered. He decided he had the authority to bypass the agency, and vacate the approvals directly. Had he, instead, issued an injunction against the FDA, the move could have allowed the agency to work in a more timely manner to implement the decision.  
    
            On page two of his opinion, Kacsmaryk criticizes jurists who use the word “fetus” to “inaccurately identify unborn humans in unscientific ways.”
    
            But who are some jurists who have decided to use the word “fetus” when discussing abortion?
    
            None other than the liberals on the Supreme Court who dissented in Dobbs.
    
            Kacsmaryk chooses, instead, to use the word “unborn human.” He also refers to medication abortion as “chemical abortion” – a term favored by opponents of abortion rights.
    
            At other times his language is graphic. When Kacsmaryk explains the effects of mifepristone, he writes that it “halts nutrition, and ultimately starves the unborn human until death.”  
    
            The judge also utilizes the word “abortionist” when referring to health care officials who perform the procedures.
    
            Critics of Kacsmaryk also fear his opinion could confuse patients. Dr. Courtney Schreiber noted in a sworn declaration filed Monday that many patients will believe that abortion is no longer legal if his ruling goes into effect Friday. Some facilities may offer just misoprostol, the doctor noted, a second drug that usually works in concert with mifepristone. 
    
            “Restricted access to this safe therapeutic threatens the health of real people – people who are mothers, sisters, daughters, wives and friends,” she wrote.
    
            Another doctor who filed a declaration in favor of a stay is Dr. Alisa Goldberg, who serves at Harvard Medical School and works at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. She testified that after more than two decades of treating patients with medication abortion, “the tiny proportion of patients who experience serious complications from taking mifepristone has remained consistently flat.” 
    
            But Kacsmaryk openly rejects such language. He contends that the agency didn’t do enough more than 20 years ago to test the drug – defying all that major medical associations have said about the efficacy of the drug. Alliance Defending Freedom, the group representing the plaintiffs in the case, praised Karcsmaryk’s ruling on Monday, insisting on calling the drug “dangerous.” Erin Hawley, a lawyer for the group, said that the FDA “put women in harm’s way, and the agency should be held accountable for its reckless actions.” 
    
            And in a court filing Tuesday, she called the opinion “meticulously considered.”
    
            Others contend Kacsmaryk abandoned his role as a judge in favor of passing himself off as a health expert. They point to a part of his decision quoting “one study” where 14% of women and girls reported having received “insufficient information” on issues on the burdens and risks of the procedure. But the study, is culled from an anti-abortion rights website and is made up of stories from those who had abortions and wish to share their experience anonymously.
    
            “Okay, so to recap the judge asserts that ‘fourteen percent of women and girls report having received insufficient information’ without revealing the entire sample consists of anonymous blog posts on pro-life website designed for women who regret their abortions,” Unikowsky wrote.
    
            And the judge cites a study about women who have had abortions feeling “shame, regret, anxiety and depression” without mentioning other studies holding the opposite.

      There were 32,000 fewer legal abortions in the US in the six months after the Dobbs decision, new analysis suggests

    ","
            In the six months after the Supreme Court ruling that ended the federal right to an abortion, there were about 32,000 fewer abortions than expected in the United States, according to a new analysis. 
    
            There were about 5,000 fewer legal abortions each month, on average, than there were in the months before the ruling – a drop of about 6%.
    
            In April and May, there were an average of about 82,000 abortions each month, according to the analysis. From July through December, that fell to an average of 77,000 abortions per month. The total number of abortions fluctuated month-to-month, but was always lower than it was in April. 
    
            The Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit focused on abortion and contraception, sponsored a research effort that collected data from abortion providers nationwide – including clinics, private medical offices, hospitals and virtual clinics. More than 80% of known providers responded. Self-managed abortions that occur outside of the formal health care system were not included in the analysis.
    
            In the 13 states that enacted bans following the Supreme Court decision, abortions fell more than 95%, with just a few reported each month from July to December. But in the remaining set of states, the average number of abortions ticked up slightly. There were surges in some of those states, including Minnesota and Kansas, that suggest that individuals living in states with more restrictions may travel for care. 
    
            “Those unable to overcome travel barriers are likely those with the fewest socioeconomic resources,” the authors of the report wrote. “Even small declines in the abortion rate still translate into enormous life impacts for those affected.”
    
            While the number of abortions declined overall, those provided virtually through telehealth increased each month and accounted for a growing share of abortions overall. There were more than 8,500 telehealth abortions in December, more than double compared with April. 
    
            Earlier research found that the average travel time to an abortion facility increased significantly for women in the US following the Supreme Court Decision. Dozens of clinics shuttered within the first month, and the average travel time to the closest facility more than tripled.

      Opinion: Anti-abortion advocates are using junk science to usurp the will of the American people
    ","
			Opinion by Michele Goodwin and Mary Ziegler

    ","
            Dueling decisions in two federal district courts last week are likely to set up a showdown at the Supreme Court over the fate of the abortion pill mifepristone. If abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill — reportedly used in more than half of abortions in the United States — will be severely undercut.
    
            Beyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions don’t like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists are using junk science to bypass the will of the American public and restrict abortion.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas blocked the use of mifepristone Friday after the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a group of anti-abortion doctors, employed dubious arguments to challenge the medication’s approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000. 
    
            The group alleges that the FDA failed to engage in a rigorous review of the drug, lacked the authority to approve the drug and rushed it to market without thorough consideration of the health implications (the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the plaintiffs, claims that the drug imperils the health and even lives of pregnant women.) 
    
            The FDA, in appealing the Texas ruling, supported its process for authorizing Mifiprex, the brand name for mifepristone. The “FDA approved Mifeprex more than 20 years ago based on a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence available and determined that it was safe and effective,” the agency said. “The approval was based on the best available science and done in accordance with the laws that govern our work.” 
    
            The Texas suit additionally claims that mifepristone was criminalized under the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal law that prohibits mailing any “article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” That legal interpretation would limit access to mifepristone because drug suppliers need to ship it to providers. 
    
            For now, the drug remains available. Kacsmaryk gave the government a week to file an appeal, which is among the legal measures underway to keep the ruling from going into effect. At the same time, in a case brought by 17 states and the District of Columbia, U.S. District Judge Thomas Owen Rice in Washington state ordered the FDA to keep mifepristone available in those jurisdictions. 
    
            The states had argued that the FDA should lift some of the restrictions on mifepristone access, which they argued were unnecessary and unsupported by science. Rice instead ordered the FDA to preserve access in the states that had brought suit.  
    
            Kacsmaryk’s ruling is unprecedented. It is rare for parties to challenge the FDA’s approval of drugs, but for a judge to second-guess a decision on a drug that has safely been on the market for more than 20 years is just about unheard of — especially when there is no legitimate case that the plaintiffs have the standing to sue.
    
            Any fair investigation of the FDA’s process would show that there are no grounds for challenging mifepristone’s approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review — more than four years — before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use than Viagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident in Europe. 
    
            Altogether, for those who take mifepristone “serious side effects occur in less than 1% of patients, and major adverse events—significant infection, blood loss, or hospitalization—occur in less than 0.3% of patients. The risk of death is almost non-existent.”  
    
            The case was never about the safety of mifepristone, however. Anti-abortion groups like the ADF cling to dubious scientific claims to bypass majority politics, putting decisions in the hands of conservative judges and confusing voters who don’t always feel qualified to have an opinion on how a drug like mifepristone works.
    
            Since 2022, voters have sent a clear message when the question is what abortion law ought to look like: They have sided with supporters of abortion rights in six out of six ballot initiatives, boosted Democratic candidates and, just last week, transformed the Wisconsin Supreme Court. A recent Ipsos poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans want medication abortion to be kept legal.
    
            Kacsmaryk’s ruling is part of a strategy to take the question away from voters and to reframe abortion as something that ordinary Americans neither understand nor get a say about. Such an approach isn’t new, and it’s not going anywhere anytime soon; if the anti-abortion movement can’t win in a fair democratic fight, its members will seek out ways to change the rules. 
    
            Many antiabortion groups have long tried to undermine abortion by claiming that it harms girls and women — and that abortion opponents were seeking to protect pregnant people from the “abortion industry.” 
    
            This strategy underwrote targeted regulations of abortion providers (TRAP laws), onerous clinic regulations and statutes forcing women to receive medically unnecessary and invasive vaginal ultrasounds. State legislatures enacted burdensome laws requiring waiting periods before a woman can legally terminate a pregnancy. This all despite the fact that a woman is about 14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term than having an abortion.
    
            When the Supreme Court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2007, dubious scientific arguments became even more central to anti-abortion advocacy. In Gonzales v. Carhart, the court held that in circumstances of scientific uncertainty, legislators would have more latitude to regulate abortion. That incentivized antiabortion groups to identify or manufacture uncertainty by creating their own data and fielding their own witnesses.
    
            Implausible scientific claims are now visible on social media, in lawsuits and in congressional hearings. In a separate fight, for example, the antiabortion group Students for Life of America has asked the FDA to reconsider its mifepristone approval by making claims about the ill effects of abortion on wastewater. 
    
            In Congress, abortion opponents testified — contrary to the position taken by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists — that life-saving abortions, or even abortions in cases of rape, were not “abortions” at all. (By taking this position, abortion opponents can still defend bans with no or few exceptions by claiming that abortion is never necessary.)
    
            That Kacsmaryk embraced snake-oil science underscores concerns that broader dangers loom. If his ruling stands, this case sends a message that challengers don’t need to have science on their side, or even the standing, to sue. All that matters is control of the courts.

      Mother of 6-year-old student who shot teacher charged with child neglect
    ","

    ","
            The mother of a 6-year-old who shot his first-grade teacher in Newport News, Virginia, in January has been indicted on charges of felony child neglect, and one count of recklessly leaving a firearm to endanger a child, a news release from the office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney said Monday.
    
            The child will not be criminally charged, Newport News Commonwealth’s Attorney Howard Gwynn said last month.
    
            Deja Taylor’s son shot his teacher Abigail Zwerner, 25, on January 6 at Richneck Elementary School, leaving her in the hospital with gunshot wounds to her hand and chest, investigators said.
    
            The gun was purchased by Taylor and was kept on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, secured by a trigger lock, an attorney representing the family told CNN in January. The child brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said.
    
            The indictment comes after a “thorough investigation” from the police and the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s office, according to the news release.
    
            James Ellenson, one of the attorneys for the family, said in a statement Tuesday that Taylor, 26, “has cooperated from the first day of the incident,” and intends to turn herself in by the end of the week.
    
            “As always, first and foremost is the continued health and wellbeing of all persons involved in the incident at Richneck Elementary School, to include both the teacher and Deja’s son,” the statement said.  
    
            The boy has an “acute disability” and was under a care plan which required a parent to attend school with him, though he was unaccompanied on the day of the shooting, the family has said in a statement. “We will regret our absence on this day for the rest of our lives,” the statement read.
    
            A lawsuit brought this month by Zwerner alleges school administrators and the school board were aware of the student’s “history of random violence” and did not act proactively amid concerns over a firearm in the boy’s possession the day of the shooting.
    
            Ellenson said last week the allegations in the lawsuit against the child and the family “should be taken with a large grain of salt.”
    
            “We of course continue to pray for Ms. Zwerner’s complete recovery,” Ellenson said without commenting further on the lawsuit. 
    
            In the lawsuit, which seeks $40 million in compensatory damages, an attorney for Zwerner alleges school staff and administrators at Richneck Elementary School were aware the child was violent at home and his parents refused to place him in special education classrooms.
    
            According to the court document, during the first half of the school year, the 6-year-old was required to be accompanied by a parent during the school day “because of his violent tendencies.” But that day, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied without a one-on-one companion during the school day,” the complaint says.
    
            The suit also alleges the school’s then-assistant principal ignored concerns and warning signs flagged by several teachers and staff members, including that the 6-year-old may have had a firearm in his possession in the hours leading up to the January 6 shooting.
    
            A guidance counselor and administrator at the elementary school said assistant principal Ebony Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his “mother would be arriving soon to pick him up,” the complaint says.
    
            Diane Toscano, an attorney for Zwerner, said Monday the lawsuit makes it clear “we believe the school division violated state law.”
    
            “There were failures in accountability at multiple levels that led to Abby being shot and almost killed. Today’s announcement addresses but one of those failures,” Toscano said in an email. “It has been three months of investigation and still so many unanswered questions remain.”
    
            The fallout from the incident was swift, drawing harsh criticism from parents and leading the school board to vote to oust Superintendent George Parker III. Ebony Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal, Briana Foster Newton, was reassigned to another school, though the district did not say where.
    
            CNN requested comment from Parker about the lawsuit but has not heard back.
    
            The circuit court has also asked to impanel a special grand jury to continue the investigation, according to the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s news release.
    
            “The Special Grand Jury will investigate to determine whether additional charges against additional persons are justified by the facts and the law,” Gwynn said in the release. “If the Special Grand Jury determines that additional persons are criminally responsible under the law, it can return additional indictments.”
    
            In her first interview since the shooting, Zwerner told NBC in March she can’t forget the look on the child’s face as he aimed the gun at her.
    
            “I remember him pointing the gun at me, I remember the look on his face,” Zwerner said. “I remember the gun going off.”
    
            Asked about her recovery, Zwerner said, “I’ve been doing OK. It’s been challenging.”
    
            “Some days are not-so-good days where I can’t get up out of bed,” she told NBC. “Some days are better than others where I’m able to get out of bed and make it to my appointments. But from going through what I’ve gone through, I try to stay positive.”

      Clinics and doctors brace for more restrictions on women’s health care after court ruling on abortion drug
    ","

    ","
            Less than a year after the US Supreme Court ended legal protection for abortions nationwide, clinics that provide reproductive health care across the United States are bracing for more restrictions on the care they provide to women.
    
            If a judge’s ruling takes effect Friday, it may soon be illegal for doctors to prescribe mifepristone, the first in a two-drug regimen that can help women terminate a pregnancy at home – and that has other uses.
    
            At Northeast Ohio Women’s Center, staffers are calling patients who expected to get medication abortions next week, telling them to change their plans.
    
            “They’re scrambling to change their schedules to get in to see us earlier,” said Dr. David Burkons, the physician who runs the clinics.
    
            About half of abortions in the US use mifepristone, which is sold under the brand name Mifeprex.
    
            Mifeprex blocks the hormone progesterone, which effectively stops a pregnancy from continuing. For an abortion, women take mifepristone first, followed one or two days later by misoprostol, a drug that causes the uterus to contract, cramp and bleed, similar to a heavy period. It empties out the uterus, ending the pregnancy. It can be used up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.
    
            But the uses of mifepristone go beyond abortion.
    
            The drug helps soften and open the cervix, the neck of the uterus, and doctors depend on it to help when women are having a miscarriage and when a pregnancy needs to be terminated quickly if the life of the mother is at stake.
    
            In certain situations, when a pregnancy has become too risky, time is of the essence, says Dr. Alison Edelman, who directs the division of Complex Family Planning at Oregon Health and Sciences University.
    
            “The more expediently that we can have somebody not be pregnant, the better, and mifepristone helps us speed that process up and make it safer for patients,” she said.
    
            Doctors also use mifepristone before procedures in which they need to go into the uterus, such as to remove bleeding polyps.  Studies have shown that the drug helps reduce the amount of force needed to open the cervix and reduces the amount of blood loss associated with the procedure.
    
            Studies also show that mifepristone has moderate to strong benefits for inducing labor and treating uterine fibroids and endometriosis, sometimes helping avoid surgery, according to the American Society of Health Systems Pharmacists.
    
             It can be used to prevent bleeding between periods and to control hyperstimulation of the ovaries during in-vitro fertilization, the society said in a statement.
    
            Doctors say they still have other ways to treat those problems, but when considering the needs of individual patients, they will be missing a valuable tool.
    
            “We have our gold standard of what we provide – the safest, most effective regimen – and then if it’s not available, we use the next best one. And that’s what we would be left with,” Edelman said.
    
            Mifepristone has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for 23 years, and it has been used by over 5 million women in the United States. FDA data shows that less than 1% of women who take it have significant adverse events. A CNN analysis of FDA data found that mifepristone was even less risky than some other common medications, including Viagra and penicillin.
    
            Medication abortions have become an increasingly important option for women in states that restricted abortion access after the Supreme Court’s ruling last year that ended legal protections for abortions in every state. They are also sometimes the only kind of abortion many women can get in rural areas that have lost abortion providers.
    
            This ease of access has also made the medication regimen a target for abortion opponents.
    
            “They want to see a national ban, and this is in fact what they are going for in this case,” said Kristen Moore, director of the EMAA Project, a nonprofit that is seeking to make it easier to get abortion medications in the US.
    
            What will happen next is far from settled. Appeals have been filed to stop the ruling in Texas from taking hold, and higher courts will have to weigh in.
    
            Even if the court does take mifepristone off the market in the US, doctors say, they will still be able to provide medication abortions using misoprostol alone.
    
            In fact, some abortion providers have been planning on using misoprostol by itself in case mifepristone is isn’t available.
    
            Carafem, which provides telehealth abortion care, has been offering a misoprostol-only regimen since the Covid-19 pandemic began, Chief Operating Officer Melissa Grant says.
    
            “In 2020, we started to use misoprostol alone as an option,” she said. Workers have since been tweaking the regimen and gathering data.
    
            “We now feel confident that, even though we would much prefer to use both, that we can use misoprostol alone effectively and are ready to switch gears to have a higher percentage of our clients or even 100% of our colleagues use that option if necessary,” Grant said.
    
            Still, some providers said it’s not ideal.
    
            The misoprostol-only regimen is slightly less effective than the one that uses both drugs, and it causes more cramping and bleeding, which can mean more complications.
    
            “We’re more likely to see failures and therefore more likely to need surgical intervention after misoprostol alone,” said Dr. Erika Werner, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts Medical Center.
    
            Still, doctors want women to know that medication abortions and miscarriage care will still be available even if mifepristone isn’t.  And they hope that higher courts will intervene to keep this medication on pharmacy shelves.
    
            “The clinicians would have to use these other options instead of choosing based on their own expertise, knowledge and judgment when rendering such care,” Dr. Iffath Hoskins, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said Monday. “Frankly, as a clinician, I do not want to be in that position.”

      Suspension of mifepristone approval wouldn’t be the end of medication abortion
    ","

    ","
            Even if US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s decision to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone goes through, there still will be a nonsurgical option for people to manage abortions at home. 
    
            In the United States, the so-called abortion pill is actually two medications, mifepristone, sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym, or known as RU-486, and misoprostol, which is taken about 24 to 48 hours later. 
    
            The federal judge’s ruling in Texas last week applies only to mifepristone. He delayed his ruling for a week to allow for appeals, but even if the ruling is put in place, it does not involve misoprostol. 
    
            Misoprostol alone is considered a safe and effective way to have an abortion, studies show. It has been used that way for decades.
    
            The two drugs work differently. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which the body needs for the pregnancy to continue. The hormone helps maintain the inside of the uterus, and without it, the uterus will expel its contents.
    
            Misoprostol is approved by the FDA to prevent and treat gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It also is used off-label for other kinds of ulcers, and it has several gynecological uses, including to induce contractions, to decrease blood loss after delivery and to treat miscarriages. 
    
            When used for an abortion, misoprostol works to help empty the uterus through bleeding and muscle contractions.
    
            “It’s a little old-school, but we could do it,” said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in New Jersey and a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
    
            It’s what people did before the FDA approved mifepristone in 2000, Brandi said.
    
            “Many places around the country that don’t have access to mifepristone, often due to politics, have been using misoprostol-only regimens for a long time,” she said.
    
            California said Monday that it is stockpiling misoprostol.
    
            “While California still believes Mifepristone is central to the preferred regimen for medication abortion, the State negotiated and purchased an emergency stockpile of Misoprostol in anticipation of Friday’s ruling by far-right federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to ensure that California remains a safe haven for safe, affordable, and accessible reproductive care,” Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said in a release. 
    
            Some health organizations such as Carafem, a national provider of reproductive health services, offer the one drug alone. It is endorsed as a medically acceptable approach by the World Health Organization. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says a misoprostol-only regimen is an “acceptable alternative” if mifepristone is unavailable.
    
            The two-drug approach to medicine abortion is preferable because it is slightly more effective, Brandi said. Also, abortion with misoprostol alone can come with more side effects.
    
            A person who uses this method is instructed to use it sublingually, putting four pills under their tongue and leaving them there for 30 minutes, then swallowing what’s left with water. They can also be used vaginally. 
    
            Typically, bleeding will begin within one to four hours after the first dose. Heavy bleeding usually lasts about three to five hours, but bleeding can last two weeks or longer, studies show. 
    
            Without mifepristone, a person most likely has to take more misoprostol than they would with the two-drug regimen. One study suggested that a person should be prescribed three or four doses as well as an additional dose in case it is needed.
    
            “The more we give, the more side effects people will have. And that’s not the goal. We want to make sure people not only have an effective response to the medicine, we also want to make sure that people aren’t as uncomfortable as they could be,” Brandi said. “Like I tell my patients, you do not need to suffer to have an abortion. That is not the purpose of this process.” 
    
            Other side effects can include fever, chills, nausea and diarrhea. 
    
            Medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all US abortions, studies show. Even if mifepristone is no longer available and misoprostol becomes the only option, it will still be the most popular choice, according to Dr. Jamila Perritt, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in Washington, D.C. 
    
            “Again, it is safe. It is effective. It requires a different dosing, and you experience the symptoms a little bit longer,” Perritt said. “There are some other some additional side effects, like a longer duration of bleeding or more intense nausea or vomiting or gastrointestinal side effects, but when you look at that against the barriers that are put in place, both at the state and now the federal level for accessing abortion, many individuals still choose the second medication alone, because it is more convenient and easier, and it means you’re not walking through hundreds of protesters when you go to get care at your health care provider’s office.”
    
            Dr. Iffath A. Hoskins, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says that although the one-drug option is safe, people shouldn’t have to make that choice because a lot of research shows that the two drugs in combination are highly safe and effective.
    
            “We do use off label medications when clinically appropriate; however, that should not happen here because we have over two decades worth of clinically sound evidence based information that this is valid option,” Hoskins said.

      There’s a reason for the GOP silence on abortion and guns
    ","
			Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN

    ","
            Yet another mass shooting and a new blow to nationwide abortion rights left Republicans facing pointed questions on two of the most emotive issues dominating American politics.
    
            But the GOP had almost nothing to say, reflecting the way that it is locked into positions that animate its most fervent grassroots voters but risk alienating it from much of the public.
    
            A controversial ruling from a conservative judge in Texas that could halt the use of a popular abortion drug nationwide, and another shooting spree – this time in Kentucky – sparked outrage among Democrats and calls for strengthening gun safety measures and protecting abortion rights. 
    
            Most Republicans stayed silent on the two issues on which they have achieved their political and policy goals but that are threatening the party’s long-term viability.
    
            After the shooting in downtown Louisville on Monday, Kentucky’s Republican senators issued condolences but offered no solutions about how the tragedy, which killed five people and injured eight others, might have been avoided. The gunman used a rifle in the attack after being notified of his impending dismissal from a job at a bank, a law enforcement official said.
    
            “We send our prayers to the victims, their families, and the city of Louisville as we await more information,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell wrote in a tweet that also praised first responders. And Sen. Rand Paul tweeted that he and his wife were “praying for everyone involved in the deadly shooting,” adding that “our hearts break for the families of those lost.”
    
            Democrats offered condolences too, but also had a more practical response. President Joe Biden called for the kind of gun safety reform that is impossible with Republicans in control of the House of Representatives and without Democrats holding more seats in the Senate. “Too many Americans are paying for the price of inaction with their lives. When will Republicans in Congress act to protect our communities?” Biden asked in a tweet. 
    
            Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvey, who represents Louisville in Congress, called for action to tackle gun violence. “Thoughts and prayers for those we lost, those who are injured and their loved ones and families are appreciated, but today serves as a stark reminder that we need to address gun violence at the national level,” the freshman congressman said.
    
            Over the last few decades, Republicans have expertly used gun rights and a push to overturn a constitutional right to end a pregnancy to energize their most loyal voters. And on each issue, in a purely political sense, it’s hard to argue that they have not racked up considerable wins.
    
            There are more guns than ever in the US. Republicans around the country are leading efforts to slash firearms regulation and broaden citizens’ capacity to carry guns. Despite a murderous run of massacres in schools, nightclubs, places of worship and, on Monday, in a bank, the party has effectively closed down all significant attempts in Congress to make it harder to buy weapons – including the assault-style rifles used in recent shootings. A bipartisan effort to persuade states to embrace red flag laws, which could help authorities confiscate weapons from people thought to pose a risk, did pass Congress last year. But its success was all the more notable because of the paucity of other federal legislation in previous decades.
    
            On abortion, meanwhile, the 50-year conservative campaign to overturn Roe v. Wade ranks as one of the most stunning victories for a long-term political movement in history. It reached its apex with the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            Yet it’s possible that these famous wins could carry a significant risk for the party.
    
            South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace calls herself “pro-life,” but also warns that GOP-backed state laws that don’t provide exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother alienate large and vital sections of the US electorate. Mace was a rare Republican to publicly respond to Texas Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s abortion drug ruling last week, which Democratic groups have seized on to renew claims Republicans want a national ban on abortion.
    
            “We are getting it wrong on this issue,” Mace said on “CNN This Morning” on Monday. “We’ve got to show compassion to women, especially to women who’ve been raped. We’ve got to show compassion on the abortion issue, because by and large, most of Americans aren’t with us on this issue.” She called for the US Food and Drug Administration to ignore the judge’s ruling, aligning her with progressive Democrats like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
    
            One reason Republicans have been successful in tightening abortion restrictions and loosening those on guns has been that their voters have embraced these two issues. They are make-or-break for many activists, and candidates have shaped their platforms as a result. Democrats, however, have traditionally been less successful in energizing their core supporters on both. The disparate intensity level among the parties was one factor in the sequence of events that led to a new conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned Roe. For years, Democrats trod carefully around the guns issue, wary of alienating more moderate or soft conservative voters.
    
            But there are signs this could be changing. Abortion was a huge motivator for Democratic voters in last year’s midterms and the Supreme Court’s ruling clearly hamstrung Republican candidates in several key swing races. In Wisconsin, which reverted to a pre-Civil War law banning almost all abortions once Roe was overturned, the issue was critical to the victory of a liberal candidate in last week’s state Supreme Court race, which flipped the conservative majority.
    
            Liberal fury over the failure to enact new gun laws stoked a political storm in Tennessee last week. Republicans expelled two Black Democratic lawmakers from the state’s House of Representatives for leading a gun reform protest inside the chamber after a mass shooting at a Nashville school the week before that killed six people, including three nine-year-olds. This highlighted a growing frustration among Democrats at their impotence in the face of endless mass shootings. (One of the lawmakers, Justin Jones, was sworn back into the chamber on Monday on an interim basis after the Nashville Metropolitan Council voted to appoint him.)
    
            Despite this shifting political terrain, there are few signs that top Republican leaders are willing to change the party’s tack on guns or abortion. Or that they have the political room to do so. Even though it makes sense for Republicans to appeal to a more general audience to avoid alienating crucial suburban, moderate and female voters, the vehemence of their core supporters makes this an impossible straddle. It’s a similar dynamic to the one many GOP power brokers have long faced with Donald Trump. The former president remains so popular with base voters that his GOP critics risk their careers by publicly opposing him. And yet, he has long been a liability among general election voters – as proved by the GOP’s performance in 2020 and 2022.
    
            The party’s failure to align with most Americans on abortion and on some aspects of gun safety may not be sustainable. Polls show that many voters, including younger Americans, are being driven away from the party because of its positions.
    
            In a Harvard Youth Poll released last week, which was completed before the shooting in Nashville, 63% of 18-to-29-year-olds said that gun laws should be made more strict, with 22% saying they should be kept as they are, and 13% that they should be made less strict. Young Americans are generally on the same page as the public as a whole. In October 2022, 57% of all Americans said that laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict, with 32% saying laws should be kept as they were and 10% that laws should be made less strict, according to a Gallup survey from October 2022. 
    
            On abortion, only 26% of Americans favor laws making it illegal to use or receive through the mail FDA-approved drugs for a medical abortion, while 72% oppose such laws, according to a PRRI report that analyzed polling on the issue over the last year. While 50% of White evangelical Protestants favor making it illegal to use or receive those drugs, less than half of any other racial, gender, educational or age group agree.
    
            In a Gallup poll in January, 46% of Americans said they were dissatisfied with US abortion policies and would prefer to see less strict abortion laws. That’s a record high in the firm’s 23-year trend, up from 30% in January 2022 and just 17% in 2021.
    
            Given these numbers, and recent election results, it’s not surprising that some Republicans not actively courting the base may choose not to speak at length on guns and abortion. And such data may also help to explain the GOP’s increasingly anti-democratic turn as it seeks to cling onto power – whether in efforts to expel Tennessee lawmakers for disturbing decorum with their anti-gun protests or through Trump’s insistence he won an election he actually lost.

      Medication abortion case could set up another explosive Supreme Court ruling – but it may not look like last year’s
    ","

    ","
            The Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade last June was decades in the making, culminating in a dramatic evisceration of women’s constitutional privacy rights and ability to obtain an abortion.
    
            The new controversy over medication abortion, which has burst relatively suddenly on the legal scene, has the potential for another seismic ruling at the Supreme Court.
    
            Yet it is a different kind of case and, ultimately, could bring a different resolution.
    
            The challenge by anti-abortion physicians and medical groups tests the US Food and Drug Administration’s authority to review and approve drugs for use. It brings to federal courts nuts-and-bolts questions of agency protocols and judicial deference, including when and under what situations courts may jettison longstanding scientific determinations.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in his Friday ruling put himself in the shoes of agency experts, declaring that they had failed to evaluate sufficiently the harms of the drug mifepristone, the first of a two-drug abortion regimen that has become the most common among women trying to end a pregnancy.
    
            “The Court,” he wrote of his determination, “does not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly. But here, FDA acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns – in violation of its statutory duty – based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions.”
    
            The US Department of Justice, on behalf of the FDA, forcefully rejected Kacsmaryk’s stance in a filing Monday as it seeks to postpone the effect of his ruling beyond this Friday as appeals are underway. If the ruling took effect, the drug could be unavailable nationwide by the end of the week.
    
            Since 2000, when the FDA determined that mifepristone was safe and effective to terminate early pregnancies, government lawyers say, the agency “has consistently adhered to that judgment across five presidential administrations. During that time, more than five million Americans have chosen to end their pregnancies using mifepristone…. When mifepristone is used as FDA directs, serious adverse events are exceedingly rare, just as they are for many common drugs like ibuprofen.”
    
            Separately, the pill-manufacturer Danco, backing the FDA, said in a Monday filing that Kacsmaryk’s “relentlessly one-sided narrative … never mentions the millions of women who have benefitted from the availability of medication abortion or the harms an injunction would wreak on Danco, a one-product company.”
    
            It’s not just the availability of this abortion pill that’s at stake. If those defenders of the FDA lose and Kacsmaryk’s decision is affirmed by a lower appellate court and then a majority of the nine Supreme Court justices, it would transform the rules for FDA determinations, far beyond the abortion realm, to other existing or new drugs.
    
            Equally important in the continuing battle over abortion rights, if the decision stands, it would diminish access to abortion even in states that currently allow it. When the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization last summer, the narrow majority emphasized that they were removing judges from the business of abortion regulation and returning the issue to the individual states.
    
            Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the apparent key fifth vote in favor of that decision, wrote a separate statement, declaring that judges would no longer decide “difficult moral and policy questions” related to abortion.
    
            “To be clear, then,” Kavanaugh added, “the Court’s decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States. On the contrary, the Court’s decision properly leaves the question of abortion for the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process.”
    
            To try to preserve abortion in their states and ensure no retrenchment on current FDA protocols for medication abortion, Washington state and 16 other Democratic-run states, along with the District of Columbia, had separately sued the FDA to prevent it from adding new restrictions to the dispensing of mifepristone.
    
             Acting last Friday soon after Kacsmaryk in the Texas-based FDA challenge, US District Judge Thomas Rice issued an order that would prevent the FDA from changing rules that would affect the availability of mifepristone in the 18 jurisdictions that were part of the litigation.
    
            The decision from Kacsmaryk’s Amarillo courtroom more urgently drew the attention of Biden administration lawyers, drug manufacturers and abortion rights advocates.
    
            Abortion opponents, too, view the case as a prime battleground for further reducing women’s opportunities to end a pregnancy. The challengers, a group of anti-abortion physicians and medical groups, had specifically sought out Kacsmaryk’s court for their lawsuit. A 2019 appointee of former President Donald Trump, the judge previously worked as a deputy general counsel at the First Liberty Institute, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group.
    
            In his 67-page decision Friday, Kacsmaryk demonstrated frustration, bordering on contempt, for the FDA process. He also revealed his abhorrence for abortion. In describing how mifepristone works, he said it “blocks the hormone progesterone, halts nutrition, and ultimately starves the unborn human until death.”
    
            He observed in a footnote that jurists often use the word “fetus” in opinions – as in fact the Supreme Court did in its Dobbs decision – but that he was favoring “unborn human” or “unborn child.”
    
            Any abortion-rights dilemma is bound to incite religious and cultural passions, along with profound questions about a woman’s right to make the deeply personal decisions related to a pregnancy.
    
            The new abortion medication dispute now moving up through appellate courts, however, centers on important but dry issues of legal standing, the deadline for filing a lawsuit against the FDA and whether, if the merits of the case are reached, the agency’s actions were arbitrary and capricious.
    
            DOJ lawyers have argued that the medical groups challenging the FDA lack standing to sue because they have no actual injury and offer baseless speculation regarding harms to women and the medical profession from mifepristone.
    
            Denying that contention, Kacsmaryk found that the groups had standing based on numerous grounds, including that they allege “adverse events from chemical abortion drugs can overwhelm the medical system and place enormous pressure and stress on doctors during emergencies and complications.” 
    
            The heart of his decision was a full-scale rejection of the safety of medication abortion to a woman, physically and psychologically.
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. The risk of death by penicillin, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. 
    
            Kacsmaryk contended, however, the FDA had failed to consider “the intense psychological trauma and post-traumatic stress women often experience from chemical abortion.” He maintained that use of the drug had caused many more deaths and severe adverse reactions than the FDA had acknowledged. 
    
            The DOJ lawyers said Kacsmaryk cherry-picked dubious materials to support his position, and some doctors were quick to try to refute the judge’s medical conclusions.
    
            Dr. Courtney Schreiber, a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania, warned about the consequences of restricting access to mifepristone in a declaration attached to the drug manufacturer’s motion to suspend Kacsmaryk’s decision during appeals. 
    
            If access to mifepristone disappears, she said, some facilities may offer just misoprostol – a second medication drug that usually works in concert with mifepristone. That would, she contended, “surely result in more unscheduled visits and emergency room visits for pain, incomplete abortion, and side-effect concerns.”

      Iowa’s attorney general has paused funding for sexual assault victims’ Plan B and abortions
    ","

        5:31 AM EDT, Tue April 11, 2023
    ","
            Iowa’s Attorney General has paused funding for emergency contraception and abortions for sexual assault victims, according to an email Iowa’s Coalition Against Sexual Assault received that was also shared with CNN.
    
            The email was sent from Chief Deputy Attorney General Sam Langholz. Attorney General Brenna Bird’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    
            Langholz told the nonprofit that a review of victim’s services is ongoing and the Attorney General has not made a final decision on whether the payments will resume. 
    
            “While not required by Iowa law, the victim compensation fund has previously paid for Plan B and abortions. As a part of her top-down, bottom-up audit of victim assistance, Attorney General Bird is carefully evaluating whether this is an appropriate use of public funds,” Bird’s Press Secretary Alyssa Brouillet said in a statement to the Des Moines Register. “Until that review is complete, payment of these pending claims will be delayed.”
    
            Langholz shared the same statement from Bird’s press secretary in the email obtained by CNN. 
    
            Under the 1979 Iowa Sexual Abuse Examination Payment Program, victims of sexual assault in Iowa are “never responsible for a sexual abuse forensic examination or for medications required due to the assault,” according to Iowa’s Victim Assistance annual report. 
    
            Though it was not explicitly required, it has been the state’s longtime policy to cover the cost of emergency contraception under the victim compensation fund, and in rare cases, the fund has also paid for abortions for rape victims, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the victim assistance division under the previous attorney general, told the Des Moines Register.
    
            After Bird took office, Tibbetts Murphy resigned at request of the new attorney general, the Des Moines Register reported.
    
            Funds for the program are entirely made up of fines and penalties paid by convicted criminals, rather than general taxpayer money – a point victim advocacy groups emphasize. 
    
            “Victims of rape and child abuse have an acute need for timely access to health services, including contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy and abortion care. Cost should never be a barrier for rape victims seeking medical care,” Iowa’s Coalition Against Sexual Assault said in a statement Monday, urging the attorney general to continue the payments to sexual assault victims. “Using offender accountability victim compensation funds to cover the cost of forensic exams, incentivizes victims to undergo an invasive exam that can help prevent offenders from victimizing others and enhance access to medical care for crime victims.” 
    
            Ruth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, called Bird’s decision “deplorable and reprehensible,” saying it “further demonstrates politicians’ crusade against Iowans’ health and rights,” according to a statement. 
    
            Bird, a Republican, won her election in 2022 in a race that largely focused on abortion after her Democratic opponent declined to defend Iowa’s “fetal heartbeat” law, which would ban most abortions after about six weeks. 
    
            During her campaign, Bird said, “I am pro-life and I will defend the laws that are passed by the Legislature.” 
    
            Iowa’s Coalition Against Sexual Assault says that ensuring victims are not responsible for the cost of a forensic exam or for needed medications after an assault is “key to encouraging victims to undergo this extremely invasive medical exam as soon as possible after a violent assault.”

      Access to reproductive health care has become more challenging for women in the US, study shows

            As abortion rights become more restricted in the United States, a new study shows that it’s become harder for women to access reproductive health care services more broadly – such as routine screenings and birth control – in recent years.
    
            Women seeking reproductive health care were more likely to report challenges to access – and more of them – in 2021 than they were in 2017, according to the study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open. Researchers analyzed survey data from thousands of women who were asked to reflect on their experiences with reproductive health care in the three years leading up to the study.
    
            About 45% of women experienced at least one barrier to reproductive health care services in 2021, up 10% from 2017. Nearly 19% reported at least three barriers in 2021, up from 16% in 2017. 
    
            “Reproductive health care services are among the most common health care needs of women of reproductive age, and access to such care is of paramount public health importance,” the researchers wrote. Delaying or forgoing it can have serious consequences, both to an individual’s physical health and to their general well-being. 
    
            The most commonly cited barrier in both years was finding a physician or clinic that felt comfortable to the patient. About 1 in 4 women identified this as a challenge in 2021, up from about 1 in 5 in 2017. 
    
            Cost became slightly less of a barrier in that timeframe, but interpersonal relationships and logistical challenges such as finding transportation or child care became more challenging. 
    
            The Covid-19 pandemic probably contributed to these shifts, according to the researchers. Fear of contracting the virus could have heightened anxieties around visiting a health care setting, for example. The child care crisis has been exacerbated in recent years, which could limit travel flexibilities. On the other hand, stimulus checks may have helped ease some financial barriers. 
    
            Broader restrictions on reproductive rights – including a significant cut in federally funded family planning clinics by the Trump administration – probably also played a role, they wrote. 
    
            The largest increases in barriers to reproductive health care were reported by individuals from historically disadvantaged populations, including low-income and Hispanic women. 
    
            Access to reproductive health care is a “persistent and pressing barrier,” the researchers wrote. “Significant” challenges that existed in 2017 generally got worse in 2021. 
    
            “The study’s findings suggest that efforts are needed to ensure reproductive health care access, especially during disruptive events,” they wrote.

      Justice Department and abortion pill manufacturer ask appeals court to freeze judge’s order that could make drug unavailable after Friday

    ","
            The Justice Department and a manufacturer of medication abortion drugs asked a federal appeals court on Monday to put on hold a judge’s ruling that could make the drug unavailable nationwide after Friday.
    
            The requests, filed on Monday before the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, are seeking a short-term administrative stay as well as a long-term stay pending appeal on a lower court ruling from US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who ordered the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug to be suspended. The court said Monday that the plaintiffs in the case must respond by Tuesday night before midnight.
    
            An administrative stay would give the appellate court more breathing room to consider whether Kacsmaryk’s ruling should be frozen while the litigation plays out. The Justice Department and Danco, a manufacturer of the drug mifepristone that intervened in the case to defend the FDA’s approval in 2000, had both already filed notices of appeal.
    
            Kacsmaryk said his Friday night order would not go into effect for seven days to give the Justice Department time to appeal. 
    
            The Justice Department is asking for the 5th Circuit to act on its emergency request by noon on Thursday, “to enable the government to seek relief in the Supreme Court if necessary.”
    
            The department’s lawyers told the appeals court that if Kacsmaryk’s ruling were to go into effect, it “would thwart FDA’s scientific judgment and severely harm women, particularly those for whom mifepristone is a medical or practical necessity.”
    
            “This harm would be felt throughout the country, given that mifepristone has lawful uses in every State,” the DOJ filing said. “The order would undermine healthcare systems and the reliance interests of businesses and medical providers. In contrast, plaintiffs present no evidence that they will be injured at all, much less irreparably harmed, by maintaining the status quo they left unchallenged for years.” 
    
            Danco similarly told the appeals court that if Kacsmaryk’s order wasn’t frozen, it “is certain to cause irreparable harm: to women who will lose access to the medication abortion regimen that is the standard of care; to Danco; to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries; and to the separation of powers undergirding judicial and regulatory action.”
    
            Kacsmaryk’s order in a case brought in Texas by anti-abortion rights activists is seemingly at odds with another federal court ruling handed down less than an hour later in a separate case on the other side of the country.
    
            That second order said that the FDA must maintain the drug’s availability in 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia, which sued to make abortion pills easier to obtain. In that case, US District Judge Thomas O. Rice said the FDA could not do anything that would reduce the availability of the drug in the 18 jurisdictions that brought the lawsuit.
    
            The Justice Department has not said yet whether it will appeal Rice’s order. On Monday, the Justice Department asked Rice to clarify how FDA should comply with his order if Kacsmaryk’s ruling is allowed to go into effect, with a filing that pointed to a “significant tension” between the two rulings. 
    
            Mifepristone is the first pill in the two-pill process to terminate a pregnancy. Medication abortion makes up the majority of abortions in the United States.
    
            With its latest 5th Circuit filing, the Justice Department argued that the district court upended the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, “depriving patients of access to this safe and effective treatment, based on the court’s own misguided assessment of the drug’s safety.”
    
            “The district court took this extraordinary step despite the fact that plaintiffs did not seek relief for many years after mifepristone’s original approval, waited nearly a year after the most recent FDA actions they seek to challenge, and then asked the court to defer any relief until after a final resolution of the case,” the DOJ wrote.
    
            The Justice Department described Kacsmaryk’s order as “extraordinary and unprecedented.”
    
            Meanwhile, Danco characterized the Friday ruling as “an unprecedented judicial assault on a careful regulatory process that has served the public for decades.”
    
            Danco’s filing included declarations from two prominent doctors who have sworn under oath about the safety of mifepristone and warn that their patients will be “irreparably harmed” if the district court order is allowed to go into effect.
    
            One declaration comes from Dr. Courtney Schreiber, a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania.
    
            She said that some patients are unable to have procedural abortion – the other method of terminating a pregnancy – due to their anatomy and that others may have to weigh whether to have a “re-traumatizing pelvic exam” and procedure or continue an “unwanted pregnancy as a result of rape to term.”
    
            Schreiber underscored that some of her patients will believe that “abortion is no longer available or unsafe.”
    
            Some facilities, she said, may offer just misoprostol, a second medication drug that usually works in concert with mifepristone. Such a move would “surely result in more unscheduled visits and emergency room visits for pain, incomplete abortion, and side-effect concerns,” she said.
    
            “Restricted access to this safe therapeutic threatens the health of real people – people who are mothers, sisters, daughters, wives and friends – in our country,” Schreiber said.
    
            Another declaration was signed by Alisa Goldberg, the director of the Family Planning Fellowship and Associate Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School. She is currently an attending physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and has prescribed mifepristone through the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts.
    
            Goldberg says she “personally” prescribes mifepristone to approximately 10 patients a month, all of whom she sees in-person. She says she has tracked adverse events due to mifepristone and that less than 1% of patients report any sort of serious adverse event from a medication abortion.
    
            She said that surgical abortions are less available, in part, because the procedure requires an appropriate space, a team including a doctor, multiple nurses and medical assistants, and typically a three-to-four hour visit.
    
            “I am concerned that if a stay is not issued, more of my patients likely will end up unable to obtain necessary and desired reproductive health care in a timely fashion,” Goldberg said.

      Next phase in the medication abortion fight will be a quick-moving legal battle

    ","
            A seven-day clock is ticking for the Biden administration and higher courts to address an untenable situation around medication abortion – one created by rival federal court rulings from judges in separate corners of the country.
    
            While it’s not unusual for lower courts to disagree on major legal questions, the contradicting orders that came down Friday – within less than an hour of each other – marked the most high-pitched legal battle over abortion access since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            The Justice Department and a manufacturer of medication abortion drugs asked a federal appeals court on Monday to put on hold an order halting the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, the first drug used in the medication abortion process.
    
            The requests, filed on Monday before the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, are seeking a short-term administrative stay as well as a long-term stay pending appeal on a lower court ruling from US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who ordered the FDA’s approval of the drug to be suspended.
    
            The Justice Department is asking for the 5th Circuit to act on its emergency request by noon Thursday, “to enable the government to seek relief in the Supreme Court if necessary.”
    
            US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told CNN on Sunday that the administration intended to do everything it could to ensure that women have access to abortion pills “not just in a week – but moving forward, period.”
    
            He said that “everything is on the table,” when asked if the FDA could ignore the ruling – a comment later walked back by a department spokesperson. 
    
            In the case in question, a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion activists in Texas, a judge said Friday that he was suspending the longstanding approval of the drug, but delayed his order by seven days to give the government time to seek a higher court’s intervention.
    
            Less than an hour later, a federal judge in Washington state – who is overseeing a lawsuit brought by state Democratic attorneys general seeking to expand access to abortion pills – issued an order barring the FDA from taking any steps to reduce the drug’s availability. That order applies in the 18 jurisdictions that brought the lawsuit, but would seem to conflict with the Texas order, which applies nationwide.
    
            Mifepristone was approved by the FDA nearly 23 years ago and medication abortion makes up the majority of abortions in the United States. Leading medical organizations have vehemently pushed back on the Texas judge’s assertions that the drug is unsafe.
    
            Regardless of the exact procedural route, the next couple of days stand to be dramatic, and feature a flurry of court filings and high-stakes decisions that might be handed down with only limited explanation.
    
            Even without the rival ruling from the judge in Washington state, Kacsmaryk’s decision to halt the 2000 approval is an unprecedented move, and one – if allowed to go into effect – that will inject significant uncertainty and confusion into what is already a tumultuous legal landscape around abortion.
    
            The DOJ has not indicated how it will respond to the order from the Washington judge, US District Judge Thomas O. Rice. The department may be inclined to appeal it, so to wipe away a court order that also inserted a judge into FDA decision-making. But the department may opt to forgo emergency litigation over whether Rice’s order should be paused in the meantime. 
    
            On Monday, the Justice Department asked Rice to clarify how FDA should comply with his order if Kacsmaryk’s ruling is allowed to go into effect, with a filing that pointed to a “significant tension” between the two rulings. It’s asking Rice to clarify his ruling by Friday, ahead of when the Kacsmaryk order is scheduled to take affect absent an intervention from a higher court.
    
            As even anti-abortion rights activists who brought the case have had to acknowledge, it is unprecedented for a federal judge to ordered a drug off the market that’s been approved for decades.
    
            If Kacmsaryk’s ruling goes into effect, it raises a bevy of questions about how the order is supposed to be implemented, particularly while the FDA is under the separate judicial command to not reduce the drug’s availability in a large swath of the county. 
    
            Kacsmaryk’s opinion did not add clarity to this question. He is invoking a legal mechanism to halt the drug’s approval that was not among the remedies the plaintiffs were seeking. 
    
            One major question is how providers, distributors and manufacturers who were not party to the Texas case should respond to the order. 
    
            While mifepristone manufacturer Danco intervened as a defendant in the case, the other major manufacturer, GenBioPro, did not and is not a party in the litigation. GenBioPro said in a statement about the ruling Friday night it is “reviewing the court’s order in detail.”
    
            “Nothing in the court’s order changes the decades of science and evidence regarding mifepristone’s safety and efficacy,” GenBioPro CEO Evan Masingill said in the statement. “As we review the court’s order, we will continue to make our product available. We will take any steps necessary to lawfully make mifepristone available and accessible to as many people as possible in the country.” 
    
            Legal experts have told CNN that, without any direction from the FDA otherwise, providers and distributors have no obligation to stop prescribing and dispensing mifepristone for abortions. A medication abortion regimen of only misoprostol – the second drug in the FDA-approved process – is also a potential option for providers to prescribe to patients seeking to terminate their pregnancies. 
    
            But the confusion and uncertainty about the effects of Kacsmaryk’s order stand to have a chilling effect on providers and patients. 
    
            Providers are already telling CNN that, even though Kacsmaryk’s ruling is not into effect, they’re changing the care and counsel they’re offering patients. 
    
            Against this backdrop, some Democrats are calling on the Biden administration to ignore the FDA’s ruling.
    
            “I believe that the Biden administration should ignore this ruling,” Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told CNN on Friday. “The courts have the legitimacy and they rely on the legitimacy of their rulings, and what they are currently doing is engaged in an unprecedented and dramatic erosion of the legitimacy of the courts.” 
    
            Legal experts have argued that FDA has the option to issue non-enforcement guidance that could provide some solace to providers and others in the drug’s supply chain, but it’s unclear whether the agency is considering that option.
    
            The administration has so far emphasized its fight against the ruling will be a legal response through the appeals in court.

      Republican congresswoman says FDA should ignore ruling suspending abortion drug approval

            A Republican congresswoman who represents a swing district in South Carolina urged the Food and Drug Administration on Monday to ignore a recent ruling by a federal judge suspending the approval of a medication drug used for abortion.
    
            “This is an FDA-approved drug. I support the usage of FDA-approved drugs, even if we might disagree,” Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “This Morning.” “It’s not up to us to decide as legislators or even, you know, as the court system that whether or not this is the right drug to use or not.”
    
            Mace considers herself “pro-life,” as does virtually every Republican office-holder on the national level. But in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, the party has had to navigate a political landscape in which harsh restrictions on the procedure have proven politically unpopular.
    
            “This is an issue that Republicans have been largely on the wrong side of,” Mace continued. “We have, over the last nine months, not shown compassion towards women, and this is one of those issues that I’ve tried to lead on as someone who’s ‘pro-life’ and just have some common sense.”
    
            Mace’s comments on Monday align her with a position expressed by progressive Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who on Friday called for the ruling to be ignored, saying that if it was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court, “it would essentially institute a national abortion ban.” But several Republicans, including Rep. Tony Gonzalez on CNN, have fiercely pushed back on the suggestion to ignore the ruling.
    
            “Everybody’s welcome to their own opinion,” Mace said Monday. “I represent a very purple district that is really a bellwether for the rest of the country. And I can tell you, far more than the vast majority of 60-70% of Americans are not going to agree with this decision. And there are many pro-life people that, also while they’re pro-life, they don’t want the government to intervene in this radical of a manner, and the FDA has a rigorous process.”
    
            On Friday, District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk issued a ruling to halt the decades-old approval of mifepristone, but he paused the ruling from taking effect for a week so it could be appealed, a process that is underway. With a pause leaving the ruling on hold amid appeal, lawmakers have been in flux. 
    
            In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra would not say whether he believes the FDA should ignore the ruling and keep the drug on the market, but he maintained that the Biden administration is considering all options. 
    
            But HHS spokesperson Kamara Jones later attempted to walk back Becerra’s response.
    
            “People are rightly frustrated about this decision — but as dangerous a precedent it sets for a court to disregard FDA’s expert judgment regarding a drug’s safety and efficacy, it would also set a dangerous precedent for the administration to disregard a binding decision.” 
    
            Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told “CNN This Morning” on Monday that ignoring the ban “just throws us into another level of chaos that I don’t want to know where that ends up.”

      Texas judge’s abortion ruling ignites new showdown that could harm Republicans

    ","
            A single conservative judge in Texas has provoked sudden health care and legal chaos by effectively halting the nationwide use of a popular abortion drug by the end of the week.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s decision to suspend the Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug mifepristone, which has been used safely for more than 20 years, marked an extraordinary use of judicial power in the face of scientific data and is likely to force the Supreme Court to take up abortion again, a year after it overturned Roe v. Wade.
    
            His ruling on Friday, which he paused for a week to allow appeals, also represented a judicial intervention into the health care decisions of millions of American women and could effectively make abortion unavailable in many states if it goes into force. The Biden administration is already mobilizing to thwart the judge’s audacious move after lodging an appeal. 
    
            But the ruling is causing sharp political reverberations amid criticism from health care regulators and providers. The situation is complicated because less than an hour later, a judge in Washington state issued a dueling ruling requiring the government to keep the drug available in 18 liberal jurisdictions that had sued to expand access to abortion pills. Politically, this latest resurgence of abortion politics will raise fears among Republicans that the party’s rigid anti-abortion line could provoke a backlash – and it’s already giving Democrats a powerful new example to mobilize voters heading into 2024. 
    
            The intensity of the storm Kacsmaryk whipped up was evident in heated rhetoric between Republicans and Democrats on Sunday. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra vowed that women would have safe and effective medication available after the administration launched a legal appeal to stop the suspension from going into force on Friday.
    
            “For America’s sake and for women’s sake, we have to prevail in this,” Becerra told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    
            New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the ruling an “extreme abuse of power” on the same show. And in a sign of a growing constitutional tangle, she suggested the FDA could effectively ignore it on the grounds that it was a “mockery of our democracy, and a mockery of our law.” 
    
            Ocasio-Cortez won unusual support from across the aisle when GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina said on “CNN This Morning” Monday that she agreed with her colleague from New York. 
    
            “It’s not up to us to decide as legislators, or even as a court system, whether or not this is the right drug to use or not,” Mace told Kaitlan Collins. “This is an FDA-approved drug. Whether you agree with its usage or not, that is not your decision. That is the FDA’s decision.”
    
            Mace also recognized her own party’s problems on the abortion issue. “This is one of those issues that I’ve tried to lead on as someone who’s pro-life and just have some common sense. We are getting it wrong on this issue. We’ve got to show compassion to women, especially to women who’ve been raped. We’ve got to show compassion on the abortion issue, because by and large, most of Americans aren’t with us on this issue.”
    
            But Texas Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales told CNN’s Bash that his party could use its House majority to punish the FDA if the agency took such a step. “If the administration wants to … not live up to this ruling, then we’re going to have a problem,” he said. “It may come (to) a point where House Republicans on the appropriation side have to defund FDA programs that don’t make sense.” 
    
            Such a move could severely impede a critical arm of the American health care system and deepen acrimony surrounding the regulatory approval process, which was attacked by conservatives amid skepticism of the Covid-19 vaccine.
    
            Gonzales also blithely dismissed concerns of women who will fear they can no longer get mifepristone and anger over the removal of a constitutional right to make decisions about one’s own reproductive health. His comment was exactly the kind of controversial statement that has contributed to Republicans’ struggles with female voters.
    
            “It’s important that we have real discussions on women’s health care and … get off the abortion conversation,” Gonzales told Bash. “Women have a whole lot more other issues than just abortion. Let’s have those real conversations, and let’s talk about the other things that are happening in this world.”
    
            The new front in the abortion battle will only intensify national political tumult, which is also being fueled by showdowns over guns, a building debt-ceiling clash and Donald Trump’s recent indictment. But the ruling by Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by the ex-president, stirred up some potentially intractable controversies. 
    
            — It set up a legal collision that seems destined to end up at the Supreme Court. There is the question over whether the judge overstepped his power to halt the FDA’s approval for mifepristone – a key resource given that half of US abortions are performed using medication. And the Washington judge’s ruling sets up the kind of dueling interpretations of law only the Supreme Court can resolve. 
    
            — The idea that a single judge in a conservative state could potentially change the health care options of millions of Americans sets up an extraordinary constitutional situation. It also flies in the face of the reasoning advanced by the conservative majority Supreme Court and anti-abortion rights advocates – that the procedure’s availability should be determined by legislatures in individual states.
    
            — Kacsmaryk’s ruling also threatens to create problems for the approval of future drugs or to open the way to legal challenges for existing drugs. And it is another sign of a prominent conservative figure substituting his own lack of scientific expertise for that of doctors and the rigor of clinical trials. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the FDA. The risk of death from the use of penicillin is four times greater. 
    
            Kacsmaryk, however, argued that the FDA had “entirely failed to consider the psychological effects of the drug or an evaluation of its long term-term medical consequences.” American Medical Association President Jack Resneck, Jr. criticized the judge’s “disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation.” He added: “By rejecting medical facts, the court has intruded into the exam room and has intervened in decisions that belong to patients and physicians.”
    
            — The resurgence of the abortion debate may be unwelcome news for Republicans. The overturning of Roe v. Wade last year turned out to be a motivating factor for Democratic voters in the midterm elections. According to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted last July, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, nearly two-thirds of Americans disapproved of the decision. And just last week, abortion was also a key issue in a Wisconsin election that handed control of the state Supreme Court to liberals. 
    
            The decision by Kacsmaryk, a long-time opponent of abortion rights, is the latest occasion where a high-profile member of the conservative movement has launched a daring application of power in a way that Democrats argue trashes legal and democratic convention. Previous examples include the Republican majority’s expulsion of two Black state legislators from the Tennessee state House last week after they joined a gun control protest in the chamber; attempts by some conservative states to curtail voting access; and even Trump’s bid to overturn the 2020 election.

      Why Republicans are in trouble: Trump and the abortion issue aren’t going away

            Donald Trump is now in a stronger position to win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination than he has been in months as his party rallies around him following his indictment by a New York grand jury on business fraud charges.
    
            But actual results on the ground continue to suggest that the former president may not be good for the Republican brand among the general electorate.
    
            On the day of Trump’s arraignment in Manhattan on Tuesday, Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz celebrated victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election as liberals won control of the high court in the ultimate swing state.
    
            That result is just part of a larger story in which Democrats and Democratic-backed candidates across the nation have been performing better in elections this year than Joe Biden did in their states or districts in 2020. And it potentially portends well for Democrats’ 2024 fortunes.
    
            The result in Wisconsin sums up the Republican problem. Biden won the state by less than a point in 2020, after Trump had carried it by a similar margin four years earlier. The Badger State is one of a handful that has voted for the winner in the last four presidential elections, and it is one of few that has a US senator of each party.
    
            Protasiewicz’s 11-point winning margin over her Republican opponent is a relative blowout compared with Biden’s 2020 performance in Wisconsin.
    
            We can also see the Democratic overperformance in Wisconsin in another Tuesday election, this one a state Senate election in the Milwaukee area. While not spoken about anywhere near as much as the state Supreme Court race, Republicans needed to hold the open seat to win a supermajority in the state Senate.
    
            The Republican candidate did win, but only by 2 points. This marked a 3-point overperformance for the Democratic nominee as Biden lost the district by 5 points in 2020.
    
            The Wisconsin results match up well with what we’ve seen so far in 2023 special election across the country. 
    
            In the lone federal special election so far this year, Democrat Jennifer McCllean outperformed Biden’s 2020 margin in Virginia’s 4th Congressional District by 13 points.
    
            In the average of nearly 20 special state legislative elections, Democrats have done about 4 points better than Biden’s margin, on average.
    
            The president, of course, won the 2020 election, so the fact that the political environment looks to be better for Democrats now than it was then is a good sign for his party.
    
            It also marks a big difference with what we saw in 2019 when Democrats in special elections were nearly on par with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 margins. That came after Democrats overperformed Clinton in the 2018 midterms. It was a signal that the 2020 elections might be close.
    
            What makes the Democrats’ strong showings this year especially odd is that they are occurring with Biden’s approval rating stuck in the low 40s. Normally, you wouldn’t expect an unpopular president’s party to do so well in off-year elections.
    
            This suggests that the factors currently at play are similar to those in the latter half of 2022. Following the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade halfway through the year, Democrats started to outdo Biden’s 2020 margins in districts that held special elections.
    
            And Democrats had a historically exceptional night in the November midterms. They more than held their own, despite Biden’s approval rating being well south of 50%.
    
            The midterm exit polls revealed that many voters who didn’t like Biden or Trump voted Democratic. Almost all the key races in the states that will likely decide the presidency in 2024 went Democratic. Put another way, Biden wasn’t the deciding factor you might have expected him to be among swing voters. Trump factored into their vote too, even though he wasn’t president.
    
            Neither abortion nor Trump seem to be going away as an issue in 2023.
    
            Abortion was at the forefront of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, with liberals hoping that a win by Protasiewicz would provide them with a majority to legalize the procedure statewide.
    
            And Trump remains the clear favorite for the GOP nomination for president, despite his indictment and continuing unpopularity among the general electorate.
    
            If those things don’t change going into 2024, Republicans may be in big trouble.

      HHS secretary says ‘everything is on the table’ in response to medication abortion ruling
    ","

    ","
            Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Sunday said “everything is on the table” following a Texas federal judge’s ruling to suspend the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the medication abortion drug mifepristone.
    
            In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” the secretary would not say whether he believes the FDA should ignore the ruling and keep the drug on the market, but he maintained that the Biden administration is considering all options.
    
            “We want the courts to overturn this reckless decision,” Becerra said, adding that there was a “good chance” of Supreme Court intervention but declining to say how, exactly, the administration will handle the ruling in the interim. 
    
            “Everything is on the table. The president said that way back when the Dobbs decision came out. Every option is on the table,” the secretary told Bash, referring to last year’s Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.
    
            But an HHS spokesperson later Sunday tried to walk back Becerra’s response to suggestions that the FDA should ignore the ruling.
    
            “People are rightly frustrated about this decision — but as dangerous a precedent it sets for a court to disregard FDA’s expert judgment regarding a drug’s safety and efficacy, it would also set a dangerous precedent for the Administration to disregard a binding decision,” HHS spokesperson Kamara Jones tweeted. 
    
            New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one of the Democrats pushing that approach. In a separate appearance on “State of the Union,” she did not back away from her call Friday on CNN for the ruling to be ignored, saying that if it was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court, “it would essentially institute a national abortion ban.”
    
            “I do not believe that the courts have the authority over the FDA that they just asserted, and I do believe that it creates a crisis,” she told Bash.
    
            Ocasio-Cortez called the ruling “an extreme abuse of power” and said there was precedent for the executive branch ignoring court rulings. 
    
            “I do think that when it comes to gaming out what the very real possibilities are in the coming days, weeks and months, this is not just about speculation, but this is about preparation. And the reality of our courts right now is very disturbing,” she said. 
    
            Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas warned in a separate interview with Bash on Sunday that House GOP appropriators could defund certain FDA programs if the ruling is ultimately ignored. 
    
            “The House Republicans have the power of the purse, and if the administration wants to not lead this ruling, not live up to this ruling, then we’re going to have a problem,” the second-term lawmaker said. “And it may come a point where House Republicans on the appropriation side have to defund FDA programs that don’t make sense.”
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk on Friday issued a ruling to halt the decades-old approval of mifepristone, but he paused the ruling from taking effect for a week so it could be appealed, a process that is underway.  
    
            “This is not America,” Becerra said Sunday. “What you saw is that one judge in that one court in that one state, that’s not America. America goes by the evidence. America does what’s fair. America does what is transparent, and we can show that what we do is for the right reasons. That’s not America.”
    
            Within an hour of the ruling Friday, a different federal judge ruled in favor of 17 Democratic-led states and Washington, DC, looking to expand access to the abortion pill, allowing them to keep the drug available.
    
            Becerra on Sunday touted the proven safety of the drug, a factor that Kacsmaryk questioned in his ruling. He confirmed that the Department of Justice had already filed its appeal and is waiting for its day in court.
    
            Still, Becerra had little to say about what tangible preparations the administration would take to secure access to abortion should the drug no longer be available after the weeklong pause.
    
            “Well, [women] certainly have access today, and we intend to do everything to make sure it’s available for them not just in a week but moving forward, period,” Becerra told Bash when asked if women would have access to the medication after this week.
    
            The Justice Department and Danco, a mifepristone manufacturer that intervened in the case to defend the approval, have both filed notices of appeal. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Danco said in statements that in addition to the appeals, they will seek “stays” of the ruling, meaning emergency requests that the decision remains frozen while the appeal moves forward.
    
            They’re appealing to the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which is sometimes said to be the country’s most conservative appellate court. Yet some legal scholars are skeptical that the 5th Circuit, as conservative as it is, would let Kacmsaryk’s order take effect.
    
            “I got to believe that, Dana, an appeals court, the Supreme Court, whatever court has to understand that this ruling by this one judge overturns not just access to mifepristone, but possibly any number of drugs,” Becerra said.

      Meet the judge who ruled medication abortion must remain available in some states

            What initially looked like an outright victory for anti-abortion activists Friday evening soon became more complicated. 
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, first ruled Friday that the Food and Drug Administration’s 2000 approval of mifepristone – one of the drugs used to terminate a pregnancy – needed to be halted. 
    
            But less than an hour after Kacsmaryk’s ruling, US District Judge Thomas Owen Rice of the Eastern District of Washington, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, ordered the federal government to keep the drug available in 17 states plus the District of Columbia. 
    
            Because the decisions out of the two courts are so contradictory, intervention from the US Supreme Court is a real possibility. 
    
            In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about Rice. 
    
            Rice was appointed to the Eastern District of Washington in 2011 by Obama. He was confirmed to the position by the US Senate in a 93-4 vote in 2012.
    
            He had served as an assistant US attorney in Washington state starting in 1987. In that role, he focused on issues related to eminent domain and Social Security claims. Prior to that, Rice was a trial attorney in the tax division of the US Department of Justice, where he specialized in abusive tax shelter litigation. 
    
            Rice previously sided with an abortion rights group. In 2018, he issued a permanent injunction that blocked the Trump administration from stopping grants to a Planned Parenthood program that funded teen pregnancy prevention programs around the country. 
    
            That case was brought against the Trump administration by Planned Parenthood after the administration ended Teen Pregnancy Prevention grants earlier than they were supposed to end for 81 organizations across the US, claiming they had been unsuccessful. 
    
            “The Court determines that the public interest weighs in favor of (Planned Parenthood), as it would prevent harm to the community … and prevent loss of data regarding the effectiveness of teen pregnancy prevention,” Rice wrote at the time.  
    
            When residents of Yakima, Washington, sued the city, claiming its “at-large” seats on the City Council prevented Latinos from electing members who represented their Latino-majority community, Rice ruled that the election system violated the Voting Rights Act. 
    
            “The existing record, undisputed in all material respects, supports only one rational conclusion: that under the totality of the circumstances, City Council elections are not ‘equally open to participation’ by Latino voters,” Rice said in his 2014 Montes v. City of Yakima decision. “The numbered post system, with its effective majority vote requirement, places Latino voters at a steep mathematical disadvantage, even when their voting strength is perfectly optimized.”
    
            In recent weeks, Rice has presided over cases related to a federal firearm offense, assault of a federal officer with a deadly weapon, and fraudulently obtained Covid-19 relief funds.
    
            Rice’s response to lawmakers during his confirmation hearing offered a glimpse into how he thinks as a judge and how he would view the decisions of higher courts. 
    
            When asked by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa if he was committed to following the precedents of higher courts “faithfully and giving them full force and effect, even if you personally disagree with such precedents,” Rice responded “yes.”
    
            Rice was also asked which sources and guiding principles he would use in deciding cases of first impression if there were no controlling precedents that “dispositively concluded an issue” before him. 
    
            “I would first turn to the plain meaning of the words of the statute,” the judge responded. “If necessary, I would seek to determine the context and intent of Congress. I would also look to analogous cases from the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for guidance. If no other similar cases were available, I would consult other federal court decisions that considered the issue or like issues.”
    
            Rice also said he would “apply binding Supreme Court and Court of Appeals precedent without regard to my personal judgment” when he was asked what he would do if he thought the Supreme Court or the court of appeals had “seriously erred in rendering a decision,” and if he would either apply that decision or use his “own judgment of the merits, or your best judgment of the merits.”
    
            Following Kacsmaryk’s ruling in Texas, the Justice Department and a mifepristone manufacturer have filed notices of appeal. They are appealing in the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considered the country’s most conservative appeals court.
    
            Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department was still reviewing Rice’s ruling in Washington.

      Democrats slam Texas abortion ruling as Republicans mostly go quiet

    ","
            A conservative Texas judge on Friday put a dent in the blue wall of abortion rights protections, issuing an order that could suspend approval of a drug used in medication abortions by women across the country – including in states with robust protections in place.
    
            The decision from District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk could represent the biggest blow to abortion rights in the US since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. That ruling upended the 2022 midterm elections, prompting a backlash that helped Democrats outperform expectations at almost every level of government.
    
            Kacsmaryk paused his ruling for seven days to allow the federal government to appeal, an opportunity the Justice Department, joined by the drug manufacturer, quickly said it would take. President Joe Biden slammed the decision, calling it “another unprecedented step in taking away basic freedoms from women and putting their health at risk” and warning that the Food and Drug Administration’s mission now risked being undermined by “political, ideological attacks.”
    
            Further complicating the matter, another federal judge, in Washington state, ruled Friday that the US Food and Drug Administration could not restrict access to the drug, mifepristone, in a separate lawsuit brought by Democratic state attorneys general.
    
            The conflicting federal court decisions have likely produced a legal stalemate that will end up before the US Supreme Court. But the political fallout is already coming into focus, with Democrats at every level of government warning that the Trump-appointed Texas judge’s ruling is both gravely unjust and another step by anti-abortion Republicans in their quest to outlaw the procedure nationwide.
    
            This long-brewing judicial clash comes just days after voters in Wisconsin flipped a state Supreme Court seat, and control of the bench, to favor liberals in a historically expensive election that largely hinged on the future of abortion rights in the state – and as political leaders in swing states around the country calculate its implications ahead of the 2024 elections.
    
            “This does not just affect women in Texas,” Biden said Friday, “if it stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the medication, regardless of whether abortion is legal in a state.
    
            On Friday evening, Democrats and allied abortion advocates quickly lashed out at the Amarillo-based Texas court and a judge that the plaintiffs, led by an anti-abortion group, sought because of his previously stated opposition to abortion rights.
    
            “Today’s unprecedented decision threatens the rights of women nationwide to make decisions about their health care and the ability to access medication prescribed to them by their doctors,” Vice President Kamala Harris said. “Simply put: this decision undermines the FDA’s ability to approve safe and effective medications—from chemotherapy drugs, to asthma medicine, to blood pressure pills, to insulin—based on science, not politics.” 
            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday echoed the vice president’s comments, calling the ruling an “awful, extreme and unprecedented decision.”
    
            “Let’s be clear, this is about the Republicans’ goal of a nationwide abortion ban,” the New York Democrat said on a call with reporters. “This is about stripping away health care for millions of Americans, and this is about MAGA Republicans using the courts to enact an extreme agenda that is wildly unpopular with the American people.”
    
            Schumer said Senate Democrats remain committed to passing the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill aimed at preserving abortion access nationwide. The legislation was blocked in the chamber last year after failing to secure enough votes to break the filibuster. It remains unlikely to pass now with Republicans in control of the House and a slim Democratic majority in the Senate. 
    
            Republicans have been quieter in response, but this latest setback for abortion rights supporters is another sign of the increasingly tight grip conservatives hold on the courts – an issue poised to play an influential role in the 2024 election.
    
            “If there was ever any doubt that GOP extremists want anything other than a ban on all abortion, everywhere, today’s ruling should make it clear that they have no intention of respecting our freedoms,” NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement.
    
            Democratic leaders in many states with abortion protections insisted the Texas court decision would not affect access to mifepristone, though it remains unclear how providers will interpret the opposing rulings.
    
            Ellen Rosenblum, the Democratic attorney general of Oregon, said her office was reviewing the orders but made clear this new front in the legal and political fight over abortion was only just taking shape.
    
            “Don’t be too distracted by the breaking news out of Texas – we got a BIG WIN in the case led by Oregon and Washington (and joined by 16 other states),” Rosenblum tweeted. “The federal judge in the eastern district of Washington JUST granted our request to preserve access to Mifepristone pending the outcome of our case.”
    
            Should Kacsmaryk’s ruling ultimately prevail, it would effectively end the two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process. But even if it falls on appeal, his attempt to overrule medical professionals at the FDA over the use of a drug that has been safely and effectively used for so long marks a fraught new chapter in post-Roe American politics.  
    
            The long-standing national divide was sharpened last June by the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which ended federal protections for women seeking the procedure, allowing Republican state legislators and executives to pass new restrictions or outright bans. It was a landmark victory for conservatives, but also sparked a backlash that damaged Republicans in more moderate or left-leaning states during last year’s midterms.
    
            “Dobbs was supposed to leave abortion laws up to the states. But now, unelected Republican judges are making decisions for every single person in the country. That’s going to motivate voters, especially those who are feeling the impact of these anti-abortion rulings for the first time,” said Danielle Deiseroth, the interim executive director of liberal think tank and pollster Data For Progress.
    
            Voters in Wisconsin on Tuesday made a clear statement on the potency of abortion politics when they elected liberal judge Janet Protasiewicz to the state’s high court. Her victory over a conservative judge aligned with anti-abortion groups all but guaranteed that Democratic Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul’s lawsuit challenging the state’s abortion ban, an issue at the center of his successful 2022 reelection bid, would prevail – a key selling point during the campaign.
    
            “Our state is taking a step forward to a better and brighter future where our rights and freedoms will be protected,” Protasiewicz said in her victory speech this week.
    
            The Texas decision could also bring out new internal dissent within both the Democratic and Republican parties. Some liberal Democrats on Friday night argued that the White House should disregard the order and instruct the FDA to stick to its current position.
    
            “I believe that the Biden administration should ignore this ruling,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN’s Anderson Cooper shortly after it was issued. “What (the courts) are currently doing is engaged in an unprecedented and dramatic erosion of the legitimacy of the courts.”
    
            Ocasio-Cortez also pointed to a statement from Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, who made a similar argument.
    
            “This devastating ruling has no basis in law and will ban the most common method of abortion in EVERY single state,” Wyden tweeted. “President Biden can and must ignore this ruling and keep mifepristone on the market and accessible for every woman in America.”
    
            Biden now risks a row with his own party if he does not take a hard line. His response late Friday was fiery, coming with a promise to “fight this ruling.” But even as he derided it as “the next big step toward the national ban on abortion that Republican elected officials have vowed to make law in America,” Biden did not immediately suggest he would direct the FDA to ignore it.
    
            Republicans could also find themselves at odds with one another as the electoral backlash following Dobbs – the ruling that overturned Roe – becomes more difficult to ignore.
    
            Former President Donald Trump, again a leading candidate for the GOP nomination, has been largely silent about abortion issues. Earlier this year, Trump appeared to blame abortion opponents for the GOP’s weak midterm showing, saying that “people that pushed so hard, for decades, against abortion, got their wish from the US Supreme Court and just plain disappeared, not to be seen again.”
    
            The effects were clearest in Michigan, where a ballot measure to enshrine a right to abortion, contraception and miscarriage management overwhelmingly passed. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – all Democrats – won reelection and Democrats flipped control of the state House and Senate.
    
            Now, though, the measure passed by nearly 57% of voters could be undercut by reduced access to a medication abortion pill, which is used in more than half of US abortions.
    
            “In this particular circumstance, what the (Texas case) plaintiffs asked for is essentially for one single judge in one district of one state to make a decision that is going to affect millions of people in all 50 states,” Nessel recently told CNN. “And that’s incredibly scary.”

      Rival rulings on medication abortion hypercharge the post-Roe legal war
    ","
			By Tierney Sneed, CNN

    ","
            A pair of conflicting federal court rulings on Friday created arguably the most contentious and chaotic legal flashpoint over abortion access since the Supreme Court’s ruling last summer that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the right to an abortion nationwide. 
    
            Within less than an hour, two major rulings came down in separate, closely watched cases concerning medication abortion – in lawsuits that are completely at odds with each other. 
    
            In one case, filed by anti-abortion activists in Texas, a judge said the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone – one of the drugs used to terminate a pregnancy – should be halted. But the court paused its ruling for a week so that it can be appealed, and that appeal is already underway. 
    
            In the second case, where Democratic-led states had sued in Washington to expand access to abortion pills, a  judge ordered the federal government to keep the drug available in the 17 states, plus the District of Columbia, that brought the lawsuit. 
    
            On their face, both cases deal with the administrative law that controls how the US Food and Drug Administration goes about regulating mifepristone. The disputes did not rely directly on the question of whether there is a right to an abortion – the question that was at the center of the Supreme Court’s ruling last June. But tucked in the Texas ruling, by US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, was the idea that embryos could have individual rights that courts can consider in their rulings. 
    
            Both cases emerge from a political environment that was unleashed by the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade reversal and a willingness to push the legal envelope that the Supreme Court ruling created. The abortion issue is now on a path back to the Supreme Court, as higher courts are asked to sort out the contradictory commands of Friday night’s decisions. 
    
            Because the Texas judge has paused his ruling, it has no immediate impact on the availability of medication abortion drugs. But the next several days stand to be a dramatic and combustible legal fight over the order – a fight ratcheted up by the rival ruling in Washington.
    
            Besides pausing his ruling for one week, Kacsmaryk – an appointee of former President Donald Trump who sits in Amarillo, Texas – seemed to hold nothing back as he ripped apart the FDA’s approval of mifepristone and embraced wholeheartedly the challengers’ arguments that the drug’s risks weren’t adequately considered. 
    
            Kacsmaryk, whose anti-abortion advocacy before joining the federal bench was documented by a recent Washington Post profile, showed a striking hostility to medication abortion, which is the method used in a majority of abortions in the United States.
    
            Leading medical organizations have already condemned his opinion and pushed back at the judge’s analysis of the safety of medication abortion. 
    
            The judge said that the FDA failed to consider “the intense psychological trauma and post-traumatic stress women often experience from chemical abortion.” The term “chemical abortion,” which is preferred by abortion opponents, was repeatedly invoked by the judge in his ruling, as was “abortionist” and “unborn human.” Kacsmaryk suggested that the FDA’s data was downplaying the frequency with which the drug was being mistakenly administered to someone who had an ectopic pregnancy, i.e. a pregnancy outside the cavity of the uterus. He repeated the challengers’ accusations that the FDA’s approval process had been the subject of improper political pressure.
    
            He said the FDA’s refusal to impose certain restrictions on the drug’s use “resulted in many deaths and many more severe or life-threatening adverse reactions.” 
    
            “Whatever the numbers are, they likely would be considerably lower had FDA not acquiesced to the pressure to increase access to chemical abortion at the expense of women’s safety,” he said. 
    
            Jack Resneck Jr., the president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement that Kacsmaryk’s ruling “flies in the face of science and evidence and threatens to upend access to a safe and effective drug.” 
    
            “The court’s disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation,” the AMA president said. 
    
            Kacsmaryk’s opinion paid no heed to the argument made by the FDA’s defenders that cutting off access to medication abortion would put the health of pregnant people at risk and that it would force abortion seekers to terminate their pregnancies through a surgical procedure instead.
    
            Instead, the judge wrote that a ruling in the challengers’ favor would ensure “that women and girls are protected from unnecessary harm and that Defendants do not disregard federal law.” 
    
            As he explained why the preliminary injunction – which was being handed down before the case could proceed to a trial – was justified, he said that embryos had their own rights that could be part of the analysis. That assertion goes further than what the Supreme Court said in its June ruling, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health. 
    
            “Parenthetically, said ‘individual justice’ and ‘irreparable injury’ analysis also arguably applies to the unborn humans extinguished by mifepristone — especially in the post-Dobbs era,” Kacsmaryk said Friday. 
    
            Whereas Kacsmaryk had been asked by the challengers in Texas to block medication abortion, US District Judge Thomas Owen Rice, who sits in Spokane, Washington, was considering whether abortion pills should be easier to obtain. 
    
            Rice, an Obama appointee, granted the Democratic attorneys general who brought the lawsuit a partial win.  
    
            They had asked Rice to remove certain restrictions – known as REMS or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy – the FDA has imposed on mifepristone, with the blue states arguing the drug was safe and effective enough to make those restrictions unnecessary. 
    
            While Rice is rejecting that bid for now, he granted a request the states also made that the FDA be ordered to keep the drugs on the market. But Rice’s ruling only applies in the 17 plaintiff states and the District of Columbia. 
    
            His decision maintains the status quo for the availability of abortion pills in those places and he specifically is blocking the agency from “altering the status quo and rights as it relates to the availability of Mifepristone under the current operative January 2023 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.” 
    
            Rice’s opinion was a striking split screen to Kacmsaryk’s. While the Texas judge said the FDA did not adequately take into account the drug risks, Rice showed sympathy to the arguments that the rules for mifepristone’s use were too strict and that the agency should be taking a more lenient approach to how the abortion pill is regulated.  
    
            Ultimately, he said he would not grant the Democratic states’ request that he remove some of the drug restrictions at this preliminary stage in the proceedings, because that would go well beyond maintaining the status quo while the case advances. He noted that if he had granted that request, it would also undo a new FDA rule that allows pharmacies to dispense abortion pills. That would reduce its availability and would run “directly counter to Plaintiffs’ request.” 
    
            If Kacsmaryk’s ruling halting mifepristone’s approval is allowed to go into effect, it will run headlong into Rice’s order that mifepristone remain available in several states. Kacsmaryk’s ruling is a nationwide injunction. 
    
            The Justice Department and Danco, a mifepristone manufacturer that intervened in the case to defend the approval, both filed notices of appeal. Both Attorney General Merrick Garland and Danco said in statements that in addition to the appeals, they will seek “stays” of the ruling, meaning emergency requests that the decision is frozen while the appeal moves forward.
    
            They’re appealing to the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is sometimes said to be the country’s most conservative appeals court. Yet some legal scholars were skeptical that the 5th Circuit, as conservative as it is, would let Kacmsaryk’s order take effect. 
    
            Washington, where the blue states’ lawsuit was filed, is covered under the 9th Circuit, a liberal appellate court. But it’s unclear if the ruling from Rice will be appealed. Garland said the Justice Department was still reviewing the decision out of Washington. A so-called circuit split would increase the odds that the Supreme Court would intervene. But given how the practical impact of the two district court rulings contradict each other, the Supreme Court may have no choice but to get involved.
    
            The lawyer for the challengers in the Texas case, anti-abortion medication associations and doctors, said Friday evening that he had not reviewed the Washington decision, so he could not weigh in on how it impacted Kacsmaryk’s order that the drug’s approval be halted.
    
            “I’m not sure whether there’s a direct conflict yet and with the Washington state decision just because I haven’t read it yet, but there may not be a direct conflict,” Erik Baptist, who is an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, said. “But if there is a direct conflict then there may be – it may be inevitably going to the Supreme Court, but I’m not convinced that it’s necessary at this point to make that conclusion.”

            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement late Friday that a federal judge’s ruling in Texas over mifepristone is “inflammatory” and a “grievous legal overstep.”
    
            The US Food and Drug Administration issued the following statement Friday night in response to the ruling of a federal judge in Texas about its approval of mifepristone:
    
            President Joe Biden promised late Friday night that his administration will fight against a Texas judge’s ruling that seeks to halt the FDA’s approval of a medication abortion pill.
    
            The Justice Department filed a notice of appeal Friday night. 
    
            A judge’s order that seeks to halt the FDA’s approval of a medication abortion drug has been appealed to a federal appeals court.
    
            Both the Justice Department and Danco, a manufacturer of the drug that intervened in the case, filed notices of appeal to the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
    
            The order halting the approval had already been put on pause for seven days by the judge who handed it down, in order to give the DOJ time to appeal.
    
            Danco Laboratories, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the abortion pill Mifepristone, released a statement Friday in response to a Texas federal judge issuing a ruling that will suspend the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of the pill. 
    
            Long added that the order “fails to account for the meticulous, well-documented FDA decision-making process that led to the initial 2000 approval and the subsequent approvals setting the conditions under which Mifeprex has been distributed for 23 years.”
    
            Jessica Ellsworth, lead counsel for Danco, said in the statement that Danco plans to appeal the ruling and “feels strongly that the rule of law should prevail in this case, which would result in a reversal of this ruling.”
    
            A federal judge in Washington state ruled the FDA must keep medication abortion drugs available in more than a dozen Democratic-led states. 
    
            Read the decision here:
    
            New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on President Joe Biden to ignore a Texas judge’s ruling halting the approval of a medication abortion pill during an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper Friday.
    
            The congresswoman said conservative jurists have undermined their legitimacy through the “deeply partisan and unfounded nature” of these rulings.
    
            Pushed by Cooper on whether the lawmaker wanted a system where the federal government ignores the judiciary, Ocasio-Cortez said the FDA and the Biden administration will consider the merits of several legal challenges and decide “how exactly we mapped this out.”
    
            But the congresswoman said a Republican “power grab” in the judiciary has created a situation in which the legitimacy of their rulings is in doubt.
    
            Asked again if she thinks the Biden administration should flatly ignore the ruling, Ocasio-Cortez said the presidency and Congress can and should act as a check on the judiciary, but she did not outline a specific course of action as it pertains to the Biden administration’s tack on the abortion ruling.
    
            Some key context: US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who made the ruling halting the abortion pill’s FDA approval, is an appointee of former President Donald Trump and known as a deeply conservative jurist.
    
            During his presidency, Trump and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell placed a heavy focus on confirming more than 200 judicial nominees, leaving a significant imprint on the judiciary that could last for decades.
    
            Ocasio-Cortez said Democrats have been “preparing and anticipating for there being these egregious overreaches by members of the judiciary,” saying its a natural progression from Republican efforts to “pack these courts with partisan judges.”
    
            Remember: The Texas ruling is on hold for seven days so the federal government can appeal. The decision is complicated further by the ruling of a second federal judge in Washington state, who said the drug must remain on the market in more than a dozen Democratic-led states.
    
            CNN’s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.
    
            Organizations and officials are reacting to US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s decision Friday to halt the FDA’s approval of the medication abortion pill, mifepristone. 
    
            The American Medical Association blasted Kacsmaryk’s decision, saying it “flies in the face of science and evidence.” 
    
            The Alliance Defending Freedom called Friday’s ruling in the case “a significant victory.” But Erik Baptist, an attorney with the group, said he is not yet sure how a separate ruling in a case in Washington could conflict with the ruling.
    
            He told reporters he has not yet taken a look at the ruling out of Washington that directly conflicts with the ruling out of Texas. 
    
            Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel expressed her disappointment in the ruling Friday. 
    
            The Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America nonprofit called the decision “a win for the health and safety of women and girls.”
    
            California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the ruling “ignores facts, science, and the law” and puts “the health of millions of women and girls at risk.”
    
            Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke to CNN’s Anderson Cooper about the ruling Friday. 
    
            Planned Parenthood called Kacsmaryk’s decision a “deeply harmful move.”
    
            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is “horrified” by the Texas ruling. 
    
            Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont called the ruling “another devastating attack on “reproductive rights” and said that it “is about controlling medical decisions that should be between patients and their doctors.”
    
            Maine Gov. Janet T. Mills called the decision “reckless” and said it “ignores basic science and facts.” 
    
            The US Justice Department will appeal the decision by the Texas judge who said he will suspend the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of a medication abortion pill, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said he was pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government could appeal. 
    
            Garland said the department will also review the decision by the judge in Washington state who said in a new ruling that the FDA must keep medication abortion drugs available in more than a dozen states that sued the FDA to make the abortion pills.
    
            The federal judge in Washington state who issued a ruling Friday in a key abortion lawsuit has previously ruled in favor of reproductive rights advocates in a Trump-era dispute.  
    
            US District Judge Thomas Owen Rice was appointed to the Eastern District of Washington in 2011 by President Barack Obama. The Senate confirmed Rice for the post in 2012 by a vote of 93-4.  
    
            In his ruling, Rice said the FDA must keep medication abortion drugs available in more than a dozen liberal states that sued the FDA to make the abortion pills more accessible.  
    
            The judge previously sided with an abortion rights group when he issued a permanent injunction in 2018 that blocked the Trump administration from slashing grants to a Planned Parenthood program that funds teen pregnancy prevention programs across the country. 
    
            Planned Parenthood brought the case against the Trump administration after the government ended Teen Pregnancy Prevention grants for 81 organizations across the nation. The grants to fund the program were supposed to run through 2020, but the Department of Health and Human Services said the grants would end in 2018 instead, arguing that the program was unsuccessful. 
    
            Rice served as chief judge of the Eastern District of Washington from 2016 to 2020. Prior to his appointment, Rice had served since 1987 as an assistant US Attorney in Washington.  
    
            A lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the medication abortion lawsuit in Texas called Friday’s ruling “a significant victory,” but said that he is not yet sure how a separate ruling in a Washington state case could conflict with it. 
    
            Baptist said he has not yet looked at the ruling out of Washington that directly conflicts with the Texas ruling.
    
            “I’m still digesting the court’s decision from the Northern District of Texas. I have not had an opportunity to review the Washington state decision to see how it may or may not impact the court’s decision in our litigation in Texas,” he said. 
    
            “I’m not sure whether there’s a direct conflict yet and with the Washington state decision just because I haven’t read it yet, but there may not be a direct conflict,” he added later. “But if there is a direct conflict then there may be – it may be inevitably going to Supreme Court, but I’m not convinced that it’s necessary at this point to make that conclusion.” 
    
            Asked about the seven-day stay issued by Kacsmaryk in the case, Baptist said: “The court was recognizing and acknowledging that the government had already asked that and proceeded to give it. So it’s a reasonable relief that the court gave to the government to seek that appeal in the interim.” 
    
            White House lawyers are currently reviewing the opposing decisions from judges in Washington and Texas on the FDA’s approval of a medication abortion pill, according to an official. 
    
            Making her first remarks on a Texas judge’s decision to halt the approval of a medication abortion pill, Vice President Kamala Harris said the decision set “a dangerous precedent.”
    
            Harris spoke to reporters at an airfield in Nashville on Friday after meeting with Democratic lawmakers in Tennessee.
    
            The vice president noted the FDA approved the drug, mifepristone, 20 years ago, and said it has been “proven to be safe” in the two decades since.
    
            Harris said she would have more remarks after reviewing the judge’s ruling. President Joe Biden has yet to publicly weigh in on the case.
    
            “As a general matter, I’ll say that there is no question that the president and I are going to stand with the women of America and do everything we can to ensure that women have the ability to make decisions about their health care, their reproductive health care,” Harris said.
    
            Remember: There are two major decisions on medication abortion that came down in short succession this evening. After the Texas judge’s ruling on mifepristone, a second federal judge ruled the drug must remain on the market in more than a dozen Democratic-led states.
    
            The two decisions mark the most significant abortion-related rulings since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            CNN’s Sam Fossum contributed to this report.
    
            In a striking split screen to the ruling out of Texas, where US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Texas tore apart the process the FDA used to approve the drug, mifepristone, which is the first drug used in a two-drug regime to terminate a pregnancy, Judge Thomas Owen Rice in Washington state took a more deferential tone toward to the FDA, ordering that the status quo be maintained by keeping the drug on the marker.
    
            The states where the approval of mifepristone is not affected, thanks to the ruling from a federal judge Friday in Washington state:
    
            Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Washington, DC.
    
            In a dramatic turn of events, a federal judge in Washington state said Friday night in a new ruling that the FDA must keep medication abortion drugs available in 17 liberal states and Washington, DC, that sued the FDA to make the abortion pills.
    
            This lawsuit is separate from the ruling that came down in Texas minutes earlier that will halt the approval of the drug. That ruling was paused for seven days, giving the Justice Department time to appeal.
    
            A federal judge’s decision could have long-term impacts on the trust in the FDA’s approval process and chill pharmaceutical companies from developing new drugs, according to Elizabeth Cohen, CNN senior medical correspondent.
    
            Mifepristone has about 5 deaths per million users, while other commonly used drugs like Penicillin have about 20 deaths per million users, she said.
    
            “So if this judge is so concerned about side effects, why isn’t he saying let’s take penicillin off the market?” Cohen said.
    
            Further, Cohen said a ruling that allows a judge to take a drug off the market could make pharmaceutical companies nervous. She said confidence in scientists at the FDA is critical for the development and creation of new drugs people need.
    
            “If they think that just one judge can take that drug off the market, they may not be willing to invest that kind of money,” Cohen said.
    
            The move to suspend the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone was a stunning move, CNN’s senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said Friday.
    
            She said it will “be a real problem for reproductive healthcare” if women aren’t allowed to take mifepristone. 
    
            She added that FDA scientists are “the ones who look through all the data.”
    
            More than half of abortions in the United States are medication abortions, said Elizabeth Cohen, CNN senior medical correspondent, which means a new ruling from a federal judge in Texas to suspend FDA approval of one of the medical abortion drugs is going to impact people across the country.
    
            He is pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government can appeal, but if at any point that suspension goes into effect, it will take away the option of medical abortion.
    
            The drug, mifepristone, is the first drug in the medication abortion process.
    
            Cohen said women rely on mifepristone and medical abortions for other circumstances as well, including when they have miscarriages or need to have an abortion because the fetus is non-viable.
    
            “They rely on this for all sorts of reasons, and they wouldn’t be able to do that,” Cohen said.
    
            CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck said Judge Kacsmaryk’s ruling “may never go into effect,” but that the administration will now have to appeal it to higher courts that are stacked with conservative jurists. 
    
            “This isn’t going to be the last word. Even Judge Kascmaryk recognizes that he can’t let this ruling go into immediate effect. And it may never go into effect,” said Vladeck, who is a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.  
    
            “But this puts the onus on the Biden administration to get either the most conservative appeals court in the country, or the most conservative Supreme Court in our lifetime, to freeze this ruling before it can go into effect,” Vladeck added. 
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone, the drug at the center of the Texas medication abortion lawsuit, is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. 
    
            There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That’s a death rate of 0.0005%.
    
            Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin — a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia — is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra — used to treat erectile dysfunction — is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA.
    
            “(Mifepristone) has been used for over 20 years by over 5 million people with the capacity to become pregnant,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. “Its safety is very well established.”
    
            The lawsuit, filed by a coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations against the FDA, under the umbrella of the “Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine” and several doctors, sought a number of actions by the court, chief among them an injunction ordering the FDA “to withdraw mifepristone and misoprostol as FDA-approved chemical abortion drugs and to withdraw defendants’ actions to deregulate these chemical abortion drugs.”
    
            “Plaintiffs now ask this court to do what the FDA was and is legally required to do: protect women and girls by holding unlawful, setting aside, and vacating the FDA’s actions to approve chemical abortion drugs and eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo this dangerous drug regimen,” they wrote in their initial complaint.
    
            A federal judge said Friday he will suspend the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, but he is pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government can appeal.
    
            A federal judge in Texas ruled to suspend the FDA’s approval of a medication abortion pill. He is pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government can appeal. 
    
            Read the decision here:
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said that the Food and Drug Administration had “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem by omitting any evaluation of the psychological effects of the drug or an evaluation of the long term-term medical consequences of the drug,” referring to mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process.
    
            Kacsmaryk also was critical that the drug was not tested for under-18 girls undergoing reproductive development. 
    
            “But that is not all,” he continued, criticizing how the FDA handled ultrasounds to identify ectopic pregnancy.
    
            A federal judge said he will suspend the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of a medication abortion pill, but he is pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government can appeal.
    
            CNN is reviewing the judge’s 67-page ruling now.
    
            Medication abortion now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US. It has become a key focus in the fallout from the overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            The lawsuit against the FDA, filed by anti-abortion doctors and medical associations, was seeking a preliminary injunction that would require the agency to withdraw or suspend its approval of the drug mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process.
    
            Mifepristone is a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that has been shown to be safe and effective for more than two decades.
    
            The lawsuit from anti-abortion advocates claims that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn’t study it enough to approve it.
    
            Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery.
    
            Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it’s sometimes known as RU 486.
    
            Here are some key things to know: 
    
            How mifepristone works: Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus.
    
            Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents.
    
            Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions.
    
            The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period.
    
            This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show.
    
            How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country’s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, which signed an amicus brief in the Texas case.
    
            This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries.
    
            Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. That means the death rate is 0.0005%.
    
            Mifepristone’s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show.
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra – used to treat erectile dysfunction – is nearly 10 times higher.
    
            Side effects of mifepristone: Mifepristone usually doesn’t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones.
    
            Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA.
    
            Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are “exceedingly rare,” happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations’ amicus brief.
    
            How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US.
    
            Preliminary data published February 2022 from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, showed that medication abortion accounted for 53% of all abortions in the US.

            The federal judge overseeing the high-profile challenge to the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of certain drugs used to terminate a pregnancy is a deeply conservative jurist with a proclivity for siding with plaintiffs looking to roll back reproductive and LGBTQ rights or block key Biden administration policies.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, was confirmed by a 52-46 Senate vote in 2019.
    
            The FDA case, the biggest abortion-related case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, has drawn considerable criticism from abortion rights advocates. But Kacsmaryk himself has also drawn scrutiny for the way he’s handled the matter, with critics taking issue with some highly unusual steps he took to delay making the public aware that a hearing was scheduled in the case for March 15.
    
            Since Kacsmaryk took the bench in 2019, he’s helped make Texas a legal graveyard for policies of President Joe Biden’s administration, largely due to the fact that Texas’ rules for how federal cases are assigned in the state have allowed conservatives to file there strategically, almost guaranteeing their complaints will be before sympathetic judges. Kacsmaryk is assigned every case filed in his division.
    
            In recent comments to The Washington Post, Kacsmaryk’s sister, Jennifer Griffith, detailed her brother’s long history of being anti-abortion and how she believes fate brought the abortion case before him.
    
            “I feel like he was made for this,” Griffith said. “He is exactly where he needs to be.”
    
            The group that brought the medication abortion lawsuit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, incorporated in Amarillo a few months before they filed the suit, according to documents from the Texas secretary of state’s office.
    
            Kacsmaryk is the only federal district judge seated in the Amarillo division of the US District of Northern Texas.
    
            Read more about Kacsmaryk here. 
    
            For about four hours of arguments on March 15, the federal judge in Texas asked questions that suggested he is seriously considering undoing the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a medication abortion drug and the agency’s moves to relax the rules around its use.
    
            But the judge, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, also indicated he was thinking through scenarios in which he could keep the drug’s 2000 approval intact while blocking other FDA rules.
    
            Anti-abortion doctors and medical associations are seeking a preliminary injunction that would require the FDA to withdraw or suspend its approval of the drug, mifepristone, and that would block the agency’s more recent regulatory changes making the pills more accessible.
    
            Here are some of the big takeaways:
    
            Judge focused on FDA’s process for approving abortion pills: Kacsmaryk showed a particular interest in the arguments by the abortion opponents that the FDA approved mifepristone in an unlawful way.
    
            He zeroed in on a claim by the abortion foes that the studies that the FDA looked at when deciding whether to approve the drug did not match the conditions under which the agency allows it to be administered.
    
            Erik Baptist, attorney for the challengers, alleged that those studies all featured patients who received ultrasounds before being treated with the drug, which is not among the FDA’s requirements for prescribing abortion pills. Baptist accused the FDA of “examining oranges and declaring apples to be safe.”
    
            Justice Department attorney Daniel Schwei defended the FDA’s approach, arguing that the relevant law gives the FDA discretion to determine what studies are adequate for approving a drug’s safety. He also said the challengers’ claims were factually flawed because the FDA also was looking at studies where the patients did not receive an ultrasound.
    
            Impact of the reversal of Roe v. Wade: The medication abortion lawsuit targets actions the FDA took around medication abortion pills before last summer’s Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade’s abortion rights protections.
    
            While that decision, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, didn’t play a major role in Wednesday’s arguments, the judge referenced it and suggested it could have an impact on his thinking about the case.
    
            He asked Erin Hawley, an attorney for the challengers, whether Dobbs was an “intervening event” that has “changed the landscape” around the relationship between state and federal government concerning abortion policy. Hawley agreed, calling it a “sea change.”

            Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
    
            The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion.
    
            “It reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,” she said.
    
            It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications — like hemorrhages or infections — for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a 2015 study conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications.
    
            The likelihood of serious complications via procedural abortion — performed second-trimester or later — is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And childbirth by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%.
    
            If access to mifepristone is cut off, abortion clinics and telehealth organizations could pivot to misoprostol-only abortions, Aiken told CNN. Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said.
    
            In the latest study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol.
    
            Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen.
    
            “It’s clear people can use these medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, at home even without the help of a medical professional very safely,” said Aiken.
    
            Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it’s readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN.
    
            However, a lesser-effective method means more people will likely have unsuccessful abortions.
    
            “It’s possible that it might not work for some people, and it will prolong their abortions,” said Upadhyay. “Then by the time they get back to the clinic, they’re seeking abortion later in pregnancy.”
    
            Before the ruling, 19 states already restricted telehealth abortion care, limiting access to medication abortion. Nearly half of US adults were unsure whether medication abortion was currently legal in their state as of late-January, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Experts say that confusion will only be exacerbated.
    
            “People are not going to be sure mifepristone or misoprostol in fact, is available. I think it’s going to be confusing,” said Aiken. “As people look around for options or feel unsure about their options, they may end up delaying [care].”

      Matthew Kacsmaryk: The Trump-appointed judge overseeing the blockbuster medication abortion lawsuit

            The federal judge overseeing a high-profile challenge to the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of certain drugs used to terminate a pregnancy is a deeply conservative jurist with a proclivity for siding with plaintiffs looking to roll back reproductive and LGBTQ rights or block key Biden administration policies.  
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, said Friday that he will suspend the FDA’s approval of a medication abortion pill called mifepristone, but he is pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government can appeal. 
    
            The FDA case, the biggest abortion-related case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, has drawn considerable criticism from abortion rights advocates. 
    
            But Kacsmaryk, who was confirmed by a 52-46 Senate vote in 2019, has also drawn scrutiny for the way he’s handled the matter, with critics taking issue with some highly unusual steps he took to delay making the public aware that a hearing was scheduled in the case last month.
    
            Since Kacsmaryk took the bench in 2019, he’s helped make Texas a legal graveyard for policies of President Joe Biden’s administration, largely due to the fact that Texas’ rules for how federal cases are assigned in the state have allowed conservatives to file there strategically, almost guaranteeing their complaints will be before sympathetic judges. Kacsmaryk is assigned every case filed in his division. 
    
            In recent comments to The Washington Post, Kacsmaryk’s sister, Jennifer Griffith, detailed her brother’s long history of being anti-abortion and how she believes fate brought the abortion case before him. 
    
            “I feel like he was made for this,” Griffith said. “He is exactly where he needs to be.”
    
            The group that brought the medication abortion lawsuit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, incorporated in Amarillo a few months before they filed the suit, according to documents from the Texas secretary of state’s office.
    
            Kacsmaryk is the only federal district judge seated in the Amarillo division of the US District of Northern Texas. 
    
            Kacsmaryk has been flexing his conservative bona fides long before he became a federal judge, with his record on a range of issues on display while he worked for a prominent legal group representing the religious right. 
    
            But in his few short years as a judge, he has emerged as chief antagonist of the Biden administration, including with rulings against the administration’s moves to expand LGBTQ protections, Biden’s immigration agenda and policies that ensure minors’ access to birth control without their parents’ permission.  
    
            In December, Kacsmaryk put on hold the Biden administration’s most recent attempt to end the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program. And he has overseen Texas cases challenging vaccine mandates, the gender identity guidance issued by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the administration’s limits on the use of Covid-19 relief funds for tax cuts. 
    
            In the birth control case, he ruled in December that a federal program that allowed minors to receive birth control without their parents’ consent was unlawful, halting the program in Texas.
    
            “Defendants’ administration of the Title X program violates the constitutional right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children and Texas Family Code,” Kacsmaryk wrote. The ruling is now being appealed.  
    
            A month earlier, Kacsmaryk blocked the Biden administration from enforcing new rules that sought to protect transgender Americans from discrimination in health care. That ruling is also being appealed by the administration.  
    
            Criticism of the judge-shopping tactics by conservative plaintiffs has come directly before Kacsmaryk, including in early February when the Justice Department took aim at the strategy in a dispute he’s overseeing involving a new Labor Department rule.  
    
            “Plaintiffs’ and other litigants’ ongoing tactic of filing many of their lawsuits against the federal government in single-judge divisions, or divisions where they are otherwise almost always guaranteed to procure a particular judge, undermines public confidence in the administration of justice,” DOJ wrote in court papers.  
    
            One of the attorneys representing the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine in the FDA case pushed back on allegations from critics that the filing location was chosen strategically to get the case before Kacsmaryk.  
    
            “It’s an utterly nonsensical argument to make because we have every right to file a lawsuit where our clients are injured,” Erik Baptist, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing the abortion pill challengers, told CNN. He pointed to an individual plaintiff in the lawsuit, Dr. Shaun Jester, who practices near Amarillo.
    
            “Congress has authorized the American public to sue federal agencies where the American public has actually been injured and where they reside,” Baptist said. “And that’s exactly what Dr. Jester did here. He filed this lawsuit with the other plaintiffs in this case because he is based in the Amarillo area, and therefore, we filed this lawsuit where he resides.”
    
            Prior to joining the bench, Kacsmaryk served for several years as deputy general counsel at the First Liberty Institute, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group, where he worked mainly on “religious liberty litigation in federal courts and amicus briefs in the US Supreme Court,” according to a biography issued in 2017 by the Trump White House. 
    
            Among the Supreme Court disputes Kacsmaryk weighed in on was the landmark 2015 case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. In a brief submitted to the court by Kacsmaryk and others on behalf First Liberty and a host of other religious groups, they urged justices to rule that the First Amendment’s free speech protections “protects religious dissenters who disagree with state recognized same-sex marriage.”  
    
            Months after the court issued its decision in the case, Kacsmaryk penned an essay critical of the ruling that also took aim at proposed legislation that sought to enshrine federal protections for LGBTQ Americans.  
    
            “The Equality Act seeks to weaponize Obergefell, moving with lightning speed from a contentious five-to-four victory on same-sex marriage to a nationwide rule that ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender identity’ are privileged classes that give no quarter to Americans who continue to believe and seek to exercise their millennia-old religious belief that marriage and sexual relations are reserved to the union of one man and one woman,” he wrote.  
    
            At the time of his confirmation to the court, his then-employer heaped praise on him for being “the first confirmed judge who’s gone directly from a religious liberty law firm to the federal judiciary.”
    
            “Matthew’s confirmation is a major win for religious-freedom practitioners, proving that a principled attorney may zealously advocate for the rights of religious minorities, conscientious objectors, and faith-based ministries without forfeiting the opportunity to serve on the bench,” First Liberty Institute said in a statement. 
    
            Kacsmaryk is also a longtime member of the conservative legal group the Federalist Society and has campaigned for Texas GOP Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, as well as Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, according to answers he submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

      Maternity units are closing across America, forcing expectant mothers to hit the road
    ","
			By Amanda Musa and John Bonifield, CNN
		;Amanda Musa;John Bonifield","

        7:38 PM EDT, Fri April 7, 2023
    ","
            In picturesque Bonner County, Idaho, Leandra Wright, 40, is pregnant with her seventh child.   
    
            Wright is due in August, but three weeks ago, the hospital where she had planned to deliver, Bonner General Health, announced that it would be suspending its labor and delivery services in May.   
    
            Now, she’s facing a potentially precarious drive to another hospital 45 minutes from her home.   
    
            “It’s frustrating and worrisome,” Wright said.  
    
            Wright has a history of fast labors. Her 15-year-old son, Noah, was born on the way to the hospital. 
    
            “My fifth child was born on the side of the highway,” Wright said. “It was wintertime, and my hospital at the time in California was about 40 minutes away, and the roads were icy, so we didn’t make it in time.”  
    
            By the time she and Noah got to the hospital, about 15 minutes after he was born, his body temperature was lower than normal. 
    
            “It worries me not to have a doctor there and worries me to have to go through that,” Wright said. 
    
            Residents of Bonner County aren’t the only ones dealing with unexpected maternity unit closures.  
    
            Since 2011, 217 hospitals in the United States have closed their labor and delivery departments, according to a report by the health care consulting firm Chartis.
    
            A CNN tally shows that at least 13 such closures have been announced in the past year alone.  
    
            Services provided at maternity units vary from hospital to hospital. Most  offer obstetrics care in which an obstetrician will deliver a baby, either vaginally or via cesarean section. These units also provide perinatal care, which is medical and supportive care before and after delivery. 
    
            Other services provided may include lactation specialists and private delivery rooms. 
    
            After May 19, Bonner General Health will no longer offer obstetrical services, meaning there will be zero obstetricians practicing there. Consequently, the hospital will no longer deliver babies. Additionally, the unit will no longer provide 24-hour anesthesia support or post-resuscitation or pre-transportation stabilization care for critically ill newborns. 
    
            Some hospitals that have recently closed their maternity units still offer perinatal care, along with routine gynecological care. 
    
            Bonner General is planning to establish a clinic where perinatal care will be offered. Gynecological services – such as surgical services, preventative care, wellness exams and family planning – will still be provided at a nearby women’s health clinic. 
    
            The Chartis report says that the states with the highest loss of access to obstetrical care are Minnesota, Texas, Iowa, Kansas and Wisconsin, with each losing more than 10 facilities. 
    
            Data released last fall by the infant and maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes also shows that more than 2.2 million women of childbearing age across 1,119 US counties are living in “maternity care deserts,” meaning their counties have no hospitals offering obstetric care, no birth centers and no obstetric providers.  
    
            Maternity care deserts have been linked to a lack of adequate prenatal care or treatment for pregnancy complications and even an increased risk of maternal death for a year after giving birth. 
    
            Money is one reason why maternity units are being shuttered.  
    
            According to the American Hospital Association, 42% of births in the US are paid for by Medicaid, which has low reimbursement rates. Employer-sponsored insurance pays about $15,000 for a delivery, and Medicaid pays about $6,500, according to the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care cost and utilization data. 
    
            “Medicaid funds about half of all births nationally and more than half of births in rural areas,” said Dr. Katy Kozhimannil, a public health researcher at the University of Minnesota who has conducted research on the growing number of maternity care deserts. 
    
            Kozhimannil says communities that are most likely to be affected by maternity unit closures tend to be remote towns in rural counties in states with “less generous Medicaid programs.” 
    
            Hospitals in larger cities are often able to offset low reimbursement rates from Medicaid births with births covered by employer-sponsored insurance, according to Dr. Sina Haeri, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and CEO of Ouma Health, a company that provides virtual prenatal and perinatal care to mothers living in maternity care deserts.  
    
            Many large hospitals also have neonatal intensive care units.  
    
            “If you have a NICU, that’s a substantial revenue generator for a hospital,” Haeri said.  
    
            Most rural hospitals do not have a NICU, only a nursery where they care for full-term, healthy babies, he said. Due to that financial burden, it does not make financial sense for many rural hospitals to keep labor and delivery units open.  
    
            A low volume of births is another reason for the closures.  
    
            In announcing the closure, Bonner General noted that in 2022, it delivered just 265 babies, which the hospital characterized as a significant decrease.  
    
            Rural hospital administrators providing obstetric care say it takes at least 200 births annually for a unit to remain safe and financially viable, according to a study led by Kozhimannil for the University of Minnesota’s Rural Health Research Center.  
    
            Many administrators surveyed said they are working to keep units open despite low birth rates.  
    
            “Of all the folks that we surveyed, about a third of them were still operating, even though they had fewer than 200 births a year,” Kozhimannil said. “We asked why, and they said, ‘because our community needs it.’ ”    
    
            Another issue for hospital administrators is staffing and recruitment.    
    
            The decision to close Bonner General’s labor and delivery unit was also directly affected by a lack of experienced, qualified doctors and nurses in the state, said Erin Binnall, a Bonner General Health spokesperson.  
    
            “After May 19th, Bonner General Health will no longer have reliable, consistent pediatric coverage to manage neonatal resuscitations and perinatal care. Bonner General’s number one priority is patient safety. Not having board-certified providers certified in neonatal resuscitation willing to provide call and be present during deliveries makes it unsafe and unethical for BGH to provide these services,” Binnall told CNN by email.  
    
            The American Hospital Association acknowledges the staffing challenges some hospitals face.   
    
            “Simply put, if a hospital cannot recruit and retain the providers, nurses, and other appropriately trained caregivers to sustainably support a service then it cannot provide that care,” the association said in a statement. “Such challenges are only magnified in rural America, where workforce strain is compounded by aging demographics that in some communities has dramatically decreased demand for services like Labor and Delivery.” 
    
            More stringent abortion laws may be playing a role in the closures, too.  
    
            Bonner General said in a news release last month that due to Idaho’s “legal and political climate, highly respected, talented physicians are leaving. In addition, the Idaho Legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care.”  
    
            According to the Guttmacher Institute, Idaho has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country: a complete ban that has only a few exceptions.  
    
            Idaho requires an “affirmative defense,” Guttmacher says, meaning a provider “has to prove in court that an abortion met the criteria for a legal exception.” 
    
            No matter the reason, Kozhimannil said, closures in rural communities aren’t just a nuisance. They also put families at risk.  
    
            “That long drive isn’t just an inconvenience. It actually is associated with health risks,” she said. “The consequence that we saw is an increase in preterm births. Preterm birth is the largest risk factor for infant mortality. It is a huge risk factor for developmental and cognitive delays for kids.”  
    
            Haeri says the decline in maternal care also has a clear effect on maternal mortality rates.  
    
            The maternal death rate for 2021 – the year for which the most recent data is available – was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in the US, compared with rates of 20.1 in 2019 and 23.8 in 2020, according to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics. In raw numbers, 1,205 women died of maternal causes in the US in 2021.  
    
            Conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes may raise a person’s risk of complications, as can being pregnant with multiples, according to the National Institutes of Health. Pregnant women over the age of 35 are at a higher risk of pre-eclampsia. 
    
            As labor and delivery units continue to shut their doors, possible solutions to the growing problem are complex, Haeri says.  
    
            “I think anyone that comes to you and says the current system is working is lying to you,” he said. “We all know that the current maternity system is not good.”   
    
            Kozhimannil’s research has found that many women who live in maternity care deserts are members of minority communities.  
    
            “When we conducted that research, we found the communities that were raising the alarm about this … tended to be Black and indigenous, or tribal communities in rural places,” she said. “Black communities in the South and East and tribal communities throughout the country, but especially in the West, Mountain West and Midwest.”  
    
            Haeri says one possible solution is at a woman’s fingertips.   
    
            “I always say if a woman’s got a cell phone, she should have access,” he said.   
    
            A 2021 study found that women who live in remote areas of the US could benefit from telehealth visits, which would decrease the number of “in-person prenatal care visits and increase access to care.”  
    
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends 12 to 14 prenatal care appointments for women with low-risk pregnancies, and the study suggests that expansion of prenatal telehealth appointments could help women living in remote areas better adhere to those guidelines.   
    
            Ouma works with mothers who are typically remote and high-risk, Haeri says.    
    
            He also believes that promoting midwifery and doula services would help bolster maternity care in the US.   
    
            Certified nurse midwives often assist remote mothers who are high-risk or who decide to give birth at home, he says.   
    
            Midwives not only deliver babies, they often work with medical equipment and can administer at-home physical exams, prescribe medications, order lab and diagnostic tests, and assess risk management, according to the American College of Nurse Midwives. Doulas – who guide mothers through the birthing process – are often present at home births and even hospital births.  
    
            “That midwifery model shines when it comes to maternal care. [And] doula advocacy involvement leads to better outcomes and maternity care, and I think as a system, we haven’t made it easier for those two components to be really an integral part of our maternity care in the US,” Haeri said.   
    
            After living in Idaho for 10 years, Wright says, she and her fiancé have considered leaving the state. The lack of maternity and pediatric care at Bonner General Health is a big reason why.  
    
            “I feel safe being with [my] doctors. Now, I have to get to know a doctor within a couple of months before my next baby is born,” Wright said.  
    
            As she awaits the arrival of her new son, she feels doubtful that there is a solution for mothers like her.  
    
            “Everywhere – no matter what – everybody has babies,” she said. “It’s posing a problem for people who have babies who don’t have the income to drive or have high risk pregnancies or first-time mothers who don’t even know what to expect.”

      Idaho AG rescinds legal opinion that said health care providers can’t make out-of-state abortion referrals
    ","

    ","
            Two days after being hit with a lawsuit over a legal opinion that said Idaho’s abortion ban prohibits medical providers from referring patients out-of-state for abortion services, the state’s attorney general said Friday that he is rescinding the analysis. 
    
            Attorney General Raúl Labrador said a letter from his office had been “mischaracterized as law enforcement guidance sent out publicly to local prosecutors and others.”
    
            “It was not a guidance document, nor was it ever published by the Office of the Attorney General,” he wrote in the letter to state GOP Rep. Brent Crane, adding: “Accordingly, I hereby withdraw it.” 
    
            Labrador’s initial letter to Crane last month said that the state’s near-total abortion ban “prohibits an Idaho medical provider from either referring a woman across state lines to access abortion services or prescribing abortion pills for the woman to pick up across state lines.” 
    
            Friday’s letter injects fresh uncertainty into whether the lawsuit filed on Tuesday by Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky and two doctors in Idaho will continue.
    
            US District Judge B. Lynn Winmill on Friday said the withdrawal does suggest “that the urgency behind the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order may have been somewhat or completely abated.”
    
            Brian Church, an attorney for Labrador, told the judge that the attorney general’s new letter makes it as though his March 27 letter “were never written.” 
    
            But that didn’t appear to assuage the concerns raised by a lawyer for the plaintiffs, who told Winmill that he wasn’t presently prepared to withdraw his motion for a temporary restraining order, which would prevent the state from enforcing the guidance for a short period of time before hearings are held in the case. 
    
            “I mean, Mr. Church was pretty careful in what he could say and what he couldn’t say. And the thing that he didn’t say is, ‘If your clients continue to make referrals you don’t have to worry that they could face enforcement action,’ right? He didn’t say that,” said Peter Neiman, one of the attorneys representing Planned Parenthood and the two doctors. 
    
            “Perhaps (we) get to a point where the emergency is gone. But right now, I still have a situation where I have doctors who need to tell patients what their options are and are not sure if they can do a complete, accurate and fair job of doing that without facing personal risk,” he said. 
    
            Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue in the suit that Labrador’s interpretation of the state’s abortion ban runs afoul of several constitutional protections, including the First Amendment’s free speech guarantees.
    
            “Labrador’s interpretation is unprecedented and amounts to a clear threat that Idaho will seek to punish individuals for speech and conduct related to abortions that take place in states where abortion is legal,” the lawsuit states. 
    
            The lawyers described Labrador’s legal opinion as “truly novel” and “shocking,” writing in the suit that his interpretation “risks further isolating Idaho patients by cutting them off from critical health care in other states that is legal in those states.”
    
            The plaintiffs will now decide whether they want to continue seeking emergency relief from the court or to let the lawsuit play out on a normal timeline, with their decision on that likely to be made in the coming weeks.

      Opinion: Idaho’s new abortion law is first to challenge the right to travel
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler

  Published
        2:12 PM EDT, Fri April 7, 2023
    ","
            This week, Idaho passed the first law restricting travel for abortion. Framed as an “abortion trafficking” bill, it criminalizes anyone who helps a minor get an abortion or abortion pills without parental consent.  Violators will face felony charges and up to five years in prison.
    
            The law could treat anyone, from friends to grandparents, as traffickers. Even when parents consent, a defendant has to prove it using an affirmative defense, a job that usually belongs to prosecutors. Idaho Republicans presented the bill as a common-sense protection of parental rights. State Representative Barbara Ehardt, one of its sponsors, described it as a tool to “go after those who would subvert a parent’s right to be able to make those decisions in conjunction with their child.”
    
            But make no mistake: Idaho’s bill is part of a broader attack on the right to travel for adults as well as minors, and the stakes of whittling away at that right are higher than ever.
    
            To understand the intent behind the law, we can simply look at where it came from. It draws directly from a model developed by the National Right to Life Committee, a major national antiabortion group, in the summer of 2022. The model stressed that it would not be enough to enforce abortion bans, given that people could take advantage of “existing State laws on telehealth and the proximity of States with less protective laws” to circumvent criminal abortion laws. Idaho’s abortion trafficking law was presented not just as a step to protect parents, but part of a broader way to curtail abortion-related travel. 
    
            Starting with minors is a natural way for abortion opponents to test the waters of a legal prospect that — as a state law that openly seeks to restrict the ability to travel from one state to another by choice — seems to challenge a fundamental tenet of both federalism and freedom. 
    
            The law directly echoes a federal law on the sex trafficking of minors, which criminalizes those who “knowingly recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, obtain, or maintain a minor” for the purpose of commercial sex acts, regardless of whether the minor was forced, coerced or deceived into that act.  When Idaho’s law is challenged, as it surely will be, abortion opponents will likely tell courts that if one law is legal, the other must be too.  
    
            And they will stress that courts sometimes carve out narrower rights for minors. We often take for granted that minors do not have the right to vote, even if the Constitution protects access to the ballot for adults. In the context of abortion, when the Supreme Court still recognized abortion as a fundamental right, judges upheld laws requiring minors to notify their parents or get their consent before terminating a pregnancy.  
    
            Never mind that a similar law would not stand if it applied to adults — the Court at the time struck down a law requiring married women to get their husbands’ permission. If Idaho wants to go after the right to travel, focusing on minors seems to be a logical place to start.
    
            But if attacks on the right to travel accelerate, there will be a far more wide-ranging fallout. The right to travel is venerable: since 1823, the Supreme Court has recognized the “right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to reside in any other state.” 
    
            The Supreme Court also addressed the idea of a right to travel in cases from the 1940s and 1960s. In Shapiro v. Thompson in 1969, it struck down laws setting minimum length-of-residency requirements for those seeking welfare. The Court stressed that “our constitutional concepts of personal liberty … require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited.”  The Court reaffirmed this idea in 1999 in Saenz v. Roe, which struck down a similar durational residency requirement, stressing that the right was so vital that it could be enforced when either private citizens or the government violated it. 
    
            But in recent years, as the nation becomes more polarized, the stakes of free travel seem higher. In 2008, author Bill Bishop identified what he called the Big Sort: Americans, he argued, were moving partly to live near those who agreed with them politically. This sorting amplified the nation’s political polarization; by 2004, half of Americans lived in counties where presidential elections were landslides.  Since then, the number of super landslide counties — where a president won 80% or more of the vote — almost quadrupled. 
    
            If identity-related moves are deepening polarization, it is also increasingly important for Americans seeking to match their hopes for the future with the policies in their states. State legislatures — and often, state policy — have grown far more polarized in recent decades. The culture wars, together with the Covid-19 pandemic, have prompted the migration of Americans to states where they feel a sense of belonging. In the past several years, conservatives tired of mask and vaccine mandates moved from big progressive states to Texas or Florida.  
    
            Now, states with harsh abortion bans are seeing the exit of physicians and medical students who do not wish to navigate a new criminal regime. Parents of transgender children are sometimes fleeing states that restrict access to gender-affirming care.  
    
            For many Americans, the right to travel can be a kind of deliverance. The ability to move around allows people to avoid sanctions and even criminal charges for choices that are central to their identities. The right to travel lets people seek out like-minded communities and define how they see themselves.
    
            If Idaho’s experiment is a success, other threats to the right to travel will be coming. For now, Idaho is targeting people within the state who are directing minors on how to obtain pills or procedures out of state, but other proposals floated by the antiabortion movement are more expansive, such as bills, modeled on Texas’s SB8, that could allow bounty hunters to sue anyone who has an abortion out of state — even if those actors were following the law in the state where the abortion took place. 
    
            If one state can so easily regulate what happens outside its borders, it will gut the freedom for Americans to seek sanctuary in places that suit them politically. It will not be a healthy sign for our democracy.
    
            In theory, voters can opt for the politicians and policies they prefer. But if courts begin gutting the right to travel, states could make it much harder for their citizens to cross borders. They may even try to apply their own criminal laws and civil penalties to out-of-state actors who help people who have crossed state lines. 
    
            When the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade, Justice Alito suggested that it was better to leave abortion politics to the democratic process. That way, the court implied, voters in each state could decide to go their own way, and if an issue mattered enough to someone, they could move to a place that reflected their views. But that is not what key abortion opponents in Idaho and other states like it are aiming for. They want to stop citizens from having abortions, anywhere, and for almost any reason. If the right to travel is a casualty of that fight, so be it.

      Democrats push abortion rights to the ballot in 2024, using an old GOP playbook
    ","

        7:00 AM EDT, Fri April 7, 2023
    ","
            Key Democrats hoping to keep abortion access a central part of the 2024 campaign are looking to the 2004 playbook of an old Republican nemesis: Karl Rove. 
    
            Rove was the architect of ballot initiatives to ban gay marriage placed in swing states to boost turnout for George W. Bush. Now Democrats are pushing ballot measures and an array of other moves to try to capitalize on a backlash to last year’s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which they say was instrumental in many of their wins in last year’s midterms.   
    
            “We should put the right to choose on every ballot across the country in 2024 – not just with the candidates we choose, but with referendum efforts to enshrine reproductive rights in states where right-wing politicians are stripping those rights away,” Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker told CNN.
    
            With President Joe Biden expected to run for reelection and Democrats forecasting tough races for key Senate and House seats, several Democratic operatives say next year is the perfect moment to turn Rove’s wedge-issue strategy on its head and get swing voters excited about abortion rights – the same way an abortion rights ballot proposition in Michigan helped power a massive blue wave in the state last year.
    
            The frustration with threats to abortion access hasn’t faded, Democrats – from Biden’s close advisers to organizers across the country – agree. Their proof is Tuesday’s blowout win by Democrats’ preferred candidate in Wisconsin. The state Supreme Court race came with high stakes for abortion access given the court is expected to decide the fate of the state’s 1849 ban, which had been dormant for decades but snapped back into place with last year’s US Supreme Court ruling. 
    
            “In 2024, voters will be deciding whether to elect people who want a national abortion ban,” said Ben Wikler, the Democratic Party chair in the state. “Republicans nationally will feel the fury that Wisconsin feels now.” 
    
            Even some conservatives are raising the alarm. After the Wisconsin election, conservative commentator Ann Coulter, referring to last summer’s US Supreme Court decision, tweeted: “Pro-lifers: WE WON. Abortion is not a ‘constitutional right’ anymore!” She suggested that new abortion restrictions are backfiring on the GOP. “Please stop pushing strict limits on abortion, or there will be no Republicans left,” she added. 
    
            Rove didn’t respond to a request for comment on the Democrats invoking him in their political strategy.
    
            But Democrats are counting on new restrictions being pushed by Republicans in Congress and in many state legislatures – including a ban on abortions after six weeks that could soon head to the desk of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who’s in final deliberations about launching a presidential campaign – to keep stoking fresh backlash. That will only be accentuated, they argue, if a Texas judge’s ruling in a pending case leads to a restriction in access to a common abortion medication, even in states where the procedure is legal. 
    
            Some in the party continue to push for economic issues to be their preeminent message. But abortion rights advocates and top Democratic operatives say they’ll look to tie every Republican candidate – for president all the way down the ticket – to the hardest-line abortion restrictions, which polls show are broadly unpopular.  
    
            And they’ll do it, they say, by tapping into what they think is a more widely resonant argument about bringing people together to push back on government overreach and stripping them of their rights. 
    
            “It’s time for Democrats to take this fight directly to the people,” Pritzker said. “Let’s make the choice for voters in 2024 crystal clear.”
    
            The ballot propositions are part of a patchwork, ad hoc strategy that collections of activists, advocates and operatives are sorting out on the state and local levels, as they wait for Biden to make a final decision about running and setting the tone for a national campaign. More than 20 lieutenant governors, for example, led by Connecticut’s Susan Bysiewicz, have started a coalition to share tactics and information as they push to protect abortion rights in their states. And groups of Democratic state attorneys general have come together in joint lawsuits aimed at trying to undermine a possible decision from the Texas judge against the abortion pill. 
    
            In New York – where six Republicans who represent congressional districts where Biden won in 2020 are top targets for the party nationally – the Democratic-dominated state legislature has already put a measure on the ballot for next year. Maryland legislators moved to add their own proposal to the 2024 ballot at the end of March.
    
            “There’s no doubt it will energize voters to fight for their fundamental rights,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN.
    
            Hochul, a Democrat who convened a special session of the state legislature last year after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, said that even though abortion rights didn’t appear to move many voters in her very blue state last year, there’s still a need for abortion rights politicians to push for more.
    
            “We’ve all seen the terrifying ways other states are trying to roll back reproductive rights, and we know it’s up to us to fight back,” said Hochul. 
    
            There’s a burgeoning effort by some abortion rights activists in Florida for a potential ballot proposition there, and the process is already well underway in the key battleground state of Arizona, as well as in Colorado. Efforts are also underway in Montana, people advising them tell CNN, and in Nevada – each of which will have a Senate race that could determine the majority. 
    
            Activists are also expecting Republicans to try get an abortion proposition on the ballot in Iowa, where state legislators are advancing a proposition that would impose new restrictions. 
    
            Asked if Pritzker would be funding ballot proposition efforts in other states, a spokesperson for the billionaire governor pointed to his past financial support of the issue, including in last year’s ballot initiative in Michigan and in support of the Democrats’ preferred Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate. 
    
            Nationally, Biden advisers say that Vice President Kamala Harris will take the lead on the abortion issue – as she did in the 2022 midterms – in the plans for a reelection campaign while the president would also push to codify Roe v. Wade as part of his own pitch. 
    
            Harris is planning to expand her national tour on reproductive rights, like her trip to Iowa in March, which was specifically geared to call attention to the Republican presidential candidates who’ve been landing in the state. 
    
            Harris aides say she has been keeping tabs on the medication abortion case out of Texas, warning fellow Democrats about the consequences for other medications if this Food and Drug Administration approval is reversed, but has also been reaching out behind the scenes – checking with legislators who’ve protected abortion rights in their states and with Virginia state Sen. Aaron Rouse about how talking about abortion rights helped him win a January special election that flipped a seat. 
    
            “People around our country are concerned, afraid, confused, desperate, in many ways feeling alone,” Harris said recently as she met with Iowa state legislators who support abortion rights in Des Moines.  
    
            Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who survived a tight reelection last year in which she spoke often about abortion rights, argues that the way to appeal to Republican voters and independents is to talk about how the GOP is being taken over by extremists. 
    
            “It is such a personal, emotional, important issue for people that my colleagues on the far right do not understand why it will continue to resonate,” Cortez Masto said.
    
            That’s in line with Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, the two national nonpartisan groups at the forefront of organizing the ballot proposition campaigns in 2022 and as well as those taking shape for 2024. (The ACLU just spent $900,000 on its own radio ads in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.)
    
            There’s a natural fit, operatives at both groups say, in talking about taking back power from governments that took rights away. 
    
            “We continue to see a lot of promise in appealing directly to voters who are so with us on this on the issue,” said ACLU senior political strategist Carolyn Ehrlich, arguing the ballot propositions from last year are “a roadmap for protecting rights in states where the legislature is a roadblock to progress.” 
    
            Ballot propositions that would have further restricted abortion were defeated last year in deep-red states like Kansas and Kentucky – major victories for abortion rights advocates. And after Republicans fell short of their hopes of a “red wave” in the midterms, those advocates and aligned operatives argue that the GOP has largely been pushed into a corner. 
    
            “I don’t think we’re going to have to nuance anything to voters. What we’re going to have to do is to communicate to voters where the parties stand,” said EMILY’s List President Laphonza Butler.
    
            New attacks on reproductive rights will only further enrage and mobilize their voters, said NARAL President Mini Timmaraju. 
    
            “Every single candidate for public office next year will have no choice but to go on the record with their position, and we’ll be there to hold them accountable or lift them up,” Timmaraju said.
    
            Talking about abortion has already proven complicated for the emerging Republican presidential field. Former President Donald Trump, whose three Supreme Court nominees helped overturn Roe v. Wade, lashed out after the midterms to say “‘the abortion issue’” was “poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on no exceptions.”  
    
            Former Vice President Mike Pence has remained an advocate of a national abortion ban. Other prospective candidates have stopped short of that while making announcements of their own: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin has pushed a 15-week ban in his state – except in the case of rape, incest and the health of the mother – as he eyes a potential moderate lane in the race. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who has announced her candidacy, says she wouldn’t support a full federal ban but has expressed openness to the 15-week federal ban for most abortions introduced last year by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, though she hasn’t taken a firm position.
    
            Fellow South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, asked on Fox News earlier this month about the bill in his state that would allow the death penalty to be imposed on women who receive abortions, said it was “a terrible idea” and then quickly shut down the conversation. A spokesperson for Scott, whose travel schedule in recent months has looked like that of a likely presidential candidate, did not respond to a CNN interview request to elaborate. 
    
            Similar bills are being introduced by Republican legislators in several other states, including ones that would reclassify abortion as murder and ones that could apply “wrongful death” to embryos frozen as part of IVF fertility treatments.  
    
            Anti-abortion activists aren’t leaving much room for compromise. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser declared in a call with reporters in January that any Republican who doesn’t back a federal abortion ban or restrictions that moved toward one has “disqualified him or herself as a presidential candidate in our eyes.” 
    
            That applies for candidates for other offices too, Dannenfelser warned. And, she said, she wants candidates speaking loudly and clearly about more restrictions they’d support rather than trying to avoid the issue. To do otherwise, she said, would be an “ostrich strategy.”

      Life-threatening pregnancy and childbirth risks can vary depending on where you live, study finds
    ","
			By Jacqueline Howard, CNN

    ","
            The risks of severe complications during pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum can vary drastically depending on where the person lives, a new study suggests.
    
            Among people with Medicaid insurance in the United States, rates of severe maternal morbidity – life-threatening complications during pregnancy, delivery or after childbirth – range dramatically from about 80 cases for every 10,000 live births in Utah to more than 200 per 10,000 in the District of Columbia, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. 
    
            That means rates of severe complications were about 2.5 times higher in DC than in Utah. 
    
            “We expected some variation at the state level. We didn’t necessarily think it was going to be a three-fold difference. So that was a pretty striking finding,” said lead study author Dr. Lindsay Admon, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan Medical School and obstetrician-gynecologist at U-M Health Von Voigtlander Women’s Hospital.
    
            In the United States, attention is growing on maternal death rates and the fact that the nation has the highest rate of mothers dying in pregnancy or childbirth than other high-income countries. Just last month, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that the rising US maternal death rate climbed significantly yet again in 2021, reaching 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 23.8 in 2020.
    
            But maternal morbidity remains a public health issue too, Admon said.
    
            “Maternal morbidity is 70 times more common than mortality,” she said. “These are severe adverse events as well, and I think these are the first time we’ve really had broad scale data at the state level about what the leading factors are in individual states.”
    
            The study authors – from the University of Michigan, Boston University, Columbia University and the University of Minnesota – analyzed Medicaid data on 4.8 million live births across 49 states and Washington, DC, from 2016 to 2018. They examined overall and state-level rates of severe maternal morbidity, occurring within 42 days before or after delivery. 
    
            “The data that we were able to put together reflects nearly half of all births occurring during the study period,” Admon said. Medicaid finances 41% of births in the United States.
    
            The data showed that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity among pregnant Medicaid patients, that did not involve blood transfusions, was 146.2 cases for every 10,000 deliveries – and those rates ranged depending on where the person lived.
    
            The five states with the lowest rates of severe maternal morbidity, according to the data, were Utah, with a rate of 80.3 per 10,000; Maryland at 81.3; Rhode Island at 84.4; Nebraska at 88; and New Hampshire at 91.1.
    
            The jurisdictions with the highest rates were Washington, DC, at 210.4 per 10,000; California at 190.5; Nevada at 187.1; New Jersey at 180.6; and New York at 174.6.
    
            The most frequently identified cause of complications for patients was eclampsia, a serious condition involving high blood pressure during pregnancy, which can lead to seizures. Other leading causes of complications were acute respiratory distress in which fluid collects in the lungs, abnormal blood clotting and sepsis, a serious complication of an infection.
    
            “For states where sepsis or severe infection is a leading indicator of maternal morbidity, an intervention might be to really focus their resources on early treatment of sepsis, on patient and community awareness of what sepsis is, and what the signs and symptoms are to look out for to seek care,” Admon said.
    
            “In many states, eclampsia, which is a severe complication of hypertension in pregnancy resulting in a seizure, was a leading cause of morbidity, and in those states, I would hope that folks would think ‘OK, we really need to educate our population, our clinicians about hypertension in pregnancy,’ ” she said. “We know that complications from chronic conditions are the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, and individuals in the US have been giving birth at older ages – with more chronic conditions, with more severe chronic conditions – for the last couple of decades.”
    
            The types of complications that can happen during pregnancy or childbirth also appeared to vary when the data was analyzed by race. 
    
            “When we looked at the leading causes of morbidity among the Black and White populations among Medicaid beneficiaries, basically, eclampsia was leading among the non-Hispanic Black population and sepsis among the non-Hispanic White,” Admon said. However, Black patients still had a higher rate of sepsis than White patients. 
    
            “There are six things that occur at higher rates among the non-Hispanic Black population,” Admon said: eclampsia, heart failure, acute kidney failure, respiratory distress, sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which causes blood clotting.
    
            In states where race and ethnicity data were available, the researchers found that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity was 2.1 per 100 live births among Black patients with Medicaid, compared with 1.3 per 100 live births among White patients.
    
            “The research really highlights that we have a long way to go still towards achieving maternal health equity in the US,” Admon said. “I think it’s structural racism and that there’s a great deal of implicit and explicit bias that happens with health care, and those are really important issues that we need to tackle.”
    
            The findings came as no surprise to Dr. Zsakeba Henderson, senior health adviser for the nonprofit National Institute for Children’s Health Quality in Boston, an expert on maternal and infant health inequities.
    
            “The main reason why I’m not surprised is that we already know that there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality in our country, with Black women three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes,” said Henderson, who was not involved with the new research. “And the main disparities that we see in mortality, we also see in morbidity.”
    
            In other words, the factors behind racial disparities seen in maternal mortality could be some of the same factors driving state-by-state differences in severe maternal morbidity rates. 
    
            For example, the area with the highest morbidity rates in the new study was Washington, DC. According to a report released last year by the DC Maternal Mortality Review Committee, nearly all of the pregnancy-related deaths in DC – 90% – were among Black mothers, even though they constitute roughly half of all births there.
    
            “So to see that DC had the highest morbidity was not surprising to me at all,” Henderson said. 
    
            “We can’t deny the fact that there’s a huge racial disparity, and so I suspect that states that have higher populations of Black pregnant moms, who tend to have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality, are likely to have higher numbers of severe morbidity,” she said. 
    
            The new findings can help guide discussions around what needs to be done to reduce rates of maternal morbidity in the United States, as well as the disparities by state and race, said Dr. Sarosh Rana, section chief of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine, who was not involved in the new study.
    
            “It’s nice to have this data for people who are policymakers at the level of the state but also physicians and institutional leaders like myself. This data will help guide implementation of quality improvement initiatives and provide equitable care,” Rana said.  
    
            The new study is “eye-opening” and “can begin to inform clinical care, quality improvement, and policy change with regard to maternal morbidity and mortality,” Dr. Doee Kitessa, a general obstetrician and gynecologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center and an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said in an email Thursday.
    
            “This study can help hospitals and states target quality improvement initiatives toward the leading indicator of severe maternal morbidity,” said Kitessa, who was not involved with the research.
    
            “While the data is based on billing codes and not patient charts, it’s an excellent start to understanding the causes of maternal morbidity by state and the disparities that exist,” she said. “This can help states and healthcare institutions begin to address and work to decrease the rates of severe maternal morbidity that are affecting the patients they care for.”
    
            Some policies have been introduced to tackle the United States’ maternal health crisis. At the federal level, the Black Maternal “Momnibus” Act of 2021, a sweeping bipartisan package of bills, aims to provide pre- and post-natal support for Black mothers, such as by extending eligibility for certain benefits postpartum. 
    
            Yet within individual health care systems, it’s important for physicians and leaders to pay attention to disparities in obstetrical care, Rana said, and among other factors that can lead to disparities, a key component is implicit bias in the care of Black women. 
    
            “I think it is important to listen to patients when they raise concerns and for expecting mothers to be aware of the signs and symptoms of pregnancy or childbirth complications. There are actually lots of signs that doctors should be talking about and that patients should be aware of,” Rana said, adding that common warning signs of preeclampsia and eclampsia, for instance, are headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and swelling of the hands or face. 
    
            “What I feel is, sometimes there’s a gap between a patient complaining and the doctor listening. There is so much data showing that patients, especially African American Black patients, are not always listened to,” she said. “That’s another barrier that a lot of our patients face, and it contributes to racial disparities.”

      Mother and grandmother to the same baby: Spanish actress sparks surrogacy debate
    ","

    ","
            A Spanish TV actress has sparked controversy after using a surrogate to fulfill what she says was the final wish of her dead son: to have a child.  
    
            Ana Obregón announced the birth in a cover story for Hola! magazine published earlier in April, detailing how she used sperm samples from son Aless, who died of cancer in 2020 at the age of 27, to impregnate a surrogate mother.
    
            Obregón – a 68-year-old socialite who is married to Italian aristocrat Alessandro Lequio – has long been a fixture on Spanish television, and is best known for appearing in series such as “A las once en casa.” 
    
            Such was the interest in the child in Spain that another magazine, Letras, tracked down the surrogate – a woman of Cuban origin that lives in Florida – and splashed photos of her on its front page.
    
            The story has sparked both legal and ethical debate in Spain, where surrogacy is illegal and sperm samples can only be used to impregnate a widowed partner within 12 months of the donor’s death with their explicit permission.
    
            Obregón told Hola! that the baby, Ana Sandra Lequio Obregón, was born on March 20 in Miami and will have a US passport. She will be registered at the Spanish consulate in Miami before flying home to Spain, added Obregón.
    
            Some have questioned whether Obregón should be able to bring a baby born via a method illegal under Spanish law into the country.
    
            But the actress says she has documents proving that she is legally recognized as the baby’s mother in the United States, and adopting a child born abroad is legal in Spain. 
    
            While some experts say the legalities of the situation are unclear, many legal commentators have said she is unlikely to face any legal issues upon returning home.
    
            However the case has also raised moral questions over surrogacy. Spanish law considers the practice “a form of violence against women.”
    
            Others have questioned Obregon’s claim that she was fulfilling her son’s dying wish.
    
            “It seems questionable to me that the wishes of the deceased would have been for his sperm to be used to impregnate an egg in the body of a woman in another country,” said philosophy professor Gonzalo Velasco in an interview with radio station Cadena Ser. 
    
            “It seems quite convoluted,” he added, likening the developments to a story by horror author Stephen King or melodramatic Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar.
    
            Verónica Fumanal, president of Spain’s Association of Political Communication (ACOP) said the announcement made her think of the dystopian TV series “Black Mirror.”
    
            “She bought herself a grandaughter with sperm from her dead son,” said Fumanal in an interview with Cadena Ser, who questioned the way in which Obregón had publicized the baby’s birth. 
    
            “She put a camera in her face and sold the exclusive,” said Fumanal.
    
            Obregón has sought to dampen the controversy, calling the debate in Spain “absurd” because surrogacy is legal in many countries around the world. 
    
            Spain is one of many countries where surrogacy is illegal, and in others, such as the United Kingdom, surrogacy is legal but restricted.
    
            These restrictions, in addition to high costs and a shortage of surrogates, encourage UK couples to look for a surrogate abroad, including in the US, where the process is more straightforward.
    
            Obregón told Hola! that surrogacy is “very normalized” in the US and that there is no debate like there is in Spain.
    
            She also revealed how baby Ana fits into her family.
    
            “This girl isn’t my daughter, but my grandaughter,” she told Hola! “She is Aless’ daughter and when she grows up I will tell her that her father was a hero.”
    
            Obregón also said that Aless always wanted a big family, and didn’t rule out repeating the process so that Ana could have a brother or sister.
    
            But next on the agenda is the release of a book which tells the story of the surrogacy, scheduled for publication on April 19.
    
            CNN has contacted representatives of both Ana Obregón and her husband Alessandro Lequio for comment.

            Broadway star Laura Benanti has opened up about a pregnancy loss.
    
            The Tony-award winning actress posted Wednesday on her legacy verified Instagram account about enduring a miscarriage while performing during The Broadway Cruise, which traveled from New York to Bermuda.
    
            The post shows Benanti on stage with a caption that began, “On Monday April 3rd, I performed on stage for 2000 people while having a miscarriage.”
    
            “I knew it was happening. It started slowly the night before,” the caption continues. “If it had been our first loss, or even our second, I likely wouldn’t have been able to go on. But unfortunately, I am not a stranger to the pain and emptiness of losing a pregnancy.”
    
            Benanti went on to write that, “It is a path I have walked before, hand in hand with my husband. But this time we walked it alongside some of the kindest, most loving humans I will ever have the honor to share space with.”
    
            She then thanked everyone from the audience to her band, the people involved in the production and her family for the support she received.
    
            Benanti wrote that she and her husband, Patrick Brown, “are so grateful for the family that we have, and the miracle of our two little girls.”
    
            “My husband and I are heartbroken but we will move through this together as we, and so many others, have done before,” she wrote. “I share all of this, not to garner sympathy or attention, but to remind the many people and families who have and will suffer in this way that there is no shame in this kind of loss. That you are not alone. And to remind myself as well.”
    
            Benanti and Brown married in 2015 and welcomed daughter, Ella, in 2017 and daughter, Louisa, in 2022.

      Health care providers sue Idaho AG over new guidance limiting out-of-state abortion referrals

    ","
            Health care providers in Idaho on Wednesday sued the state’s attorney general after he wrote in a legal opinion that the state’s abortion ban prohibits medical providers from referring patients out-of-state for abortion services. 
    
            Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, said in a two-page letter last week that the state’s near-total abortion ban “prohibits an Idaho medical provider from either referring a woman across state lines to access abortion services or prescribing abortion pills for the woman to pick up across state lines.” The letter was sent to state GOP Rep. Brent Crane in response to questions he raised to the attorney general about how far-reaching the ban is, according to the document. 
    
            After the Supreme Court gave states the green light last year to enact restrictions on abortion within their borders, opponents of the procedure began turning their attention to efforts to restrict people from obtaining an abortion in states where it’s still legal. In addition to Labrador’s new guidance, Idaho’s governor approved a law Wednesday limiting minors’ ability to travel out-of-state for an abortion. 
    
            The new lawsuit was brought against Labrador and several other state officials by Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, and two doctors in Idaho who as a result of Labrador’s letter, “have ceased having comprehensive conversations with their patients about out-of-state abortion options,” including referring them to providers outside of Idaho, according to the complaint. 
    
            Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue in the lawsuit that Labrador’s interpretation of the law runs afoul of several constitutional protections, including the First Amendment’s free speech guarantees.
    
            “Labrador’s interpretation is unprecedented and amounts to a clear threat that Idaho will seek to punish individuals for speech and conduct related to abortions that take place in states where abortion is legal,” the lawsuit states. 
    
            “Moreover, his interpretation depends on the assertion that Idaho law punishes abortions performed outside of Idaho – a clear Due Process and Dormant Commerce Clause violation,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote in the suit, referring to two other constitutional provisions.
    
            The lawyers described Labrador’s legal opinion as “truly novel” and “shocking,” writing in the suit that his interpretation “risks further isolating Idaho patients by cutting them off from critical health care in other states that is legal in those states.” 
    
            Labrador’s office declined to fully comment on the lawsuit, but said in a statement to CNN: “We look forward to addressing Planned Parenthood’s arguments in court.”
    
            In his letter last week, Labrador noted that a violation of the state’s ban, including by making out-of-state referrals for abortion services, “requires the suspension of a health care professional’s license.” 
    
            “This is a five-alarm fire,” Planned Parenthood Great Northwest CEO Rebecca Gibron warned in a statement. “Banning abortion wasn’t enough for anti-abortion extremists in Idaho; they now want to ban where you go, what information you’re legally allowed to obtain, and even what health care providers can say. Attorney General Labrador’s opinion is an egregious extension of Idaho’s abortion ban. We won’t stand for it.” 
    
            On Wednesday, GOP Gov. Brad Little approved legislation that makes it much harder for minors in the state to obtain out-of-state abortions without parental consent. 
    
            The law creates an “abortion trafficking” crime that makes it illegal for adults in Idaho to assist a minor with obtaining an abortion without informing the pregnant person’s parents or guardians, including by “recruiting, harboring, or transporting the pregnant minor within this state.” 
    
            Though a parent consenting to the procedure would provide a defense to the crime, according to the law, it “shall not be an affirmative defense to a prosecution … that the abortion provider or the abortion inducing drug provider is located in another state,” meaning someone could be prosecuted in Idaho for the conduct that occurred in-state as they helped the minor receive the out-of-state abortion.

      Whitmer signs repeal of Michigan’s 1931 abortion ban

    ","
            Michigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday signed a repeal of the state’s 1931 abortion ban, which the Democratically controlled state legislature had passed last month. 
    
            “This is long overdue,” the Democratic governor, who campaigned on protecting abortion rights last fall, said in a statement on Twitter. 
    
            The ban’s repeal came a day after a major victory for abortion rights advocates in neighboring Wisconsin, where liberals won control of the state Supreme Court, which is expected to decide a lawsuit challenging the state’s 1849 abortion ban. In the wake of last summer’s US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, protecting abortion rights has proven to be a galvanizing force for Democrats and independents, which helped power the Democratic majorities that made the Michigan repeal possible.
    
            Democrats control both chambers in the Michigan legislature and the governor’s mansion for the first time in four decades after last fall’s midterms, when voters also voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution. 
    
            Michigan’s state Senate majority immediately prioritized repealing the abortion ban – which prohibited the procedure even in cases of rape and incest, except to preserve the woman’s life, and had remained on the state’s books even after the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court ruling.
    
            The state Senate passed the repeal last month in a 20-18 vote along party lines after earlier passing the state House.
    
            “Finally ending this draconian abortion ban was made possible by our Democratic victories in the state legislature last year,” interim Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee President Heather Williams said in a statement. “This is another crystal-clear proof point that Democratic legislatures are critical for protecting and expanding abortion rights.” 
    
            Abortion rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America also thanked Whitmer for signing the repeal, calling the ban a “malignant threat to the health and well-being of Michiganders.”
    
            “Today is a crucial step in the fight for freedom and abortion access for Michiganders today, tomorrow, and for generations to come,” NARAL President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement.

      Florida Senate passes 6-week abortion ban

            Florida’s state Senate on Monday passed a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after the gestational age of six weeks, or about four weeks of pregnancy.
    
            The bill’s advance, which still needs to pass the state’s GOP-led House, comes one year after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week ban into law. The new legislation likely further burnishes the conservative credentials of DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, and it was met with outrage by state Democrats, two of whom were arrested during a protest near the state Capitol Monday night.
    
            The current bill would impose restrictions on telehealth abortions and medication. It would include exemptions for women facing life-threatening harm while pregnant and victims of rape, incest and human trafficking. 
    
            The bill targets both physicians who perform abortions and those who “actively participate in” them, and should the bill become law, any person who violates it could be charged with a third-degree felony. 
    
            The “Heartbeat Protection Act” passed the Florida Senate in a 26-13 vote. 
    
            A protest over the bill near the state Capitol resulted in the arrests of 11 people who were charged with trespassing after a warning, Tallahassee police said. Florida Democrats said state party Chairwoman Nikki Fried and Florida Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book were among them.
    
            “As the Democratic leader in the Florida Senate, it’s my job to a lead this incredible group of 11 Democrats, other than myself, to fight against these extreme policies,” Book told CNN on Wednesday. ‘Women will die as a consequence of this piece of policy.”
    
            Other abortion rights advocates say the Florida bill unfairly seeks to ban abortions before many even know they are pregnant. 
    
            “This bill will unfairly and disproportionately impact people who live in rural communities, people with low incomes, people with disabilities, and people of color,” Kara Gross, the legislative director and senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said in a statement.
    
            “Hundreds of thousands of pregnant people will be forced to travel out of state to seek the care they need. Many people will not even know they are pregnant by six weeks, and for those who do, it is unlikely they will be able to schedule the legally required two in-person doctor’s appointments before six weeks of pregnancy,” Gross said.
    
            The White House has also criticized the pending bill. 
    
            “The President and Vice President believe women should be able to make health care decisions with their doctors and families – free from political interference. They are committed to protecting access to reproductive care, and continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement when the bill was first introduced.
    
            State Sen. Clay Yarborough, one of the bill’s Republican sponsors, said “unborn children deserve the strongest protections possible under our laws.”
    
            The legislation underscores the ongoing efforts across the country to restrict access to abortion in a post-Roe world. Other Republican-led states have also pursued six-week abortion bans that have been met with legal challenges.

      Liberal judge’s victory in Wisconsin Supreme Court race marks political shift in key swing state
    ","

    ","
            The victory of a liberal judge in Tuesday’s Wisconsin Supreme Court election marks a significant political realignment toward the left in a crucial swing state, potentially closing the door on an era of Republican dominance with issues such as abortion rights at stake.
    
            With liberals now poised to effectively control the seven-judge court, Democrats are newly optimistic about saving abortion access in the state, establishing a firewall against any Republican challenges to the 2024 elections and potentially redoing GOP-drawn state legislative and congressional maps. That combination of issues proved a potent force in a race that attracted massive turnout and spending.
    
            And as they did in last year’s midterms in some places around the country, Democrats, once again, appear to have capitalized on a broad backlash to the US Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and a base still energized by the specter of another Donald Trump presidency. 
    
            Republican-supported Daniel Kelly lost the technically nonpartisan contest to Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz, who will begin a 10-year term this summer, effectively flipping control of the divided bench to liberals. Conservative Justice Patience Roggensack’s retirement opened the seat, triggering a contentious race that attracted national attention – and donor dollars. It was the most expensive state judicial election in the country ever. 
    
            “Anger about Roe hasn’t dissipated. Fear for our democracy remains. Voters are still alarmed by the MAGA extremism of candidates like Dan Kelly. And if this race is an early bellwether – we can safely say that Republicans didn’t learn their lesson in 2022,” said Sarah Dohl, the chief campaigns officer for Indivisible, a progressive advocacy group.
    
            Wisconsin has emerged as one of the country’s most competitive political fronts, with ground that’s expected to again be hotly contested in next year’s presidential and Senate races. But the state government – outside the governor’s office – has been bossed by Republicans. Since defeating GOP Gov. Scott Walker more than four years ago, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed roughly 150 bills and been hamstrung in pursuing large parts of his own agenda. Now, GOP policy gains at the state level – most notably its crushing of public sector labor unions – are in doubt. 
    
            In the years before Trump’s emergence, the Wisconsin GOP ran roughshod over state politics and sought to export its national playbook around the country. Walker entered the 2016 GOP presidential primary as an early favorite, pitching his state as a model for the nation. But like so many others in that year’s Republican field, he never got off the blocks as Trump thundered to the nomination. 
    
            That fall, Trump shattered the Democratic illusion of a “blue wall” in the Upper Midwest, defeating Hillary Clinton by fewer than 25,000 votes in the Wisconsin general election.
    
            But Trump’s victory also triggered a backlash – and a mini Democratic resurgence at the state level.
    
            Evers was first elected governor during the 2018 Democratic wave. He won a second term last year. And though Republican Sen. Ron Johnson held his seat in 2022, Trump had lost the state two years earlier by a little more than 20,000 votes. His false allegations of 2020 election fraud infuriated Democrats, along with many swing voters, and ultimately in this year’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race hobbled Kelly, who faced blowback for his role in advising GOP officials in their efforts to hatch a fake electors scheme
    
            And while the court could find itself ruling on election laws again, abortion may the most immediate battle to reach the justices.
    
            The state’s high court is expected to decide a lawsuit challenging an 1849 law that bans nearly all abortions, which had been dormant for decades but snapped back into place with last year’s US Supreme Court ruling. Protasiewicz, Wisconsin Democrats and allied groups such as Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America and Emily’s List all worked to frame the race as another referendum on abortion rights. 
    
            “For over a decade, anti-choice ideologues have held their iron grip on Wisconsin’s highest court, leaving voters hungry for change,” NARAL president Mini Timmaraju said in a statement. “Judge Janet’s resounding victory comes as abortion access faces an onslaught of attacks by extremist state courts determined to tear up our rights at every step.”
    
            Victory for abortion rights activists follows a similar result in neighboring Michigan, which voted last fall to enshrine abortion and other reproductive rights into the state constitution while reelecting Democratic women to its three most powerful executive offices. Those results continued a streak of successes for Democrats who dug in hard on the issue – a political winner in many swing states and legislative districts.  
    
            Kelly, the conservative in Wisconsin, was coy about how he would rule on a slate of potential hot-button cases, but his past writings and work for anti-abortion groups allowed Protasiewicz, who signaled her skepticism about the ban, to attack him on the issue. Her past comments also suggest a new day’s dawning for the labor community and Democrats seeking to upend the state’s skewed legislative maps.
    
            “Everything from gerrymandering to drop boxes to Act 10 may be revisited to women’s right to choose,” Protasiewicz told Wisconsin Radio Network in February. (Act 10 eliminated collective bargaining for most public sector employees.) 
    
            And with another presidential election on the horizon, her willingness to consider attempts to roll back or reverse restrictive voting laws or regulations could have clear national implications. 
    
            The state’s voter ID laws, put in place by Republicans, are among the strictest in the country. Wisconsin’s high court played a pivotal role in the outcome of the 2020 election, rejecting a Trump lawsuit aimed at invalidating Joe Biden’s victory – but only by a 4-3 margin with one conservative justice siding with the liberals. 
    
            In the event of another challenge like that, Democrats would now only need their allies to hold the line to prevent a similar bid.

      Gun violence in the US has become more lethal, research suggests
    ","

    ","
            A record number of people are dying from firearm injuries in the US, and new research suggests that shootings are becoming more lethal, too.
    
            Most victims of fatal firearm injuries die at the scene of the shooting, before they can be treated in a health care setting. But that has become increasingly common over the past two decades. 
    
            About 57% of firearm fatalities in 2021 occurred at the scene of the shooting, up 9% since 1999, according to a research letter published Wednesday in the JAMA Surgery journal. For this analysis, researchers used data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and excluded suicides and other self-inflicted firearm injuries. 
    
            Nearly 49,000 people died from firearm injuries in the US in 2021, CDC data shows – an unprecedented surge of about 23% over two years during the Covid-19 pandemic.
    
            And a shift in the type of firearms that are being bought and used is a key factor making shootings more lethal, experts say.
    
            “It’s leaning more and more towards military-grade, higher velocity, higher lethality type of weapons,” said Dr. Eric Fleegler, an emergency physician at Boston Children’s Hospital. 
    
            “That includes larger magazine capacity so they can shoot more bullets, the ability to fire them at faster rates, and quite frankly, just bigger, faster bullets which cause more damage to a human body.” 
    
            Federal data shows that handguns are the most common murder weapon, used in more than half of all homicides that involve firearms. But rifles, such as the AR-15, are becoming more frequently used. 
    
            Nearly 4% of firearm homicides in 2021 involved a rifle, killing 447 people, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That’s more than twice as many deaths and nearly twice as common compared to firearm homicides in 2015.
    
            Other external factors could also play a role in the location where a victim dies, such as increasing demand for ambulances that could affect emergency transportation options.
    
            Still, experts say that more – and better – data on gun violence is needed. 
    
            In the CDC data, for example, definitions to help differentiate location of death were lacking and many were coded as “other” or “unknown.”
    
            And the true scope of America’s gun epidemic is far broader than the deaths it causes, experts say. 
    
            “Deaths from firearm injuries are horrible tragedies, but they are unfortunately just the tip of the iceberg,” said Fleegler, who has studied gun violence but was not involved in this research.
    
            There are many others who suffer physically from gunshot wounds and a deep emotional toll on families and communities, he said, and more robust data is needed to understand that. 
    
            While there are more questions to be answered, experts say that this new research adds to evidence that an important step to reducing gun violence will involve addressing the types of guns that are available.
    
            “It reiterates that maybe there should be a look at solutions which limit the magazine capacity and access to high-caliber weapons, as well,” said Ari Davis, a policy advisor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Gun Violence Solutions.

      Opinion: The cruel twist that harms women in the military
    ","
			Opinion by Michael Bennet
		;Michael Bennet","
  Updated
        10:04 AM EDT, Tue April 4, 2023
    ","
            Days after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, I received a call from a former officer in the US Air Force. Like most Americans, she worried about how the ruling could harm the health, privacy and freedom of American women. But she raised another issue that is equally deserving of our attention – the harm to our national security.
    
            The number of women enlisting in the military has grown significantly over time. They now represent roughly a fifth of the total force and over a third of our civilian workforce. But when women volunteer for active duty, they, like any other service member, don’t choose where to serve. The Pentagon decides that.
    
            Before Dobbs, our troops had some assurance that, wherever the Pentagon sent them, they would at least have minimal access to reproductive care as a protected constitutional right. Not anymore. The Supreme Court stripped away that right, without grappling in its written opinion with the harm it would inflict on service women in states with little or no access to reproductive care.  
    
            Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, 18 states have rushed to ban or limit abortion access. Ten have no exceptions, even for rape or incest. Meanwhile, radical state legislators have introduced bills restricting the freedom of women to travel from one state to another for reproductive care. And several states – from Iowa to Nebraska – have only begun to chip away at a woman’s right to choose.
    
            Texas, home to Fort Hood – one of the largest military bases in the US, has posted $10,000 bounties for residents who successfully sue anyone who has helped in accessing or performing an abortion after it is no longer legal. 
    
            Alabama, home to six military bases, has threatened doctors and nurses with up to 99 years in jail for performing an abortion. The state’s attorney general even suggested using a chemical endangerment law – which is designed to protect kids from meth – to prosecute women for ending their pregnancies with a medication abortion pill. 
    
            In Florida, which is home to 21 military bases, Gov. Ron DeSantis just endorsed a six-week abortion ban. He may be unaware – or may not even care – that a third of women don’t even know they’re pregnant until around six weeks.
    
            These cruel policies are part of an escalating war on access to reproductive care, and we cannot allow our military readiness to become collateral damage.
    
            After Dobbs, it’s not hard to see why a woman might think twice before enlisting if the Pentagon could station her in a state that bans abortion – even if she is a victim of rape or incest. The former Air Force officer who called me understood immediately how it harms military readiness to force service women to travel far from their base to access care, to say nothing of the cost to their privacy when every single person in their units finds out about it. 
    
            A recent study from RAND Corporation found that Dobbs could increase attrition, decrease readiness and harm military recruiting. And that’s after the Pentagon just had its worst recruiting year since the Vietnam War ended.
    
            To help address these challenges, the Pentagon recently announced three policies. The first two authorize travel allowances and absences without leave for service women to access reproductive care if it’s unavailable in their duty station. This matters because service members may not be able to afford to travel, which is why the Pentagon covers travel for other procedures that aren’t locally available. 
    
            The third policy gives service members more time before they must tell their commanding officer they’re pregnant, providing women in uniform more space and privacy to decide if they want to carry a pregnancy to term – a decision that’s become a lot more complicated after Dobbs.
    
            I applaud the Biden administration for these steps to protect access to care for the service women who protect us, but the administration should go further. In the wake of Dobbs, the Pentagon still has no policy to account for the harm of moving a base from a state that protects access to reproductive care to a state that does not. 
    
            For example, the Pentagon is now considering whether to move the US Space Command from Colorado, which protects abortion access, to Alabama, which criminalizes it. Except in the most extreme cases – rape, incest and life of the mother – service members at the new base would have to travel out of state for the reproductive care they need.
    
            When the Pentagon makes basing decisions, like this, some of the factors it considers include number of available parking spaces, housing affordability and area construction costs. What’s not on the list? Whether the state prohibits abortion, imprisons doctors who perform them or turns its residents into bounty hunters against women.  
    
            Why should basing decisions turn on how much it costs to house a family, but not whether that family has the freedom to plan its future? It is absurd. 
    
            Securing access to reproductive care is among the greatest civil rights struggles of our times, and President Joe Biden has an opportunity to lead – as former President Harry Truman did when he ordered the desegregation of our armed forces. Today, at a minimum, that means creating a policy to account for access to reproductive care in the Pentagon’s basing and personnel decisions.
    
            Nine months after Dobbs it can be easy to feel powerless as one state after another takes aim at the right to choose. But here is one specific way that Biden can hold the line, strengthen our readiness and defend the freedom of service women who spend every day defending ours.
    
            Clarification: An earlier version of the piece did not fully account for abortion access on US military bases. It has been updated to reflect the Defense Department’s policy of providing abortions on base in cases of rape, incest and life of the mother.

      Infertility affects a ‘staggering’ 1 in 6 people worldwide, WHO says
    ","
			By Jacqueline Howard, CNN
		;Jacqueline Howard","
  Published
        6:32 PM EDT, Mon April 3, 2023
    ","
            An estimated 1 in 6 people globally are affected by infertility, according to a new report from the World Health Organization, which emphasizes that the condition is common.
    
            Rates of infertility – defined as not being able to conceive after a year of having unprotected sex – are similar across all countries and regions, Monday’s WHO report says.
    
            “In our analysis, the global prevalence of lifetime infertility was 17.5%, translating into 1 out of every 6 people experiencing it in their lifetime,” Dr. Gitau Mburu, a scientist of fertility research at WHO, said Monday. 
    
            “Lifetime prevalence of infertility does not differ by income classification of countries,” he said. “Lifetime prevalence was 17.8% in high-income countries and 16.5% in low- and middle-income countries, which, again, was not a substantial or significant difference.”
    
            Yet there are differences in how much people are spending on fertility treatments and how accessible such treatments are, according to the report.
    
            “People in the poorest countries were found to spend a significantly larger proportion of their income on a single cycle of IVF or on fertility care compared with wealthier countries,” Mburu said, “exemplifying that this is an area with high-level risk of inequality in access to health care.”
    
            Global public health groups typically call attention to overpopulation as a major public health concern, so the spotlight that the WHO report turns on infertility not only is surprising but is welcome, said Dr. David Keefe, reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist at the NYU Langone Fertility Center in New York.
    
            “That report did not surprise me in terms of the content, because it’s been known for some time that infertility is much more prevalent than anyone wants to think about: Having a child and having a family is kind of a universal dream or aspiration for people from every country, from every region. What surprised me was the World Health Organization coming out in support of it,” said Keefe, who was not involved with the WHO research.
    
            “It was a welcome acknowledgment of the other foot dropping on the population front,” he said. “The acknowledgment that this is a worldwide problem and that additional attention must be devoted to it in terms of policy and strategy is welcome.”
    
            The WHO report – described as the “first of its kind in a decade” – includes an analysis of infertility data from 1990 through 2021. The data came from 133 previously published studies on infertility prevalence.
    
            “The purpose of this analysis was to generate updated data on the global and regional estimates of infertility prevalence by analyzing all available data from different countries, making sure that we take into account different study approaches,” Mburu said.
    
            Based on that data, the researchers estimate that lifetime prevalence of infertility – representing the proportion of people who have ever experienced infertility in their reproductive life – was 17.5% in 2022. 
    
            The period prevalence of infertility, meaning the proportion of people with infertility at any given point currently or in the past, was found to be 12.6% in 2022.
    
            Although the data showed some variation in infertility prevalence across regions – with the highest lifetime prevalence at 23.2% in the Western Pacific, compared with the lowest at 10.7% in the Eastern Mediterranean – those regional differences were not either substantial or conclusive based on the data, according to WHO’s report. 
    
            The researchers also did not determine whether global infertility rates have been increasing or decreasing over time.
    
            “The data which we analyzed for this report was from 1990 to 2021, and during that period, we did not see evidence of increasing rates of infertility. However, the way the data was arranged, it was not really organized to answer that question,” Dr. James Kiarie, head of contraception and fertility care at WHO, said Monday. “We cannot, based on the data we have, say that infertility is increasing or constant – so we must say that probably the jury is still out on that question.”
    
            Over time, various factors can affect a person’s fertility, and age is one of the most important, said Dr. Emre Seli, chief scientific officer for the maternal and infant health nonprofit March of Dimes. Seli, who is also a professor at Yale School of Medicine and medical director of Yale Fertility Center, was not involved in the new report. 
    
            “Fertility decreases as the age of the female partner increases,” he said.
    
            “Fertility is really an emotionally taxing issue for those who are affected by it. It is a major source of stress to want to have a child and not be able to,” Seli said. “Most of my patients are women, and they do become affected by this at many levels, and they do suffer from lack of adequate research as well as lack of adequate insurance coverage to undergo the treatments that they need.”
    
            Infertility, affecting the male or female reproductive system, can be treated with medicine, surgery or assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization or IVF, during which an egg and sperm are joined in a lab dish and put into a womb once the fertilized egg becomes an embryo.
    
            “Infertility is a major and a widespread health issue affecting a staggering 1 in 6 people globally over the duration of their reproductive lives,” Dr. Pascale Allotey, director of the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research Department at WHO, said Monday.
    
            Despite that, solutions for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility remain “underfunded” and “inaccessible” to many patients due to high costs, Allotey said.
    
            “Infertility is an important public health concern because it can have wide-reaching negative impacts on the lives of the people affected,” she said. “WHO is calling for universal access to affordable high-quality fertility care, improved data to enable infertility to be meaningfully addressed in health policy and programs, and greater efforts to ensure this issue is no longer sidelined in health research and policy.”
    
            Mburu added that infertility can also have effects on mental health, raising risks of anxiety, depression and intimate partner violence.
    
            “Our message is that infertility needs to be included as a priority in responding to the needs of populations in different countries,” Mburu said. “This is because people have a right to expect to obtain the highest possible standard of mental, social and physical health as defined by WHO.”
    
            The new data from WHO reinforces that more people need fertility coverage and access to high-quality care than was previously thought, said Dr. Asima Ahmad, an endocrinologist and fertility expert who serves as chief medical officer and co-founder of Carrot Fertility, a company that helps employers set up fertility benefits. She added that inequities emerge in who has such access to care, such as Black women who tend to experience inequities in access.
    
            “These inequities, I’m not surprised that they exist on a global level, because we already see the inequities in the United States domestically, with how infertility impacts different populations and how some populations have limited access. And even with the access that they finally get, they, for example, will have a lower rate of success or even a higher rate of miscarriage,” said Ahmad, who was not involved in the new WHO report.
    
            “A lot of people don’t have access to clinically vetted evidence-based information around what causes infertility, how to recognize it, and then when you do find out that you have it, how to treat it,” she said. “The other, which is one of the biggest barriers that we see, is financial access to fertility. In the United States, a lot of that access comes through the employer providing, for example, fertility benefits, but on a global level, that’s not necessarily the case, and finances tends to be the biggest barrier.”

      Morning after pill brand speeds up retail access, doubles supply per pack

    ","
            One maker said it is responding to high demand for the morning-after pill, after the US Supreme Court last year ended a constitutional right to abortion, by speeding up availability of the emergency contraceptive in retail stores and introducing a new two-count pack.
    
            Julie launched as a one-step tablet of emergency contraceptive containing Levonorgestrel, the key ingredient in the popular Plan B emergency contraceptive that was approved by FDA in late 1990s without a prescription, at 4,500 Walmart stores nationwide last September. 
    
            The startup experienced a surge in demand for its $42 tablet at launch amid an overall spike in purchases of emergency contraceptive following the US Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in on June 24, 2022.
    
            The FDA-approved morning-after pill can reduce the chance of pregnancy after unprotected sex or failure of another contraceptive method like a condom, and is ideally taken within 72 hours. The pill, which is legal in all 50 US states, works by delaying ovulation or preventing implantation and cannot terminate a pregnancy. 
    
            While the plan from the beginning was always to make the product widely accessible as quickly possible, the Supreme Court’s ruling only compelled the startup to accelerate the timetable for Julie’s nationwide rollout.
    
            “The Dobbs decision and overturning Roe v. Wade last year rocked everyone’s world, our customers and our retail partners,” said Amanda E/J Morrison, cofounder of Julie. “It lit a fire under us to provide our product to more women and, more importantly, to educate women about emergency contraceptives.”
    
            In April, just seven months after hitting the market, Julie is now expanding into 5,600 CVS stores and 1,500 Target stores. The brand is also introducing a new 2-count pack of its emergency contraception (which has a three-year expiration period). The two-count pack rolled out at CVS locations over the weekend.
    
            “With the two-pack, we want to make it easier for women to keep extra emergency contraceptive at home, just like they would with other birth control options like condoms,” said Morrison. 
    
            The price for two-count pack is $70. Morrison said the pill works most effectively the closer it is taken after unprotected sex, ideally within 72 hours.
    
            Dr. Colleen Denny,  a clinical associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, said she saw the upside to a two-count pack of emergency contraception, which she hasn’t seen before from other emergency contraception brands.
    
            “It generally makes sense for barriers to emergency contraception, prescription and over the counter, to be as low as possible,” said Denny,
    
            “Emergency contraception is incredibly safe and effective at preventing pregnancy when used in the right time frame,” she said. “Relationships are complicated. There can be situations where there isn’t access to emergency contraception or women might not ask the partner to use it. So being able to have access to one pill and a backup is a great idea.”
    
            Kelly Cleland, executive director of the American Society for Emergency Contraception, said emergency contraception brands, like Julie, still have to work harder at making the product not only more accessible, but also more affordable.
    
            “I am in favor of expanding access, but this is a missed opportunity when a generic brand comes into the market with a high price barrier,” Cleland said about Julie’s $70 price for the two-count pack. 
    
            Cleland said a study done last year by the American Society for Emergency Contraception on access to emergency contraception in stores compared price at retail for branded and generic emergency contraception options. The report said some generic options were priced at $6 or less.
    
            Julie said it set the price for its single pill and two-count pack so it can fund its one-for-one donation program (in which the company donates one box for every box purchased) and to cover business costs tied to packaging and marketing.
    
            By overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court revoked the notion that the constitutional right to privacy included an abortion. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court expanded states’ authority to regulate or restrict abortion.
    
            A total of 26 US states have since implemented new abortion restrictions or all-out bans.
    
            In the rulings’ immediate aftermath, doctors and prescribers saw a sharp jump in demand for different forms of contraception, including emergency contraception, and longer-lasting forms of birth control. The rush on emergency contraceptives forced some pharmacy chains to impose temporary purchase limits. 
    
            “Every time there is a new development on restrictions to reproduction health care, there’s a run on emergency contraceptive. Our retail partners confirmed this,” said Morrison, adding that news events continue to influence buying patterns for emergency contraceptive.
    
            “The current political climate has emboldened Julie,” Morrison said. This, according to the company, includes expanding Julie’s available within communities through unexpected places like bars, restaurants and coffee shops.

      Opinion: The reality of gun violence in the US is bleak, but history shows it’s not hopeless
    ","

    ","
            Given the widespread availability of guns in this country and the hundreds of mass shootings that take place each year, many Americans are either haunted by the trauma of gun violence or fearful of the possibility that they or their loved ones could be the next victims.  
    
            But the issue of gun control seems impossible to tackle due to the stark reality of partisanship in Washington.
    
            After the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, the gun industry seized on massive commercial opportunities to expand the sales of AR-15-style assault weapons. The number of deaths attributed to mass shootings has also significantly increased since the ban expired. 
    
            Despite this, many Republican lawmakers have refused to adopt common sense measures that would curb the ability of citizens to purchase some of these weapons, bending instead to the gun lobby and segments of the electorate who consider these weapons sacrosanct. 
    
            In fact, some Republicans are trying to make it easier to purchase guns. Just days after six people, including three children, were killed in an elementary school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, state legislators in North Carolina overrode the governor’s veto and made it legal to purchase a pistol without a permit. 
    
            Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, visited a popular gun store in Cobb County, Georgia, on Thursday as part of his book tour. 
    
            Despite these tone-deaf and counterproductive moves, Americans can’t afford to be consumed by total despair and hopelessness when it comes to this issue.  
    
            We must reject the notion that passing legislation is impossible. It is not.  
    
            History shows that lawmakers have been capable of taking significant steps to strengthen the regulation of guns and pass gun control legislation at the federal and state levels. 
    
            In 1927, the Mailing of Firearms Act, also known as the Miller Act, prohibited Americans from sending concealed weapons through the US Postal Service. Rep. John F. Miller, a Republican from Washington, took action and an effective grass roots campaign garnered widespread support. While the law was limited in its scope — people could still legally send firearms through private mail carriers — it marked a breakthrough in federal legislative efforts. 
    
            The National Firearms Act was passed in 1934, after Prohibition-era criminals adopted the use of the “Tommy Gun,” one of the first portable and fully automatic firearms. The law imposed regulations and heavy taxes on certain firearms, including machines guns and sawed-off shotguns. The government also established a national registry to keep a record of sales.
    
            Four years later, Congress enacted the Federal Firearms Act of 1938. Interstate gun dealers were made to obtain licenses and maintain customer records. The law also banned the sale of weapons to certain Americans, including those who were convicted of felonies. The president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) even supported the bill. “I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons,” Karl T. Fredrick testified before Congress. “I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.”
    
            More modern regulations were instated after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. The Gun Control Act of 1968 expanded the rules on selling and importing firearms, prohibited certain individuals, such as convicted felons, from having guns and set the minimum age required to purchase a handgun at 21. “The government can help protect its citizens against the random and the reckless violence of crime at gunpoint,” President Lyndon Johnson said upon signing the bill. 
    
            And let’s not forget, there have been modern Republican presidents who have agreed to more stringent federal controls as well. President Ronald Reagan — who survived an assassination attempt in 1981 — signed the Undetectable Firearms Act in 1988 that made it “unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive any firearm” that could not be detected by a metal detector.
    
            In 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed the Crime Control Act, which the Democrat-controlled Congress had passed to tightened restrictions on semi-automatic weapons. Three years later, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, named after Reagan’s Press Secretary James Brady who was seriously wounded in the assassination attempt. The law imposed a five-day waiting period for purchases of handguns and required federally licensed dealers to run background checks on those purchasing a firearm. 
    
            In 1994, Congress passed a federal ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of certain semi-automatic assault weapons. Former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter all supported the bill. “This is a matter of vital importance to the public safety,” they wrote in a letter to members of the House. “While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals.” The legislation, which passed in the wake of a series of horrendous shootings, was not perfect. There were loopholes, since the law did not ban all semiautomatic weapons and it had a sunset provision of 10 years.
    
            The Republican-controlled Congress allowed the law to expire (and in 2005 passed a law that shielded the gun industry from liability lawsuits). Nonetheless, numerous studies have shown that the assault weapons ban was successful during the 10 years it was in effect. 
    
            There have been more federal legislation since then, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022 which provided more funding for crisis intervention programs, mental health programs, and security in schools and imposed a number of new background checks and sales bans.
    
            A number of states have also taken the lead. California, New York, Illinois, Maryland and Colorado are just some of the states that put tougher measures in place in 2022.
    
            But there’s plenty more work to be done. Many of the regulations that have been passed over the years were severely flawed. Some provisions have been dismantled, while other have been weakened as gun producers and buyers found ways around them. 
    
            The gun lobby and manufacturing industry still rule the roost despite having weakened in recent years. The Second Amendment continues to be used as a bludgeon against new gun regulations despite many legal experts arguing that the founding fathers never intended to allow unfettered access to guns. But the Republican Party has fully aligned itself with a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and the partisan divide might be growing — the 2022 midterms were the first in 25 years where the NRA did not give any Democratic candidates a high ranking. 
    
            With the filibuster in the Senate, Democrats have been unable to move forward with key measures that experts agree would be needed to meaningfully tackle this crisis. This has forced presidents such as Barack Obama to resort to executive action instead.
    
            In the end, breaking through the gridlock once again will require unyielding political pressure on elected officials. Members of Congress must continue to hear from the majority of Americans who do support stricter gun control. This must be an issue raised and highlighted every election cycle, and candidates should be forced to go on the record as to where they stand when it comes to the kind of weapons that are consistently used in mass shootings. 
    
            The Parkland students who survived the 2018 shooting at their Florida high school created a template for this sort of action. The student courted the youth vote, organized rallies and protests in districts across the country, and capitalized on media attention to keep the issue on the front-burner.
    
            During the March on Washington in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. famously spoke about the urgency of now. “We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now,” he said while standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial. “This is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.” While King was talking about racial justice, the message that he delivered rings just as true today with regards to guns. 
    
            With mass shootings still occurring at an alarming rate, the nation is increasingly traumatized by gun violence. Young children today are now subject to active shooter drills and live with the very real fear that a mass shooting could take place in their schools, with guns surpassing car accidents as the leading cause of death for US children and teens. 
    
            Despite this bleak reality, we must remember that federal and state legislative bodies can and have passed important gun control legislation. This history must be part of the national conversation.

      Abortion foes take aim at ballot initiatives in next phase of post-Dobbs political fights

    ","
            After a string of recent ballot-box victories for abortion rights groups, opponents of the procedure are redoubling their efforts – including, in some places, pushing to make it harder to use citizen-approved ballot measures to guarantee abortion access.
    
            An anti-abortion coalition in Ohio, for instance, recently unleashed a $5 million ad buy targeting an effort to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution through a ballot initiative – just as the initiative’s organizers won approval to collect signatures to put the question to voters in November. Meanwhile, legislators in Ohio and other states are weighing bills that would make it more difficult to pass citizen-initiated changes to state constitutions. 
    
            The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year left abortion laws up to the states, and abortion rights groups quickly scored wins on ballot measures in six of them – including in the battleground state of Michigan, where voters protected abortion access, and in the Republican strongholds of Kansas, Kentucky and Montana, where voters defeated efforts to restrict abortions.
    
            “What we saw in the midterms last year was a wake-up call,” said Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. She said helping local groups defeat abortion-related ballot measures is one of the top three priorities for the group’s state affairs team.
    
            Groups on both sides of the abortion divide have poured big sums into an upcoming state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin that has seen record spending and offers a key test of the potency of the abortion issue among voters in a battleground state. Whether a conservative or liberal candidate wins a swing seat Tuesday on the seven-member high court there could determine the fate of abortion rights in the state. A Wisconsin law, enacted in 1849, that bans nearly all abortions is being challenged in court and is likely to land before the state Supreme Court.
    
            More fights over ballot initiatives on abortion are stirring to life around the country. In addition to Ohio – where a state law banning abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy has been put on hold by a judge – abortion rights proponents have begun to push ballot proposals in South Dakota and Missouri. Most abortions are now illegal in those two states.
    
            And groups in at least more six states are considering citizen initiatives as a way to guarantee or expand access to abortions, said Marsha Donat, capacity building director at The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which helps progressive groups advance ballot measures.
    
            Ohio, however, looms as the next big abortion battleground on the 2023 calendar – with skirmishes already underway in the courts, the state legislature and on the airwaves. 
    
            A state “fetal heartbeat” law that prohibits many abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy took effect when the US Supreme Court struck down Roe with its decision last June in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. But the law has been put on hold by a judge in Cincinnati in a case that’s expected to end up before the state’s high court.
    
            Abortion rights supporters recently won approval to begin collecting signatures to put a measure on the November ballot that would guarantee Ohioans’ access to abortion. If approved by voters, state officials could not prohibit abortion until after fetal viability, the point at which doctors say the fetus can survive outside the womb.
    
            The initiative says that “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions” on contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care and abortion.
    
            It also would bar the state from interfering with an individual’s “voluntary exercise of this right” or that of a “person or entity that assists an individual exercising this right.”
    
            A conservative group called Protect Women Ohio immediately launched an ad campaign – putting $4 million on the air and $1 million into digital advertising – to cast the amendment as one that would strip parents of their authority to prevent a child from having an abortion or undergoing gender reassignment surgery, although the proposed constitutional amendment makes no mention of transgender care.
    
            Officials with Protect Women Ohio argue that the initiative’s language is broad enough to be interpreted as extending to gender reassignment surgery, an assertion initiative proponents say is false. 
    
            In the campaign aimed at defeating the amendment, “we’ll make sure they have to own every last word of this radical initiative,” said Aaron Baer, the president of Center for Christian Virtue and a Protect Women Ohio board member, told CNN. “They chose this language for a reason, and we’re not going to let them off the hook.”
    
            Lauren Blauvelt – who chairs Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, the group promoting the initiative – said the ad “is completely wrong” and called it an “unfortunate talking point from the other side.” 
    
            “Our amendment … creates the fundamental right that an individual can make their own reproductive health care decisions” and does not touch on other topics, she said.
    
            But the ad campaign highlights the effort to link abortion to the transgender and parental rights issues currently animating conservative activists. 
    
            Susan B. Anthony’s Pritchard said she believes that her side can win on the issue of limiting abortions but “we believe also that we broaden our coalition and broaden awareness of what these things actually do when we highlight the parental rights issue that is very real.”
    
            The initiative’s supporters need to collect more than 413,000 signatures from Ohioans by July 5 to qualify for the November ballot. Under current Ohio law, changes to the state’s constitution can be approved via ballot initiative by a simple majority of voters. 
    
            A bill introduced by Republican state Rep. Brian Stewart would increase that threshold to 60% and would mandate that the signatures needed to put an amendment on the ballot come from all 88 counties in the state, instead of 44, as currently required.
    
            Ohio state Senate President Matt Huffman backs raising the threshold and also supports holding an August special election to change the ballot initiative rules. If successful, the higher threshold would be in effect before November’s election when voters could consider adding abortion rights to the state constitution.
    
            Neither Huffman nor Stewart responded to interview requests from CNN. 
    
            Ohio lawmakers recently voted to end August special elections, citing their expense and low participation. But Huffman recently told reporters in Ohio that a special election – with a potential price tag of $20 million – would be worth the expense if it helped torpedo the abortion initiative. 
    
             “If we save 30,000 lives as a result of spending $20 million, I think that’s a great thing,” he said, according to Cleveland.com.
    
            The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center is tracking 109 measures across 35 states that could affect initiatives put to voters in 2024. Some would increase the threshold for an initiative to pass. Others would increase the minimum number of signatures – or require that they come from a broader geographic area – before an initiative could qualify for the ballot in the first place, Donat said.
    
            Many of the bills that seek to make it more difficult to pass ballot initiatives do not specifically target abortion issues. But they come as progressive groups increasingly turn to the initiative process as a way to bypass Republican-controlled legislatures and put a raft of issues – from legalizing marijuana to expanding Medicaid eligibility and boosting the minimum wage – directly to voters. 
    
            “Attacks, through state legislatures, on the ballot measure process have been pretty consistent and pretty aggressive for the last several (election) cycles,” said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which has helped pass progressive measures in red states.
    
            Hall said the abortion issue, while not the sole focus of current efforts to curb ballot initiatives, has put “additional fuel on an already burning fire.”
    
            In Missouri, a state law banning most abortions – including in cases of rape and incest – took effect last year after Roe was overturned. A group called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom has filed petition language that proposes adding abortion protections to the state constitution via ballot initiative. In recent cycles, voters in Missouri have expanded Medicaid eligibility and legalized recreational marijuana use through such initiatives.
    
            This year, the state’s Republican-controlled legislature is weighing making it harder for those initiatives to succeed. In February, the state House voted to raise the bar for amending the state constitution from a simple majority to 60%. Voters would have to approve the higher threshold.
    
            “I believe the Missouri Constitution is a living document but not an ever-expanding document,” Republican state Rep. Mike Henderson, the measure’s sponsor, said during House floor debate. “And right now, it has become an ever-expanding document.”

      Children and teens are more likely to die by guns than anything else

            Guns are the leading cause of death for US children and teens, since surpassing car accidents in 2020. 
    
            Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. Nearly 3,600 children died in gun-related incidents that year. That’s about five children lost for every 100,000 children in the United States. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to a KFF analysis.
    
            The shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville on Monday, marks the 16th shooting this year in grades K-12 and the deadliest since the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last year, according to a CNN analysis of school shooting data. Six people — three children and three adults — were killed.
    
            There have been 130 mass shootings so far in 2023, the highest number of shootings recorded at this point in any year since at least 2013, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.
    
            Child and teen mortality overall surged during the Covid-19 pandemic — driven not by Covid-19 deaths but by fatal injuries, according to a new study in JAMA. Firearms accounted for nearly half of the increase in mortality in 2020.

      DNA led to arrest in 2022 attack on Wisconsin anti-abortion organization, authorities say

            A Wisconsin man was arrested Tuesday in connection with a 2022 firebombing attack on an anti-abortion organization’s office in the state’s capital after DNA evidence linked him to the crime scene, prosecutors said. 
    
            Hridindu Sankar Roychowdhury, 29, of Madison, was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport on one count of attempting to cause damage by means of fire or an explosive, the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Wisconsin said in a news release. Roychowdhury had purchased a one-way ticket for a flight that was set to depart Boston for Guatemala City on Tuesday morning, according to the news release. 
    
            Roychowdhury’s arrest relates to a May 2022 incident in which a Madison office of Wisconsin Family Action, a political organization that lobbies against abortion rights, was vandalized and damaged by fire, authorities said.
    
            After investigators identified Roychowdhury as a possible suspect earlier this month, police recovered leftover food and related items in a public trash can, the US attorney’s office said. Law enforcement then collected DNA from that food, and a forensic biologist matched it to DNA evidence from the scene of the attack, according to the release.
    
            Roychowdhury was scheduled to appear in US District Court in Boston on Tuesday, and a date for his appearance in federal court in Madison has not been set. It is unclear if he has obtained an attorney.
    
            Madison firefighters were called to the building after a passerby saw fire there on May 8, 2022, and the firefighters quickly put out the blaze, officials said. No injuries were reported.
    
            Two Molotov cocktails that did not ignite were found inside the building, and it appeared that a separate fire was started, police said at the time. Graffiti reading, “If abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either” was found at the scene, the US attorney’s office said.
    
            The organization appeared to have been targeted because of its beliefs, police said. The fire was being investigated as arson, the Madison Fire Department said at the time.
    
            A few days before the fire, a draft of a US Supreme Court majority opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that the constitution protected a woman’s right to an abortion, was leaked. 
    
            The nation’s high court did rule in June 2022 that there is no federal constitutional right to an abortion, triggering weeks of protests nationwide.  
    
            Wisconsin was one of a number of states with an abortion restriction in place prior to the Roe ruling. Its 1849 ban on nearly all abortions is being challenged in court and likely to land before the state Supreme Court.
    
            If convicted, Roychowdhury would face a sentence of five to 20 years in prison, the US attorney’s office said.

      Opinion: Crumbley parents lose their appeal. Why that could be a game changer on school shootings

            The parents of a teenager who shot and killed four students at Oxford High School in Michigan in November 2021 are set to stand trial for involuntary manslaughter after an appellate court last week rejected their contention that the charges have no legal justification.
    
            The fact that yet another school shooting took place within days of this decision, as three children and three adults were killed Monday at Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, only underscores the urgency of finding ways to prevent these tragedies. 
    
            In the Michigan case, the appeals court acknowledged that holding parents accountable for their child’s crime is precedent-setting, but the judges said the unusual and unique facts of this mass murder require that prosecutors be allowed to make the case for doing so. 
    
            The appellate decision is a game changer in the fight to end the epidemic of school shootings in this country. It’s rare for adult gun owners to be charged in relation to school shootings because parents of shooters have a constitutional right to own a firearm, and most states don’t have laws requiring gun owners to secure their weapons when children are in the household. This ruling sends a powerful statement that no child kills in a vacuum – and that principle might be key to unlocking legislation around safe storage and preventing parents from buying guns for children who are a threat to themselves and others. 
    
            James and Jennifer Crumbley, who have pleaded not guilty, allegedly neglected cries for help from their son for months and dismissed serious concerns from the school the day before and the morning of the shooting. Yet even as they apparently ignored warning signs, the Crumbleys bought their son a gun and took him to target practice. Fifteen at the time of the mass shooting, their son pleaded guilty in October to terrorism and murder charges.
    
            Since 1996, we have studied the life histories of nearly 200 mass shooters, initially with funding from the National Institute of Justice, to understand their behaviors and find ways to stop them. We have interviewed perpetrators and people who knew them – including their parents – and have found that mass shooters generally, and school shooters particularly, follow a similar pathway to violence. 
    
            School shooters tend to be White boys and young men who are current or former students of the schools they target. The Oxford shooter is no different. Many of the facts about this perpetrator are also not surprising.
    
            In their recent opinion, judges cited text messages that the perpetrator sent his parents months before the shooting demonstrating paranoia and delusions. In our research on school mass shooters, 85% showed similar warning signs of a crisis and 92% were suicidal. Further, 93% of school mass shooters communicated violent intent ahead of time and 86% showed a high degree of planning before the shooting. Lastly, 73% of all school mass shooters had a history of childhood trauma, and there are allegations that was at play here, too. 
    
            These early signs should be helpful in stopping mass shootings. Unfortunately, in this case, the parents didn’t heed them. The day before the Oxford shooting, a school administrator called James and Jennifer Crumbley because their son was allegedly looking at firearms ammunition online during class. His mother texted her son, “LOL I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.” 
    
            Then on the day of the shooting, they were called into school because their son drew a gun on his math worksheet with the words: “The thoughts won’t stop Help me” and “Blood everywhere.” The Crumbleys didn’t immediately take their son out of school for mental health treatment. (They reportedly said they had to return to work.) Later that afternoon, he murdered four of his classmates.
    
            The Crumbleys did even more than fail to intervene, however, which is what makes this case so different. While a majority of school mass shooters obtain their firearm from home, according to our research, the Oxford High School shooter was allegedly given his gun by his parents. 
    
            James Crumbley purchased the weapon for his son four days before the shooting, using his son’s own money. Jennifer then took him to the range to practice with it. According to the perpetrator’s own court testimony, he later retrieved the gun from an unlocked container in his home and hid it in his school backpack.
    
            Though this behavior on the part of parents is unusual, it isn’t unheard of. The Crumbleys aren’t the only ones who overlook the warning signs, which is part of why accountability for them could prompt other parents to intervene.
    
            In our research, we’ve encountered three types of parents of mass shooters. The most common type create chaos and trauma with their parenting. These parents have often experienced trauma themselves. They may have suffered from domestic violence, addiction or mental illness, or they may have been victims of childhood abuse or neglect in the past. 
    
            Today, they may be emotionally distant or overwhelmed by their own problems, prone to outbursts of anger or neglectful of their children’s needs. As a result, they struggle to provide a stable environment for their children. Children who grow up in these environments may suffer from early childhood trauma, which can lead to a host of psychological and behavioral problems later in life, including violence if not addressed. These parents need support and services, not criminal prosecution. Universal trauma screening and school-based mental health may help identify the children living in these families who need early intervention. 
    
            The second type is parents who sense that something is wrong with their child but don’t know what to do or who to turn to for help. Several of the mothers of perpetrators we’ve interviewed fall into this category. 
    
            They may downplay problems or ignore warning signs because they fear a punitive, police-led intervention will only make things worse. This is why we have to be careful of the slippery slope of criminally charging parents in these cases – we want to encourage parents who are concerned about their child to seek the necessary help without hesitating for fear of legal repercussions. 
    
            But then there are parents like the Crumbleys, who did more than just not asking for help. They were allegedly told something was very wrong with their child but chose to ignore or dismiss warning signs while enabling and accelerating future violence by offering easy access to a gun. 
    
            They did so even though they were aware that their child had a history of violent behavior or disqualifying mental illness. For example, the father of the 2022 Highland Park mass shooter is facing criminal felony charges after agreeing to sponsor his son’s gun license after his son was accused of threatening to kill his family and after his son attempted suicide with a machete. The father has pled not guilty.
    
            It’s important to note that not all parents of mass shooters fit neatly into these three categories, and not all mass shooters come from dysfunctional families. However, understanding the role that parents can play in shaping their children’s behavior and mental health is an important step in preventing future tragedies.
    
            We can provide better support for families affected by trauma and mental illness, as well as better resources for parents who may be struggling to raise their children in a safe and healthy environment. And in extreme cases like the Oxford shooting, we can hold parents who directly influence these tragedies criminally accountable.

            Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin argued against criticisms from Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville on Tuesday and implored him to support the department’s officer nominations, which Tuberville has vowed to block until Austin reverses his stance on policies supporting service members seeking abortions.
    
            “Not approving the recommendation for promotions actually creates a ripple effect through the force that makes us far less ready than we need to be,” Austin told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. 
    
            Tuberville has said he would hold up Defense Department nominations for flag and general officers until Austin “rescinds or suspends” the new policies, which largely focus on providing support for service members who have to travel out of state for care – including abortions and other non-covered reproductive health care like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI).
    
            “The effects are cumulative, and it will effect families,” Austin added of the delay, “it will effect kids going to schools because they won’t be able to change their duty station, and so it’s a powerful effect and will impact on our readiness.” 
    
            Tuberville said Tuesday during the committee hearing that his hold is about “not forcing the taxpayers of this country to fund abortion.” 
    
            The Pentagon has been authorized to provide abortions in limited circumstances for decades; the 1976 Hyde Amendment said that federal funds can be used to perform abortions in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother’s life is at risk. Tuberville acknowledged that the “military has performed abortions for years,” but that he doesn’t “recall one military person ever complaining that we weren’t performing enough abortions.”
    
            The new Pentagon policies were released in response to a Supreme Court ruling in June which removed the federal right to an abortion. In the wake of the decision, around a dozen states enacted so-called “trigger laws” which severely restricted abortion access. Many of those states – including Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana — have substantial military populations. 
    
            “[O]ne in five of our troops are women,” Austin told Tuberville. “And they don’t get a chance to choose where they’re stationed, so almost 80,000 of our women are stationed in places where they don’t have access to non-covered reproductive healthcare. And I heard from our troops, I heard from our senior leaders, I heard from our chiefs and also our secretaries and this policy is based on a strong legal ground.” 
    
            “I really implore you to reconsider and allow our nominations to move forward,” Austin said. “It will make a significant difference for our force.” 
    
            Austin’s exchange with Tuberville was far from the only tense moment in Tuesday’s hearing. Lawmakers also raised issue with the timeline of the Pentagon’s notification of activity in Syria last week, when an Iran-backed proxy group attacked a facility housing US personnel and ultimately killed on American contractor. 
    
            A suspected Iranian drone hit the coalition maintenance facility at 1:38 p.m. local time in Syria on March 23, which is 6:38 a.m. eastern time, Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said last week. 
    
            Retaliatory strikes from the US were authorized by President Joe Biden later that day, and carried out on facilities associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps at 7:40 p.m. eastern time. 
    
            Lawmakers have said that they were notified about the original attack and the US response that evening with congressional aides telling CNN the notification was communicated around the time of the retaliatory US strike.
    
            Austin said Tuesday that the department notified Congress of both instances simultaneously because of the “short period of time” between the original attack and the US’ precision strike. Austin conceded to committee Ranking Member Sen. Roger Wicker that the Pentagon “should have notified you earlier,” and said they would do “everything within our power to make sure that we improve our performance.” 
    
            National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby also defended the administration’s notification to Congress, saying that time “was pretty compressed that day.”
    
            “We took an attack, which killed an American citizen and wounded a half a dozen others, and retaliated against that attack on the very same day, so there was an awful lot going on in time and space, and a very compressed timeline,” Kirby said on Tuesday. “We did communicate to Congress, and I think I’ll just leave it at that.” 
    
            Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, however, pushed Austin further on the notification timeline, alleging that Austin and his office purposefully delayed the notification because senators were voting on an amendment at the same time that pertained to Iran in Syria. The amendment, which was ultimately rejected by the Senate, would have halted the repeal of the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force until Biden could certify that Iran was no longer funding or arming groups in Iraq and Syria. 
    
            Austin said there was “no connection” between the notification and the vote on the amendment. 
    
            “The chairman and I were testifying that morning as well, so as soon as we came out of testimony we began working on crafting response options,” Austin told Cotton. 
    
            “Secretary Austin, I don’t believe you,” Cotton said. “I believe that your office specifically withheld notification of this deadly strike against Americans because the Rubio amendment, on which we voted midday, directly touched on exactly this scenario, not repealing these use of force resolutions if the president couldn’t certify that Iran was no longer attacking us in Iran and Syria that’s what I believe. Nothing you can say is going to change my belief about that.” 
    
            “I just want to say, senator, that that is absolutely not true,” Austin responded.

      Mother loses her 2-year-old to tornado while in the hospital giving birth to her second child

            When Dominique Green left her 2-year-old daughter Aubrey with her parents in their Mississippi mobile home Friday evening, she didn’t know she would lose a daughter and give birth to a son within 24 hours. 
    
            Green was heading to the hospital to give birth to a baby boy and left Aubrey in the safekeeping of the little girl’s grandparents.
    
            Her mother was also watching three other grandchildren, 8-year-old Kaleb, 7-year-old Kelsey, and 1-year-old Kensley while their mother, Jessica Drain, was at work.
    
            Green and Drain could not know that a powerful tornado would soon hit the Silver City neighborhood. Their parents had all four grandchildren and their own two young children, ages 10 and 11, in the mobile home with them when the tornado struck. 
    
            It tore the mobile home apart, leaving nothing but debris. Aubrey died from the impact and Kaleb sustained a severe brain injury. He is on a ventilator in an intensive care unit, his mother said. 
    
            They were among the many victims of a deadly outbreak of storms and tornadoes that over the weekend left a trail of destruction and killed at least 21 people in Mississippi alone.
    
            When she got the call, she didn’t believe what had happened, Drain told CNN. 
    
            “They told me that my son was bleeding out of his head, he was laying there, he had a seizure his eyes rolled to the back of his head,” she said, adding that she feels “pain, hurt and frustration for not being able to get to my son or my niece in time.” 
    
            Jessica’s aunt JoAnn Winston lives next to the mobile home and said they never knew the tornado was coming. 
    
            “I heard something like a train … my older son was saying ‘get down on the floor get down on the floor!’” Winston said when she went to check on her sister’s mobile home there was nothing there.
    
            “I didn’t see no house no nothing and I looked around and I seen the baby laying a little bit far from her grandmother … the ambulance had her and were doing CPR on her,” she said. 
    
            Aubrey was a happy child who loved to dance and was very sweet, Winston said. 
    
            She loved to play on a rocking horse that was later found lying among the debris. Drain said her sister, Green, was still in the hospital after giving birth to a healthy baby boy. 
    
            On Sunday, the family found out Winston’s brother had died from an apparent heart attack unrelated to the storm. Now they will prepare for two funerals while waiting for little Kaleb to wake up. 
    
            Drain has started a GoFundMe campaign to help cover Kaleb’s expenses.
    
            “I’m praying, I’m praying for day, at night every hour every minute every second,” Drain said. “They’re going to try to eventually wake him up to see what his brain does. They say they can’t tell right now because he’s sedated.”

      America’s kids are failed again
    ","
			Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN

    ","
            A more heartrending and quintessentially American scene is hard to imagine.
    
            A human chain of children, hand-in-hand, shepherded by police officers, fled the latest school struck by unfathomable tragedy. On Monday, it was Nashville’s turn to join the roster of cities made notorious by a mass shooting epidemic much of the country seems prepared to tacitly accept as the price of the right to own high-powered firearms. 
    
            The reality of what unfolded inside was inhuman, but it can unfortunately be imagined given the gruesome insider accounts that emerged from previous school shootings – in Uvalde, Texas, last year, or at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012.
    
            Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9 years old, were gunned down by a shooter armed with two AR-style weapons and a handgun, two of which police said were bought legally. Their names – known only to the rest of America in death – were released by police about the same time as they should have been going home from Covenant School for the day.
    
            Three staff, all half a century older, also died. They were Cynthia Peak, 61, Katherine Koonce, 60, and Mike Hill, 61.
    
            They were all murdered in the place that should be the safest: where kids go to school. But a plague of recent classroom rampages, distinguished even among America’s gun violence by their depravity, shows that nowhere is really secure. That’s why millions of parents often drop their kids off with a nagging fear about whether their school is next. And it’s why a generation of kids has endured active shooter drills that will mark them – just as children halfway through the last century dived under desks in duck-and-cover practices in case of atomic warfare. The difference now is that the danger comes not from a foreign nuclear rival but from within.
    
            Firearms are the leading cause of death in American kids aged 1 to 19, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation based on 2020 data. And while many guns claim kids in violent neighborhoods, not in the classroom, schools seem to be increasingly vulnerable. 
    
            According to data from the Gun Violence Archive, the Nashville horror was among at least 130 mass shootings so far this year – more than this point in any previous year since at least 2013. (The GVA, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.) Such events are now so frequent that there are some cases of people who survived one such event getting caught up in the aftermath of a subsequent one.
    
            Ashbey Beasley, who escaped the July Fourth mass shooting last year in Highland Park, Illinois, was visiting Tennessee on a family trip when Monday’s shooting occurred. She made an unannounced appearance on live television and asked, “How is this still happening? Why are our children still dying?”
    
            Revealing another tragic web of gun violence consequences, Beasley later told CNN’s Erin Burnett that she had arranged to have lunch with a friend whose son was killed in a mass shooting at a Waffle House in Antioch, Tennessee, five years ago, who called her to let her know her living son was in lockdown in a Nashville school because of Monday’s mass shooting.
    
            “This is where we are at, we have children living through multiple mass shooting (incidents). What are we doing?” Beasley told Burnett. Former President Barack Obama tweeted a video of Beasley’s original comments, writing, “We are failing our children.”
    
            Monday’s shooting in Illinois was so frustrating to people like Beasley because the rituals that followed it were so familiar – and so futile. Everyone knows that they will be going through the same routine again soon. Republican politicians quickly offered “thoughts and prayers” or stayed silent. Their Democratic counterparts demanded gun reform. Calls for an improvement in mental health care, which spring up after every mass shooting, are likely next. 
    
            At the White House, President Joe Biden diverted from remarks at a previously scheduled event highlighting the role of women in small business to address yet another school shooting.
    
            “We have to do more to stop gun violence. It’s ripping our communities apart, ripping the soul of this nation,” the grim-faced president said. Biden made the call for action that is now a defining feature of the ineffective political maneuvering that always follows mass shootings, whether they are in schools in Texas or Tennessee or a supermarket in Buffalo or on a university campus in Michigan.
    
            “I call on Congress again to pass my assault weapons ban. It’s about time that we began to make some more progress,” Biden said. The president understands perfectly that such a step was impossible in the past Congress and will be in the present one, where Republicans control the House and Democrats are still well short of 60 votes in the Senate. A presidential call for action has almost become a custom of mourning as much as a plea for political coalition building. Biden will likely be doing something similar again very soon.
    
            One of the top Senate Republicans, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, quickly tamped down any ideas that the deaths of three small kids and three adults who looked after them would make any political difference. “I would say we’ve gone about as far as we can go – unless somebody identifies some area that we didn’t address,” Cornyn told CNN. 
    
            The Texas Republican was a vital player in passing bipartisan gun legislation last year despite some fierce opposition from gun rights activists in his home state. The new law, which was the most significant federal firearms reform in decade, followed the horrific shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde that killed 21 people. While it doesn’t ban any weapons, it includes measures offering states more incentives to fund red flag laws, which allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. This was all a fragile Senate coalition could bear.
    
            Despite his previous role, Cornyn also expressed some frustration with Biden’s remarks. “The president just keeps coming back to the same old tired talking points. So he’s not offering any new solutions or ideas. If he does, I think we should consider them, but so far, I haven’t heard anything.”
    
            In one sense, Cornyn – who predicted no action on guns until at least the next election – was simply stating the facts. Biden does call for an assault weapons ban after most mass shootings. But to hear such a suggestion described as “tired talking points” is still jarring after Monday’s shooter was carrying two AR-style weapons and killed six people.
    
            The Texas senator also encapsulated the reality, frustration and limitations of the guns debate. He said that such bans would affect “law-abiding citizens” adding, “I don’t believe those law-abiding citizens are a threat to public safety.”
    
            Cornyn is right that most Americans who own such firearms never infringe the law, use their weapons recklessly or much less launch mass shootings. But at the same time, some of these weapons designed for the battlefield have the capacity to cause enormous carnage in just a few moments. The assailants that open fire with them in schools, shopping malls or bars have sometimes been law-abiding until their attacks.
    
            The political argument on guns is essentially about the rights of which Americans take priority. Is it those of citizens who own such weapons, even though a tiny minority of them use them to create mayhem and murder? Or should it be the victims of gun crime, like those kids and adults gunned down in Nashville, who had their rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness eradicated in a few seconds of terror?
    
            “Our message here is very, very clear: Enough is enough. We need to see action in Congress,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “This Morning” Tuesday, rejecting Cornyn’s remarks.
    
            A political tragedy underlies many of these mass shootings. In a bitter political climate, where any attempts at gun legislation are portrayed as an attempt to illegally snatch away firearms, there is no reachable common ground between upholding the constitutional right to bear arms and the wishes of many Americans who want stricter gun laws. 
    
            The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a hero of the conservative movement, wrote in the Heller opinion in 2008 that it was permissible for the government to regulate firearms while remaining faithful to the Second Amendment. He wrote that the right secured by the amendment was not “a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” 
    
            That’s a position that has long been overtaken by the Republican Party’s march to the right – a fact that Cornyn implicitly underscored in his comments. 
    
            This lack of any common ground on an issue of deadly importance parallels the wider disconnect in a politically polarized society that increasingly lacks a common cultural understanding. 
    
            This political paralysis means that there are almost certainly some young kids going to school as usual on Tuesday morning, who, one day, won’t come home after class.

      Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates clash over 1849 abortion ban in lone debate
    ","

    ","
            The two candidates battling for a seat on Wisconsin’s Supreme Court clashed Tuesday over the state’s 1849 abortion ban in their lone debate, underscoring the high stakes of an election that could decide the issue in one of the nation’s most important swing states. 
    
            Former Justice Daniel Kelly, a conservative, and liberal opponent Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz will square off April 4 in an election that will decide the balance of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. In a state where control is split between a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature, the high court could decide the outcome of legal battles over the state’s abortion laws, its legislative maps and more.
    
            The debate – the only one scheduled between Protasiewicz and Kelly – took place on the same day Wisconsin voters began casting early ballots in person.
    
            It’s the nation’s most expensive judicial contest on record, with about $30 million already spent on advertising and counting, as there are two weeks remaining in the campaign. Wisconsin is one of 14 states in the country that directly elects Supreme Court justice in this manner. 
    
            Protasiewicz focused her attacks on Kelly on abortion, with the state’s 1849 ban on nearly all abortions currently being challenged in court and likely to land before the state Supreme Court. 
    
            “If my opponent is elected, I can tell you with 100% certainty, that 1849 abortion ban will stay on the books. I can tell you that,” Protasiewicz said in Tuesday’s debate.
    
            She said she is “making no promises” on how she would rule on the 1849 abortion law. But she also noted her personal support for abortion rights, as well as endorsements from pro-abortion rights groups. And she pointed to Kelly’s endorsement by Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion rights. 
    
            Kelly shot back that Protasiewicz’s comments are “absolutely not true.” 
    
            “You don’t know what I’m thinking about that abortion ban,” he said. “You have no idea. These things you do not know.” 
    
            The debate took place before a crowd of about 100 people who were seated in an auditorium at the offices of the State Bar of Wisconsin in Madison. The candidates answered questions from a panel of three Wisconsin reporters as the audience watched in silence.
    
            The rhetoric grew increasingly bitter and testy, particularly on the topics of abortion, redistricting and criminal sentencing, with the two rivals standing several feet apart on a small stage. The differences that have been aired in a multi-million television ad campaign came alive.
    
            Kelly looked directly at his opponent and repeatedly raised pointed questions about her integrity, saying at one point: “This seems to be a pattern for you, Janet, telling lies about me.” He called her by her first name, Janet, rather than judge.
    
            Protasiewic only occasionally looked toward her challenger, but pushed back against an allegation that she is soft on crime: “I have worked very hard to keep our community safe, each and every day I’m on the bench.”
    
            Kelly accused Protasiewicz of handing down light sentences to violent offenders. 
    
            He cited the case of Anton Veasley, who in 2021 was convicted of child enticement and third degree sexual assault and was released after Protasiewicz stayed his five-year prison sentence with four years of probation, giving him credit for 417 days he’d already spent in jail. 
    
            “We look at the sentencing she has composed and the reasoning she used to reach those conclusions, and that’s just irresponsible to allow dangerous convicted criminals back out so easily with no repercussions into the communities they just got done victimizing,” Kelly said.
    
            Protasiewicz acknowledged that “hindsight is 20/20.” But she said Kelly was mischaracterizing her record.
    
            “I have sentenced thousands of people. And it’s interesting that a handful of cases have been cherry-picked and selected and twisted, and insufficient facts have been provided to the electorate,” she said.

      Ethan Crumbley’s parents should stand trial for involuntary manslaughter, appellate court says
    ","

    ","
            The parents of the Oxford High School shooter will stand trial on four counts of involuntary manslaughter for the four deaths their son Ethan Crumbley caused in a November 2021 school shooting in what may be a precedent-setting case, the Michigan Court of Appeals has ruled. 
    
            The parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have argued the charges have no legal justification and that they should not be held responsible for their son’s killings.
    
            In a written opinion filed Thursday, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of this case – holding parents accountable for a child’s crimes – but called the situation unique and unusual.
    
            “We share defendants’ concern about the potential for this decision to be applied in the future to parents whose situation viz-a-viz their child’s intentional conduct is not as closely tied together, and/or the warning signs and evidence were not as substantial as they are here,” wrote the panel. 
    
            The opinion said that those concerns are “significantly diminished” by the fact that Crumbley’s actions “were reasonably foreseeable, and that is the ultimate test that must be applied.”
    
            In the opinion, the judges cited text messages from the months before the massacre in which Crumbley told his parents about experiencing paranoia and hallucinations, including his belief that a demon was throwing objects around the house. When his mother didn’t reply, he sent her another message asking, “can you at least text back.” His mother did not text back that day and was riding horses with James at the time, according to the opinion. 
    
            Crumbley also told a friend that he believed he was having a mental breakdown and asked his parents for medical help but that his father told him to “suck it up” and his mother laughed, according to the opinion. 
    
            In a concurring opinion, Judge Michael Riordan noted that the case was exceptional because of how clear it was that Crumbley was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence – and the fact that his parents provided him a handgun anyway.
    
            “Our legal system does not, nor should it, criminally punish people for subpar, odd, or eccentric parenting, or require that children be deprived of any instrumentality that otherwise is legal to possess and use. Moreover, I suspect that parents do not reasonably assume, as a matter of course, that their children will commit violent crimes,” wrote Riordan wrote. “However, before us is the unusual case. EC was extraordinarily troubled, yet defendants nonetheless provided him with a handgun and, despite having discrete, disturbing evidence that EC contemplated harming others, did nothing when confronted with that evidence.”
    
            Jennifer and James Crumbley can appeal the decision to Michigan’s Supreme Court, which previously ruled that there appears to be enough evidence to move forward with a trial.
    
            Ethan Crumbley, 15 years old at the time, shot and killed four students and injured six students and a teacher at his Michigan high school in November 2021. He pleaded guilty in October to terrorism and murder charges. A hearing is set for May 1 where a circuit court judge will consider whether Crumbley, a minor prosecuted as an adult, can be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
    
            Crumbley’s parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were also arrested days after the shooting following a manhunt that led authorities to a Detroit warehouse. Accused of providing their son easy access to a firearm and disregarding warning signs, the pair were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter. 
    
            Prosecutors have argued the Crumbleys “willfully ignored the needs and well-being of their son and the threat he posed to others.” In a December 2021 court filing, they said that the parents knew their son was depressed and “fascinated” with guns.
    
            On the day of the shooting, school officials held a meeting with James and Jennifer Crumbley after discovering disturbing drawings their son made featuring guns and the words, “The thoughts won’t stop help me.” The school advised the parents to provide counseling to their son within 48 hours. But the parents declined to take their son out of school and he returned to the classroom.
    
            According to Ethan Crumbley’s statements in court, he retrieved a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack, and pulled it out of his bag in a bathroom before opening fire on his classmates.
    
            James Crumbley purchased the gun used by his son just four days before the massacre, according to prosecutors.
    
            Attorneys for Crumbley’s parents previously indicated that they would want their son to testify in their defense should their case go to trial.

            Within days of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s memorial service in late September 2020, boxes of her files and other office possessions were moved down to a dark, windowless theater on the Supreme Court’s ground floor, where – before the ongoing pandemic – tourists could watch a film about court operations.

            The abrupt mandate from Chief Justice John Roberts’ administrative team to clear out Ginsburg’s office and make way for the next justice broke from the common practice of allowing staff sufficient time to move and providing a new justice with temporary quarters if needed while permanent chambers were readied.  
    
            It upset employees throughout the building. They were aware that in the weeks before Ginsburg died, her staff had labored to ensure she had case documents at hand, whether in the hospital or at home. They were exhausted from all the memorial arrangements, which had attracted thousands of people to Washington.   
    
            But the confirmation of then-President Donald Trump’s chosen successor, Indiana-based US appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett, was as much a fait accompli at the court as in the political sphere.  
    
            That behind-the-scenes drama and internal tensions over cases that followed, accelerated by all three Trump appointees, led to a new level of distrust and discord among the justices that lingers today.    
    
            Almost as abruptly as Ginsburg’s possessions were cast out, the court’s 6-3 conservative majority began ravaging the vestiges of Ginsburg’s work on women’s rights and access to abortion. The internal negotiations on the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which ended up reversing nearly a half century of abortion rights, were tightly tied to Ginsburg’s death and the succession of Barrett.   
    
            The abortion controversy also surfaced a pattern of double-signaling to colleagues and people beyond the court by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second appointee. Kavanaugh has long been concerned with appearances. He remains torn between his allegiance to conservative backers from his 2018 nomination fight and his desire for acceptance among the legal elites who shunned him.  
    
            Since Kavanaugh joined the bench, a documented pattern reflects the lengths that he goes to in order to appear conciliatory. 
    
            A previously unreported example occurred in 2019, when Kavanaugh joined a dissent denigrating a US district judge for rejecting the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form. A Supreme Court source revealed that Kavanaugh then quietly sent the judge a personal note saying he actually respected him.  
    
            Kavanaugh similarly sought to have it both ways a few months later, when he tried to soften a vote against LGBTQ rights by asserting respect for gay interests.  
    
            “Millions of gay and lesbian Americans have worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law,” he wrote in dissent as a six-justice majority expansively interpreted a 1964 law prohibiting sex discrimination so that it would cover LGBTQ employees. “They have exhibited extraordinary vision, tenacity, and grit – battling often steep odds in the legislative and judicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives.”  
    
            The state of Mississippi and other opponents of abortion had perfect timing. Ginsburg was still alive and serving in June 2020 when the state first filed its petition to the Supreme Court defending a ban on abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy. The state had lost in lower courts because its prohibition clashed with the 1973 Roe v. Wade and the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld the right of a woman to end a pregnancy before the fetus was viable, that is, could live outside the womb.    
    
            Around the time the justices were scheduled to first decide whether to grant or reject the Mississippi appeal, Ginsburg died.  
    
            After Barrett settled in, the court announced in May 2021 that it would hear Mississippi’s appeal later in the year. The case had enormous potential. Roe’s viability standard was nearly 50 years old. And in previous cases, the justices had consistently accepted the fetal viability benchmark established in Roe, that women were free to make the abortion choice before viability, at about 23 weeks.  
    
            Meanwhile, other Republican-run states were inspired by Barrett’s succession of Ginsburg to write anti-abortion laws. The Texas Legislature passed a statute, SB 8, that forbade abortions at the first sign of cardiac activity, roughly six weeks into pregnancy. Legislators added a shrewd twist to their so-called “heartbeat law,” delegating the enforcement of the ban to private citizens. It was a way to insulate state officials from lawsuits and try to ensure that judges would not block enforcement of the law.    
    
            So before they got to the Mississippi case, Supreme Court justices heard the Texas controversy on an expedited schedule. A five-justice far-right majority – Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett – a lineup made possible only because Ginsburg was no longer on the bench – decided to allow the Texas law to take effect.  
    
            Kavanaugh and Barrett, however, had appeared during oral arguments in that Texas case to be going in the opposite direction, to vote to block the Texas law. Kavanaugh particularly questioned whether, if states could block abortion rights, they could do the same for firearm rights and free speech. Barrett sounded troubled that the Texas law was written in a way that would deny any challenger a “full constitutional defense.”  
    
            Their remarks were widely interpreted by outside observers to suggest they were ready to rule against Texas and to allow abortion clinics to challenge the law preventing abortions after about six weeks. More importantly, some of the justices who believed that law blatantly unconstitutional interpreted their colleagues’ comments that way, too, and believed there would be a turning point in the Texas case. But when the votes were cast in private, the justices on the left realized they had been misled by what they had heard in public.   
    
            Kavanaugh often conveyed conflicting signals as he dealt with fellow justices. In an abortion case in 2020, with Ginsburg still sitting, there was a five-justice majority to invalidate a Louisiana physician regulation based on a 2016 precedent involving similar physician credentialling. Roberts had joined the four liberals at the time to oppose the regulation, based on precedent.    
    
            Kavanaugh suggested in a series of confidential memos to his colleagues that he wanted to avoid resolving the merits of the case brought by abortion providers and instead send it back to lower court judges for further hearings. Kavanaugh argued it was not clear that physicians would be unable to obtain credentials and abortion clinics would shutter – a point that conflicted with the trial judge’s finding after a six-day trial.  
    
            No other justice wanted to sidestep the case, and in the end he joined dissenters who favored Louisiana over the abortion providers challenging the physician requirement.    
    
            Kavanaugh’s criticism of a lower court judge’s findings went further in the census questionnaire dispute. He was one of three justices who particularly denigrated US District Judge Jesse Furman for rejecting the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form. Furman had discovered and emphasized in his decision that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was motivated by a clutch of outside Trump political advisers, including Steve Bannon.  
    
            Writing for a dissenting bloc, Thomas suggested Furman was biased and had crossed a line – a bold complaint against a fellow federal judge – declaring, “I do not deny that a judge predisposed to distrust the Secretary or the administration could arrange those facts on a corkboard and – with a jar of pins and a spool of string – create an eye-catching conspiracy web.” 
    
            The later Kavanaugh note to Furman showed his efforts to appear conciliatory: He joined an opinion challenging Furman’s integrity but then wrote the judge a note that pleaded the opposite.   
    
            By late 2021, it was becoming clear that Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett wanted to end Roe, irrespective of what they had told senators about adherence to precedent during their confirmation hearings.    
    
            Barrett had been especially skillful in deflecting questions about her personal opposition to abortion during her hearing, even as then-Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, declared, “This is the first time in American history that we’ve nominated a woman who’s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.”  
    
            During the hearings, then-California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, now vice president, said, “I would suggest that we not pretend that we don’t know how this nominee views a woman’s right to choose and make her own health care decisions.”  
    
            Barrett rejected Harris’ implication that she would be persuaded by her personal feelings against abortion when resolving a case, telling senators of Harris, “No, she is not right.”  
    
            Just over a year later, during the justices’ December 2021 internal debate on the Mississippi abortion law, Roberts tried to offer a compromise that would uphold the 15-week ban (dismantling the viability firewall) but preserve some right to abortion in the earlier weeks of pregnancy.  
    
            The five justices to his right, however, wanted to entirely end the constitutional rights of Roe.  
    
            In past abortion cases, votes sometimes shifted over the weeks and months of closed-door negotiations. But this majority was different. It would not be shaken by entreaties from Roberts or the three liberal justices then serving, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.  
    
            The court was hurtling toward a June 2022 announcement ending nearly a half century of constitutional interpretation. When a draft of its decision, authored by Alito, was leaked and published by Politico on May 2, suddenly it was all in the public eye. The stridently written 98-page document had been foreshadowed by the court’s action in the earlier Texas dispute, in which the justices had already allowed the dissolution of abortion rights in the country’s second most populous state.  
    
            The leak also had the effect of hindering internal debate among the justices in the Dobbs case. Justices later privately revealed that public disclosure of the 5-4 split and the tone of the opinion outright rejecting Roe v. Wade effectively froze the votes. That eliminated the opportunity for compromise, as can happen with hard-fought cases in the final weeks of negotiation.  
    
            The leak that accompanied that radical revision of women’s privacy rights further revealed a distrust among the justices that had been building for years.     
    
            Thomas, who usually spoke only of how well the justices got along, told a Dallas audience that May that the justices couldn’t help but look over their shoulders, wondering who was responsible for the disclosure of the Dobbs draft.  
    
            Thomas contrasted that with the court atmosphere before 2005, when Roberts joined the court as chief justice. Before then, Thomas said, “We actually trusted each other.”  
    
            Asked about the celebrated friendship of Ginsburg and the late Scalia, who served 1986-2016, Thomas said, “This is not the court of that era. I sat with Ruth Ginsburg for almost 30 years. And she was actually an easy colleague for me. You knew where she was.”     
    
            It was a revealing comment from a justice who himself was known inside the court for abhorring the kind of cagey negotiations Roberts often undertook.  
    
            But changes in the two years since Barrett had succeeded Ginsburg were even more consequential. Thomas, who had often been a solo dissenter, was prevailing across the board. He and Alito, both in their 70s, were demonstrating a sense of urgency, to take advantage of the majority they had and thrust the law rightward on multiple fronts.   
    
            The remaining liberals were profoundly frustrated. In 2020, they had help craft decisions that favored abortion rights, LGBTQ protections and preserving the Obama-era program giving some young immigrants a path to citizenship. Just one year earlier, in 2021, they had managed to be part of several compromises with conservatives, for example, to reject the third legal challenge to Obamacare.    
    
            Now they expected to win nothing – then and in the future. When the three liberals worked together on a joint dissent to the Mississippi case, they added forebodingly: “No one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.”

      Judge temporarily halts Wyoming abortion ban amid legal challenge
    ","

    ","
            A Wyoming district court judge has temporarily blocked a state abortion ban that went into effect over the weekend, count documents show. 
    
            Judge Melissa Owens of the Teton County District Court granted the restraining order Wednesday, blocking enforcement of the anti-abortion law while the court considers a legal challenge brought against the state by abortion providers.
    
            The sweeping ban, called the “Life is a Human Right Act,” went into effect Sunday and prohibits abortion in most circumstances, only providing exceptions for incest, sexual assault, cases of “lethal fetal anomaly” or when the pregnant person’s life is in danger.
    
            Violation of the law is a felony and carries penalties of up to five years in prison and a $20,000 fine.
    
            “Abortion as defined in this act is not health care,” the act says, citing the Wyoming constitution. “Instead of being health care, abortion is the intentional termination of the life of an unborn baby.”
    
            When the law passed Friday, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, expressed concern that “this new law will only result in a new lawsuit, which will delay any resolution to the constitutionality of the abortion ban in Wyoming,” his office said in a statement.
    
            Also on Friday, Gordon signed a separate bill into law that makes it a felony to prescribe, sell, or use abortion medications. The legislation takes effect July 1.
    
            Following the passage of the two laws, Mini Timmaraju, president of abortion-rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America, said the bans “should alarm everybody in every corner of our country.”
    
            There’s no stone that anti-choice extremists will leave unturned as they seek to do everything they can to ensure that abortion is banned across the nation,” Timmaraju said in a statement. “This first-of-its-kind ban on medication abortion, as well as the total ban, are just the latest proof.”

      Record-breaking Wisconsin Supreme Court race could decide abortion rights and 2024 rules in key battleground
    ","

    ","
            In one of the nation’s most important political battlegrounds, the future of election laws, abortion rights and more could hinge on the outcome of an April race for a seat that will determine control of the state Supreme Court. 
    
            Power in Wisconsin – the state that was the tipping point in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections – is divided between a Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and a Republican-controlled legislature. 
    
            That split has placed the state Supreme Court, where conservatives currently hold a 4-3 majority, at the center of pitched, partisan battles over several key issues, including abortion rights, election challenges, and legislative and congressional district lines. 
    
            And because Wisconsin is one of 14 states to directly elect Supreme Court justices, the race between Janet Protasiewicz, the liberal Milwaukee County judge, and Daniel Kelly, the conservative former state Supreme Court justice, has shattered spending records on statewide judicial races, with more than $30 million in television advertising already flooding the state’s airwaves ahead of the April 4 election. 
    
            The two are battling to replace Justice Patience Roggensack, a conservative. A Protasiewicz victory would tip the balance of power on the seven-member court.
    
            Ben Wikler, chairman Wisconsin Democratic Party, said the implications of the Supreme Court race could not be overstated for the state and the nation.
    
            “This election is the most important election in the country in 2023 because Wisconsin is the tipping point state for presidential elections,” Wikler said in an interview Tuesday. “Whoever wins the Supreme Court race will cast the deciding vote on questions like voting rights decisions, our abortion ban and even potentially whether to overturn the results of the 2024 presidential election.”
    
            The court played a pivotal role in the outcome of Wisconsin’s 2020 election: Justices voted 4-3, with conservative Brian Hagedorn joining the court’s three liberals, to reject former President Donald Trump’s efforts to throw out ballots in Democratic-leaning counties.
    
            The court has also shaped Wisconsin’s election laws. It has voted in recent years to prohibit ballot drop boxes and have selected maps that cemented Republicans’ solid majority in the state legislature.
    
            The April 4 election will set the stage for the 2024 presidential race, with the court likely to be asked to weigh in again on election rules, including the state’s voter identification law, and potentially sort through another round of legal challenges afterward. 
    
            Those high stakes have turned the state Supreme Court race into one of the nation’s most closely watched contests of 2023.
    
            “It’s going to be close,” former President Barack Obama said Tuesday in a tweet urging Wisconsin voters to cast their ballots early. 
    
            The race’s focal point, though, has been abortion, after the state’s 1849 law banning abortion in nearly all cases took effect in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade and leave abortion laws up to the states. 
    
            A lawsuit challenging that 1849 law could reach the state Supreme Court as soon as this fall. And while the two candidates are refusing to say how they’d rule, they’re leaving little doubt about their leanings. 
    
            In their lone debate Tuesday, Protasiewicz said she is “making no promises” on how she would rule. But she also noted her personal support for abortion rights, as well as endorsements from pro-abortion rights groups. And she pointed to Kelly’s endorsement by Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion rights. 
    
            “If my opponent is elected, I can tell you with 100% certainty, that 1849 abortion ban will stay on the books. I can tell you that,” Protasiewicz said.
    
            Kelly shot back that Protasiewicz’s comments are “absolutely not true.” 
    
            “You don’t know what I’m thinking about that abortion ban,” he said. “You have no idea. These things you do not know.” 
    
            Still, pro-abortion rights and anti-abortion forces have poured money and volunteer hours into the race. 
    
            Gracie Skogman, the legislative director for Wisconsin Right to Life, said hundreds of volunteers across the state were mobilizing around the Supreme Court contest because of their deep opposition to abortion. She conceded it was a challenge making people aware of the April 4 election, but said voters would be motivated to suppport Kelly.
    
            “We have a massive base – thousands of people all across the state – but we need to get them to turn out,” Skogman said in an interview. “From a pro-life perspective, there is more at stake in this election than ever before in our state.”
    
            Even though Kelly has not explicitly said he would oppose an expansion of abortion rights, Skogman said his history on the issue made her group comfortable that he would.
    
            “Our endorsement is based on his judicial philosophy,” Skogman said. “Judge Kelly is very clear that he does not believe in legislating from the bench and he seeks to uphold our state constitution. And that is what makes us confident in his endorsement.”
    
            Protasiewicz has been on the ballot before, during her bids for Milwaukee County judge, but has never faced a statewide election. For months, her campaign aired television ads trying to teach Wisconsin voters how to say her name, literally spelling out the pronunciation on screen: “Pro-tuh-say-witz!” 
    
            In an interview at the state Capitol on Tuesday, following her debate with Kelly, she said the high stakes of the election have not been overstated – from abortion policy, gerrymandering and voting laws.
    
            “The results of the 2024 presidential election are likely to come in front of the Supreme Court as well,” Protasiewicz told CNN. “The 10 electoral votes that we have here are very, very highly sought after.”
    
            She has dramatically outspent her opponent, largely due to a multi-million dollar infusion from the Wisconsin Democratic Party. If she wins, she has pledged to recuse herself from cases directly involving the party.
    
            But she said she would not step aside on cases involving the next presidential election.
    
            “I wouldn’t think the Democratic Party would be one of the plaintiffs or respondents in that case,” she said. “Last time, I believe it was Trump v. Biden, so I don’t think the party itself would be a party to the matter.”
    
            Asked whether that was drawing a distinction without a difference, she said: “I don’t think so.”
    
            “I could probably still even be fair on cases involving the party, but I just think the optics are really poor,” she said. “You want the citizens to absolutely believe that their Supreme Court is fair, impartial and acting with integrity and independence.”
    
            She has declined to say how she would rule in specific cases, including the state’s 1849 law effectively banning abortion across Wisconsin, but said her decisions would “uphold her values.” She has made clear she supports abortion rights and believes the state law in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade is wrong.
    
            She has painted her rival as an extremist, airing ads about his involvement with the state Republican Party’s scheme to create a fake slate of electors for Trump.
    
            “He is a total threat to our democracy,” Protasiewicz said, reprising a central mantra of her campaign.
    
            In an interview on Wednesday, Kelly dismissed the suggestion as “scaremongering” and accuses his rival of placing politics above the law.
    
            “We have a very stark choice ahead of us,” Kelly said. “Will we continue with the rule of law or will we instead trade it in for the rule of Janet?”
    
            He brushed aside criticism of his previous employment with the Wisconsin Republican Party and the Republican National Committee. He described them merely as his legal clients.
    
            He said the 2024 presidential campaign – and Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes – should not be part of the discussion in the Supreme Court race.
    
            “I have no idea what this might do for the 2024 presidential elections, nor is it relevant to this race,” Kelly told CNN. “Our only job is to resolve the legal questions the people of Wisconsin bring to us and we do it according to the existing law, without reference to its political implications.”
    
            While he has been endorsed by three of the state’s largest anti-abortion groups, Kelly said he made no promises to them and has not indicated how he would rule on any cases before the court.
    
            “The conversations that I’ve had with them are the same conversations I’ve had with literally everyone else in the state of Wisconsin: What kind of jurist would you be they asked me?” Kelly said. “I told them I’m the kind of jurist who applies the law as it currently exists to the extent it’s consistent with the Constitution. And I do it without regard to my personal views or personal politics.”
    
            He said the millions of dollars that have come into the state from outside liberal groups were misguided and could backfire, saying: “We can take care of our own business here in Wisconsin just fine.”
    
            “Let’s just say if Janet wins, she will be forever known as the jurist who is bought and paid for by the Democratic Party in Wisconsin,” Kelly said. “I want no part of that.”

      Progestagen-only contraceptives carry similar, small breast cancer risk as other hormone contraceptives, study finds
    ","
			By Jessie Gretener, CNN
		;Jessie Gretener","

        12:08 AM EDT, Wed March 22, 2023
    ","
            All hormone contraceptives, including progestagen-only “minipills,” carry a small “excess risk” of breast cancer, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Oxford, but the overall risk remains low.
    
            The study, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine, bridges a research gap by investigating the link between breast cancer and progestagen-only contraceptives.
    
            “Use of combined oral contraceptives, containing both estrogen and progestagen, has previously been associated with a small increase in breast cancer risk but there is limited data about the effect of progestagen-only hormonal contraceptives,” the authors wrote.
    
            The study found that progestagen-only contraceptives are associated with a 20% to 30% relative risk for breast cancer, which aligns with previous research on combined hormone contraceptives. The overall risk of breast cancer among hormone contraceptive users is low, especially for younger women, and past studies have shown that the excess risk is gone entirely about 10 years after stopping.
    
            The study does not indicate that hormonal contraceptives cause breast cancer but rather investigated potential links to the disease. 
    
            Progestagens, or progestin, are a type of synthetic hormone drug that mimic the natural hormone progesterone, which is crucial for menstruation and pregnancy.
    
            Unlike combined hormone contraceptives, progestagen-only contraceptives do not have estrogen. Types of progestagen-only contraceptives available in the UK and US include the implant, the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD), the contraceptive injection and the minipill.
    
            In the UK, which is ranked highest for access to contraception on the 2023 Europe Contraception Policy Atlas, prescriptions for progestagen-only contraceptives are almost as high as for combined oral contraceptives. 
    
            In the US, the combined pill is the most popular hormonal contraception, but a significant percentage of women are choosing an implant or IUD, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    
            Progestagen-only contraceptives work to prevent pregnancy by thickening mucus in the cervix to stop sperm reaching an egg and, in some cases, can stop ovulation completely. 
    
            The CDC and the British National Health Service also cite additional benefits.
    
            For example, women who have severe period pain are often advised to opt for the implant or IUD, as progestagen-only contraceptives can weaken or stop periods for some women. This can serve as a more sustainable and affordable option for long-term pain management for conditions like endometriosis. The minipill is also cited as a safe option for women who are breastfeeding.
    
            Like combined hormonal contraceptives, progestagen-only contraceptives are designed to prevent unwanted pregnancies but should still be used in tandem with condoms, as they do not protect women from sexually transmitted infections.
    
            The new study analyzed data on almost 10,000 women under the age of 50 in the UK who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1996 and 2017, as well as more than 18,000 who did not have breast cancer.
    
            “On average, 44% of women with breast cancer and 39% of matched controls had a hormonal contraceptive prescription, with about half the prescriptions being for progestagen-only preparations,” the study stated.
    
            The Clinical Practice Research Datalink, which collected the data for the study, also combined the results with previous research, including women from a wider age range. 
    
            The resulting 15-year “excess risk” associated with five years of use of combined or progestagen-only contraceptives in high-income countries was estimated at 8 per 100,000 users ages 16 to 20 and 265 per 100,000 users ages 35 to 39. 
    
            Kirstin Pirie, a researcher at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study, said excess risks must be viewed in the context of the “well-established benefits” of contraceptive use during a woman’s reproductive years, such as birth control and hormone regulation. Pirie also noted that breast cancer risks are lower for younger women, given that the underlying risk increases with age.
    
            Claire Knight, a senior health information manager at Cancer Research UK, which provided core funding for the study, said that hormonal contraception is a personal choice, as “there are lots of possible benefits to using contraception, as well as other risks not related to cancer.”
    
            “Women who are most likely to be using contraception are under the age of 50, where the risk of breast cancer is even lower. For anyone looking to lower their cancer risk, not smoking, eating a healthy balanced diet, drinking less alcohol and keeping a healthy weight will have the most impact,” Knight said.
    
            The researchers noted some limitations in the study, including a lack of complete information on a woman’s prescription history. However, while that limitation affected the ability to assess the long-term associations of contraceptive use with breast cancer risks, the authors say it is unlikely to have disproportionately affected the short-term findings.
    
            The study says data was lacking on a family history of breast cancer, but the researchers said that previously published findings for combined oral contraceptives were unaltered after adjusting for family history.
    
            The authors also said they attempted to investigate whether there are differing breast cancer risks between hormonal and nonhormonal IUDs. However, they said too few women in England had been prescribed nonhormonal IUDs to make a reliable comparison.

      Missouri AG seeks to restrict gender-affirming care for minors

            Missouri’s Republican attorney general is seeking to implement an emergency regulation to restrict gender-affirming care for minors.
    
            “Because gender transition interventions are experimental, the regulation clarifies that state law already prohibits performing experimental procedures in the absence of specific guardrails,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in a news release on Monday.   
    
            Some of the “guardrails” include “prohibiting gender transition interventions when the provider fails to ensure that the patient has received a full psychological or psychiatric assessment, consisting of not fewer than 15 separate, hourly sessions over the course of not fewer than 18 months to determine, among other things, whether the person has any mental health comorbidities,” according to the release.  
    
            The rule will go into effect 10 days after it is filed with Missouri’s secretary of state office, which said it had not yet been filed as of late Tuesday morning.
    
            Once it goes into effect, the regulation would last “30 legislative days or 180 days, whichever is longer,” the release said.   
    
            Republicans have expressed concern over long-term outcomes and question whether minors are capable of making such consequential decisions. LGBTQ advocates and many physicians, however, regard the treatment as medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender, the gender by which one wants to be known.
    
            Major medical associations agree that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria, which, according to the American Psychiatric Association, is psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align.
    
            Though the care is highly individualized, some children may decide to use reversible puberty suppression therapy. This part of the process may also include hormone therapy that can lead to gender-affirming physical change. Surgical interventions, however, are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors.
    
            Bailey said Monday that his efforts are aimed at protecting children and that the care is a part of “a woke, leftist agenda” that results in “irreversible consequences.”
    
            But Dr. Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region & Southwest Missouri, called Bailey’s claims “medically false and harmful” in a series of tweets on Monday.
    
            The emotional debate over gender-affirming care for transgender children has become a political flashpoint – especially among conservatives – at a time legislators across the country are advancing measures to restrict LGBTQ rights.  
    
            In February, CNN reported that more than 80 bills seeking to restrict access to gender-affirming care for trans youth has been introduced by Republican state lawmakers around the country this year, with debates around the issue reaching new heights due to proposals that would dramatically expand the scope of bans on such care. 
    
            Days ago, Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a bill that prohibits transgender minors from receiving gender-affirming care, allows educators to refuse to refer to transgender students by their preferred pronouns and would not allow schools to discuss sexual orientation or gender identity with students of any age.
    
            A Tennessee bill that prohibits gender-affirming care for minors was also signed into law earlier this month. In February, South Dakota enacted a similar health care ban, and Utah put one on its books in January. Alabama, Arizona and Arkansas also enacted bans on gender-affirming care in recent years, though the laws in Alabama and Arkansas have been temporarily blocked by federal courts.

      Wyoming outlaws abortion pills
    ","

    ","
            As the fight over abortion pills heats up nationally, Wyoming on Friday prohibited the medication in what NARAL Pro-Choice America called a “first of its kind” law, and also enacted a near-total ban on abortion.
    
            Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill making it a felony to prescribe, sell, or use “any drug for the purpose of procuring or performing an abortion.” Violators could face up to six months in prison and a $9,000 fine.
    
            The legislation takes effect July 1.
    
            Medication abortions are already included in the overall abortion bans in a number of states. Some states have restricted telehealth abortion care, limiting access to medication abortion. 
    
            A leading abortion-rights advocate said Wyoming’s explicit prohibition of the pills is unique.
    
            “There’s no stone that anti-choice extremists will leave unturned as they seek to do everything they can to ensure that abortion is banned across the nation,” NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement Saturday. “This first-of-its-kind ban on medication abortion, as well as the total ban, are just the latest proof.”
    
            Meanwhile, a federal judge in Texas could rule soon in a case seeking to overturn FDA approval of a drug used in medication abortions. The lawsuit seeks to block access nationwide to mifepristone, the first of two drugs used in the process.
    
            If the lawsuit is successful, 40 million more women of reproductive age would lose access to the drug, according to NARAL. That’s in addition to the 24.5 million women of reproductive age living in states with abortion bans, and those “who can get pregnant but who do not identify as women,” according to NARAL.
    
            The FDA approved Mifepristone in 2000. In 2020, medication abortions accounted for more than half of US abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, another abortion rights advocacy group.
    
            Legal fights over abortion have been raging across the country since last year when the US Supreme Court threw out Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision guaranteeing abortion rights.
    
            “Already, 17 states and counting are enforcing bans on abortion since” the ruling, NARAL said.
    
            Last week, California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will stop working with Walgreens, the retail drugstore chain that announced it would not dispense abortion pills in 21 Republican-dominated states.
    
            Wyoming’s governor allowed a second anti-abortion bill to become law without his signature. The more sweeping law bans abortion under most circumstances, with penalties of up to five years in prison and a $20,000 fine.
    
            The Life is a Human Right Act allows exceptions for incest, sexual assault, or when the pregnant person’s life is in danger, and in cases of “lethal fetal anomaly.”
    
            “Abortion as defined in this act is not health care,” the act says, citing the Wyoming constitution. “Instead of being health care, abortion is the intentional termination of the life of an unborn baby.”
    
            The legislation takes effect Sunday.
    
            Gordon “expressed concern this new law (HB 152) will only result in a new lawsuit, which will delay any resolution to the constitutionality of the abortion ban in Wyoming,” according to a statement from his office.
    
            “A person’s health, not politics, should guide important medical decisions – including the decision to have an abortion,” said Antonio Serrano, ACLU of Wyoming advocacy director, in a statement.

      New Mexico governor signs bill protecting access to reproductive and gender-affirming care into law

    ","
            New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday signed into law a bill that prohibits local municipalities and other public bodies from interfering with a person’s ability to access reproductive or gender-affirming health care services.
    
            HB7, the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act, also prohibits any public body from imposing laws, ordinances, policies or regulations that prevent patients from receiving reproductive or gender-affirming care.
    
            The move comes in the wake of the reversal of federal abortion rights last year and as several states have enacted measures to prevent minors from accessing gender-affirming care.  
    
            Gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender – the gender by which one wants to be known.
    
            “New Mexicans in every corner of our state deserve protections for their bodily autonomy and right to health care,” Lujan Grisham said in a news release. “I’m grateful for the hard work of the Legislature and community partners in getting this critical legislation across the finish line.”
    
            Each violation of the law can result in a fine of $5,000 or damages, if the amount is greater, according to the bill. 
    
            The law follows ordinances that several municipalities in the state had previously passed related to abortion care access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer.
    
            While abortion is legal in New Mexico, several GOP-led states have introduced or enacted measures restricting abortion, including Texas and Oklahoma, which have banned the procedure at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions. In response, New Mexico, which neighbors both states, allocated $10 million to build a new abortion clinic near the Texas border.
    
            Several other Democratic-controlled states have moved to reaffirm reproductive care in response to the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling. 
    
            Minnesota’s Democratic governor signed a bill into law earlier this year that enshrined the “fundamental right” to access abortion in the state. Last year, California passed several bills expanding abortion access, including protections for abortion providers and patients seeking abortion care in the state from civil action started in another state.
    
            As states move to enact measures, new legal challenges could further complicate abortion access in a post-Roe America. 
    
            A federal court in Texas heard arguments this week to block the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion, which made up more than half of US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Though the Trump-appointed judge has not issued a ruling, he suggested during arguments that he is seriously considering undoing the FDA’s approval. 
    
            Also at risk is access to gender-affirming care for trans youth, which LGBTQ advocates have long stressed is life-saving health care. 
    
            So far this year, lawmakers in Tennessee, Mississippi, Utah and South Dakota have enacted legislation to restrict minors’ access to such care. 
    
            Additionally, more than 80 bills seeking to restrict access to gender-affirming care have been introduced around the country through early last month, according to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union and shared with CNN.

      US maternal death rate rose sharply in 2021, CDC data shows, and experts worry the problem is getting worse
    ","

    ","
            As women continue to die due to pregnancy or childbirth each year in the United States, new federal data shows that the nation’s maternal death rate rose significantly yet again in 2021, with the rates among Black women more than twice as high as those of White women.
    
            Experts said the United States’ ongoing maternal mortality crisis was compounded by Covid-19, which led to a “dramatic” increase in deaths.
    
            The number of women who died of maternal causes in the United States rose to 1,205 in 2021, according to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics, released Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s a sharp increase from years earlier: 658 in 2018, 754 in 2019 and 861 in 2020. 
    
            That means the US maternal death rate for 2021 – the year for which the most recent data is available – was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with rates of 20.1 in 2019 and 23.8 in 2020.
    
            The new report also notes significant racial disparities in the nation’s maternal death rate. In 2021, the rate for Black women was 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is 2.6 times the rate for White women, at 26.6 per 100,000.
    
            The data showed that rates increased with the mother’s age. In 2021, the maternal death rate was 20.4 deaths per 100,000 live births for women under 25 and 31.3 for those 25 to 39, but it was 138.5 for those 40 and older. That means the rate for women 40 and older was 6.8 times higher than the rate for women under age 25, according to the report.
    
            The maternal death rate in the United States has been steadily climbing over the past three decades, and these increases continued through the Covid-19 pandemic. 
    
            Questions remain about how the pandemic may have affected maternal mortality in the United States, according to Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, chief medical and health officer for the infant and maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes, who was not involved in the new report.
    
            “What happened in 2020 and 2021 compared with 2019 is Covid,” Cherot said. “This is sort of my reflection on this time period, Covid-19 and pregnancy. Women were at increased risk for morbidity and mortality from Covid. And that actually has been well-proven in some studies, showing increased risks of death, but also being ventilated in the intensive care unit, preeclampsia and blood clots, all of those things increasing a risk of morbidity and mortality.” 
    
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists previously expressed “great concern” that the pandemic would worsen the US maternal mortality crisis, ACOG President Dr. Iffath Abbasi Hoskins said in a statement Thursday. 
    
            “Provisional data released in late 2022 in a U.S. Government Accountability Office report indicated that maternal death rates in 2021 had spiked—in large part due to COVID-19. Still, confirmation of a roughly 40% increase in preventable deaths compared to a year prior is stunning new,” Hoskins said.
    
            “The new data from the NCHS also show a nearly 60% percent increase in maternal mortality rates in 2021 from 2019, just before the start of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic and tragic effect on maternal death rates, but we cannot let that fact obscure that there was—and still is—already a maternal mortality crisis to compound.”
    
            Health officials stress that people who are pregnant should get vaccinated against Covid-19 and that doing so offers protection for both the mother and the baby.
    
            During the early days of the pandemic, in 2020, there was limited information about the vaccine’s risks and benefits during pregnancy, prompting some women to hold off on getting vaccinated. But now, there is mounting evidence of the importance of getting vaccinated for protection against serious illness and the risks of Covid-19 during pregnancy.
    
            The Covid-19 pandemic also may have exacerbated existing racial disparities in the maternal death rate among Black women compared with White women, said Dr. Chasity Jennings-Nuñez, a California-based site director with Ob Hospitalist Group and chair of the perinatal/gynecology department at Adventist Health-Glendale, who was not involved in the new report.
    
            “In terms of maternal mortality, it continues to highlight those structural and systemic problems that we saw so clearly during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Jennings-Nuñez said. 
    
            “So in terms of issues of racial health inequities, of structural racism and bias, of access to health care, all of those factors that we know have played a role in terms of maternal mortality in the past continue to play a role in maternal mortality,” she said. “Until we begin to address those issues, even without a pandemic, we’re going to continue to see numbers go in the wrong direction.”
    
            Some policies have been introduced to tackle the United States’ maternal health crisis, including the Black Maternal “Momnibus” Act of 2021, a sweeping bipartisan package of bills that aim to provide pre- and post-natal support for Black mothers, including extending eligibility for certain benefits postpartum.
    
            As part of the Momnibus, President Biden signed the bipartisan Protecting Moms Who Served Act in 2021, and other provisions have passed in the House.
    
            In the United States, about 6.9 million women have little or no access to maternal health care, according to March of Dimes, which has been advocating in support of the Momnibus.
    
            The US has the highest maternal death rate of any developed nation, according to the Commonwealth Fund and the latest data from the World Health Organization. While maternal death rates have been either stable or rising across the United States, they are declining in most countries.
    
            “A high rate of cesarean sections, inadequate prenatal care, and elevated rates of chronic illnesses like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease may be factors contributing to the high U.S. maternal mortality rate. Many maternal deaths result from missed or delayed opportunities for treatment,” researchers from the Commonwealth Fund wrote in a report last year.
    
            The ongoing rise in maternal deaths in the United States is “disappointing,” said Dr. Elizabeth Langen, a high-risk maternal-fetal medicine physician at the University of Michigan Health Von Voigtlander Women’s Hospital. She was not involved in the latest report but cares for people who have had serious complications during pregnancy or childbirth.
    
            “Those of us who work in the maternity care space have known that this is a problem in our country for quite a long time. And each time the new statistics come out, we’re hopeful that some of the efforts that have been going on are going to shift the direction of this trend. It’s really disappointing to see that the trend is not going in the right direction but, at some level, is going in the worst direction and at a little bit of a faster rate,” Langen said.
    
            “In the health care system, we need to accept ultimate responsibility for the women who die in our care,” she added. “But as a nation, we also need to accept some responsibility. We need to think about: How do we provide appropriate maternity care for people? How do we let people have time off of work to see their midwife or physician so that they get the care that they need? How do all of us make it possible to live a healthy life while you’re pregnant so that you have the opportunity to have the best possible outcome?”

      19th century chastity law endangers 21st century abortion medicine
    ","
			Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN
		;Zachary B. Wolf","
  Published
        5:01 PM EDT, Thu March 16, 2023
    ","
            The Wild West of the post-Roe v. Wade legal landscape is focused on a lone federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, who could use a 19th century law to limit access to abortion medication for every American woman.
    
            The judge, 45-year-old Matthew Kacsmaryk, held a hearing Wednesday about whether he should impose a preliminary injunction that would require the US Food and Drug Administration to withdraw or suspend its approval of the drug, mifepristone, while a larger case progresses. 
    
            Mifepristone is taken along with another drug, misoprostol, as part of the two-step medication abortion process. Misoprostol can be prescribed on its own, but it is considered less effective.
    
            Kacsmaryk, who sounded open to the idea of restricting access to mifepristone, will have to agree with some or all of these general points raised if he decides to issue an injunction:
    
            CNN’s Tierney Sneed wrote a longer list of takeaways from the hearing, where anti-abortion rights doctors and activist groups teed up their lawsuit in Kacsmaryk’s courtroom to further limit access to abortion care in the US.
    
            It’s important to note that no matter what Kacsmaryk does, it will be appealed up through the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals and potentially to the Supreme Court.
    
            But perhaps the most incredible question Kacsmaryk faces is whether an 1870s chastity law named for an anti-vice crusader, Anthony Comstock, should be resuscitated and applied to the medicine that now accounts for a majority of US abortions.
    
            Comstock operated the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and was a special agent of the US Postal Service. He was known for seizing contraband like contraceptives and condoms in the name of rooting out obscenity, according to the New York Historical Society. 
    
            Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who has written about the Comstock Act for CNN Opinion, described Comstock as being “obsessed by what he saw as the decaying morals of a country preoccupied with sex.”
    
            Ziegler writes:
    
            The law he inspired barred not just the mailing of “obscene books” but also birth control and abortion drugs and devices. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Comstock Act was used to prohibit the mailing of many literary classics, from Geoffrey Chaucer’s “The Canterbury Tales” to works by James Joyce and Walt Whitman.
    
            Comstock himself proudly carried a gun and scoured the mail for cases involving information about abortion or contraception, even if a doctor provided it. By Comstock’s standard, the law was a great success: he claimed to have destroyed 15 tons of books, arrested more than 4,000 people and driven at least 15 people to suicide.
    
            While Congress has acted to relax elements of the Comstock Act, including to allow the mailing of contraceptives, it is still technically on the books with regard to the mailing of anything that could be used for an abortion.
    
            During the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA dropped its requirement that a person obtain mifepristone in person. A prescription is still required. 
    
            In December, the Department of Justice notified the US Postal Service that the Comstock Act did not apply as long as “the sender lacks the intent that the recipient of the drugs will use them unlawfully.” 
    
            The FDA permanently removed the in-person requirement in January, hoping to guarantee more access to the medication after the Supreme Court ended Roe v. Wade last June. 
    
            The group that brought the Texas lawsuit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, wants to reapply the Comstock Act and restrict the mailing of abortion medication.
    
            The FDA’s already exhaustive and detailed drug approval process was especially scrutinized for mifepristone, which was more commonly known as part of the RU-486 regimen when it became available to American women at the turn of the century. 
    
            It had been available in Europe for a dozen years before that. Here’s CNN’s report from September 2000.
    
            That the drug works safely as a means of abortion is not really up for dispute as a medical matter after all that time, according to CNN’s Jen Christensen, who explains more about the medication in this article about mifepristone.
    
            Another CNN data analysis suggests mifepristone is safer than penicillin and Viagra. 
    
            Mifepristone has a death rate of 0.0005% – five deaths for every 1 million people in the US who used it. Penicillin’s death rate is four times greater. Viagra’s is 10 times greater, according to the analysis by CNN’s Annette Choi and Will Mullery.
    
            Kacsmaryk had a long history of challenging laws providing greater access to reproductive rights before he became a federal judge. While he has promised to be an impartial judge, every Democrat and one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, opposed his nomination in 2019.
    
            Now Kacsmaryk is the only federal judge at the courthouse in Amarillo, which almost guarantees he hears cases filed there. 
    
            So it may be no coincidence that the group challenging use of mifepristone set up an outpost months before filing its lawsuit. The group is based in Tennessee, but one of the doctors named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit practices near Amarillo.
    
            However one feels about judicial shopping and whether that happened in this case, the word appears to be out that a conservative judge is alone in Amarillo and open for business. 
    
            According to a CNN profile, Kacsmaryk has also put on hold Biden administration policies related to immigration and overseen cases related to vaccine requirements and gender identity. Last December, he halted a federal program in Texas that allowed minors to get birth control without their parents’ consent.
    
            That suit regarding the birth control program established in 1970 was brought by a Texas father “raising each of his daughters in accordance with Christian teaching on matters of sexuality,” which he said forbids premarital sex.
    
            Kacsmaryk agreed, even citing the Catechism of the Catholic Church in his decision to say “contraception (just like abortion) violates traditional tenets of many faiths, including the Christian faith Plaintiff practices.”
    
            His sister described him to The Washington Post as an anti-abortion rights activist and detailed her own decision to give a child up for adoption rather than seek an abortion.
    
            “He’s very passionate about the fact that you can’t preach pro-life and do nothing,” Jennifer Griffith told the Post. “We both hold the stance of you have to do something. You can’t not.”

      Kavanaugh and Alito said judges would be out of the abortion equation. That’s not the case

    ","
            When the Supreme Court reversed federal abortion rights last June, Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion stressed that “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”  
    
            Justice Brett Kavanaugh went further, separately emphasizing that the controversy would now be one for state officials and that judges would no longer undertake the “difficult moral and policy questions” related to when a woman is allowed to end a pregnancy. 
    
            But the drama Wednesday in a Texas courtroom over medication abortions demonstrates that judges remain at the center of access to abortion in America and reinforces the possibility that another battle over reproductive rights could soon land at the high court. 
    
            Whether Kavanaugh was trying to downplay the consequences of the startling June decision or ignoring the persistence of anti-abortion foes, he and fellow conservatives who secured the 5-4 ruling failed to acknowledge the kind of dispute now before Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. 
    
            A single federal judge – not a duly elected state legislature – is positioned to shut down access to an abortion drug and thwart women seeking to end pregnancies even in states where the procedure is still legal. Such an order could sweep nationwide, rather than be limited to one state. 
    
            This new fraught chapter, accompanied by protests at the scene and heightened court security, reveals how America’s abortion wars have only intensified since the June 24, 2022, decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. 
    
            Oral arguments offer a partial look into a judge’s thinking, but during Wednesday’s four-hour hearing in an Amarillo courtroom, Kacsmaryk signaled an openness to the challengers’ effort to undo the FDA’s approval of abortion drugs. A 2019 appointee of former President Donald Trump, Kacsmaryk previously served as deputy general counsel at the First Liberty Institute, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group and expressed anti-abortion views.   
    
            The case began last November when a group of anti-abortion organizations and physicians filed their challenge in Kacsmaryk’s district – a move apparently intended to secure a sympathetic jurist. The challengers asked that he take the unprecedented step of ordering the FDA to withdraw approval for mifepristone, the first of two drugs used to abort a fetus. 
    
            The FDA authorization dates to 2000, and today medication abortions constitute slightly more than half of all abortions in the US. 
    
            As the challengers made their case against the FDA in written filings, they cited the Dobbs decision’s lifting of constitutional protections. But as Kavanaugh, who cast a critical vote, stressed, states still have the authority to keep abortion legal within their boundaries. 
    
            “To be clear, then,” Kavanaugh wrote in his concurring opinion, “the Court’s decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States. On the contrary, the Court’s decision properly leaves the question of abortion for the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process. Through that democratic process, the people and their representatives may decide to allow or limit abortion.” 
    
            The second of former President Donald Trump’s three Supreme Court appointees, Kavanaugh said that the Dobbs decision “does not prevent the numerous States that readily allow abortion from continuing to readily allow abortion. That includes, if they choose, the amici States supporting the plaintiff in this Court: New York, California, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii.” 
    
            The legality of the procedure in those states could mean little, however, without access to needed medication. 
    
            When the Supreme Court reversed federal abortion rights last June, the justices disagreed over the ramifications for future abortion disputes. Three dissenting justices warned that it would keep federal judges in “the sphere of controversy,” leading them “to wade further into hotly contested issues, including moral and philosophical ones.” 
    
            Those three (Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and now-retired Stephen Breyer) invoked possible threats to medication abortions in their dissenting opinion. 
    
            “(T)he majority’s ruling today invites a host of questions about interstate conflicts,” they said. “Can a State bar women from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? Can a State prohibit advertising out-of-state abortions or helping women get to out-of-state providers? Can a State interfere with the mailing of drugs used for medication abortions? The Constitution protects travel and speech and interstate commerce, so today’s ruling will give rise to a host of new constitutional questions. Far from removing the Court from the abortion issue, the majority puts the Court at the center of the coming ‘interjurisdictional abortion wars.’” 
    
            In the Texas case, the anti-abortion alliance argues that the FDA failed to sufficiently test for the safety and effectiveness of abortion drugs over the past two decades. Seeking immediate action by Kacsmaryk, they wrote in their filing, “Without an injunction, these dangerous drugs will result in physical complications, emotional trauma, and death for women.” 
    
            The FDA counters that mifepristone has been proven safe. Its lawyers point at the expertise of the agency and say the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine wants to “upend that longstanding scientific determination based on speculative allegations of harm.” 
    
            In the Dobbs decision, Chief Justice John Roberts aligned partially with the liberals as he dissented from the wholesale reversal of Roe v. Wade. Yet, he declined to sign any of their joint dissent and wrote separately that he would have upheld the disputed 15-week ban on abortion from Mississippi – and gone no further. 
    
            Kavanaugh declined that stopping point. Any lingering right to abortion, he wrote in phrasing repeated throughout his opinion, “will be decided, as the Constitution dictates, by the people and their elected representatives through the constitutional processes of democratic self-government.”

      Judge appears open to blocking medication abortion drug after hearing in Texas

            Our live coverage has ended. Read more about today’s hearing in the posts below. 
    
            For about four hours of arguments, a federal judge in Texas asked questions that suggested he is seriously considering undoing the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a medication abortion drug and the agency’s moves to relax the rules around its use.
    
            But the judge, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, also indicated he was thinking through scenarios in which he could keep the drug’s 2000 approval intact while blocking other FDA rules.
    
            Anti-abortion doctors and medical associations are seeking a preliminary injunction that would require the FDA to withdraw or suspend its approval of the drug, mifepristone, and that would block the agency’s more recent regulatory changes making the pills more accessible.
    
            Here are some of the big takeaways:
    
            Judge focused on FDA’s process for approving abortion pills: Kacsmaryk showed a particular interest in the arguments by the abortion opponents that the FDA approved mifepristone in an unlawful way.
    
            He zeroed in on a claim by the abortion foes that the studies that the FDA looked at when deciding whether to approve the drug did not match the conditions under which the agency allows it to be administered.
    
            Erik Baptist, attorney for the challengers, alleged that those studies all featured patients who received ultrasounds before being treated with the drug, which is not among the FDA’s requirements for prescribing abortion pills. Baptist accused the FDA of “examining oranges and declaring apples to be safe.”
    
            Justice Department attorney Daniel Schwei defended the FDA’s approach, arguing that the relevant law gives the FDA discretion to determine what studies are adequate for approving a drug’s safety. He also said the challengers’ claims were factually flawed because the FDA also was looking at studies where the patients did not receive an ultrasound.
    
            Impact of the reversal of Roe v. Wade: The medication abortion lawsuit targets actions the FDA took around medication abortion pills before last summer’s Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade’s abortion rights protections.
    
            While that decision, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, didn’t play a major role in Wednesday’s arguments, the judge referenced it and suggested it could have an impact on his thinking about the case.
    
            He asked Erin Hawley, an attorney for the challengers, whether Dobbs was an “intervening event” that has “changed the landscape” around the relationship between state and federal government concerning abortion policy. Hawley agreed, calling it a “sea change.”
    
            What could happen next: Kacsmaryk wrapped up the hearing without any explicit timeline for when he’ll rule, telling the parties he would issue an order and opinion “as soon as possible.”
    
            An appeal would first go to a panel of three judges of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, arguably the most conservative appeals court in the country. The panel’s decision could then be appealed either to the full 5th Circuit or the US Supreme Court.
    
            Kacsmaryk seemed to be grappling with the practical impact of a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs. He asked plaintiffs’ attorneys, the DOJ lawyers and the attorneys for the drug company Danco whether it would be possible for him to block some but not all of the FDA actions the challengers were targeting.
    
            More takeaways.
    
            The medication abortion lawsuit targets actions the US Food and Drug Administration took around medication abortion pills before last summer’s Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade’s abortion rights protections. 
    
            While that decision, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, didn’t play a major role in Wednesday’s arguments, the judge referenced it multiple times and suggested it could have an impact on his think about the case.
    
            He brought up Dobbs early on in the hearing, and raised it specifically in connection with a friend of the court brief filed by 22 GOP-led states supporting the challengers. 
    
            The judge noted that the red states’ brief argued that the FDA’s actions were infringing on their state laws concerning abortion pills. 
    
            He asked Erin Hawley, an attorney for the challengers, whether Dobbs was an “intervening event” that has “changed the landscape” around the relationship between state and federal government concerning abortion policy. 
    
            Hawley agreed, calling it a “sea change.” 
    
            If US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has any sore feelings over the blow up around his efforts to keep Wednesday’s hearing plans quiet, he didn’t show them at the proceedings. 
    
            When questioning both sides of the case, Kacsmaryk had a restrained, straight-forward tone. The challengers got some follow up questions, but never did Kacsmaryk aggressively push back on their arguments. The substance of his questions for the US Food and Drug Administration’s defenders was more skeptical, but he kept with the measured approach in his questioning, and avoided any pushiness when grilling the government and one of mifepristone’s manufacturers about the approval process.
    
            Occasionally he threw in a light-hearted remark or an attempt at a joke. Some of the legal arguments Wednesday focused on whether the statute of limitations had run out for the challengers and whether they qualified for an exemption based on the FDA’s actions.
    
            At the end of the hearing, he thanked the parties, as well as those who filed dozens of friend of the courts briefs, for their “superb” briefing. He also acknowledged the logistical hurdles the lawyers at the hearing went through to get to his courthouse in Amarillo, which is a several hours’ drive from Texas’ biggest cities.
    
            Left unmentioned by the judge was the fact that he tried to delay the announcement of the hearing until the evening before, which would have made it difficult for members of the public and the media to attend Wednesday’s proceedings. 
    
            While scheduling Wednesday’s hearing at a private status conference last week, he had told the attorneys he was planning on waiting until posting the scheduling order until Tuesday and asked them to keep the plan quiet as well. At the status conference, according to a transcript CNN obtained Tuesday, he cited death threats and harassment the staff at his court had faced. That hostility was also not mentioned at Wednesday’s hearing.
    
            Meanwhile, outside of the courthouse, only a handful of demonstrators showed up. Some of them were dressed as clowns, an apparent reference to a comment made by Kacsmaryk at the status conference about the risk of a “circus-like” atmosphere. 
    
            The courtroom was open to the public, but only with limited seating: 19 seats for reporters and 19 for members of the publics. By 6 a.m. ET Wednesday there were already lines outside the courtroom to claim those seats. Those attendees were not allowed to bring electronics in with them, and if they left the courthouse, they were not allowed back in.
    
            Kacsmaryk warned at the beginning of the hearing that anyone who disrupted the proceedings would be immediately removed without warning. But there were no such disruptions.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk on Wednesday appeared hung up on the process the US Food and Drug Administration used to approve the medication abortion drug. 
    
            Kacsmaryk was particularly focused on a claim by the abortion foes that the studies that the FDA looked at when deciding whether to approve the drug did not match the conditions under which the agency allows it to be administered. 
    
            Erik Baptist, attorney for the challengers, alleged that those studies all featured patients who received ultrasounds before being prescribed the drug, which is not a requirement for obtaining abortion pills, and Baptist accused the FDA of “examining oranges and declaring apples to be safe.”
    
            Kacsmaryk returned to the that “apples to oranges” argument several times throughout the hearing. 
    
            Justice Department attorney Daniel Schwei argued that the relevant statute gives the FDA discretion to determine what studies are adequate for approving a drug’s safety and effectiveness — an argument Kacsmaryk pressed him on. Schwei also said that the challengers’ example citing ultrasounds was factually flawed, because some of the studies the FDA looked at did not involve the patients receiving an ultrasound.
    
            Kacsmaryk was similarly focused on a claim by the plaintiffs that the FDA violated the law in the special, accelerated process that it used to approve mifepristone in 2000. 
    
            At one point the judge revealed in the hearing that he had downloaded a list of the other drugs the FDA had approved through the accelerated process. He ticked through the list of drugs, which were made up mostly of treatments for HIV and cancer, and he asked the Justice Department for its “best argument” for why mifepristone fit into the list.
    
            Over the course of about four hours of arguments, a federal judge in Texas asked questions that suggested he is seriously considering undoing the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of medication abortion drugs and the agency’s moves to relax the rules around its use. 
    
            But the judge, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, also indicated he was thinking through scenarios in which he could keep the drug’s approval intact while blocking the FDA’s more recent moves to make abortion pills easier to obtain.
    
            Wednesday’s hearing concerned a request by the challengers for a preliminary injunction that would require the FDA to withdraw or suspend its approval of the drug, mifepristone, as well as the more agency’s recent regulatory changes regarding abortion pills.
    
            Kacsmaryk’s line of questioning for defenders of the FDA’s approval of mifepristone hinted that he sympathized with the legal arguments from challengers who argued the approval was unlawful. 
    
            Kacsmaryk also had many questions for the lawyers for the plaintiffs, anti-abortion doctors and medical associations, and showed some skepticism towards granting an order that was as aggressive as what they were seeking.
    
            A federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, concluded a high-stakes hearing without announcing whether he plans to grant a preliminary injunction that would suspend or withdraw approval of a medication abortion drug that’s been available for more than 20 years.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said he would issue an order and an opinion “as soon as possible” in the case challenging the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug. 
    
            A preliminary injunction would temporarily cut off access to the most common method of abortion in the United States, and the dispute marks the most significant legal battle concerning abortion since the Supreme Court ended nationwide abortion protections with its overturning of Roe v. Wade last summer.
    
            The drug mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000, and the plaintiffs — a coalition of anti-abortion medical associations and doctors — are also challenging more recent moves by the FDA that made abortion pills easier to obtain.
    
            Kacsmaryk’s decision came after hearing arguments from both the government defending the medication as well as challengers of the drug in a federal courtroom on Wednesday. 
    
            A federal judge in Texas is considering a lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide. The lawsuit targets the agency’s 2000 approval of mifepristone, one of the two drugs used for medication abortion.
    
            Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks’ gestation, which is “70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,” according to the US Food and Drug Administration.
    
            In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.
    
            Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the “abortion pill,” which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.
    
            “Some people do this because they cannot access a clinic — particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion — or because they have a preference for self-care,” Grossman said. “A growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective.”
    
            What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman’s health. 
    
            Read the conversation here. 
    
            The federal judge overseeing the high-profile challenge to the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of certain drugs used to terminate a pregnancy is a deeply conservative jurist with a proclivity for siding with plaintiffs looking to roll back reproductive and LGBTQ rights or block key Biden administration policies.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, was confirmed by a 52-46 Senate vote in 2019.
    
            The FDA case, the biggest abortion-related case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, has drawn considerable criticism from abortion rights advocates. But Kacsmaryk himself has also drawn scrutiny for the way he’s handled the matter, with critics taking issue with some highly unusual steps he took to delay making the public aware that a hearing was scheduled in the case for Wednesday.
    
            Since Kacsmaryk took the bench in 2019, he’s helped make Texas a legal graveyard for policies of President Joe Biden’s administration, largely due to the fact that Texas’ rules for how federal cases are assigned in the state have allowed conservatives to file there strategically, almost guaranteeing their complaints will be before sympathetic judges. Kacsmaryk is assigned every case filed in his division.
    
            In recent comments to The Washington Post, Kacsmaryk’s sister, Jennifer Griffith, detailed her brother’s long history of being anti-abortion and how she believes fate brought the abortion case before him.
    
            “I feel like he was made for this,” Griffith said. “He is exactly where he needs to be.”
    
            The group that brought the medication abortion lawsuit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, incorporated in Amarillo a few months before they filed the suit, according to documents from the Texas secretary of state’s office.
    
            Kacsmaryk is the only federal district judge seated in the Amarillo division of the US District of Northern Texas.
    
            Read more about Kacsmaryk here. 
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk asked the challengers to the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a medication abortion drug to walk him through their arguments for why and how he could reverse that approval from more than 20 years ago.
    
            The federal judge asked the plaintiffs – a group of anti-abortion medical associations and doctors – how they overcome certain procedural thresholds in the case and about the legal approach he should take in analyzing their arguments. 
    
            While the judge did not appear skeptical of the plaintiffs’ arguments, one of the sharpest questions from the judge was whether the challengers could point to another analogous case when a court intervened in the way he is being asked to intervene here. 
    
            Erik Baptist – one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs – conceded they could not point to a similar case and blamed FDA delays in addressing citizen petitions and challenges. Later in the hearing, however, he pointed to other times the FDA had suspended or withdrawn drugs based on court cases, suggesting the court has authority in such matters.
    
            Other key moments: Baptist also took issue with how the FDA used certain protocols during studies conducted before approving the drug – like requiring ultrasounds – but did not issue those same requirements when approving the drug for the public. He described that as a reckless act, calling it an “apples and oranges” approach.  
    
            For remedies, the judge asked the plaintiffs whether they suggest he order a suspension or withdrawal of the medication. Baptist said the better approach would be withdrawal but that suspension would be an alternative action. 
    
            Whatever relief the judge may grant, Baptist argued, must be swift and complete, saying the harms of these drugs “know no bounds” and “time cannot be lost.” 
    
            The defenders of the FDA’s moves have not argued yet, so it’s not clear if they will face more skepticism or if Kacsmaryk will strike a similar tone with them as he did with the challengers.
    
            Baptist and Erin Morrow Hawley argued for the challengers. Both are lawyers at the Alliance Defending Freedom.  
    
            While Baptist argued the drug is causing irreparable harm for the plaintiffs and putting the public at risk, Hawley focused on standing, saying the plaintiffs have had to divert resources to care for women who’ve dealt with complications from the drug, which she described as “dangerous.” 
    
            The challengers have reserved 30 minutes for rebuttal after the defenders of the drug go next. The hearing is still ongoing. 
    
            Electronics and video are not allowed in the courtroom, but CNN’s reporters are inside and will continue to provide updates as the hearing unfolds.
    
            Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
    
            The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion.
    
            It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications — like hemorrhages or infections — for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a 2015 study conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications.
    
            The likelihood of serious complications via procedural abortion — performed second-trimester or later — is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And childbirth by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%.
    
            If access to mifepristone is cut off, abortion clinics and telehealth organizations could pivot to misoprostol-only abortions, Aiken told CNN. Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said.
    
            In the latest study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol.
    
            Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen.
    
            Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it’s readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN.

            As a federal judge in Texas hears a lawsuit on a medication abortion case, the Women’s March is holding a protest outside the courthouse in Amarillo.
    
            Protesters were slowly arriving this morning, as well as a handful of police officers in bikes. 
    
            A small group of protesters hold signs that say, “Defend Medication Abortion” and “Not your Uterus not your decision.” 
    
            “Abortion is health care. I’m a registered nurse and I believe very strongly in everyone’s right to access medication abortion as they see fit,” Lindsay London, a protester from Amarillo, said.
    
            Some of the protesters are dressed in costume. One man is wearing a plush kangaroo judge outfit, and two other people are dressed in clown costumes.
    
            “His court is a joke,” said Felix Robertson, donning a clown wig. 
    
            Lyons and Robertson said they decided to dress up like clowns because of what US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said during a status conference call last week. During the call, Kacsmaryk asked that the attorneys “not further advertise or tweet any of the details of this hearing so that all parties can be heard and we don’t have any unnecessary circus-like atmosphere of what should be more of an appellate-style proceeding.”
    
            “We’ll bring the circus then,” Robertson said.
    
            “We’re reminding him that he created the circus,” Lyons said. “We’re here to show him that he doesn’t have support in Amarillo, that we don’t agree with his decision, and we’re going to continue to be outspoken against this joke circus of a courtroom.” 
    
            Lyons and Robertson said that they expect a small number of protesters to show up today because of the secrecy around the announcement of the hearing, which didn’t give people much time to plan to attend. 
    
            As a hearing on the case challenging the federal government’s approval of a medication abortion drug takes place today, here’s a look at the latest polling on Americans’ views on the topic. 
    
            Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone — the first drug in the medication abortion process — is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. 
    
            There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That’s a death rate of 0.0005%.
    
            Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin — a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia — is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra — used to treat erectile dysfunction — is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA.
    
            “[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. “Its safety is very well established.”

            The federal judge involved in a major medication abortion case told lawyers last week that he did not want to publicize plans to hold a hearing in the case because of a “barrage” of death threats and other harassment that has been directed towards his courthouse, according to a transcript obtained by CNN of a private status conference.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, on a teleconference with the attorneys on Friday, said: “This is not a gag order but just a request for courtesy given the death threats and harassing phone calls and voicemails that this division has received.”
    
            The judge did not say where the threats came from.
    
            “We want a fluid hearing with all parties being heard,” the judge added. “I think less advertisement of this hearing is better.”
    
            At Wednesday’s hearing, Kacsmaryk will be considering a request for a preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiffs, anti-abortion doctors and medical associations that are asking him to block the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a drug used in medication abortion.
    
            During the Friday teleconference, he said that he would put a public order scheduling the hearing on the public docket on Tuesday, the day before the Wednesday morning hearing in Amarillo, Texas.
    
            “Other elements of this case have brought a barrage of death threats and protesters and the rest. I don’t want that to disrupt your presentation to the court,” the judge told the attorneys on the call.
    
            More background: Kacsmaryk’s effort to delay the hearing plans from becoming public was first reported by The Washington Post on Saturday, and prompted a public outcry from media outlets and legal experts who said that the effort undermined the principles of judicial transparency. He ultimately posted the scheduling order for the hearing to the court’s docket on Monday afternoon, as well as a docket entry for the Friday call.
    
            During the call, Kacsmaryk assured the attorneys that the normal courthouse security protocols will be in place for Wednesday’s hearing, but he asked that the attorneys “not further advertise or Tweet any of the details of this hearing so that all parties can be heard and we don’t have any unnecessary circus-like atmosphere of what should be more of an appellate-style proceeding.”
    
            Democratic governors from 14 states wrote a letter Tuesday asking several national pharmacies whether they plan to continue dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone. 
    
            The letter, addressed to the leaders of CVS, Rite-Aid, Walmart, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Health Mart, said that states were aware the pharmacies were reviewing their policies around the drug.
    
            The governors said they “look forward to receiving your plans for dispensing Mifepristone in states where such care is legal, as well as any other actions you plan to take to safeguard access to reproductive healthcare.”
    
            The inquiry comes as a federal judge considers a lawsuit seeking to block the use of the mifepristone drug nationwide. It also comes weeks after the pharmacy Walgreens announced that it would not distribute mifepristone in 20 states — an announcement that came on the heels of threats by Republican attorneys general that they might take legal action.
    
            Walgreens said in a statement at the time that it would only continue to dispense mifepristone, the first of two drugs in the medication abortion process, “in those jurisdictions where it is legal and operationally feasible.”
    
            Walgreens faced immediate backlash for the decision, most notably for restricting the medication in Alaska, Iowa, Kansas and Montana, where medication abortion pills are still legal. Those states have laws limiting where abortion patients may obtain drugs for medication abortion — but critics note that in some of those states, those laws have been halted by court order. 
    
            The Republican attorneys general made similar requests last week to Rite Aid, Costo, Kroger, Walmart and the Albertsons Companies — though the other pharmacy chains have remained quiet about their policies around mifepristone.
    
            The US Food and Drug Administration had previously said that pharmacies that become certified to dispense mifepristone can do so directly to someone who has a prescription from a certified prescriber.
    
            Today’s hearing is focusing on a lawsuit filed by anti-abortion advocates against the US Food and Drug Administration which targets the agency’s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process.
    
            Medication abortion, which now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the fallout from the Supreme Court’s decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            Any decision that blocks access to medication abortion – even temporarily – will significantly disrupt abortion cases nationwide.
    
            Reproductive rights advocates say that if the federal judge ultimately sides with the plaintiffs, “it would eliminate the most commonly used method of abortion care,” according to NARAL Pro-Choice America.
    
            Here a look at how the federal judge’s ruling could impact abortion access: 
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, the federal judge overseeing a challenge to the federal government’s approval of a medication abortion drug, is holding a hearing in the case in Amarillo, Texas.
    
            Electronics and video are not allowed in the federal courtroom. CNN’s reporters are inside and will provide updates as the hearing unfolds.
    
            The case concerns a challenge brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical associations to the federal government’s 2000 approval of a drug used to terminate pregnancies. Medication abortion is the most common method of abortion in the United States.
    
            What’s at stake: If the judge grants the request to block access to the drug nationwide, it could make the pills harder to obtain even in states where medication abortion is legal.
    
            The parties will each have two hours to argue, according to the new schedule order, and Kacsmaryk listed a series of legal questions about the case their lawyers should be prepared to address.
    
            CNN’s Rosa Flores reports from outside the court in Amarillo: 
    
            A federal judge in Texas will consider at a high-stakes hearing at 10 a.m ET Wednesday whether he should block the US government’s approval of the drug used for medication abortions.
    
            Here is what to watch for in the hearing:
    
            What the judge thinks of the merits of the lawsuit
    
            The challengers, who are being represented by a prominent anti-abortion legal organization, are arguing that the US Food and Drug Administration violated administrative law in how it went about approving mifepristone and in how it relaxed the rules around the drug’s use over the years.
    
            Critics of the lawsuit, which include many mainstream medical organizations that filed amicus briefs supporting the FDA, say that the plaintiffs use misleading and cherry-picked evidence to argue mifepristone is unsafe.
    
            Before joining the bench, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk engaged in work that suggested an opposition to abortion and he was a lawyer for a conservative legal firm specializing in religious liberty cases.
    
            The case before him, however, is not just about abortion, but about administrative law and to what extent the FDA’s approach can be second guessed in court. Even some conservative legal scholars have indicated skepticism to the plaintiffs’ arguments.
    
            Does the judge think he has the power to block FDA’s approval?
    
            In his instructions to the lawyers ahead of the hearing, Kacsmaryk told them to be prepared to answer several questions about whether the challengers have established that they are being harmed by the FDA’s actions in a way that makes it appropriate for a court to get involved. Additionally, there have been questions raised about whether the judge, as a practical matter, can unilaterally pull the drug off the market.
    
            There are specific legal procedures for how and when the FDA withdraws a drug, and it’s not clear whether the FDA would have to go through those steps – which could take several weeks or even months – if the court orders the approval withdrawn.
    
            There’s also the question of what effect an order from Kacsmaryk would have on the actions of providers to prescribe mifepristone and on those of manufacturers and distributors, who are not party to the case. (One drug company that manufactures and distributes mifepristone has intervened as a defendant, but the other main manufacturer has not.)
    
            Kacsmaryk has asked the lawyers to be prepared to argue what the remedy would look like if he were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs.
    
            Read up on what else to look out for here.
    
            The medication abortion challenge, brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical associations, is arguably the most significant legal dispute concerning abortion since the Supreme Court ended nationwide abortion protections with its overturning of Roe v. Wade last summer.
    
            Depending on how US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk handles the lawsuit, access could be cut off nationwide to the most common method of abortion in the United States.
    
            The Justice Department and outside legal experts say that it would be “unprecedented” for a US district court to order that the US Food and Drug Administration rescind its approval of the drug, as the plaintiffs are asking Kacsmaryk to do. 
    
            The challengers’ request for a preliminary injunction that would force the FDA to withdraw or suspend the approval while the lawsuit plays out is before Kacsmaryk on Wednesday.
    
            Among those listed in the case as attorneys with the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the legal advocacy group representing the plaintiffs, is Erin Morrow Hawley, the wife of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley. However, the lead signatory on many of ADF’s briefs has been another attorney at the organization, Erik Baptist.
    
            Kacsmaryk has given both sides two hours each to argue the case. 
    
            Some of the Justice Department’s time might be shared with lawyers for Danco, the drug company that has intervened. The challengers’ attorneys will be up first, and they’ll be allowed to reserve some of their two hours for rebuttal after the defendants have their chance to present to the judge.
    
            Will the judge hint at the timing of a decision? It is always possible that Kacsmaryk will rule on the preliminary injunction from the bench during the hearing. But that is unlikely, given the high-profile nature of the case and the breadth of topics the judge has asked the lawyers to be prepared to argue on.
    
            When he does issue his ruling, if it is an order in favor of the challengers, he could proactively put the order on pause to give the DOJ time to appeal it to the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. If not, the department is expected to ask him, as well as the appellate court, to do so.
    
            If Kacsmaryk rejects the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, they will also have the opportunity to seek the immediate intervention of a higher court.
    
            Abortion rights advocates have sounded the alarm on the lawsuit targeting the US Food and Drug Administration’s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process.
    
            Advocates for abortion are stressing that a ruling by US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in favor of the plaintiffs would affect every corner of the country since the lawsuit is targeting a federal agency.
    
            Kacsmaryk is holding a hearing Wednesday on the case. He is considering the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction that would withdraw or suspend that FDA approval while the lawsuit plays out.
    
            “If FDA approval of mifepristone is revoked, 64.5 million women of reproductive age in the US would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight,” NARAL said in a statement in February, pointing to internal research.
    
            And activists quickly mobilized in Texas around the issue, with the Women’s March holding a rally at the federal courthouse in Amarillo in February to protest the suit.
    
            “We’ve said it before: the fight for reproductive rights now lies in the states, and legal challenges like these are just the latest example of how our fight is bigger than Roe,” said Rachel Carmona, the executive director of Women’s March.
    
            A federal judge in Texas is considering a lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide, in the biggest abortion-related case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            The lawsuit, filed in November by anti-abortion advocates against the US Food and Drug Administration, targets the agency’s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday on the issue.
    
            The parties will each have two hours to argue, according to the order scheduling the hearing, and Kacsmaryk listed a series of legal questions about the case their lawyers should be prepared to address.
    
            Any decision that blocks access to medication abortion – even temporarily – will significantly disrupt abortion cases nationwide.
    
            What both sides are arguing: The lawsuit is seeking a number of actions by the court, chief among them a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering the FDA “to withdraw mifepristone and misoprostol as FDA-approved chemical abortion drugs and to withdraw defendants’ actions to deregulate these chemical abortion drugs.”
    
            The challengers are also targeting the FDA’s recent moves to make the pills more accessible, which include removing the requirement that the pills be picked up in person from an abortion provider.
    
            The FDA responded to the lawsuit in January by asking the judge to deny a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that issuing one in the matter “would upend the status quo and the reliance interests of patients and doctors who depend on mifepristone, as well as businesses involved with mifepristone distribution.”
    
            The agency also says a ruling against it would set a dangerous precedent.
    
            Danco, which makes mifepristone, also made a request similar to the FDA’s in a court filing, stressing that the lawsuit could decimate the company’s business. The drug company has been allowed to intervene in the case, as the anti-abortion activists are also asking the court to halt the FDA’s 2016 approval of its version of the medication abortion drug.
    
            Why this matters: A coalition of 22 Democratic attorneys general urged Kacsmaryk to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, writing in court papers that “annulling – or even merely limiting – any of the FDA’s actions relating to medication abortion would result in an even more drastic reduction in abortion access across the entire nation.
    
            The Democratic attorneys general noted that abortion clinics in their states have already seen a surge in patients because of traffic from residents of states where extreme abortion restrictions are in effect. Cutting off access to medication abortion would further overburden those clinics, the blue states argued, as surgical abortion would be the only available method.
    
            A coalition of 22 Republican attorneys general, meanwhile, asked the court to issue the preliminary injunction, arguing the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved the medication.

      Takeaways from the Texas hearing on medication abortion drugs
    ","

    ","
            Over the course of about four hours of arguments, a federal judge in Texas asked questions that suggested he is seriously considering undoing the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a medication abortion drug and the agency’s moves to relax the rules around its use. 
    
            But the judge, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, also indicated he was thinking through scenarios in which he could keep the drug’s 2000 approval intact while blocking other FDA rules.
    
            Anti-abortion doctors and medical associations are seeking a preliminary injunction that would require the FDA to withdraw or suspend its approval of the drug, mifepristone, and that would block the agency’s more recent regulatory changes making the pills more accessible.
    
            Here are takeaways from the hearing:
    
            Kacsmaryk showed a particular interest in the arguments by the abortion opponents that the FDA approved mifepristone in an unlawful way.
    
            He zeroed in on a claim by the abortion foes that the studies that the FDA looked at when deciding whether to approve the drug did not match the conditions under which the agency allows it to be administered.
    
            Erik Baptist, attorney for the challengers, alleged that those studies all featured patients who received ultrasounds before being treated with the drug, which is not among the FDA’s requirements for prescribing abortion pills. Baptist accused the FDA of “examining oranges and declaring apples to be safe.”
    
            Kacsmaryk returned to that “apples to oranges” argument several times throughout the hearing.
    
            Justice Department attorney Daniel Schwei defended the FDA’s approach, arguing that the relevant law gives the FDA discretion to determine what studies are adequate for approving a drug’s safety. He also said the challengers’ claims were factually flawed, because the FDA also was looking at studies where the patients did not receive an ultrasound.
    
            Kacsmaryk was similarly focused on a claim by the plaintiffs that the FDA violated the law in the special, accelerated process that it used to approve mifepristone in 2000.
    
            At one point the judge revealed in the hearing that he had downloaded a list of the other drugs the FDA had approved through the process. He ticked through the list of drugs, which were made up mostly of treatments for HIV and cancer, and he asked the Justice Department for its “best argument” for why mifepristone fit into the list.
    
            One of the sharpest questions from the judge was whether the anti-abortion activists could point to another analogous case when a court intervened in the way he is being asked to intervene here. 
    
            Baptist conceded there was none and blamed FDA delays in addressing citizen petitions and challenges. Later in the hearing, Baptist raised other times the FDA had suspended or withdrawn drugs based on court cases in other contexts, arguing those cases showed that Kascmaryk had the authority to grant the plaintiffs’ request.
    
            Attorneys for the defendants – which include both the FDA and a drug company that manufactures mifepristone and intervened in the case – pushed back on those examples. They said that the plaintiffs were relying on patent cases, where the dispute was between a brand name drug and a generic counterpart, and those examples were not analogous here.
    
            The medication abortion lawsuit targets actions the FDA took around medication abortion pills before last summer’s Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade’s abortion rights protections.
    
            While that decision, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, didn’t play a major role in Wednesday’s arguments, the judge referenced it and suggested it could have an impact on his thinking about the case.
    
            He brought up Dobbs early on in the hearing and raised it specifically in connection with a friend of the court brief filed by 22 GOP-led states supporting the challengers.
    
            The judge noted that the red states’ brief argued that the FDA’s actions were infringing on their state laws concerning abortion pills.
    
            He asked Erin Hawley, an attorney for the challengers, whether Dobbs was an “intervening event” that has “changed the landscape” around the relationship between state and federal government concerning abortion policy.
    
            Hawley agreed, calling it a “sea change.”
    
            If Kacsmaryk has any sore feelings over the blow up around his efforts to keep Wednesday’s hearing plans quiet, he didn’t show them at the proceedings.
    
            When questioning both sides of the case, Kacsmaryk had a restrained, straight-forward tone. He had occasional follow-up questions for the plaintiffs, but did not aggressively push back on their arguments. The substance of his questions for the FDA’s defenders was more skeptical, but he kept with the measured approach in his questioning, and avoided any pushiness when grilling the government and the drug company about the approval process.
    
            At the end of the hearing, he thanked the parties, as well as those who filed dozens of friend of the courts briefs, for their “superb” briefing. He also acknowledged the logistical hurdles the lawyers at the hearing went through to get to his courthouse in Amarillo, which is a several hours’ drive from Texas’ biggest cities.
    
            Left unmentioned by the judge was the fact that he tried to delay the announcement of the hearing until the evening before, which would have made it difficult for members of the public and the media to attend Wednesday’s proceedings. When there was blowback to The Washington Post reporting about his plan – laid out in a private teleconference with attorneys where he pointed to death threats and harassment that had been directed to the courthouse staff – he announced the hearing on Monday.
    
            The courtroom was open to the public, but only with limited seating: 19 seats for reporters and 19 for members of the public. By 6 a.m. CT Wednesday there were already lines outside the courtroom to claim those seats. Those attendees were not allowed to bring electronics in with them, and if they left the courthouse, they were not allowed back in.
    
            Kacsmaryk warned at the beginning of the hearing that anyone who disrupted the proceedings would be immediately removed without warning. But there were no such disruptions.
    
            Kacsmaryk wrapped up the hearing without any explicit timeline for when he’ll rule, telling the parties he would issue an order and opinion “as soon as possible.”
    
            While he was arguing, Schwei, the DOJ attorney, requested that the judge – if he were to rule against the FDA – to immediately put that ruling on pause so it could be appealed. The judge stopped short of promising an automatic stay in the event of an adverse ruling, but he acknowledged he understood what DOJ was asking for.
    
            An appeal would first go to a panel of three judges of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, arguably the most conservative appeals court in the country. The panel’s decision could then be appealed either to the full 5th Circuit or the US Supreme Court.
    
            Beyond these procedural questions, Kacsmaryk seemed to be grappling with the practical impact of a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs. He asked plaintiffs’ attorneys, the DOJ lawyers and the attorneys for the drug company Danco whether it would be possible for him to block some but not all of the FDA actions the challengers were targeting. He returned to the question again when the plaintiffs were back up for the rebuttal.
    
            He also pressed Baptist, the attorney for the abortion opponents, on whether the plaintiffs were seeking an order that the FDA begin the withdrawal of the drug – a process that would take months – or if they thought the judge could directly take if off the market.

      What to watch for at Wednesday’s hearing in medication abortion lawsuit
    ","

    ","
            A federal judge in Texas will consider at a high-stakes hearing on Wednesday whether he should block the US government’s approval of the drug used for medication abortions.
    
            The case, brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical associations, is arguably the most significant legal dispute concerning abortion since the Supreme Court ended nationwide abortion protections with its overturning of Roe v. Wade last summer.
    
            Depending on how US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk handles the medication abortion lawsuit, access could be cut off nationwide to the most common method of abortion in the United States.
    
            The Justice Department and outside legal experts say that it would be “unprecedented” for a US district court to order that the US Food and Drug Administration rescind its approval of the drug, as the plaintiffs are asking Kacsmaryk to do. The drug – mifepristone – was approved by the FDA more than two decades ago, and the plaintiffs are also challenging more recent moves by the FDA that made abortion pills easier to obtain.
    
            Before Kacsmaryk on Wednesday is the challengers’ request for a preliminary injunction that would force the FDA to withdraw or suspend the approval while the lawsuit plays out.
    
            The hearing will start at 9 a.m. CT and is expected to last several hours. While it will be open to the public, the hearing will not be livestreamed.  
    
            Here is what to watch for in Wednesday’s hearing:
    
            The challengers, who are being represented by a prominent anti-abortion legal organization, are arguing that the FDA violated administrative law in how it went about approving mifepristone and in how it relaxed the rules around the drug’s use over the years.
    
            “After two decades of engaging the FDA to no avail, plaintiffs now ask this court to do what the FDA was and is legally required to do: protect women and girls by holding unlawful, setting aside, and vacating the FDA’s actions to approve chemical abortion drugs and eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo this dangerous drug regimen,” the complaint reads.
    
            Critics of the lawsuit, which include many mainstream medical organizations that filed amicus briefs supporting the FDA, say that the plaintiffs use misleading and cherry-picked evidence to argue mifepristone is unsafe.
    
            “The scientific evidence supporting mifepristone’s safety and efficacy is overwhelming. Mifepristone is one of the most studied medications prescribed in the United States and has a safety profile comparable to ibuprofen,” a group of leading medical and public health societies wrote to the court in one such brief. 
    
            Mifepristone is the first drug in the two-pill regimen for terminating a pregnancy. If it is no longer available, wait times at brick-and-mortar clinics in states where abortion is legal will likely increase significantly. The capacity of those clinics has already been stretched thin by the flood of patients from states where abortion is illegal, Democratic attorneys general said in a brief.
    
            Before joining the bench, Kacsmaryk engaged in work that suggested an opposition to abortion and he was a lawyer for a conservative legal firm specializing in religious liberty cases.
    
            The case before him, however, is not just about abortion, but about administrative law and to what extent the FDA’s approach can be second guessed in court. Even some conservative legal scholars have indicated skepticism to the plaintiffs’ arguments. 
    
            Kacsmaryk had considered holding a full trial on the merits of the lawsuit before deciding the preliminary injunction, but ultimately forewent that route, which will limit the evidence that will be before him Wednesday.
    
            Before Kacsmaryk gets to the merits of the challengers’ arguments, he’ll have to weigh several procedural questions that might constrain his ability to intervene in the dispute.
    
            In his instructions to the lawyers ahead of the hearing, Kacsmaryk told them to be prepared to answer several questions about whether the challengers have established that they are being harmed by the FDA’s actions in a way that makes it appropriate for a court to get involved. Additionally, there have been questions raised about whether the judge, as a practical matter, can unilaterally pull the drug off the market.
    
            There are specific legal procedures for how and when the FDA withdraws a drug, and it’s not clear whether the FDA would have to go through those steps – which could take several weeks or even months – if the court orders the approval withdrawn. 
    
            There’s also the question of what effect an order from Kacsmaryk would have on the actions of providers to prescribe mifepristone and on those of manufacturers and distributors, who are not party to the case. (One drug company that manufactures and distributes mifepristone has intervened as a defendant, but the other main manufacturer has not.)
    
            Kacsmaryk has asked the lawyers to be prepared to argue what the remedy would look like if he were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs.
    
            Among those listed in the case as attorneys with the Alliance Defending Freedom, the legal advocacy group representing the plaintiffs, is Erin Morrow Hawley, the wife of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley. However, the lead signatory on many of ADF’s briefs has been another attorney at the organization, Erik Baptist. 
    
            Kacsmaryk has given both sides two hours each to argue the case. Some of the Justice Department’s time might be shared with lawyers for Danco, the drug company that has intervened. The challengers’ attorneys will be up first, and they’ll be allowed to reserve some of their two hours for rebuttal after the defendants have their chance to present to the judge.
    
            It is always possible that Kacsmaryk will rule on the preliminary injunction from the bench during hearing. But that is unlikely, given the high-profile nature of the case and the breadth of topics the judge has asked the lawyers to be prepared to argue on.
    
            When he does issue his ruling, if it is an order in favor of the challengers, he could proactively put the order on pause to give the DOJ time to appeal it to the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. If not, the department is expected to ask him, as well as the appellate court, to do so.
    
            If Kacsmaryk rejects the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, they will also have the opportunity to seek the immediate intervention of a higher court.
    
            It will also be worth watching whether Kacsmaryk addresses the death threats his courthouse has received and his botched attempt to minimize publicity around Wednesday’s hearing.
    
            Kacsmaryk called a private teleconference with the case’s attorneys Friday to discuss scheduling the hearing and the logistics for it. The teleconference, however, was not announced at the time on the public docket, and during the call, Kacsmaryk said he would hold off announcing Wednesday’s hearing publicly “to minimize some of the unnecessary death threats and voicemails and harassment that this division has received from the start of the case.”
    
            He asked the attorneys not to publicize it themselves, but the hearing – and Kacsmaryk’s request that the plan for it be kept quiet – was reported by The Washington Post Saturday. 
    
            As legal experts and media organizations criticized his secretive approach as undermining the principles of judicial transparency, Kacsmaryk announced the hearing on Monday. But his order did not address why he had sought to keep it under wraps and it is unclear whether the fracas will come be mentioned during Wednesday’s proceedings.
    
            Kacsmaryk said, according to a transcript of the Friday status conference obtained by CNN, that the courthouse had received a “barrage of death threats” and harassing phone calls.

      Polish court convicts rights activist for supplying pregnant woman with abortion pills

    ","
            Human rights groups have condemned the conviction of a Polish activist for supplying a pregnant woman with abortion pills in a landmark trial under the country’s ultra-strict abortion laws.
    
            A Warsaw court on Tuesday found activist Justyna Wydrzyńska guilty of assisting an abortion by supplying the drugs and sentenced her to 30 hours of community service a month for eight months, according to the judge.
    
            The case sets a precedent within the country that already has some of the most restrictive abortion legislation in Europe, which human rights watchers believe will further repress women’s reproductive rights.
    
            Wydrzyńska is a co-founder of the Polish activist group, Abortion Dream Team, which campaigns against abortion stigma in the country.
    
            In a post on its website, Abortion Dream Team said Wydrzyńska provided the pills to a woman named Ania, who was married to “an abusive man” who threatened to report a kidnapping if she traveled to Germany with her 3-year-old son for an abortion. 
    
            Ania’s partner reported her to the police, who then confiscated the pills.
    
            Wydrzyńska told the court she “would never wish for any woman to be alone in these tough situations,” adding she was “not ashamed” of her decision to assist the pregnant woman.
    
            “I don’t feel guilty at all. I just sat there and listened as if it didn’t concern me at all. I don’t accept the verdict,” the activist told journalists outside the court room after the hearing. 
    
            The case marks “the first time in recent history in which a human rights defender in Europe has been prosecuted and convicted for assisting with access to abortion,” according to the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), a global human rights organization of lawyers and advocates.
    
            In a statement Tuesday CRR’s senior legal advise Keina Yoshida called Wydrzyńska’s conviction “deeply concerning.”
    
            Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard warned in a statement that the case “sets a dangerous precedent in Poland, where abortion is nearly completely banned, and offers a chilling snapshot of the consequences of such restrictive laws.” 
    
            In Poland, abortions are only permissible in if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest or if the mother’s life is considered to be at risk. 
    
            The country’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has pledged to tighten abortion laws since coming into power in 2015, concentrating on removing the right of mothers to abort pregnancies in the case of a fatal fetal abnormality. 
    
            Although parliamentary opposition prevented the party from amending the law in October 2020, Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal – the country’s highest court – ruled it was unconstitutional for women to terminate pregnancies in the case of fetal abnormalities, saying the exception constituted “eugenic practices.”
    
            According to Amnesty, this ruling “eliminated one of the only remaining legal grounds for abortion under Poland’s highly restrictive law and its entry into force means that there is now effectively a near-total ban on abortion in Poland.”
    
            In her Tuesday statement, Amnesty’s Callamard said Wydrzyńska’s conviction “marks a depressing low in the repression of reproductive rights in Poland,” adding the activist’s lawyers plan to appeal the judgment – which is not final.

      Mortality rate for children and teens in the US surged in 2020 and 2021, study shows

            The mortality rate for children and teens in the United States surged in 2020 and 2021, driven not by deaths from Covid-19 but from fatal injuries from things like firearms, drugs and cars, according to a study published Monday in JAMA.  
    
            The pandemic years brought a marked shift to the trends in pediatric mortality, which had previously seen a “period of great progress,” according to the study authors. Pediatric deaths had been ticking up, but the latest annual increases – nearly 11% in 2020 and more than 8% in 2021 – were the largest in decades.
    
            “Medicine and public health have made remarkable progress in lowering pediatric mortality rates, but the lives they have saved are now endangered by man-made pathogens,” the authors, from Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and the University of Washington, wrote.  
    
            When Covid-19 and injuries are excluded, pediatric mortality actually decreased.
    
            Covid-19 mortality rates doubled among children between 2020 and 2021, but still only explained about a fifth of the total increase in mortality in 2021, according to the study.
    
            Instead, firearms “play a central role,” the authors said – accounting for nearly half of the increase in mortality in 2020.
    
            “Current efforts to understand gun violence, overcome political gridlock, and enact sensible firearm policies are not progressing with the speed that pediatric suicides and homicides require,” they wrote.
    
            Infants are the only age group that did not see a significant increase in mortality, but most of the surge was due to deaths among older children.
    
            For those ages 10 to 19, injury mortality increased 23% between 2019 and 2020 – including homicides that jumped 39% and drug overdoses that more than doubled.
    
            But even among younger children between 1 and 9, injuries explained nearly two-thirds of the increase in mortality between 2020 and 2021, according to the study.
    
            “Research and policy efforts to address the underlying causes—eg, depression, suicidality, opioid use, systemic racism, widening inequities, societal conflict—are urgently needed, as is system redesign to provide help for people affected by these conditions,” the study authors wrote.
    
            “A nation that begins losing its most cherished population—its children—faces a crisis like no other.”

      Judge says court handling medication abortion case has received ‘barrage’ of death threats

    ","
            A federal judge told lawyers involved in a major medication abortion case last week that he did not want to publicize plans to hold a hearing in the case because of a “barrage” of death threats and other harassment that has been directed towards his courthouse, according to a transcript obtained by CNN of a private status conference.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, on a teleconference with the attorneys on Friday, said: “This is not a gag order but just a request for courtesy given the death threats and harassing phone calls and voicemails that this division has received.”
    
            The judge did not say where the threats came from.
    
            “We want a fluid hearing with all parties being heard,” the judge added. “I think less advertisement of this hearing is better.”
    
            At Wednesday’s hearing, Kacsmaryk will be considering a request for a preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiffs, anti-abortion doctors and medical associations that are asking him to block the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a drug used in medication abortion.
    
            During the Friday teleconference, he said that he would put a public order scheduling the hearing on the public docket on Tuesday, the day before the Wednesday morning hearing in Amarillo, Texas.  
    
            “To minimize some of the unnecessary death threats and voicemails and harassment that this division has received from the start of the case, we’re going to post that later in the day,” Kacsmaryk said, according to the transcript. “So it may even be after business hours, but that will be publicly filed.”
    
            “Other elements of this case have brought a barrage of death threats and protesters and the rest. I don’t want that to disrupt your presentation to the court,” the judge told the attorneys on the call. 
    
            Kacsmaryk’s effort to delay the hearing plans from becoming public was first reported by The Washington Post on Saturday, and prompted a public outcry from media outlets and legal experts who said that the effort undermined the principles of judicial transparency. He ultimately posted the scheduling order for the hearing to the court’s docket on Monday afternoon, as well as a docket entry for the Friday call. 
    
            During the call, Kacsmaryk assured the attorneys that the normal courthouse security protocols will be in place for Wednesday’s hearing, but he asked that the attorneys “not further advertise or Tweet any of the details of this hearing so that all parties can be heard and we don’t have any unnecessary circus-like atmosphere of what should be more of an appellate-style proceeding.”
    
            The case concerns a challenge brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical associations to the federal government’s 2000 approval of a drug used to terminate pregnancies. Medication abortion is the most common method of abortion in the United States.
    
            If the judge grants the request to block access to the drug nationwide, it could make the pills harder to obtain even in states where medication abortion is legal.

            The federal judge overseeing a challenge to the federal government’s approval of a medication abortion drug announced Monday that there will be a hearing Wednesday in the case – an announcement that comes after reports the judge had privately sought to delay announcement of the hearing. 
    
            The hearing will be at 9 a.m. CT on Wednesday, according to the new order from US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk.
    
            Several media organizations had asked Kascmaryk to publicly announce his plans to hold a hearing Wednesday in a blockbuster medication abortion case after the judge reportedly moved to keep the hearing under wraps.
    
            “Across the ideological spectrum, the public is intensely interested in this case,” the organizations wrote in a Monday letter to the judge, which they filed before the scheduling order was posted to the docket.
    
            The case concerns a challenge brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical associations to the federal government’s 2000 approval of a drug used to terminate pregnancies. Medication abortion is the most common method of abortion in the United States. 
    
            If the judge grants the request to block access to the drug nationwide, it could make the pills harder to obtain even in states where medication abortion is legal.
    
            “The Court’s delayed docketing of notice of Wednesday’s hearing, and its request to the parties and their counsel not to disclose the hearing schedule publicly, harm everyone, including those who support the plaintiffs’ position and those who support the defendants’ position,” the media outlets added.
    
            The letter pointed to reporting by The Washington Post on Saturday that said on Friday, Kacsmaryk held a private phone call with the lawyers in the case and told them he was scheduling a hearing for Wednesday but not announcing those plans on the case’s docket until Tuesday evening. The judge reportedly told the lawyers not to publicize the hearing plans in the meantime.
    
            Kacsmaryk is currently considering the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction that would “withdrawal or suspend” that approval while the lawsuit plays out.
    
            The new order scheduling Wednesday’s hearing noted that on Friday, Kacsmaryk held a status conference with the lawyers for the party in the case. 
    
            The status conference was not publicized on the docket on Friday, but a notice for it was added to the docket on Monday with the scheduling order for the Wednesday hearing. 
    
            The parties will each have two hours to argue, according to the new schedule order, and Kacsmaryk listed a series of legal questions about the case their lawyers should be prepared to address. 
    
            The media outlets told Kacsmaryk in their letter that the “Court’s attempt to delay notice of and, therefore, limit the ability of members of the public, including the press, to attend Wednesday’s hearing is unconstitutional, and undermines the important values served by public access to judicial proceedings and court records.”
    
            Kacsmaryk’s courtroom is in Amarillo, Texas – a division in the northern Texas panhandle that is a several hours’ drive from Texas’ biggest cities and accessible only by a limited number of direct flights.
    
            According to the Post, Kacsmaryk told the case’s lawyers he was holding off until Tuesday to announce the Wednesday hearing to limit the potential for protests and disruptions to the proceedings.
    
            “The Court cannot constitutionally close the courtroom indirectly when it cannot constitutionally close the courtroom directly,” the media outlets wrote.
    
            “The United States Supreme Court has made clear that, because of our historical tradition of public access to judicial proceedings, and because of the structural necessity of such access to ensure government transparency and accountability, the circumstances in which a courtroom can be closed without violating the First Amendment and common law rights of access are rare.”
    
            The organizations signing onto the letter are the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, The Washington Post, NBCUniversal News Group, ProPublica, Inc., Texas Press Association, The Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, The Markup, and Gannett Co., Inc.

      What to know about the lawsuit aiming to ban medication abortion drug mifepristone
    ","

    ","
            A federal judge in Texas is considering a lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide, in the biggest abortion-related case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            The lawsuit, filed in November by anti-abortion advocates against the US Food and Drug Administration, targets the agency’s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process. 
    
            Medication abortion, which now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the fallout from the Supreme Court’s decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday on the issue. 
    
            Any decision that blocks access to medication abortion – even temporarily – will significantly disrupt abortion cases nationwide.
    
            Reproductive rights advocates say that if Kacsmaryk ultimately sides with the plaintiffs, “it would eliminate the most commonly used method of abortion care,” according to NARAL Pro-Choice America. 
    
            Here’s what to know about the lawsuit:
    
            The lawsuit, filed last year by a coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations under the umbrella of the “Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine” and several doctors, is seeking a number of actions by the court, chief among them a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering the FDA “to withdraw mifepristone and misoprostol as FDA-approved chemical abortion drugs and to withdraw defendants’ actions to deregulate these chemical abortion drugs.” 
    
            “After two decades of engaging the FDA to no avail, plaintiffs now ask this court to do what the FDA was and is legally required to do: protect women and girls by holding unlawful, setting aside, and vacating the FDA’s actions to approve chemical abortion drugs and eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo this dangerous drug regimen,” the complaint reads. 
    
            The challengers are also targeting the FDA’s recent moves to make the pills more accessible, which include removing the requirement that the pills be picked up in person from an abortion provider.
    
            The FDA responded to the lawsuit in January by asking the judge to deny a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that issuing one in the matter “would upend the status quo and the reliance interests of patients and doctors who depend on mifepristone, as well as businesses involved with mifepristone distribution.” 
    
            The agency also says a ruling against it would set a dangerous precedent.
    
            “More generally, if longstanding FDA drug approvals were so easily enjoined, even decades after being issued, pharmaceutical companies would be unable to confidently rely on FDA approval decisions to develop the pharmaceutical-drug infrastructure that Americans depend on to treat a variety of health conditions,” the FDA wrote.
    
            “A preliminary injunction would interfere with Congress’s decision to entrust FDA with responsibility to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs. In discharging this role, FDA applies its technical expertise to make complex scientific determinations about drugs’ safety and efficacy, and these determinations are entitled to substantial deference.”
    
            Danco, which makes mifepristone, also made a request similar to the FDA’s in a court filing, stressing that the lawsuit could decimate the company’s business. 
    
            The drug company has been allowed to intervene in the case, as the anti-abortion activists are also asking the court to halt the FDA’s 2016 approval of its version of the medication abortion drug. 
    
            “Danco is a small pharmaceutical company. It sells one drug: Mifeprex,” lawyers for the company wrote in court papers. “Entering the mandatory preliminary injunction plaintiffs seek would force FDA to withdraw approval for Danco’s only product, effectively shuttering Danco’s business.” 
    
            “Congress entrusts decision-making like this with the FDA. And they’re coming in trying to overrule that, saying this medication is unsafe because women bleed. Well, that’s part of having an abortion. It’s also part of having a pregnancy,” said Ryan Brown, an attorney representing Danco in the case. “The bottom line being that they just want to do away with abortion across the board and for any reason.”
    
            Kacsmaryk was appointed to the court in 2017 by then-President Trump and was confirmed by a 52-46 vote in 2019.
    
            Since then, he’s helped make Texas a legal graveyard for policies of President Joe Biden’s administration, presiding over 95% of the civil cases brought in Amarillo, Texas.
    
            In December, Kacsmaryk put on hold the Biden administration’s most recent attempt to end the so-called “Remain in Mexico” immigration program. And he has overseen Texas cases challenging vaccine mandates, the gender identity guidance issued by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the administration’s limits on the use of Covid-19 relief funds for tax cuts.
    
            Before joining the court, Kacsmaryk served as deputy general counsel at the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit religious liberty legal group, where he worked mainly on “religious liberty litigation in federal courts and amicus briefs in the US Supreme Court,” according to his White House biography.
    
            The abortion drug case is being closely watched by a number of interested parties, including Republican and Democratic state attorneys general. In February, two different multi-state coalitions filed amicus briefs with the court urging them to act one way or another in the matter. 
    
            A coalition of 22 Democratic attorneys general urged Kacsmaryk to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, writing in court papers that “annulling – or even merely limiting – any of the FDA’s actions relating to medication abortion would result in an even more drastic reduction in abortion access across the entire nation, worsening already dire outcomes, deepening entrenched disparities in access to health care, and placing a potentially unbearable strain on the health care system as a whole.” 
    
            They noted that “the availability of mifepristone has been particularly critical in providing access to abortion in low-income, underserved, and rural communities where procedural abortion may be unavailable,” adding that since the drug is used more during the first trimester of pregnancy, “eliminating access to this method will result in more abortions taking place later in pregnancy, further increasing costs and medical risks.”
    
            The Democratic attorneys general noted that abortion clinics in their states have already seen a surge in patients because of traffic from residents of states where extreme abortion restrictions are in effect. Cutting off access to medication abortion would further overburden those clinics, the blue states argued, as surgical abortion would be the only available method.
    
            A coalition of 22 Republican attorneys general, meanwhile, asked the court to issue the preliminary injunction, arguing the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved the medication. 
    
            “State laws on chemical abortion thus account for the public interests at issue – and they do so with the benefit of democratic legitimacy (and legal authority). The FDA’s actions can make no such claim. By obstructing the judgments of elected representatives, the agency has undermined the public interest,” they wrote.
    
            Abortion rights advocates have sounded the alarm on the case, stressing that a ruling by Kacsmaryk in favor of the plaintiffs would affect every corner of the country since the lawsuit is targeting a federal agency. 
    
            “If FDA approval of mifepristone is revoked, 64.5 million women of reproductive age in the US would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight,” NARAL said in a statement in February, pointing to internal research.
    
            “This research reveals the high stakes of this lawsuit, and we can only expect the worst from this Trump-appointed federal judge. Americans want access to abortion, but anti-choice bad actors are dead set on restricting reproductive freedom by any means possible,” said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, the group’s vice president of communications and research. 
    
            And activists quickly mobilized in Texas around the issue, with the Women’s March holding a rally at the federal courthouse in Amarillo in February to protest the suit. 
    
            “We’ve said it before: the fight for reproductive rights now lies in the states, and legal challenges like these are just the latest example of how our fight is bigger than Roe,” said Rachel Carmona, the executive director of Women’s March. 
    
            Kacsmaryk had been considering whether to consolidate a potential hearing on the preliminary injunction request with a trial on the merits of the lawsuit, a move that would have fast-tracked the entire case. 
    
            He asked the parties to weigh in, with both the plaintiffs and Danco voicing support for the consolidation. The FDA, however, urged the judge not to fast-track the trial, saying in a brief that because of the plaintiffs’ “extreme delay in filing suit to challenge FDA’s approval of the drug, there is no reason to decide this case on an emergency basis.” 
    
            Kacsmaryk ultimately decided against fast-tracking the trial, writing in a February 21 order: “Having considered the briefing and relevant law, the court determines that consolidation would not be appropriate in this case.” 
    
            Wednesday’s hearing will give both sides an opportunity to present their arguments to the judge and address a number of issues he has outlined.
    
            The judge’s decision to notify the public of the hearing came days after he held a private call with the case’s lawyers to schedule the hearing, according to The Washington Post. The call was not publicly reflected on the case’s docket for several days, nor did the judge immediately issue a public order announcing that a hearing had been scheduled. The case is not under seal.
    
            Because he has decided against fast-tracking the trial in the case, his first ruling will be only on the preliminary injunction request, which, if granted in full, would temporarily pull the abortion drug from the market.
    
            A day before the plaintiffs had submitted their brief, 12 states led by liberal attorneys general sued the FDA, saying its limits on mifepristone are too strict.
    
            The suit creates the possibility of circuit courts offering conflicting takes about the safety of abortion medication and how accessible the drug should be, something that would increase the likelihood of the Supreme Court weighing in.  
    
            The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Washington state. The states in the lawsuit are: Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont.

      Death of twin baby boy after suspected kidnapping is ruled a ‘sudden unexplained infant death,’ Ohio coroner says

            A 6-month-old baby who survived an alleged kidnapping alongside his twin brother died one month later in a “sudden unexplained infant death,” an Ohio coroner’s office said Friday.
    
            An autopsy following Ky’air Thomas’ January 28 death revealed “the infant was placed face down (prone) on an adult bed with excess bedding and pillows (unsafe sleep environment), unsupervised,” the Franklin County Coroner’s Office said in a written statement.
    
            “It is well documented that infants under the age of 8 months have limited strength in the neck musculature to reposition their airway when encountering possible obstructions,” the coroner’s office said.
    
            “This is a form of oxygen deprivation (anoxic brain injury), however, because a contributory component of mechanical or obstructive asphyxia can be neither confirmed nor excluded in this infant’s death … the manner of death is best ruled as Undetermined.”
    
            The coroner’s office said it found “no evidence of trauma, foul play, abuse, or neglect.”
    
            Previously, authorities spelled Ky’air’s name as Kyair Thomass.
    
            The baby first made national headlines after he and his twin brother, Kason, were allegedly kidnapped in Columbus, Ohio.
    
            On December 19, Ky’air and Kason were left inside a running car as their mother, Wilhelmina Thomas, was picking up a restaurant order while working as a DoorDash driver, according to Columbus police.
    
            When she returned, the car and her 5-month-old boys had vanished.
    
            Ky’air was later found alive, abandoned near the Dayton International Airport. Days later, Kason was found alive inside the stolen car more than 100 miles away, in Indianapolis.
    
            Suspect Nalah Jackson, 24, was taken into custody on suspicion of kidnapping and faces state and federal charges, authorities said.

      Washington Post: Judge keeps plans for medication abortion hearing out of public view for now

            A federal judge has set a hearing for next week in a blockbuster medication abortion case in Texas but took a series of highly unusual steps to delay making the public aware that such a hearing was being scheduled, The Washington Post reported.
    
            US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who is hearing the case, held a private call Friday with the case’s lawyers and scheduled the hearing for Wednesday, according to the Post. The call was not publicly noticed on the case’s docket, nor did the judge issue a public order announcing that Wednesday’s hearing had been scheduled. The case is not under seal.
    
            In the case, anti-abortion doctors are asking the judge – an appointee of former President Donald Trump – to undo the federal government’s 2000 approval of pills used to terminate a pregnancy. Such a move could cut off access nationwide to the most common method of abortion.
    
            Kacsmaryk told the lawyers on the call, according to the newspaper, that he would hold off on publicly announcing the Wednesday hearing until Tuesday evening, so as to limit disruptions and potential protests at the proceeding. He also asked that the attorneys on the call – which reportedly included the Justice Department’s lawyers who are defending the drug’s approval, lawyers for the anti-abortion activists who are challenging it, and lawyers for a company that distributes the drug and has intervened in the case – not to publicize the hearing plans before then.
    
            The judge’s efforts to limit transparency around Wednesday’s hearing comes in a case that has major implications for access to abortion and is arguably the biggest legal battle over the procedure since the Supreme Court overturned nationwide abortion protections in a ruling last June.
    
            Voicemails left by CNN on Sunday morning with the court’s clerk’s office and with Kacsmaryk’s chambers about the Post’s Saturday night report were not immediately returned.
    
            The case is unfolding in Amarillo – a far-flung court division in Texas’ northern panhandle that is a several hours’ drive from the state’s biggest cities and has only limited direct flight routes. Federal judicial proceedings typically play out in public.

      Texas man files wrongful death suit against women for allegedly helping his ex-wife get abortion pills

            In one of the first major legal tests of laws cracking down on abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned, a Texas man filed a lawsuit against three women claiming they illegally assisted his ex-wife in her abortion. 
    
            Marcus Silva argued in his wrongful death lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in Galveston County, that the three women were liable in the death of his unborn child after allegedly helping his then-wife terminate her pregnancy with medication. 
    
            “Under the law of Texas, a person who assists a pregnant woman in obtaining a self-managed abortion has committed the crime of murder and can be sued for wrongful death,” the lawsuit argues. A pregnant woman who receives an abortion is not liable under state law, and Silva’s ex-wife is not named as a defendant in the case.
    
            The lawsuit states that Silva’s then-wife discovered she was pregnant in July 2022 after the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8, which made most abortions illegal after approximately six weeks of pregnancy. The law also allows for private citizens to file civil suits against abortion providers or anyone who “knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion. The couple divorced in February 2023 and Silva says he was the father of the fetus, the lawsuit states. 
    
            The lawsuit includes alleged text messages between Silva’s ex-wife and two of the defendants that appear to show them discussing obtaining pills to terminate the pregnancy, as well as disposing of the pregnancy test to hide the results from Silva. The third defendant is accused of helping to get the pills to Silva’s ex-wife, according to the lawsuit. 
    
            It was not clear Friday night if the defendants had been served with the lawsuit, nor if they had attorneys. The suit states that Silva also intends to sue the medications’ manufacturer to discover what pills his ex-wife used.
    
            Silva is represented in court by Briscoe Cain, a practicing attorney and a Republican serving in the Texas state House, and Jonathan Mitchell, a former state Solicitor General who has been credited as one of the architects of Senate Bill 8. 
    
            Silva is asking the court for damages exceeding $1,000,000. A status conference in the case is set for June.

      Insurance requirements for prior authorization may prompt ‘devastating’ delays

            When Paula Chestnut needed hip replacement surgery last year, a pre-operative X-ray found irregularities in her chest.
    
            As a smoker for 40 years, Chestnut was at high risk for lung cancer. A specialist in Los Angeles recommended the 67-year-old undergo an MRI, a high-resolution image that could help spot the disease.
    
            But her MRI appointment kept getting canceled, Chestnut’s son, Jaron Roux, told KHN. First, it was scheduled at the wrong hospital. Next, the provider wasn’t available. The ultimate roadblock she faced, Roux said, arrived when Chestnut’s health insurer deemed the MRI medically unnecessary and would not authorize the visit.
    
            “On at least four or five occasions, she called me up, hysterical,” Roux said.
    
            Months later, Chestnut, struggling to breathe, was rushed to the emergency room. A tumor in her chest had become so large that it was pressing against her windpipe. Doctors started a regimen of chemotherapy, but it was too late. Despite treatment, she died in the hospital within six weeks of being admitted.
    
            Though Roux doesn’t fully blame the health insurer for his mother’s death, “it was a contributing factor,” he said. “It limited her options.”
    
            Few things about the American health care system infuriate patients and doctors more than prior authorization, a common tool whose use by insurers has exploded in recent years.
    
            Prior authorization, or pre-certification, was designed decades ago to prevent doctors from ordering expensive tests or procedures that are not indicated or needed, with the aim of delivering cost-effective care.
    
            Originally focused on the costliest types of care, such as cancer treatment, insurers now commonly require prior authorization for many mundane medical encounters, including basic imaging and prescription refills. In a 2021 survey conducted by the American Medical Association, 40% of physicians said they have staffers who work exclusively on prior authorization.
    
            So today, instead of providing a guardrail against useless, expensive treatment, pre-authorization prevents patients from getting the vital care they need, researchers and doctors say.
    
            “The prior authorization system should be completely done away with in physicians’ offices,” said Dr. Shikha Jain, a Chicago hematologist-oncologist. “It’s really devastating, these unnecessary delays.”
    
            In December, the federal government proposed several changes that would force health plans, including Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and federal Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, to speed up prior authorization decisions and provide more information about the reasons for denials. Starting in 2026, it would require plans to respond to a standard prior authorization request within seven days, typically, instead of the current 14, and within 72 hours for urgent requests. The proposed rule was scheduled to be open for public comment through March 13.
    
            Although groups like AHIP, an industry trade group formerly called America’s Health Insurance Plans, and the American Medical Association, which represents more than 250,000 physicians in the United States, have expressed support for the proposed changes, some doctors feel they don’t go far enough.
    
            “Seven days is still way too long,” said Dr. Julie Kanter, a hematologist in Birmingham, Alabama, whose sickle cell patients can’t delay care when they arrive at the hospital showing signs of stroke. “We need to move very quickly. We have to make decisions.”
    
            Meanwhile, some states have passed their own laws governing the process. In Oregon, for example, health insurers must respond to nonemergency prior authorization requests within two business days. In Michigan, insurers must report annual prior authorization data, including the number of requests denied and appeals received. Other states have adopted or are considering similar legislation, while in many places insurers regularly take four to six weeks for non-urgent appeals.
    
            Waiting for health insurers to authorize care comes with consequences for patients, various studies show. It has led to delays in cancer care in Pennsylvania, meant sick children in Colorado were more likely to be hospitalized, and blocked low-income patients across the country from getting treatment for opioid addiction.
    
            In some cases, care has been denied and never obtained. In others, prior authorization proved a potent but indirect deterrent, as few patients have the fortitude, time, or resources to navigate what can be a labyrinthine process of denials and appeals. They simply gave up, because fighting denials often requires patients to spend hours on the phone and computer to submit multiple forms.
    
            Erin Conlisk, a social science researcher for the University of California-Riverside, estimated she spent dozens of hours last summer trying to obtain prior authorization for a 6-mile round-trip ambulance ride to get her mother to a clinic in San Diego.
    
            Her 81-year-old mother has rheumatoid arthritis and has had trouble sitting up, walking, or standing without help after she damaged a tendon in her pelvis last year.
    
            Conlisk thought her mom’s case was clear-cut, especially since they had successfully scheduled an ambulance transport a few weeks earlier to the same clinic. But the ambulance didn’t show on the day Conlisk was told it would. No one notified them the ride hadn’t been pre-authorized.
    
            The time it takes to juggle a prior authorization request can also perpetuate racial disparities and disproportionately affect those with lower-paying, hourly jobs, said Dr. Kathleen McManus, a physician-scientist at the University of Virginia.
    
            “When people ask for an example of structural racism in medicine, this is one that I give them,” McManus said. “It’s baked into the system.”
    
            Research that McManus and her colleagues published in 2020 found that federal Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance plans in the South were 16 times more likely to require prior authorization for HIV prevention drugs than those in the Northeast. The reason for these regional disparities is unknown. But she said that because more than half the nation’s Black population lives in the South, they’d be the patients more likely to face this barrier.
    
            Many of the denied claims are reversed if a patient appeals, according to the federal government. New data specific to Medicare Advantage plans found 82% of appeals resulted in fully or partially overturning the initial prior authorization denial, according to KFF.
    
            It’s not just patients who are confused and frustrated by the process. Doctors said they find the system convoluted and time-consuming, and feel as if their expertise is being challenged.
    
            “I lose hours of time that I really don’t have to argue … with someone who doesn’t even really know what I’m talking about,” said Kanter, the hematologist in Birmingham. “The people who are making these decisions are rarely in your field of medicine.”
    
            Occasionally, she said, it’s more efficient to send patients to the emergency room than it is to negotiate with their insurance plan to pre-authorize imaging or tests. But emergency care costs both the insurer and the patient more.
    
            “It’s a terrible system,” she said.
    
            A KFF analysis of 2021 claims data found that 9% of all in-network denials by Affordable Care Act plans on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, were attributed to lack of prior authorization or referrals, but some companies are more likely to deny a claim for these reasons than others. In Texas, for example, the analysis found 22% of all denials made by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas and 24% of all denials made by Celtic Insurance Co. were based on lack of prior authorization.
    
            Facing scrutiny, some insurers are revising their prior authorization policies. UnitedHealthcare has cut the number of prior authorizations in half in recent years by eliminating the need for patients to obtain permission for some diagnostic procedures, like MRIs and CT scans, said company spokesperson Heather Soules. Health insurers have also adopted artificial intelligence technology to speed up prior authorization decisions.
    
            Meanwhile, most patients have no means of avoiding the burdensome process that has become a defining feature of American health care. But even those who have the time and energy to fight back may not get the outcome they hoped for.
    
            When the ambulance never showed in July, Conlisk and her mother’s caregiver decided to drive the patient to the clinic in the caregiver’s car.
    
            “She almost fell outside the office,” said Conlisk, who needed the assistance of five bystanders to move her mother safely into the clinic.
    
            When her mother needed an ambulance for another appointment in September, Conlisk vowed to spend only one hour a day, for two weeks leading up to the clinic visit, working to get prior authorization. Her efforts were unsuccessful. Once again, her mother’s caregiver drove her to the clinic himself.

      Judge under fire for ordering breastfeeding mother to leave courtroom

            An Australian judge has been widely criticized for asking a breastfeeding mother to leave a public gallery in his courtroom and then defending his decision as “self-explanatory.”
    
            Mark Gamble, a judge in the County Court of Victoria, told the woman, who was feeding her child under a blanket while observing the trial, that she needed to leave because it might be “distraction for the jury,” CNN affiliate 9News reported. 
    
            The news network reported that the woman, who wished to remain anonymous, told a local newspaper she felt shocked and degraded and started crying after leaving the courtroom in Melbourne. 
    
            Naomi Hull of the Australian Breastfeeding Association told 9News she was “completely shocked” by the incident. 
    
            “It’s really disappointing to hear that this kind of thing is still happening,” she added.
    
            Ingrid Stitt, minister for early childhood in the state of Victoria, said she understood the state’s attorney-general would talk to the courts about the issue, CNN affiliate 7News reported.
    
            “I mean, it’s 2023 for goodness sake, and women should never (feel) that they can’t actually feed their child, which is perfectly natural and a pretty basic thing,” she said. 
    
            “We need to be able to make women feel that there’s nothing wrong with them caring for their child, including feeding their child in public places.”
    
            Gamble later explained the decision to the jury, who were not in the courtroom when he asked the woman to leave.
    
            “It should all be self-explanatory, members of the jury,” he said, according to 9News. 
    
            “What I said was this, and I am reading from the transcripts: ‘Madam, you will not be permitted to breastfeed a baby in court. I’m sorry. I will have to ask you to leave. It will be a distraction for the jury at the very least. Thank you,’” he added. 
    
            In 2016, the Australian Parliament changed its rules to allow female lawmakers to nurse their infants in the chamber, and in 2017, then-Queensland Sen. Larissa Waters became the first person to breastfeed in federal parliament.
    
            According to the Australian Breastfeeding Association, “a mother’s right to breastfeed her child is protected by law both federally and in every State and Territory,” and under the country’s federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984, it is illegal to discriminate against a person either directly or indirectly on the grounds of breastfeeding.  
    
            In the state of Victoria, discrimination due to breastfeeding is illegal in the areas of “accommodation, clubs, education, employment, goods and services, selling and transferring land, and sport,” the association adds, though it does not mention courtrooms specifically. 
    
            CNN has reached out to the County Court of Victoria for comment.

      Canadian siblings born four months early set record as the world’s most premature twins

    ","
            For expectant parents Shakina Rajendram and Kevin Nadarajah, the doctor’s words were both definitive and devastating: Their twins were not “viable.”
    
            “Even in that moment, as I was hearing those words come out of the doctor’s mouth, I could still feel the babies very much alive within me. And so for me, I just wasn’t able to comprehend how babies who felt very much alive within me could not be viable,” Rajendram recalled.
    
            Still, she knew that there was no way she would be able to carry to term. She had begun bleeding, and the doctor said she would give birth soon. The parents-to-be were told that they would be able to hold their babies but that they would not be resuscitated, as they were too premature.
    
            Rajendram, 35, and Nadarajah, 37, had married and settled in Ajax, Ontario, about 35 miles east of Toronto, to start a family. They had conceived once before, but the pregnancy was ectopic – outside the uterus – and ended after a few months. 
    
            As crushing as the doctor’s news was, Nadarajah said, they both refused to believe their babies would not make it. And so they scoured the Internet, finding information that both alarmed and encouraged them. The babies were at just 21 weeks and five days gestation; to have a chance, they would need to stay in the womb a day and a half longer, and Rajendram would have to go to a specialized hospital that could treat “micropreemies.”
    
            The earlier a baby is born, the higher the risk of death or serious disability, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Babies born preterm, before 37 weeks gestation, can have breathing issues, digestive problems and brain bleeds. Development challenges and delays can also last a lifetime.
    
            The problems can be especially severe for micropreemies, those born before 26 weeks gestation who weigh less than 26 ounces.
    
            Research has found that infants born at 22 weeks who get active medical treatment have survival rates of 25% to 50%, according to a 2019 study.
    
            Rajendram and Nadarajah requested a transfer to Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, one of a limited number of medical centers in North America that provides resuscitation and active care at 22 weeks gestation.
    
            Then, they say, they “prayed hard,” with Rajendram determined to keep the babies inside her just a few hours longer. 
    
            Just one hour after midnight on March 4, 2022, at 22 weeks gestation, Adiah Laelynn Nadarajah was born weighing under 12 ounces. Her brother, Adrial Luka Nadarajah, joined her 23 minutes later, weighing not quite 15 ounces.
    
            According to Guinness World Records, the pair are both the most premature and lightest twins ever born. The previous record holders for premature twins were the Ewoldt twins, born in Iowa at the gestational age of 22 weeks, 1 day.
    
            It is a record these parents say they want broken as soon as possible so more babies are given the opportunity to survive.  
    
            “They were perfect in every sense to us,” Rajendram said. “They were born smaller than the palm of our hands. People still don’t believe us when we tell them.”
    
             The babies were born at just the right time to be eligible to receive proactive care, resuscitation, nutrition and vital organ support, according to Mount Sinai Hospital.  Even an hour earlier, the care team may not have been able to intervene medically.
    
             “We just didn’t really understand why that strict cut off at 22, but we know that the hospital had their reasons. They were in uncharted territory, and I know that they had to possibly create some parameters around what they could do,” Rajendram said.
    
             “They’re definitely miracles,” Nadarajah said as he described seeing the twins in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first time and trying to come to terms with what they would go through in their fight to survive.
    
            “I had challenging feelings, conflicting feelings, seeing how tiny they were on one hand, feeling the joy of seeing two babies on the second hand. I was thinking, ‘how much pain they are in?’ It was so conflicting. They were so tiny,” he said. 
    
            These risks and setbacks are common in the lives of micropreemies.
    
            Dr. Prakesh Shah, the pediatrician-in-chief at Mount Sinai Hospital, said he was straightforward with the couple about the challenges ahead for their twins.
    
            He warned of a struggle just to keep Adiah and Adrial breathing, let alone feed them.
    
            The babies weighed little more than a can of soda, with their organs visible through translucent skin. The needle used to give them nutrition was less than 2 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a thin knitting needle.
    
            “At some stage, many of us would have felt that, ‘is this the right thing to do for these babies?’ These babies were in significant pain, distress, and their skin was peeling off. Even removing surgical tape would mean that their skin would peel off,” Shah told CNN. 
    
            But what their parents saw gave them hope. 
    
            “We could see through their skin. We could see their hearts beating,” Rajendram said.
    
            They had to weigh all the risks of going forward and agreeing to more and more medical intervention. There could be months or even years of painful, difficult treatment ahead, along with the long-term risks of things like muscle development problems, cerebral palsy, language delays, cognitive delays, blindness and deafness.
    
            Rajendram and Nadarajah did not dare hope for another miracle, but they say they knew their babies were fighters, and they resolved to give them a chance at life. 
    
            “The strength that Kevin and I had as parents, we had to believe that our babies had that same strength, that they have that same resilience. And so yes, they would have to go through pain, and they’re going to continue going through difficult moments, even through their adult life, not only as premature babies. But we believed that they would have a stronger resolve, a resilience that would enable them to get through those painful moments in the NICU,” Rajendram said.
    
            There were painful setbacks over nearly half a year of treatment in the hospital, especially in the first few weeks. 
    
            “There were several instances in the early days where we were asked about withdrawing care, that’s just a fact, and so those were the moments where we just rallied in prayer, and we saw a turnaround,” Nadarajah said.
    
            Adiah spent 161 days in the hospital and went home on August 11, six days before her brother, Adrial, joined her there.
    
            Adrial’s road has been a bit more difficult. He has been hospitalized three more times with various infections, sometimes spending weeks in the hospital.
    
            Both siblings continue with specialist checkups and various types of therapy several times a month.
    
            But the new parents are finally more at ease, celebrating their babies’ homecoming and learning all they can about their personalities.
    
            The twins are now meeting many of the milestones of babies for their “corrected age,” where they would be if they were born at full-term. 
    
            “The one thing that really surprised me, when both of them were ready to go home, both of them went home without oxygen, no feeding tube, nothing, they just went home. They were feeding on their own and maintaining their oxygen,” Shah said. 
    
            Adiah is now very social and has long conversations with everyone she meets. Their parents describe Adrial as wise for his years, curious and intelligent, with a love of music.
    
            “We feel it’s very important to highlight that contrary to what was expected of them, our babies are happy, healthy, active babies who are breathing and feeding on their own, rolling over, babbling all the time, growing well, playing, and enjoying life as babies,” Rajendram said. 
    
            These parents hope their story will inspire other families and health professionals to reassess the issue of viability before 22 weeks gestation, even when confronted with sobering survival rates and risks of long-term disability.
    
            “Even five years ago, we would not have gone for it, if it was not for the better help we can now provide,” Shah said, adding that medical teams are using life-sustaining technology in a better way than in previous years. “It’s allowing us to sustain these babies, helping keep oxygen in their bodies, the role of carbon dioxide, without causing lung injury.”
    
            Adiah and Adrial’s parents say they’re not expecting perfect children with perfect health but are striving to provide the best possible life for them.
    
            “This journey has empowered us to advocate for the lives of other preterm infants like Adiah and Adrial, who would not be alive today if the boundaries of viability had not been challenged by their health care team,” Rajendram said.

      Newsom to shut Walgreens out of California state business following abortion pill decision
    ","
			By Gregory Krieg and Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN

    ","
            California will cease all its business with Walgreens, the retail drugstore chain, Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Monday, days after the company announced it would not dispense abortion medication in 21 Republican-dominated states.
    
            “California won’t be doing business with @walgreens – or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women’s lives at risk,” the Democratic governor tweeted. “We’re done.”
    
            Newsom’s pushback came at an already fraught time for the future of medication abortion, which is used in more than half of all procedures nationwide, as a Texas judge weighs issuing a ban on Mifepristone, the first pill in a two-drug abortion regimen. Walgreens had responded to legal pressure from Republican attorneys general in 21 states – including a handful where abortion remains legal – in deciding to partially halt its efforts to sell the drug.
    
            “We intend to be a certified pharmacy and will distribute Mifepristone only in those jurisdictions where it is legal and operationally feasible,” the company said last week in a statement.
    
            Walgreens declined to comment on Newsom’s tweet.
    
            The clash between Newsom and Walgreens, a massive chain with thousands of stores around the country, marks the latest round of fallout following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The ruling, handed down in June of last year, shook up national politics ahead of the 2022 midterms – with many Democrats crediting the backlash for helping their candidates in tough, swing state and seat races – and complicated relationships between political and business leaders.
    
            The state is currently “reviewing all relationships between Walgreens and the state,” said Newsom spokesman Brandon Richards. He also accused the company of giving in to “right wing bullies.”
    
            Newsom’s office announced Wednesday that California would be “pulling back” a renewal of a $54 million contract with Walgreens that would have taken effect May 1, 2023. 
    
            California’s Department of General Services holds a contract with the retailer “to procure specialty pharmacy prescription drugs,” mostly used by the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and its correctional health care system, Newsom’s office said in a news release. 
    
            The state will explore other options “for furnishing the same services,” his office said.
    
            Walgreens senior director for external relations Fraser Engerman said in a statement Wednesday that the company was “deeply disappointed” with the announcement and said that the decision not to renew was made off of “false and misleading information.”
    
            Late last week, Democratic California state Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a statement slamming Walgreens for bowing to political pressure from GOP officials. 
    
            “Medication abortion is safe, effective, and serves as a lifeline for people in need of critical care, especially those from vulnerable and underserved communities,” Bonta said on Friday. “I am disappointed that Walgreens has decided to give in to political pressure from anti-abortion states, and cut off access to these necessary and lifesaving medications.”
    
            The company on Wednesday sought to clarify its position, though their latest statement only added to the confusion.
    
            “Our position has always been that, once we are certified by the FDA, Walgreens plans to dispense Mifepristone in any jurisdiction where it is legally permissible to do so,” Engerman said. Medication abortion is legal and accessible in states like Kansas and Iowa, among others, despite opposition from top Republicans, who have threatened legal action.
    
            In a letter addressed to Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, an anti-abortion Republican, from last month, Walgreens said it “does not intend to dispense Mifepristone within your state and does not intend to ship Mifepristone into your state from any of our pharmacies.”
    
            Abortion remains protected under Kansas state law. Last summer, the state voted overwhelmingly to block efforts by lawmakers to ban the procedure following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade less than two months earlier.
    
            The US Food and Drug Administration said in early January that pharmacies certified to dispense Mifepristone can do so directly to someone who has a prescription from a prescriber.

      Opinion: Walgreens’ abortion pill decision sends a chilling message
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler

  Updated
        4:58 PM EST, Wed March 8, 2023
    ","
            In January, some pharmacy chains announced plans to distribute mifepristone to patients with prescriptions, following a US Food and Drug Administration policy change permitting the direct sale of the abortion drug by certified pharmacies. 
    
            Just a few months later, one of the country’s biggest  pharmacy retailers, Walgreens, abruptly announced that it wouldn’t distribute mifepristone in 21 Republican-controlled states. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a tweet that the state of California “won’t be doing business” with the chain, “or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women’s lives at risk.” Walgreens told NPR in a statement on Friday that it’s working to sell the drug in “jurisdictions where it is legal and operationally feasible.”
    
            One reason Walgreens’ move is so stunning is because the states where the company has decided not to make the drug available include several which have legalized abortion or protected it under their state constitution—including Florida, Kansas and Montana.
    
            In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has pledged to sign a ban on abortion at six weeks, but nothing has crossed his desk yet and abortion remains legal in the state until 15 weeks. In Kansas and Montana, voters last year rejected ballot initiatives eroding abortion rights. 
    
            None of that seemed to make any difference to Walgreens. Nor did it matter that no lawsuit has been filed challenging the sale of the abortion medication. The warning of potential legal action was enough to make the company backtrack. 
    
            Walgreens’ decision sends a chilling message: the mere threat of legal consequences counts for more with some in corporate America than the very real lives of the women. 
    
            In a February letter sent to Walgreens and other pharmacies, a number of state attorneys general warned—falsely—that distributing abortion medication through the mail was illegal under federal law. So what exactly did they threaten?
    
            They pointed to the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that “prohibits using the mail to send or receive any drug that will ‘be used or applied for producing abortion.’” Here it should be noted that the Biden Justice Department argues that the Comstock Act applies much more narrowly—only to drugs that are intended for criminal use—not to those received under bona fide prescription. The interpretation embraced by the attorneys general would seemingly ban all abortions, even surgical procedures, that involve an item or medication sent in the mail.
    
            Of course, state prosecutors don’t enforce federal laws, but these attorneys general had a work-around. They  threatened to go after Walgreens for alleged violation of state laws disallowing the mailing of abortion pills. But these provisions conflict with FDA policy. Separate lawsuits that have been filed in West Virginia and North Carolina argue that federal policy trumps conflicting state laws. 
    
            The attorneys general have a work-around for using the Comstock Act, too Many states have laws that bar deceptive trade practices, statutes that cover everything from false advertising to harassment by telemarketers. The attorneys general argue that because abortion is already illegal under federal law, selling abortion pills—no matter how it’s done or what state law says—violates these consumer protection laws. 
    
            Some conservative attorneys general have also argued that retailers who sell mifepristone could be prosecuted for violating federal racketeering laws. But federal racketeering law only allows state prosecutors to bring lawsuits for injuries to “business or property.” It’s hard to see how state attorneys general would even have standing to sue.
    
            There has been a lot of talk by conservative prosecutors but no action so far, and little certainty that any of these prosecutions will go anywhere. Walgreens’ decision is striking for just that reason: it is a reminder of a broader campaign of intimidation started by  governments in red states—and a sign that those threats are already working. 
    
            State lawmakers have sent threatening letters to law firms and corporations that reimburse their employees for travel out of state for abortion, accusing them of helping people “murder their unborn children.” Conservative legislators have filed bills that would criminalize corporations that help employees seeking abortion or bar them from doing business in the state. The threat of criminal charges or civil suits may be more than enough for corporations that have never spoken out on abortion rights.
    
            Polls have consistently shown that most Americans support abortion rights, with an uptick since the Supreme Court eviscerated abortion rights in June. After the Dobbs decision, a number of corporations announced that they would reimburse their employees for travel for abortion. This may not be merely a decision rooted in principle: nearly half the US workforce is female or able to get pregnant, and women outnumber men in jobs requiring a college degree. 
    
            The threat of loss of care—including for pregnancy loss—may be an important factor for people of reproductive age in deciding where to live or work. Some companies, like Salesforce and Google, have even offered to relocate employees who wish to work in another state. 
    
            Conservatives are betting that the threat of legal liability is enough to frighten corporations into changing their minds—and that their worries about workers of reproductive age don’t run that deep. For years, corporations tried to avoid being drawn into the battle over abortion. But that battle, it seems, has found them.

      Texas sued by women who say state’s abortion bans put their health at risk
    ","
			By Tierney Sneed

        2:52 PM EST, Tue March 7, 2023
    ","
            Several women who say Texas’ abortion bans posed significant risks to their health have sued the state this week, opening a new front in the legal battles that have emerged since the Supreme Court overturned national abortion rights protections last year.
    
            Five women allege in the lawsuit that uncertainty around when medical emergency exemptions in Texas’ abortion laws apply exacerbated medical emergencies that put their lives, health and fertility in danger.
    
            “To the extent Texas’s abortion bans bar the provision of abortion to pregnant people to treat medical conditions that pose a risk to the pregnant person’s life or a significant risk to their health,” the lawsuit says, “the Bans violate pregnant people’s” rights under the state constitution’s provisions protecting fundamental rights and the right to equality.
    
            The lawsuit is not seeking to block Texas’ abortion bans outright. Rather, the women – who are joined by two medical providers in the lawsuit – ask the court to clarify that abortions can be performed when a physician makes a “good faith judgment” that “the pregnant person has a physical emergent medical condition that poses a risk of death or a risk to their health (including their fertility).”
    
            The women’s complaint details harrowing stories of being denied abortion care when they faced emergency complications in their pregnancies, which were all wanted. They filed the lawsuit Monday evening in state court in Austin, Texas.
    
            Texas, its Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Texas Medical Board and its Executive Director Stephen Brint Carlton are listed as defendants in the lawsuit. 
    
            A spokesperson for Paxton said in a statement that he “is committed to doing everything in his power to protect mothers, families, and unborn children, and he will continue to defend and enforce the laws duly enacted by the Texas Legislature.” 
    
            The spokesperson, Paige Willey, also pointed to guidance Paxton issued after last year’s Supreme Court ruling that said the state’s trigger law “protects women facing life- threatening physical conditions resulting from pregnancy complications.”
    
            A spokesperson for the state medical board did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. Gov. Greg Abbott’s office also did not immediately respond to CNN’s inquiry.
    
            Texas, which has arguably the most aggressive abortion restrictions in the country, has been the site of several legal battles over abortion since before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June. 
    
            A challenge that predated that ruling to Texas’ 2021 civil enforcement abortion ban – which allows private civil lawsuits against anyone accused of facilitating abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks into the pregnancy – also went up to the Supreme Court. The justices allowed the law to stay in effect, even though at the time Roe was still on the books.
    
            Texas also preemptively sued last year to block guidance from the Biden administration that instructed health care providers that federal law obligated them to provide abortion care in medical emergencies. A federal judge sided with Texas and halted enforcement of the guidance – which threatened civil penalties and conditioned federal funding on compliance – in the state.
    
            The abortion laws in question in the new lawsuit are the six-week civil enforcement ban, a so-called “trigger ban” that went into effect after the Supreme Court’s ruling last year, and a pre-Roe abortion ban. The statutes contain language allowing exemptions for medical emergencies.
    
            “Yet inconsistencies in the language of these provisions, the use of non-medical terminology, and sloppy legislative drafting have resulted in understandable confusion throughout the medical profession regarding the scope of the exception,” the lawsuit says.
    
            The lawsuit also highlights a letter from the civil enforcement ban’s legislative sponsor to the head of the Texas Medical Board, raising concerns about reports that women facing dire health emergencies from their pregnancies were being denied care that the lawmaker said was covered by the exceptions in the state abortion code.
    
            “Texas law makes it clear that a mother’s life and major bodily function should be protected. Any deviation, such as these allegations, should be investigated as potential malpractice and a non-physician (including hospitals) instructing a physician to act should be investigated as a prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine,” the August 2022 letter, from Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes, said. He asked the board to issue guidance on the issue.
    
            It remains to be seen what kind of success Monday’s lawsuit will have. The Texas State Supreme Court, which is typically the final arbiter of whether state laws comply with the Texas constitution, has ruled in favor of Texas abortion restrictions in previous disputes that went up to the state high court.
    
            The women who brought the lawsuit, all Texas residents, say they experienced irreparable harm – including emotional trauma and risks to their physical health – because of the hoops they had to jump through to obtain the care they needed.
    
            One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Amanda Zurawski, says she “was forced to wait until she was septic to receive abortion care, causing one of her fallopian tubes to become permanently closed.”
    
            As Zurawski and her husband previously told CNN, she became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility treatments. But at 18 weeks into her pregnancy – well before the point of viability – her water broke, and she was told by her doctor that the baby would not survive, according to her account. 
    
            However, her doctors told her that they would not terminate her pregnancy until she was “considered sick enough that my life was at risk,” she recounted to CNN last year, adding that she was told that could take hours, days or even weeks.
    
            Zurawski and her husband decided they could not risk the several hours it would take to travel to another state where abortion would available. When she fell under a fever that spiked up to 103 and began exhibiting signs of sepsis, her doctors felt that they could legally induce labor without violating Texas’ abortion laws, according to the lawsuit. However, she went on to develop a secondary infection and septic shock, and her family flew into Austin, Texas fearing she could die. While she eventually recovered, the infections caused damage to her reproductive organs.
    
            Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, Lauren Miller, was pregnant with twins but learned through testing that one of the fetuses had multiple fetal abnormalities that made it highly unlikely that it would survive to birth, according to the lawsuit. Her specialists suggested she travel out of state, but evaded giving her and husband direct answers to their questions, the lawsuit says.
    
            It “was apparent that their doctors, nurses, and counselors were all fearful of speaking directly and openly about abortion for fear of liability under Texas’s abortion bans,” the lawsuit states. 
    
            Miller ultimately traveled to Colorado to obtain a so-called selective reduction – a procedure to abort the likely non-viable fetus to preserve the health of the other fetus and the mother – and Miller is now due to deliver the other fetus this month.
    
            A third plaintiff, Lauren Hall, traveled to Seattle for an abortion after being told at an 18 week scan that her fetus had a condition that gave it no chance of survival. She was told that the condition, according to the lawsuit, posed risks of hemorrhage and preterm birth, among other risks. But she says her specialist in Texas would not give her information about her options or even transfer her medical records to an abortion provider.
    
            The fourth plaintiff, Anna Zargarian, says in the complaint that at 19-and-a-half weeks into a pregnancy her water broke. She was diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and told that her fetus would not survive to birth, according to the lawsuit. 
    
            But even as doctors said the recommended treatment was an abortion, they told Zargarian they were barred from performing one because the fetal heartbeat was still detectable, according to the lawsuit. Eventually she obtained the procedure in Colorado, but now faces fear about becoming pregnant in Texas again because she has been told she will be at high risk of developing conditions linked to PPROM, the lawsuit says.
    
            The fifth plaintiff, Ashley Brandt, also says she faced complications in a pregnancy with twins, during which one fetus had conditions that were putting the other fetus at risk. Though she was ultimately able to obtain a selective abortion in Colorado, according to the lawsuit, she faced other complications that at one point sent her to the emergency room where she felt “a distinct uneasiness and confusion.”
    
            “It appeared that the medical staff thought they were not supposed to know about Ashley’s abortion or discuss it with her,” the lawsuit said, adding that the remainder of her pregnancy “was plagued by fear and stress.” She ultimately delivered a healthy baby at 38 weeks into the pregnancy.
    
            In a statement, Vice President Kamala Harris praised the lawsuit, saying it demonstrates that the fears about “the harm” patients “would experience as a result of Texas’ extreme laws” had turned into reality.
    
            “The lawsuit includes devastating, first-hand accounts of women’s lives almost lost after they were denied the health care they needed, because of extreme efforts by Republican officials to control women’s bodies,” Harris said.

      Walgreens will not distribute abortion pill in 20 states

    ","
            Walgreens on Friday said it will not distribute abortion medication in 20 states, bowing to pressure from anti-abortion lawmakers and lawsuits targeting the legality of medication abortion. 
    
            The company said it will not dispense mifepristone, the first of two drugs in the medication abortion process, in 20 states following a February 1 letter from GOP attorneys general in those states.
    
            Retail pharmacies have been caught in the middle of abortion battles. Companies are loath to antagonize lawmakers in states where they may face politically motivated reprisals. GOP leaders have recently targeted businesses ranging from Disney to investment funds.
    
            “We intend to be a certified pharmacy and will distribute Mifepristone only in those jurisdictions where it is legal and operationally feasible,” the company said in a statement. 
    
            The US Food and Drug Administration had previously said that pharmacies that become certified to dispense mifepristone can do so directly to someone who has a prescription from a certified prescriber. 
    
            A spokesperson for Rite Aid said the pharmacy chain is monitoring developments. 
    
            “Rite Aid is monitoring the latest federal, state, legal and regulatory developments regarding mifepristone dispensing and we will continue to evaluate the Company’s ability to dispense mifepristone in accordance with those developments,” spokesperson Catherine Carter told CNN in a statement. 
    
            Medication abortion, which now accounts for a majority abortions obtained in the United States, has become a flashpoint in the fallout from the Supreme Court’s decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade.
    
            A federal judge in Texas is expected to rule any day on a lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide, in the biggest abortion-related case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe.
    
            The lawsuit, filed in November by anti-abortion advocates against the FDA, targets the agency’s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone.
    
            Abortion rights advocates have sounded the alarm on the case, stressing that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would affect every corner of the country since the lawsuit is targeting a federal agency.
    
            “If FDA approval of mifepristone is revoked, 64.5 million women of reproductive age in the US would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight,” NARAL said in a statement in February, pointing to internal research.
    
            CNN has also reached out to CVS, Kroger and Walmart about their future plans for distributing mifepristone. The retailers did not immediately respond to the requests for comment.

      California couple sues fertility clinic over embryo carrying cancer gene
    ","

  Published
        3:20 PM EST, Thu March 2, 2023
    ","
            A Southern California couple is suing a fertility clinic for fraudulent concealment claiming they mistakenly transferred an embryo carrying a rare stomach cancer gene and then falsified patient records to cover up the error.
    
            Jason and Melissa Diaz claim their young son now faces the potential of stomach cancer or possible stomach surgery to avoid the rare cancer. They filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday against Huntington Reproductive Center Medical Group, also called HRC Fertility. The couple’s doctor and IVF coordinator are also named as defendants in the lawsuit.
    
            Melissa Diaz carries the BRCA1 genetic mutation making her prone to breast and ovarian cancer. Her husband, Jason, has a rare mutation that predisposed him to stomach cancer which he eventually developed when he was 32. Jason Diaz then underwent stomach removal surgery and chemotherapy, according to the lawsuit. When the couple chose to start a family, they sought out in vitro fertilization (IVF) and genetic testing for their embryos to ensure the mutations were not passed on to their future children.
    
            The couple’s first embryo transfer in August 2020 was free of both genetic mutations, but that pregnancy ended in miscarriage, according to the lawsuit. With the understanding that one of their male embryos carried only the BRCA1 gene which is linked to less risk for men than for women, the couple opted to move forward with a second embryo transfer resulting in a successful pregnancy and birth of a boy who is now a year old, the lawsuit states.
    
            Last summer, when the couple was planning to expand their family again, Melissa Diaz says she reached out to HRC Fertility and requested a copy of her embryo report. Diaz says she was surprised to see handwritten notes that indicated an embryo carrying the stomach cancer mutation was the one transferred resulting in her son.
    
            The lawsuit claims someone from the clinic then called her and “admitted that HRC had made a serious mistake,” inviting the couple to a sit-down meeting in the office.
    
            The lawsuit says Melissa later requested her full medical records from the office.
    
            “Recognizing its error, HRC Fertility then attempted to hide the truth. It produced to Melissa an altered copy of her records that omitted the crucial information of which embryo it transferred,” the lawsuit states.
    
            The lawsuit includes two versions of the embryo records and alleges “HRC attempted to hide the truth.”
    
            The couple is suing the clinic for fraudulent concealment and a violation of California’s unfair competition law, and they are separately arbitrating their claim about transferring the wrong embryo.
    
            “We trusted them to help us have a healthy baby,” said Melissa Diaz in a news conference.
    
            The Diaz’s son “will develop stomach cancer, require a total stomach-removal surgery, or both,” the court filing asserts.
    
            “Because of their error, our greatest fear has become our reality,” said Jason Diaz in the news conference. “I know the pain of this cancer personally. And I know through watching other family members suffer and eventually die from it. I wouldn’t want anyone on Earth to experience this type of pain and now I will be forced to watch my own son – my own flesh and blood – go through this.”
    
            “We deeply empathize with this family’s situation,” HRC said in a statement. “However, the patients associated with the case sought genetic testing and genetic counseling outside of HRC Fertility, and with an outside party; they wished to have a male embryo transferred, which we carried out according to the family’s explicit wishes and in accordance with the highest level of care.”
    
            “We also stand by the professionalism and expertise of our medical staff and pride ourselves on adhering to the highest standards for patient care, patient records, results, and testing at all our locations,” the statement reads.

      Baby’s body found in woodland area close to where Constance Marten and partner were arrested

            The body of a baby has been found in a woodland area in southern England, close to where aristocrat Constance Marten and her partner Mark Gordon were arrested earlier this week over concerns for their child’s welfare, UK authorities said Wednesday.  
    
            “It is my very sad duty to update that this afternoon, police officers searching a wooded area close to where Constance Marten and Mark Gordon were arrested, discovered the remains of a baby,” Detective Superintendent Lewis Basford of the Met’s East Area Command said in a statement on Wednesday. 
    
            “A post-mortem examination will be held in due course,” the statement continued.
    
            Marten, 35, and Gordon, 48, were arrested earlier this week after going missing in early January. They were believed to be traveling with a newborn.
    
            On Tuesday, London’s Metropolitan Police said in a statement the pair had been “initially arrested on suspicion of child neglect,” but were later “further arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.”
    
            Police helicopters, sniffer dogs, thermal imaging cameras and drones were used to assist over 200 officers on the ground in their search for the baby, after couple were spotted Monday in Brighton, southern England, and arrested.
    
            A crime scene has now been established around the infant remains, where work is expected to “continue for some time,” Basford said. 
    
            “This is an outcome that myself and the many officers who have been part of the search, had hoped would not happen,” he said. “I recognize the impact this news will have on the many people who have been following this story closely, and can assure them that we will do everything we possibly can to establish what has happened.” 
    
            The search for the couple and newborn began in early January, with police releasing several appeals and offering a £10,000 ($12,090) reward for information that would lead to their discovery.
    
            Marten is the daughter of aristocrat Napier Marten, a film and music producer. In an audio appeal to his daughter, published by UK news outlet The Independent last month, Napier Marten said Constance was “much, much loved, whatever the circumstances,” adding that the family was “deeply concerned” for her and her child’s welfare.
    
            “Darling Constance, even though we remain estranged at the moment, I standby, as I have always done and as the family has always done, to do whatever is necessary for your safe return to us.
    
            “I beseech you to find a way to turn yourself and your wee (little) one into the police as soon as possible so you and he or she can be protected. Only then can a process of healing and recovery begin, however long it may take, however difficult it may be,” he added.
    
            In a renewed appeal for information last week, Basford said more than 630 hours of security camera footage had been reviewed and police had received more than 350 calls from members of the public.
    
            He explained at the time that they were “not doing this and putting so many resources and efforts into finding the family just to be awkward or to interfere,” but explained the police “have a genuine concern for the health and wellbeing of the baby, and Constance and Mark, and it our duty to ensure that they are okay.”
    
            On January 5, police inquiries identified Marten and Gordon as the occupants of a car that had caught fire on a highway in the northwestern town of Bolton, England.
    
            The pair were not at the scene and most of their belongings were destroyed in the fire, according to police, who launched a missing persons investigation.
    
            Several confirmed sightings of the couple by members of the public were reported in the days following their disappearance.
    
            The pair and their baby had left the highway safely, and police used sightings and security camera footage to map their movements through various UK cities and towns.
    
            On January 7, the pair were seen in London with their faces covered leaving a taxi with an orange carrier bag and a pram.
    
            Using cash, they paid for various items, including a two-man tent, two sleeping bags and two pillows, which made detectives fear they had been camping or sleeping rough, at a time of cold temperatures.
    
            The couple dumped the buggy and other items later that day before continuing to travel.

      ‘He shot me!’ fatally wounded 9-year-old in Orlando shooting cried as she ran to mother, affidavit says

            A 9-year-old girl, who was fatally wounded when a gunman broke into her family’s Florida home after shooting a woman nearby hours earlier, told her mother, “He shot me!” as she ran for help, according to an arrest affidavit released Tuesday.
    
            Sheriff’s investigators have said the suspected shooter, Keith Moses, is accused of killing a woman on the morning of  February 22 – which brought news crews to the scene. Hours later in the neighborhood just west of Orlando, a gunman shot T’Yonna Major and her mother, then went outside and fatally shot a reporter and wounded another journalist, according to affidavit for the arrest warrant.
    
            The court document says T’Yonna’s mom was taking a nap when the assailant entered the backyard and then the home. She had told T’Yonna to get her “dance items” together so she could be ready when her father got home. The mother has not been identified by law enforcement. 
    
            The mother “said she woke up to T’Yonna Major yelling “HE SHOT ME!” as she ran into her room and jumped into her bed,” Det. Brian Savelli of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office writes in the court document.
    
            When the mother woke up, she heard two gunshots and “felt she was shot in the arm,” the document continues. The mother then grabbed her daughter and barricaded in the bathroom until emergency responders arrived. 
    
            Both were taken to a hospital, where the child died. The court document says T’Yonna was shot twice in the torso.
    
            Two journalists for Spectrum News 13 in Orlando who were covering the initial shooting were targeted with gunfire as the assailant left the home, the document says – making an adjustment to a timeline of the three incidents previously released by the sheriff’s office.
    
            According to the affidavit, minutes after the news crew arrived, reporter Dylan Lyons was shot while in the front passenger seat of the crew’s Ford Escape. He died at a hospital less than an hour later. The station, a CNN affiliate, said Lyons was 24 years old. 
    
            Photojournalist Jesse Walden was found wounded by the trunk of the SUV, deputies said. Authorities in the initial aftermath had said the journalists were shot before the girl and her mother.
    
            Nathacha Augustin, 38, was killed in the initial shooting, about five hours before the other slayings. She was found lying outside a Hyundai sedan that had been driven by Moses’ cousin, the affidavit says. 
    
            According to a previous affidavit, the cousin said he was driving around with the woman in his car and had offered Moses a ride. The suspect entered the rear passenger side and sat behind the woman. 
    
            Less than a minute later, the cousin said he “heard a loud bang,” that affidavit says. The suspect fled when the driver pulled over to call 911, the court document says.
    
            The new arrest affidavit adds that T’Yonna described her killer to responding deputies and one witness shared cell phone video of the gunman.
    
            Moses, 19, was taken into custody about 20 minutes after the shootings at the third scene, the affidavit’s timeline says. Investigators recovered a Glock .40 caliber pistol used in the shooting spree, authorities have said.
    
            Moses initially pleaded not guilty to one charge of first-degree murder. Authorities on Tuesday added two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first degree murder and burglary charges. Moses was scheduled to appear in court but his attorney waived his right due to “behavior.”
    
            On a form called “Advice to defendant, first appearance” the line for Moses’ signature has “unable to sign” filled in.  
    
            “It was extremely important to bring these charges forward,” Sheriff John Mina said at a press conference Tuesday. Authorities have not discovered a motive and the affidavit says.

      12 blue states sue FDA, saying it’s too strict in limiting abortion drugs as legal battle over mifepristone heats up

    ","
            Twelve states led by liberal attorneys general announced Friday that they had sued the Food and Drug Administration, saying its limits on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used for medication abortion, are too strict. 
    
            The suit is a possible hedge by states waiting to see how a federal judge in Texas rules in a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion groups seeking to block the FDA’s approval of mifepristone altogether. Conflicting rulings could mean the Supreme Court is asked to sort out the issue.
    
            RELATED: How a medication abortion, also known as an ‘abortion pill,’ works
    
            “The federal government has known for years that mifepristone is safe and effective,” Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. “In the wake of the Supreme Court’s radical decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the FDA is now exposing doctors, pharmacists and patients to unnecessary risk. The FDA’s excessive restrictions on this important drug have no basis in medical science.”
    
            Mifepristone was first approved in 2000 and medication abortion accounts for more than half of the abortions in the US. It is the first drug, followed by misoprostol, in the medication abortion regimen. Patients and providers must sign agreements stating the drug will be used to end a pregnancy, and pharmacies must have special certification. 
    
            The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Washington state. The states in the lawsuit are: Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont.
    
            A lawsuit seeking to block the use of medication abortion nationwide could receive an initial decision at any moment, after the plaintiffs in the case submitted to the court on Friday their final brief on the challenge.  
    
            The lawsuit, filed in November by anti-abortion advocates against FDA, challenges the two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process.  
    
            A decision by US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, in favor of the plaintiffs could have far-reaching consequences since medication abortion now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US.  
    
            In the filing submitted Friday, the anti-abortion advocates rehashed many of the arguments they made in earlier briefs. Its submission means that Kacsmaryk could soon rule on a motion by the plaintiffs to temporarily block use of the medication. The judge had previously said that once the February 24 filing deadline ended, “briefing will then be closed on the matter, absent any ‘exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.’” 
    
            Kacsmaryk, however, could also call for a hearing, or ask for additional responses.  
    
            The defendants in the case – the FDA and Danco, which makes mifepristone – argued in separate briefs to the court that a decision against the drug’s approval would be unprecedented and would shutter the drugmaker’s business.  
    
            Reproductive rights advocates have stressed that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would be devastating, with NARAL Pro-Choice America saying in a statement that if the drug is yanked from the market, “64.5 million women of reproductive age in the US would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight.”

      Pentagon’s suicide prevention committee recommends age limit and waiting period for on-base gun purchases
    ","

    ","
            A suicide prevention committee that was established by the Pentagon last year is recommending instituting a waiting period for gun purchases on bases and raising the minimum age for buying firearms in an attempt to reduce the number of suicides among service members.
    
            The Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC) announced the suggested measures as part of a broader set of 127 recommendations to reverse the current trend of suicides in the military, which has steadily increased over the last 15 years.
    
            The committee recommended putting in place a seven day waiting period for gun purchases on Defense Department facilities and a four day waiting period for ammunition purchases.
    
            The committee was created by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in May 2022 to review the Department of Defense’s ongoing suicide prevention efforts. The committee submitted a first set of 10 recommendations to Austin in December before submitting its latest report.
    
            Dr. Craig Bryan, one of the members of the committee, said a high percentage of suicides on base involved guns purchased at base military exchanges.
    
            “There’s a very strong scientific basis showing that waiting period, even as short as seven days, significantly reduce suicide rates,” said Bryan, a lethal means safety expert, in urging the Defense Department to “follow the science.”
    
            The committee also recommended raising the minimum age to purchase weapons on base to 25 years old. 
    
            “There’s arguably only one thing that all researchers agree on,” said Bryan, “and that one thing is that taking steps to slow down convenient access to highly lethal methods like firearms is the single most effective strategy for saving lives.”
    
            According to the Defense Department’s annual report, 519 service members died by suicide in 2021, the most recent number for which numbers are available. Though the latest figure is a slight decrease from the previous year’s 582 suicides, the overall number has still been trending upward.
    
            “We will review those closely,” said Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder of the latest recommendations. “I don’t have anything to announce today in terms of what steps we may take, but again this is a very important topic to the Secretary and to the entire Department of Defense.” 
    
            However, Dr. Rajeev Ramchand, an epidemiologist with the RAND corporation and another member of the SPRIRC, told reporters on Friday that service members the committee spoke with said they felt the Defense Department’s “current approach … was more of a check-the-block approach” and that suicide prevention was “not discussed frequently.” 
    
            Ramchand gave an example of a series of required suicide prevention trainings that took place over a course of several days, saying service members sat in a dark auditorium where many of them fell asleep or “were on their phones.” 
    
            “It’s hard to think this is having an effect,” Ramchand said.
    
            In addition to gun safety regulations, the committee also urged the Defense Department to address the lack of mental health services available for service members, including hiring psychologists and other mental health specialists quickly.
    
            “When service members were getting into care, they might not be seen for their second visit for about 6 weeks,” said Rebecca Blais, a sexual assault and suicide expert who is on the committee.
    
            Often, when job openings in mental health services were posted, the hiring process could drag out over a year, at which point the psychologist or other professional was no longer available, Blais said.
    
            In cases where mental health services were not available or already booked, the committee urged the Defense Department to increase insurance payments so service members could seek mental health experts outside of the military’s healthcare system.
    
            Editor’s Note: If you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

      A Wisconsin Supreme Court race holds high stakes for abortion rights and the 2024 election
    ","
			By Tierney Sneed and Fredreka Schouten, CNN

    ","
            What’s typically an under-the-radar judicial election in Wisconsin has turned into a high-stakes and expensive fight for control of the state’s Supreme Court – with the future of abortion, voting rights and redistricting in this battleground state hanging in the balance. 
    
            Millions of dollars in advertising have been reserved ahead of Tuesday’s primary election – the first of two rounds that will determine who replaces a retiring conservative justice, potentially shifting the balance on Wisconsin’s seven-judge high court. While the election is nonpartisan, each of the four contenders is squarely in the liberal or conservative camps.  
    
            “This seat is crucial to the balance of the court, and the court is crucial to the balance of the state,” said Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of its Elections Research Center. 
    
            In a state where Democrats control the governor’s office and Republicans hold sway in the legislature, the Wisconsin Supreme Court could become the final arbiter on an array of consequential issues, including the fate of the state’s prohibition on abortion in nearly all cases – enacted in 1849. The US Supreme Court’s decision last summer ending federal legal protections for the procedure has super-charged the rhetoric – and spending – around abortion in the Wisconsin race.  
    
            The state Supreme Court could also play a crucial role in the 2024 election. Wisconsin was a key location of former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his 2020 loss, and the refusal of a conservative justice on the state Supreme Court to go along with an effort that year to toss out ballots in two heavily Democratic counties looms large in the rivalry between the two right-leaning candidates in this year’s race. 
    
            “The Wisconsin Supreme Court race is the most important election in the country this year to set the stage for 2024,” Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, told CNN. 
    
            The executive director of the Wisconsin GOP, Mark Jefferson, described the contest as one with “every significant issue of the last generation on the ballot.” 
    
            Early voting in the primary is already underway, with the final day of balloting Tuesday. The top two finishers will advance to the general election on April 4.  
    
            Wisconsin is one of 38 states that use some form of elections to select their Supreme Court judges, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. In many cases, those are retention elections in which previously appointed justices run unopposed.
    
            Currently, conservatives hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and have voted in recent years to prohibit ballot drop boxes and have selected maps that cemented Republicans’ solid majority in the state legislature. This year, the departure of a conservative justice, Patience Roggensack, gives liberals an opportunity to seize the majority. The side that prevails in the election this spring is expected to control the court through the 2024 presidential election. 
    
            The candidates hoping to advance to the April general election are liberals Janet Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, and Everett Mitchell, a circuit judge in Dane County; and conservatives Daniel Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice, and Jennifer Dorow, a judge perhaps best known for presiding over the trial of a man convicted of killing six and injuring scores more in a 2021 attack on a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin. 
    
            Outside money has flooded the race, surpassing candidate spending. As of Thursday afternoon, orders for TV and radio ads focused on the race had hit $7 million, according to advertising tracked by Kantar Media/CMAG for the Brennan Center. Experts say the spending on the race could smash the previous record – $15.2 million spent on a 2004 Illinois Supreme Court race, according to the Brennan Center – for the most expensive campaign for a single state Supreme Court seat. 
    
            If a liberal and conservative emerge as the top two vote-getters Tuesday, this “will unquestionably be the most expensive (Supreme Court) race in Wisconsin history and quite possibly the most expensive race in the nation,” said Doug Keith, a Brennan Center counsel who works on judiciary issues.
    
            Protasiewicz has led the field in fundraising and ad spending, according to the latest data. In a sign of the potency of the abortion issue in the contest, she has run television spots that put her support for abortion rights front and center.  
    
            Outside groups on both sides of the issue are participating in this race in ways that go beyond their prior involvement in similar elections. 
    
            “We just know that the outcome of this race has serious implications for abortion rights in the years to come,” Tiffany Wynn, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin, told CNN. Justices on Wisconsin’s high court serve ten-year terms. 
    
            The US Supreme Court in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision last June overturned the Roe v. Wade precedent that said that the US Constitution protected abortion rights. Since then, state courts have become ground zero in the legal fights over abortions access.  
    
            “These races are more important, for obvious reasons, than ever after Dobbs,” said Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for the state affairs team at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which supports anti-abortion candidates. She pointed to a recent ruling by the South Carolina Supreme Court striking down a six-week abortion ban on state constitutional grounds and said that the anti-abortion movement is at risk of “mini-Roe decisions all across the country.” 
    
            Abortion rights advocates feel bolstered by last year’s midterm elections – particularly how they played out in Wisconsin, with Democratic incumbents, Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, winning reelection after campaigns highlighting their commitment to abortion rights. Anti-abortion advocates, meanwhile, recognize that their messaging fell short in the fall, and they’re adjusting their strategy for driving like-minded voters to the polls. 
    
            “We have a great base, but this far, in the majority of conversations we have had with them, many are not even aware that abortion is going to be the fundamental issue for this race,” Gracie Skogman, political action committee director for the anti-abortion group Wisconsin Right to Life, told CNN.  “They’re not aware that the fate of our current law rests in the hands of the court, depending on this election. And so that’s the case we’re doing the best to make.” 
    
            While Protasiewicz has pushed an unabashed abortion rights message in her campaign, the other candidates have found other ways to explicitly or implicitly signal how they’d approach the issue.  
    
            Like Protasiewicz, Everett has been openly critical of the Dobbs ruling. He told CNN that “you can criticize that and still say, ‘I am going to be a judge who looks at the facts, looks at the law, and we go from there.’” 
    
            The two conservative candidates have vowed to honor the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision and have stressed that they would not legislate from the bench – rhetoric that has been interpreted to mean that they would let the state’s law, enacted before women in the country gained the right to vote, stand.  
    
            In a statement to CNN, the Kelly campaign singled out Protasiewicz, saying that she sees legal disputes “not as matters to be resolved according to the law, but as opportunities to enact her personal values.” 
    
            Protasiewicz defended her upfront approach to abortion, which made her a target of a complaint alleging that she violated a judicial code of conduct that bars judges from committing to how they will vote on issues that may come before them. Her team has cast the complaint as politically motivated. 
    
            “I really think the electorate deserves to know the values of the people that are running for office,” Protasiewicz told CNN. “We have this kind of fake, little smokescreen, where certain people think justices should just say that ‘I’m going to follow the law,’ and that doesn’t tell you very much about the person at all.” 
    
            Kelly, who is seeking a comeback after losing his high court seat in 2020, has been endorsed by the largest anti-abortion organizations in the state, and he recently picked up the support of the national Susan B. Anthony group. With that endorsement comes a six-figure mail, phone and text message campaign on his behalf. 
    
            This spring’s Supreme Court race is expected to set the stage for the 2024 election, as the Wisconsin high court is likely to be asked to weigh in on the ground rules for next year’s contest.
    
            “Even a tiny shift in voting rules can affect the outcome of a presidential election,” said Wikler, the state Democratic Party chair. “So, what happens in Wisconsin on April 4 will have a direct impact on who gets sworn into the next term as president of the United States.” 
    
            Last year, the court’s conservative majority barred the use of most ballot drop boxes and prohibited local election officials from filling in missing information on absentee ballot return envelopes. Republicans see the state’s voter ID law as on the line in the race, with the state GOP’s Jefferson accusing Democrats of trying to use the courts to “strike down any ballot security measure they can.” 
    
            It is also not lost on those involved in this election that the Wisconsin Supreme Court played a pivotal role in 2020, by rebuffing Trump’s efforts to throw out ballots in Democratic-leaning counties.  
    
            “Because Wisconsin sits at the apex of a lot of national conversations – whether it’s the Senate race or presidential – I think Wisconsin, at this moment, may end up deciding bigger things like the presidential election, like it did 2020,” Everett, one of the two liberal candidates, told CNN. “I think the implications of that decision that was made in 2020 is the reason why people are paying attention at such a greater detail.” 
    
            Brian Hagedorn, the right-leaning justice who sided with the liberals in the Trump case – and who also ruled with the liberals to uphold Covid-19 restrictions – has been invoked by Kelly as a cudgel against his conservative rival Dorow. Kelly has pointed to his 2020 endorsement of Hagedorn to explain why he won’t commit to endorsing Dorow should she prevail over him Tuesday, implying that she can’t be depended on to rule conservatively from the bench. 
    
            “I think it’s just terribly presumptuous to say that I have to endorse her blind,” Kelly said of Dorow during a recent appearance on conservative Milwaukee broadcaster Mark Belling’s radio show. “And, especially after Brian Hagedorn, I’m just not doing blind endorsements.” 
    
            Dorow’s campaign did not make her available for an interview for this story.
    
            Kelly’s role in advising the state Republican officials in the 2020 election, including as it relates to an alternate elector scheme, has recently come under scrutiny. But he has also expressed skepticism of the legal case Trump brought, and a campaign spokesman told CNN that “the views of clients are not attributable to their attorneys.”
    
            Prominent groups that are backing Kelly tout him as the candidate with a proven record that can be trusted on the right. Among them is a group called Fair Courts America, linked to Republican megadonor and packaging magnate Richard Uihlein. State records show Uihlein donated $1.5 million to the group last month. A recent TV ad lauds Kelly’s 2020 vote on the court to rein in government health orders during the pandemic. 
    
            In a statement, Fair Courts America spokesman Dan Curry said the group is seeking to make the case that Kelly “is the clear choice … for those who want a restrained and Constitution-based Supreme Court.”  
    
            With the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, progressives finally see an opportunity to break up the state’s heavily gerrymandered map, which has allowed Republicans to win some 65% of state legislative seats even in years when Democrats have narrowly won statewide contests.
    
            The conservative majority on the state’s high court approved the current legislative lines, drawn by state Republican lawmakers, after the US Supreme Court tossed out another map that would have required the addition of a new majority-Black state Assembly district. 
    
            A 2019 US Supreme Court case, known as Rucho v. Common Cause, said that the federal judiciary has no role to play in policing partisan gerrymanders – meaning that state courts are one of the few tools that redistricting reformers have to combat aggressively partisan maps. 
    
            If a liberal flips the court’s open seat, progressive groups will attempt to relitigate the issue and urge the new majority to strike down the current map, Jay Heck, the executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin, told CNN.  
    
            Heck and other voter advocates objected to the court’s conservative majority deciding to use maps drawn by Republicans in 2011 as the foundation for the maps it considered following the 2020 census.  
    
            Protasiewicz, who has called the state’s legislative maps “rigged,” has also criticized the conservative justices’ “least change” approach from the 2011 maps, saying it has “no basis” in state law or the state constitution.  
    
            “They made it up to get to a preordained result,” she said.

      In photos: The best of Rihanna’s rule-breaking maternity style

            The timeline of maternity fashion evolution now exists in two parts: Before Rihanna and After Rihanna. Until the superstar multi-hyphenate revealed she was expecting her first child in January 2022, bumps were often seen as unwieldy shapes to be concealed — slimmed down in all-black or obscured with busy prints. 
    
            Consciously or subconsciously, pregnant celebrities in the before-times (Before Rihanna, that is) would instinctively opt for more conservative cuts on red carpets and other public events. Grecian-draped column dresses, empire-waistline gowns or tastefully floaty skirts were the pillars upon which maternity fashion was built. 
    
            Now, Rihanna’s refusal to alter her high-octane style has caused a seismic shift in our understanding of baby-on-board dressing. 
    
            Although she isn’t the first to break the mould  — pop culture enthusiasts might recall Demi Moore’s landmark 1991 Vanity Fair cover, for example, or Beyoncé’s Botticelli-inspired pregnancy announcement in 2017 — Rihanna’s sartorial rebellion has been the most consistent. 
    
            “When I found out I was pregnant, I thought to myself, ‘there’s no way I’m going to go shopping in no maternity aisle.’ I’m sorry — it’s too much fun to get dressed up,” she told Vogue for the magazine’s May 2022 cover. “I’m not going to let that part disappear because my body is changing.” 
    
            Now, to celebrate Rihanna’s 35th birthday and the announcement of her second child, we’ve collected some of her most stylish pregnancy looks.

      A childbirth myth is spreading on TikTok. Doctors say the truth is different

            Ashley Martinez has four sons and is pregnant with the daughter she’s wanted for years. 
    
            Last month, she posted a video online imploring doctors to prioritize her life, not the life of her unborn baby, if complications arise when she is in labor and it comes down to that choice. 
    
            The San Antonio, Texas, resident is due in May and is one of a number of pregnant people who have recently posted “living will” videos on TikTok.  
    
            Martinez had an emergency C-section during her last pregnancy after her umbilical cord came out before her baby, a rare but dangerous condition known as an umbilical cord prolapse that can deprive a baby of vital blood flow and oxygen.  
    
            Martinez described her last delivery as terrifying. Eight months after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade, ending a constitutional right to abortion, she said she worries about what would happen if she faced similar challenges again. 
    
            Since the ruling in June, a number of US states have criminalized abortions, leading to some fears that doctors would prioritize the life of the unborn child during a medical emergency.
    
            Martinez lost her mother to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma at a young age, and the thought of her children going through a similar tragedy terrifies her. 
    
            “Having to go into another delivery where I’m going to have a C-section, it’s scary for me,” said the 29-year-old. “My fourth pregnancy was my only C-section. I’ve always thought about not being here for my kids just because of what I went through growing up without my mom.”
    
            More than a dozen US states have banned or severely restricted access to abortions following the Supreme Court’s decision eight months ago. The abortion bans have led to legal chaos as advocates take the fight to courtrooms. 
    
            Even so, several ob/gyns told CNN that a hard choice between saving a mother and baby’s lives at childbirth, like the one outlined in the TikTok videos, is highly unlikely.
    
            This trend on TikTok has sparked a flurry of dueling videos among pregnant women and other people. Some have posted videos telling doctors in such situations to prioritize their unborn babies first, and criticizing those who expressed a different view.
    
            Martinez concedes that her mother, who died at 25, would likely have chosen to save her child first if she could. 
    
            “My mother, she didn’t have a choice, you know?” Martinez said. “The message that I want to send is just basically nobody is wrong or right in this situation. In both situations, it is a hard decision to pick your children over your unborn baby.” 
    
            In Texas, where Martinez lives, abortions are banned at all stages of pregnancy – unless there’s a life-threatening medical emergency.
    
            Dr. Franziska Haydanek, an ob/gyn in Rochester, New York, who shares medical advice on TikTok, said she’s noticed many “living will” videos in recent months. 
    
            In most of the videos, a woman appears alongside a written message saying something like, “If there are complications during childbirth, save me before the baby.” Some people, including Martinez, reference their children in their decision and even show them in the video.
    
            One was posted by Tuscany Gunter, 22, a woman whose baby is due in April. Abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy is illegal in her home state of North Carolina, and Gunter told CNN she filmed her message in solidarity with others who said they would choose themselves first. 
    
            “I wanted to make it known where I stand and to stand up with other women who are getting bashed online for saying they would rather be saved first over their baby,” said Gunter, who lives in Fayetteville. 
    
            “As a mother to three young children, I cannot dump the emotional trauma of losing their mother on them as children and expect them to cope. While I would be crushed to lose a baby, I need to think of my other living children as well … And I know the baby that passed would be safe without ever having to experience any pain or sadness.”
    
            Another woman, Leslie Tovar of Portland, Oregon, said that even though her state has no legal restrictions on abortion, she posted her video because she feared doctors would prioritize saving her unborn child to avoid legal ramifications in the post-Roe v. Wade era. 
    
            “I have two other kids at home who need mom. I can’t bear the thought of my two young boys ages 6 and 4 without their mom,” she said. 
    
            All three women said they’ve had these conversations with their partners, who agreed they should be saved first. 
    
            Of her husband, Tovar said, “His exact words were, ‘We could always have another baby later in life but there is never replacing the mother of my boys, I couldn’t do this without you.’”
    
            It’s true that complications occasionally come up during a pregnancy that lead doctors to recommend delivery to save the mother’s life, medical experts said.
    
            If this is done before a fetus is viable – under 24 weeks –  the chances of the baby’s survival are low, said Dr. Elizabeth Langen, a maternal-fetal medicine physician at the University of Michigan Von Voigtlander Women’s Hospital.
    
            Roe v. Wade’s reversal did make terminating such pregnancies more complicated, Langen and Haydanek say. 
    
            In cases involving a baby that’s not viable, it could mean that even when the baby is unlikely to survive and the mom’s health is at risk, the priority will be on saving the baby due to fear of legal ramifications, Langen said.
    
            But both doctors say these scenarios don’t occur during the birth of a viable baby. In that instance, Roe v. Wade is “less involved,” Haydanek said. 
    
            “We do everything in our efforts to save both (mother and baby),” she said. “I can’t think of a time where the medical team has had to make a decision about who to save in a viable laboring patient. It’s just not a real scenario in modern medicine – just one we are seeing played out on TV.” 
    
            Hospitals have enough resources – obstetrics and neonatal intensive care unit teams, for example – to meet the needs of both the mother and the baby, Haydanek and Langen said. 
    
            “We’re usually doing our best to take care of both the mom and the baby. And there’s very rarely a circumstance where we will do something to harm the mom in order to have the benefit of the baby,” added Langen. 
    
            “If mom’s health is deteriorating, ultimately, she’s not going to be able to support baby’s wellbeing,” Langen said. “And so generally, what we encourage folks to do is really support mom’s health, because that’s in the best interest of both mother and baby.”
    
            Both doctors said it’s important for patients to talk to their health care providers about their medical concerns and share their “living will” wishes with loved ones in case there are complications during labor that require partners to make medical decisions. 
    
            However, those decisions will not involve doctors asking your partner whose life should come first, they said. 
    
            “Before getting in a fight with your partner about who they choose to save, know that there isn’t a situation where we will ask them that,” said Haydanek, who has called the TikTok trend “horribly anxiety inducing.” 
    
            She said it’s come up so many times in recent months that she made her own TikTok video to reassure expectant parents. 
    
            “Please don’t feel like you have to make this choice,” she says in the video. “I know firsthand how much anxiety there can be in pregnancy … but it’s just not a situation that you’re gonna find yourself in.”

      Kentucky Supreme Court ruling allows state’s near-total abortion bans to remain in place for now
    ","

    ","
            The Supreme Court of Kentucky ruled Thursday that a lower court wrongfully stopped the enforcement of two state abortion laws, according to court documents. 
    
            The two measures are Kentucky’s so-called trigger law banning the procedure and a separate “heartbeat” law restricting abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy.
    
            Siding with Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron, Justice Debra Hembree Lambert asserted in her opinion that the circuit court “abused its discretion by granting abortion provider’s motion for a temporary injunction.”
    
            Planned Parenthood, along with an abortion provider represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Kentucky, sued to block Kentucky’s sweeping abortion laws after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.
    
            They filed two complaints challenging the two statutes, which effectively prohibit abortions in Kentucky except in limited circumstances where it is necessary to preserve the life of the mother, according to the opinion.
    
            The near-total bans outlaw abortion in most instances with no exceptions for rape or incest, making Kentucky one of 13 states that have banned or severely restricted abortion. 
    
            The plaintiffs argued that the laws violate the state’s constitutional rights to privacy, bodily autonomy, and self-determination, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU said in a statement. 
    
            After a circuit court temporarily enjoined the abortion bans last summer, an appellate court judge granted the attorney general’s emergency request to dissolve the injunction, but an appellate panel later recommended that the state’s highest court weigh in on the injunction.
    
            The Supreme Court of Kentucky ruled that the abortion providers did not have the standing to challenge the six-week ban because they had not argued it violated their own constitutional rights, only those of their patients.
    
            Although the court found that the abortion providers have standing to challenge the trigger ban, it ruled that the abortion providers did not show they were sufficiently harmed by the ban to warrant a temporary injunction on its enforcement, according to the opinion.
    
            Instead, the court remanded the case to the lower court to determine the constitutionality of the trigger ban, the opinion stated.
    
            The opinion does not determine whether the Kentucky Constitution protects the right to receive an abortion, as there was no “appropriate party” to raise the issue in the suit, according to Lambert.  
    
            “Nothing in this opinion shall be construed to prevent an appropriate party from filing suit at a later date,” she said.  
    
            In a statement, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU expressed disappointment with the ruling but said “this fight is not over.” 
    
            “Once again, the Kentucky Supreme Court failed to protect the health and safety of nearly a million people in the state by refusing to reinstate the lower court order blocking the law,” the statement said.
    
            The statement added, “Even after Kentuckians overwhelmingly voted against an anti-abortion ballot measure, abortion remains banned in the state. We are extremely disappointed in today’s decision, but we will never give up the fight to restore bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom in Kentucky.” 
    
            Cameron called the ruling a “significant victory” Thursday. 
    
            “Since the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade last June, we have vigorously defended Kentucky’s Human Life Protection Act and Heartbeat Law,” he said in a statement. “We are very pleased that Kentucky’s high court has allowed these laws to remain in effect while the case proceeds in circuit court.”

      US military says it will grant service members up to 3 weeks leave to travel for abortions
    ","
			By Haley Britzky and Oren Liebermann, CNN

  Published
        5:17 PM EST, Thu February 16, 2023
    ","
            The US Defense Department released a series of new policies on Thursday to provide additional support to service members and dependents who must travel out of state to receive an abortion, including allowing up to three weeks of administrative leave.
    
            “This policy reflects our continued commitment to taking care of our people and ensuring that the entire force remains ready and resilient,” Gilbert Cisneros, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said in a memo released Thursday.
    
            The military has been adjusting to the Supreme Court’s ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in June which overturned protections previously established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The new ruling set off what are called “trigger laws” in roughly a dozen states, which were designed to go into effect almost immediately after Roe v. Wade was overturned.
    
            Many of the most restrictive states  – including Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana – are home to major military installations. There were immediately concerns over how service members and their families, who often do not get to choose which installation and in which state they get to live, would navigate the changes.
    
            Indeed, a Pentagon press release on Thursday accompanying the new policies says that service members and their families “do not control where they are stationed, and due to the nature of military service, are frequently required to travel or move to meet operational requirements.”
    
            “The efforts taken by the Department today will not only ensure that service members and their families are afforded time and flexibility to make private health care decisions, but will also ensure service members are able to access non-covered reproductive health care regardless of where they are stationed,” the release said.
    
            The policy, which will go into effect by March 18, states that service members will have access to “lawfully available non-covered reproductive health care regardless of where they are stationed,” and that they will be able to request an administrative absence without being charged leave to access that care. Service members can be granted an administrative absence of up to three weeks. 
    
            It also “standardizes and extends” the timeline in which service members have to inform their commanders of a pregnancy to 20 weeks. 
    
            The 21 days of administrative absence also applies to other non-covered reproductive health care, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI).
    
            The latest policies follow the release of an overarching framework on measures to protect service members’ rights and access to abortion last fall, though officials said they were still working through the details. The measures made an effort to provide travel and transportation allowances for service members or military family members who are traveling out of state to receive an abortion, and protect military medical providers from civil or criminal lawsuits if they perform a protected abortion.
    
            “Our greatest strength is our people,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a memo in October. “There is no higher priority than taking care of our people, and ensuring their health and well-being.” 
    
            Cisneros said in a memo last year that the Dobbs ruling would have “significant implications” for service members and their families, “as well as the readiness of the force.” Cisneros also emphasized in his memo that the Supreme Court’s ruling “does not prohibit the Department from continuing to perform covered abortions, consistent with federal law.”
    
            Thursday’s release says that travel and transportation allowances can be authorized for service members and their families who have to travel for non-covered reproductive health care.
    
            Covered abortions include those performed as a result of rape or incest, and when the mother’s life is at risk, according to the Hyde Amendment, a 1976-era ruling that defined when federal funding could be used for abortions.
    
            The new policy grants service members administrative absence in order to accompany a dual-military spouse or dependent to access a non-covered abortion. It also emphasizes that commanders “are expected to display objectivity, compassion, and discretion when addressing all health care matters, including reproductive health care matters,” and act “promptly and with appropriate discretion.”
    
            In addition, the new policy forbids commanders from requiring subordinates to comply with additional requirements, such as religious consultations, medical testing, or other forms of counseling.

      Mass shooting traumas stalk America’s children from elementary school to college
    ","
			Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN

        12:10 AM EST, Wed February 15, 2023
    ","
            A generation of kids who grew up haunted by the fear of school massacres can’t outgrow their trauma: It’s also stalking their carefree college days.
    
            America’s latest mass shooting, until the inevitable next one, wrote a new community in the roll call of colleges stigmatized by tragedy. To Virginia Tech, Northern Illinois and the University of Virginia, add Michigan State University.
    
            Footage showed students fleeing for their lives. Tales emerged of individuals smashing windows to save classmates from a gunman. Students blockaded themselves in dorms, built barricades in the library, cowered in restrooms, or just ran for their lives after their cellphones buzzed with a “shots fired” warning from the university police force.
    
            More horror, in yet another city, in the cycle of sudden death that can strike anyone, anywhere. With macabre irony, the shootings at Michigan State on Monday night, which killed three students and injured five more, took place on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine’s Day 2018. Tuesday was also the 15th anniversary of a mass shooting that left five students dead at Northern Illinois University.
    
            The day brought the familiar futile anger over the tortured politics of gun control and splits among Americans about firearms that mean that – even after more senseless deaths – nothing will be done. 
    
            Any mass shooting is horrific. But whenever young lives are cut off before they’ve barely begun, the tragedy is especially aching.
    
            Parents who send their kids off to college fret about whether their sons or daughters will fit in, will struggle with academics, could stumble because of alcohol or drugs. Now, they must also worry about mass shootings. Can a nation that can’t guarantee its kids are safe at school now not keep them safe at college?
    
            “They are terrified, their parents are terrified,” Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin told CNN on Tuesday after meeting survivors and family members from Michigan State, which is in her district. “It’s terrorizing and we either do something about something that is terrorizing our population, or we don’t care about it.”
    
            Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel told CNN that when she dropped her kids off at Michigan State a year-and-a-half ago she thought, “It is going to be a miracle if we get these kids through four years of college without some sort of an incident like this taking place, because they happen so frequently.”
    
            “And unfortunately, as it turned out, the answer is no,” Nessel said. “We couldn’t get our kids through college without subjecting them to a mass shooting at their school.”  
    
            Mercifully, most American students will and do make it through college without such a terrible experience. But that doesn’t mean they will evade the fear such a shooting creates. Many know the panic stoked by false alerts about active shooters or a just the general question over whether their campus is safe.
    
            Monday’s killings led to a heartbreaking only-in-America moment, when a young Parkland survivor counseled stricken Michigan State Spartans on how to process their nightmare and what they would experience in the years ahead.
    
            “Five years ago, I almost lost my life in school. And yesterday more young people lost their lives to this issue of gun violence in college,” Aalayah Eastmond told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on Tuesday. “I’m so sad that so many other communities are dealing with this issue every single day.”
    
            Today’s college kids are no strangers to the pang of fear over gun violence. 
    
            Studies show school shootings are getting more frequent and exposing more kids to such horrors, and millions more to the nagging feeling that it could happen to them. 
    
            Each kid is now familiar with active shooter drills. Every parent knows the lurking anxiety that the worse could happen one day when they drop their child off at class. One of the only mercies of Covid-19 school shutdowns was that fear went away for a while. 
    
            A previous generation of students was marked by the Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colorado, in 1999 that killed 12 students and a teacher, and the Virginia Tech massacre in which 32 people died in 2007. 
    
            Today’s college undergrads grew up under the shadow of the massacre of 20 6- and 7-year-olds and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, an outrage that shocked the nation but failed to unlock the stuck politics of gun reform. In a horrible and extreme example of how gun violence is a constant companion for today’s young people, some Michigan State University students who survived Monday’s mass shooting had also escaped with their lives from a November 30, 2021, shooting at Oxford High School, about an 80-mile drive east of the MSU campus in East Lansing.
    
            “I never expected in my lifetime to have to experience two school shootings,” Andrea Ferguson, whose daughter is now at MSU, told CNN affiliate WDIV.  
    
            Remembrances of Monday’s dead are beginning to emerge.
    
            Alexandria Verner, one of three students who died, was remembered by her Clawson Public Schools Superintendent Billy Shellenbarger as “everything you’d want your daughter or friend to be.” The two other students killed were Arielle Anderson and Brian Fraser who both graduated in 2021 from high schools in Grosse Point, Michigan.
    
            “How is it possible that this happened in the first place, an act of senseless violence that has no place in our society and in particular no place in school,” asked Jon Dean, superintendent of Grosse Pointe Public Schools. “It touched our community not once, but twice.”
    
            Such is the inertia surrounding gun politics in Washington, that it’s become a cliche in itself to write that the usual rituals of regret and condolences played out in the capital after a mass shooting but without any expectation that politicians would respond with meaningful measures to stop it happening again.
    
            President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of senators did pass the most significant gun safety law in decades last year, though it failed to ban any weapons and fell well short of what the White House, gun control advocates and most Americans want to see. Future gun control legislation is unthinkable with Republicans now holding a narrow House majority. 
    
            Firearms reform activists will hope that the Democratic sweep of the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature in Michigan will open the possibility of significant changes to the law – but gun politics remain treacherous for lawmakers in swing states who want to cling onto power. 
    
            Biden, speaking at a conference of county executives in Washington, issued one of his increasingly frequent condemnations of mass shootings, bemoaning “a family’s worst nightmare that’s happening far too often in this country.”
    
            “We have to do something to stop gun violence ripping apart our communities,” he said, and renewed his call for an assault weapon ban that everyone knows had no chance of passing even in a Democratic-run Congress.
    
            Arguments against gun control are as well rehearsed as those for it. Second Amendment absolutists often say the answer is more guns on the streets to allow people to defend themselves and to “harden” institutions like schools and universities. Many point out that often, shootings are perpetrated by gunmen with troubled mental histories or who become isolated or alienated from their society. 
    
            But there is rarely any concentrated effort from Republicans in Washington to spend the vast amounts of money needed to overhaul mental health services. In the states, Republican governors and legislatures are busily loosening already lax guns laws in a way that are likely to lead to even easier access to weapons.
    
            Given the paralysis of gun politics, maybe it’s on individuals to act. Several recent cases of mass shootings have appeared to have a common factor: the disturbed mental state of an eventual perpetrator who had access to guns.
    
            While police are still searching for a motive for the Michigan State gunman’s rampage, his father, Michael McRae, said that after his mother died several years ago, he became “more and more bitter … angry and bitter … evil angry.” The gunman’s sister told CNN her brother was socially isolated and a criminal history with weapons. Police said he “had a history of mental health issues.”
    
            Despite the deadlocked debates over guns rights and gun control, more pro-active action by loved ones and others might allow some red flag laws that could see weapons taken from the mentally ill to work. Katherine Schweit, a former FBI senior official and active shooter expert, said people who see relatives deteriorating mentally need to act.  
    
            “We have to follow through, we have to report stuff,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “It’s the ‘see something, say something’ that has prevented us having the terrorist events in the United States. We need to do the same thing for these types of situations.”
    
            This could save lives in the future. But it’s too late for three Michigan State students who will never graduate, or their fellow Spartans whose college years are now stained by the plague of gun violence.

      National Archives agrees to give personal tours to activists who say staff asked them to hide anti-abortion attire

            The National Archives will give “personal tours” to two activists who sued the federal records agency, resolving a days-old lawsuit the pair brought after staff at the museum told them cover up anti-abortion attire during a recent visit. 
    
            A federal lawsuit filed last Wednesday said that the activists were visiting the Washington, DC, museum the same day as the national March for Life in January and “were subject to a pattern of ongoing misconduct by federal government officials, specifically National Archives security officers … who targeted plaintiffs and intentionally chilled their religious speech and expression by requiring plaintiffs to remove or cover their attire because of their pro-life messages.” 
    
            The National Archives quickly issued a statement last week clarifying that its policy allows visitor clothing to “display protest language, including religious and political speech,” and said it would investigate the incident. 
    
            In court papers filed Tuesday by both sides, the museum promised to work with each plaintiff to arrange a “personal tour” of the museum. Under the deal, staff with the National Archives and Records Administration will also extend “a personal apology on that tour regarding the events” that unfolded last month. 
    
            “NARA shall further reiterate to all NARA security officers, as well as all other NARA personnel who interact with the public … that NARA policy expressly allows all visitors to wear t-shirts, hats, buttons, and other similar items, that display protest language, including religious and political speech,” the agreement reads. 
    
            A judge must still approve the agreement.
    
            Last month’s March for Life event saw scores of anti-abortion activists travel from all over the US to attend the march, which was the first such event held since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year – the primary goal of the annual protest.

      Toddler’s death prompts new warning for a popular baby stroller

            The Consumer Product Safety Commission reiterated its warning about the hazards of some popular Baby Trend-brand strollers Friday, which led to the death of a toddler and injury of another.
    
            On Thursday, the CPSC and Baby Trend warned consumers about a head or neck entrapment risk on the Sit N’ Stand Double and Ultra strollers (model numbers beginning with “SS76” or “SS66”). The statement said a life-threatening injury could happen between the pivoting front canopy and the armrest or seat back. 
    
            The joint notice came after the asphyxiation death of a 14-month-old whose neck became trapped between the canopy tube and the armrest of a Baby Trend Sit N’ Stand double stroller. The toddler’s father was nearby but unable to see the armrest and canopy clearly.
    
            A 17-month-old child was also left with neck bruises in a separate incident.
    
            In a separate updated statement Friday Baby Trend said the strollers are “completely safe when used as intended.” (Baby Trend also said it had joined with the CPSC “out of an abundance of caution.”)
    
            “This tragic and exceedingly rare accident could have been altogether avoided if the young toddler had not been permitted to climb and play on the stroller, which was not being used as intended at the time,” the company’s statement read. 
    
            CPSC noted in its own statement that its agency does not make determinations that products are ‘safe.’
    
            “The space in front of and behind the strollers’ pivoting front canopy can entrap a child’s head or neck if a non-occupant child climbs on the exterior of the stroller or when a child in the front seat of the stroller is not securely restrained in the seat using all five points of the harness,” the CPSC said. 
    
            The warning added: “Entrapment could lead to a loss of consciousness, serious injury, or death.” 
    
            The CPSC and Baby Trend warned consumers to remove and separately store the canopy when not in use, not allow children to play on the stroller, and to secure children in the strollers with the harness. 
    
            The Sit N’ Stand strollers have been sold since 2009, and Baby Trend said over a million have been sold nationwide. They’re found at Baby Trend, Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, and buybuy BABY.
    
            Consumers are encouraged to report incidents to the CPSC or to Baby Trend at 800-328-7363 or info@babytrend.com. 
    
            Clarification: Baby Trend updated its statement Friday to clarify it is an independent statement from the CPSC. The article has been updated to reflect that change.

      Health experts call for an end to exploitative baby formula milk marketing tactics

            Less than half of infants around the world are breastfed as recommended, and baby formula is in high demand despite failing to offer the same health and developmental benefits as breast milk, experts say. According to a new report, misleading claims and political influence are to blame. 
    
            The report from health experts at institutions around the world says that commercial milk formula sales tactics violate the international code on breastfeeding marketing and calls for stricter government regulation of irresponsible baby formula marketing and widespread industry interference. 
    
            The three-paper series, published Tuesday in the medical journal The Lancet, extensively outlines “predatory tactics” in the formula milk marketing industry. The research also highlights the need for stronger maternity protections, such as universal paid maternity leave, to support breastfeeding for all women.
    
            “The sale of commercial milk formula is a multi-billion-dollar industry which uses political lobbying alongside a sophisticated and highly effective marketing playbook to turn the care and concern of parents and caregivers into a business opportunity,” Dr. Nigel Rollins, a scientist with the World Health Organization and co-author of the series, said in a news release. “It is time for this to end. Women should be empowered to make choices about infant feeding which are informed by accurate information free from industry influence.”
    
            CNN has reached out to the Infant Nutrition Council of America, a trade group representing formula marketers, for comment. 
    
            The report comes as more children than ever are being fed formula and as climate, political and economic crises repeatedly threaten global supply. The US is still recovering from a monthslong shortage of infant formula that stressed families and may spark sweeping changes at the US Food and Drug Administration. Other countries have faced similar supply chain disruptions caused by events like flooding South Africa, war in Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic – events that companies capitalized on to garner more donations and customers, according to the report. 
    
            The authors acknowledge that formula is necessary for some women who choose not to or who can’t breastfeed and note that criticisms of the commercial milk formula industry should be not be interpreted as criticism of women. 
    
            Research has shown that breastfeeding promotes infant brain development, prevents malnutrition and sudden infant death syndrome, and lowers the risk of infectious diseases, chronic diseases and leukemia later in life. For mothers, breastfeeding helps lose pregnancy weight and lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and breast and ovarian cancer. 
    
            Universal breastfeeding would save an estimated 823,000 infant and 98,000 maternal lives annually, according to research published in The Lancet and Health Policy and Planning. 
    
            The authors of the new report note that “perceived pressure, or inability, to breastfeed – especially if it is at odds with a mother’s wishes – can have a detrimental effect on mental health, and systems should be in place to fully support all mothers in their choices.” They emphasize, however, that women make infant feeding decisions based on the information they receive, and they say this information should be accurate and free from commercial influence. 
    
            Despite evidence of its benefits, global breastfeeding rates have increased very little over the past two decades while baby formula sales have nearly doubled, reaching $55.6 billion in 2019, amid misleading marketing strategies that the authors say undermine breastfeeding. 
    
            “One of the factors, which is a main focus of the series, is the very misleading and exploitative marketing from infant formula companies that use messaging about the benefits of their products without almost any scientific basis whatsoever, essentially sending a message that infant formulas are similar to, if not even better than, breastfeeding for the health and well-being of the babies,” said Rafael Perez-Escamilla, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health and a co-author of the report.
    
            The report also explains how companies exploit parental anxieties about their children’s health and development in the vulnerable newborn period. Companies often suggest that common infant adaptations such as fussiness, colic or short nighttime sleep duration are signs of breastfeeding issues that formula can fix.
    
            “Formula companies use these behaviors and present them as problematic and basically lead people towards using products as the solution to problems that may, in fact, not be problems at all but part of normal human developmental behavior,” said co-author Cecilia Tomori, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.  
    
            Experts emphasize that with appropriate education and support, such concerns can be managed appropriately with breastfeeding. 
    
            Dr. Susan Crowe, a Stanford University School of Medicine ob/gyn and lactation specialist who was not involved with the report, says she tells her patients that “the purpose of these ads is to sell formula” so they are “aware that these companies are there primarily to make a profit. Sometimes just letting them know that they’ve been exposed to advertising is helpful.” 
    
            These misleading and unsubstantiated scientific claims, experts say, violate the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes, a landmark agreement put into place in 1981 that aims to regulate unethical marketing practices to ensure that mothers are not discouraged from breastfeeding and that substitutes are used safely if needed. 
    
            Unlike most World Health Organization member countries, the United States does not legally enforce any provisions of the code.
    
            “The US does not regulate [baby formula] marketing at all. Everything goes in terms of the marketing of infant formulas,” said Perez-Escamilla, who urges the FDA and Congress to intervene. 
    
            In a statement to CNN, the FDA said that the agency regulates food labeling and “generally, infant formula marketing practices fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission.”
    
            The new report also says that baby formula companies’ influence extends far beyond marketing, including lobbying against vital breastfeeding support measures, incentivizing physicians to recommend their products to new mothers and funding research that supports their marketing agenda. 
    
            One study by WHO and the United Nations Children’s Foundation surveyed 8,500 women worldwide and found that more than a third said a health care worker recommended a specific brand of formula to them. 
    
            “It is, as a whole, a very powerful system of lobbying, of capturing scientists, of capturing health care providers and, at the end of the day, capturing families themselves with their products by really exploiting the fears of families and parents during a very vulnerable psychoemotional time,” Perez-Escamilla said. 
    
            In addition to ending the harmful marketing tactics and industry influence of formula milk companies, the authors call for actions across governments, workplaces and health care to support women who want to breastfeed. 
    
            The report calls for extending paid maternity leave to align with the recommended six-month duration of exclusive breastfeeding. WHO and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months and continued support for breastfeeding to age 2 or longer.
    
            Paid maternity leave has been shown to increase breastfeeding exclusivity and duration. However, according to the new report, more than half a billion working women globally lack adequate maternity protection – most of whom are lower-income and women of color who are forced to go back to work out of financial necessity. 
    
            The report’s authors say that formula milk marketing “exploits the lack of support for breastfeeding by governments and society” by framing breastfeeding as a “moralistic judgment, while presenting milk formula as a convenient and empowering solution for working mothers.” 
    
            The US is the only high-income country without federally mandated paid maternity leave. Although more than 80% of mothers in the US start off breastfeeding, less than a quarter exclusively breastfeed their baby at 6 months, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
    
            In 2011, the US Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding identified the lack of paid maternity leave as a significant barrier to breastfeeding and argued that “paid leave is necessary to reduce the differential effect of employment on breastfeeding among disadvantaged racial, ethnic, and economic groups, which in turn would allow disadvantaged populations to benefit from the health effects of breastfeeding.” 
    
            The new report’s authors also highlight the need for expansion in health professional training on breastfeeding to offer skilled counseling before and after birth to all mothers who wish to breastfeed. This includes guidance and support for mothers who are unable to breastfeed due to limited milk production or medical reasons, such as active HIV infection.
    
            “Initiation of breastfeeding and lactation support is tremendously helpful so that people can understand normal volumes and intervene with supplementation only when medically necessary,” Crowe said.
    
            The authors note the importance of supporting a woman’s choice regarding breastfeeding and emphasize the need for systemic policies free from unregulated baby formula marketing, lobbying and influence to allow families to make informed decisions on infant feeding.
    
            “We are asking for social support, structural social support from governments and systems to help people achieve their breastfeeding goals,” Tomori said. “We want to make sure that they understand that it is not up to individual women and mothers to do breastfeeding, that it’s actually their right, and it is part of health as a human right that they have all the support and the enabling environments that they deserve.”

      Ohio abortion law meant weeks of ‘anguish,’ ‘agony’ for couple whose unborn child had organs outside her body
    ","

    ","
            Just when Beth and Kyle Long received the worst news of their life, an Ohio law made their searing pain even worse.  
    
            For four years, the Longs tried to have a baby, enduring multiple rounds of grueling fertility treatments. In September 2022, Beth finally became pregnant.  
    
            But an ultrasound four months later showed that most of the baby’s organs were outside the body.  
    
            The condition, called limb body wall complex, is rare.  
    
            “It’s just not survivable,” a doctor involved in Beth’s care told CNN.
    
            “They will die. There’s no way there will be a life,” said Dr. Alireza Shamshirsaz, a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, who was not involved in Beth’s care.  
    
            The condition posed dangers for Beth too, and the bigger the baby was, the higher the risk of complications, including dangerous bleeding that might require a hysterectomy. They say their doctor  urged them to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible.  
    
             But when the Longs tried to schedule the abortion, they found out that their insurance wouldn’t pay for it.  
    
            Beth takes care of breast cancer patients at a state-owned hospital. She’s employed by the state of Ohio, and state law bans her health insurance from paying for abortions except in certain cases. 
    
            Endangerment to the life of the mother is one of them, and although she was at an increased risk for potentially deadly complications, Beth’s life was not in imminent danger, and the Longs say their doctor told them the insurance wouldn’t cover the procedure.  
    
            Beth and Kyle would have to foot the bill: between $20,000 and $30,000. After spending $45,000 on fertility treatments, they didn’t have the money.  
    
             It took them three weeks to make arrangements to go to a hospital that could perform the complicated abortion at a lower price. It was hours away, in another state. 
    
            During that three-week wait – a wait they had to endure only because of the Ohio law – the risk to Beth of potentially deadly complications grew. Their ability to try to have another baby was delayed, and their “agony” couldn’t end, Beth said.  
    
            “I was in mental anguish,” Beth said.  
    
            “It felt very inhumane for both our baby and for my wife,” Kyle added.  
    
            The hospital they found was a three-hour drive away, in Pittsburgh. Away from their regular obstetrician, whom Beth had known for years; away from their doula; away from their friends and family. The Longs were alone.  
    
            Beth Boring and Kyle Long met on a dating app in 2015. Their first date was a storytelling event at a local arts organization.  
    
            Beth, who was 26 at the time, had been a teacher for special-needs children and was about to start nursing school.  
    
            “I loved her big heart,” Kyle says.  
    
            Kyle, then 30 and a wedding photographer, told Beth he’d bring her food when she started school. ” ‘I’ll bring you fries and dinner while you study and I won’t bother you at all,’ ” she remembers him telling her. 
    
            “He was so sweet and made a big effort to love everyone in my life, and that was important to me,” she said. “Kyle made me feel completely safe and respected.”  
    
            Kyle proposed on December 24, 2017, in Beth’s living room. She was stressed from studying for nursing school exams, with books and papers strewn around the room.   
    
            “She said that if I could love in the cycle of life she was in, [then] we should be able to make it through anything,” Kyle recalls.  
    
            Directly after the proposal, Beth and Kyle went to Christmas Eve services at Central Vineyard Church in Columbus and shared the exciting news with family and friends, jokingly inviting them to the “Long and Boring wedding,” which took place at the church in June.  
    
             Beth was now 29. They tried to start a family soon after, but after a year of trying, a doctor discovered that Beth had advanced endometriosis, and she had surgery in February 2020.  
    
            They then spent $15,000 on a round of fertility treatments that didn’t yield any viable embryos. A second round, at the same price, had the same result.  
    
            The process was grueling. Beth had to give herself shots of hormones, and for some of the treatments, they had to do a four-hour round-trip drive to the Cleveland Clinic. Between each round, they had to wait months to try again, with even more delays as doctors’ appointments often had to be canceled and rescheduled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  
    
            Finally, a third round yielded three viable embryos: two boys and a girl.  
    
            “I just had a gut feeling we were supposed to transfer the girl” to her uterus, Beth said.  
    
            “She’s perfect!” the doctor said on September 20, 2022, just before he implanted the embryo into Beth’s uterus.  
    
            Inside her womb, the embryo was tiny and looked like it was blinking.  
    
            “She was just this little glowy dot on a screen, [and] she kind of looked like a shooting star, so we called her Star. She’s always been Star to us,” Beth said.  
    
            They waited seven weeks to see whether the implantation had worked.  
    
            “They did an ultrasound, and they confirmed her heartbeat,” Beth remembers. “The tech said it was perfect. Perfect heartbeat.”  
    
            “We’d finally made it to pregnancy,” Kyle said. “We’d spent years working on this, thousands of miles, thousands of dollars trying to get here, and it finally felt like it was worth it.”  
    
            Another ultrasound in December, when Beth was 16 weeks pregnant, also looked good, and they shared the happy news with their families at Christmas.  
    
            At that 16-week visit, Beth also had blood taken for routine tests.  
    
            They didn’t think much about that blood work until they received a phone call just after the new year.  
    
             On January 4, the day before Beth’s 34th birthday, she received a call from her obstetrician.  
    
            “I could tell it was her serious voice,” Beth remembers. “She said, ‘Some of your lab work came back abnormal.’ ”  
    
            The doctor explained that the baby might have a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida. 
    
            Kyle started keeping a journal that day. “We are prepared to raise a child with any disabilities,” he wrote.  
    
            The next day, Beth’s birthday, “we meet with the genetic counselor, and she reassures us that she has seen a lot of fluke results and not to worry,” Kyle wrote.  
    
            And even if it wasn’t a fluke, “most potential issues seemed small. If there was a large issue, it could likely be fixed with surgery. It would require us to potentially temporarily move to a new city, but we both feel optimistic going into the scan,” Kyle wrote.  
    
            Still, “the scan felt like the longest 15 minutes of our life,” he wrote.  
    
            The ultrasound technician left the room and returned with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, the genetic counselor and a nurse.  
    
            “We knew something was wrong,” Kyle wrote.  
    
            The doctor explained how the baby hadn’t developed a lower spine and the rib cage was large enough to hold only her heart, which was beating.  
    
            “There were organs outside her body. Her heart was inside her body, but it was abnormal,” said the physician involved with Beth’s care. “This is not compatible with survival.”  
    
            The doctor asked not to be named because the hospital where they work has not given them permission to speak to the media.  
    
            The Longs remember their doctors repeatedly using the phrase “incompatible with life” as they explained that the baby would probably die inside Beth or during birth.  
    
            At the ultrasound, the doctor “named a few more wrong things, but at that point I was more focused on Beth. At that moment we realized we were never going to have [our] baby girl,” Kyle wrote in the journal.  
    
            “We would have done anything to make her better,” Kyle said. But “there’s no surgery, there’s no magic pill that we could have done to make things better.”  
    
            The doctors assured the Longs that they’d done nothing wrong; Star’s rare condition was just by chance.  
    
            “We’re really good at winning the bad lottery,” Beth said.  
    
            The next day, the Longs met with Beth’s obstetrician. They said she explained that Star’s organs, besides her heart, had spilled out of a hole in her abdomen and were enmeshed in the placenta.  
    
            “[The doctor] explains to us that the sooner the pregnancy is ended the better it will be for Beth’s health. The longer the baby grows with these abnormalities, it will continue to have a worse and worse impact on Beth’s health,” Kyle wrote in his journal.  
    
            Beth said that if the placenta tore during the procedure, “I could have a lot of internal bleeding” because the bigger Star grew, “the more complicated and enmeshed [the placenta] was going to be, so time was of the essence.”  
    
            Shamshirsaz, director of the Maternal Fetal Care Center at Boston Children’s Center and a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, noted that a 21-week fetus is significantly larger than a 17-week fetus, so the three-week wait put Beth at a higher risk for bleeding and other complications.  
    
            “We know in obstetrics if we can do [an] earlier termination, the outcomes will be better. That is set in stone,” he said.  
    
            Dr. Erika Werner is the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.  
    
            “I’ve had lots of patients who never thought they would consider termination that have ended up terminating because of this diagnosis,” said Werner, who was not involved in Beth’s care.  
    
            Beth’s obstetrician said she wouldn’t be the one to do the abortion. She would reach out to one of the few specialists in Columbus who could do the complicated and risky procedure.  
    
            Over the next few days, the couple grieved for their lost baby daughter. As Kyle photographed a wedding, he watched little girls dancing with their dads during the father/daughter song, and he knew he’d never have that chance with Star.  
    
            They gave their baby a full name: Cordelia Poppy Star Long, with Star as a nickname because that’s what she looked like at the implantation and Corn Pop “because it was cute,” Kyle wrote in his journal.  
    
            While they waited to hear back from the obstetrician, Kyle called a local funeral home to arrange for Star’s cremation while Beth knit and crocheted tiny dresses for Star.   
    
            On January 9, three days after their appointment with the obstetrician, the Longs signed a form so they could officially begin Ohio’s 24-hour waiting period before an abortion.  
    
            The termination was supposed to take place in the next day or two, and while they dreaded it, they hoped it would mark the beginning of a recovery period, and then they try as soon as possible to implant one of their other two viable embryos.  
    
            But that didn’t happen.  
    
            Kyle wrote this in his journal: “Tuesday, 1/10 – The doctor calls and lets us know that none of it will be covered by insurance.”  
    
            The doctor explained that while it was legal for them to have the abortion, a 1998 Ohio law made it illegal for state employees’ insurance to cover the procedure except in certain narrow cases. The mother’s life being “endangered if the fetus were carried to term” is one of them, but the law doesn’t define what “endangered” means.  
    
            In his journal, Kyle wrote that the doctors gave them four options: One, pay the $20,000 to $30,000 and have the abortion right away in Ohio with the specialist their obstetrician had selected; two, wait until the baby died inside Beth, and then insurance would cover the abortion; three, wait until Beth’s life was at sufficient risk that the insurance would cover it; or four, find someplace else where they could do the procedure for less money.  
    
            “Kyle was ready to whip out a credit card” and pay for the procedure to be done soon at the hospital they were already familiar with in Ohio, Beth said.  
    
            “I was so motivated to just shell out the money and get it done,” Kyle added. “Just so it would be easy on us from a mental standpoint.”  
    
            Beth appreciated her husband’s efforts to protect her, but she wanted to save money for implantation of their remaining two embryos and for fertility treatments to create more embryos if those didn’t take. She’d already taken unpaid time off work during her pregnancy, and she was about to miss more work. 
    
            “For Beth it made more sense to put the focus on our future children,” Kyle wrote.  
    
            They decided to try the last option: finding a qualified doctor who would do the procedure for less money.  
    
            “It was horrifying because we were experiencing the hardest pain that anybody could have, and on top of that, of our grieving, we’re having to handle all of this ourselves and coordinate all of this ourselves,” Kyle said.  
    
            Beth was now nearly 19 weeks pregnant. She and Kyle were racing against the clock.  
    
            Ohio law allows for abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy. Plus, with each passing day, the baby was growing larger, putting Beth at increasing risk of potentially deadly complications when it came time for the termination.  
    
            To spare Beth more anguish, Kyle made calls to Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and various hospitals in the state. He wanted to be as close to home as possible so they could be near friends and family for support and so Beth wouldn’t have to endure traveling and staying at a hotel.  
    
            When he failed to find a place for Beth to have the procedure, he was once again resigned to putting it on his credit card.  
    
            But then he received a call back from Leah Mallinos, a social worker and patient navigator at Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio. She said UPMC Magee Women’s Hospital in Pittsburgh would do the procedure for $2,500.  
    
            But it couldn’t happen immediately. There needed to be a virtual appointment with a Magee doctor and a transfer of medical records, and they needed to wait for availability at Magee.  
    
            While they waited, they grieved the loss of their daughter.  
    
            Beth bought a fetal Doppler to listen to Star’s heartbeat. She listened to it over and over.  
    
            “She had a good, strong heart. I was so proud of that heartbeat,” she said. “She had worked really, really hard to grow.”  
    
            On Instagram, Beth posted a video of the Doppler on her belly, recording Star’s heartbeat.  
    
            “I love her,” she wrote in the post. “And I refuse to let her suffer or be in pain for even a moment when she’s on the outside of me. Abortion is the most loving thing I can do for her as her mother, even if it shatters my heart.”  
    
            Beth prepared for her daughter’s death.  
    
            “I don’t think I’m ever going to forget the feeling of my baby girl kicking inside of me while I was looking for urns on the Internet for her ashes,” Beth said.  
    
            Still, she would have to wait another two weeks before she could have the abortion in Pittsburgh.  
    
            On January 23, she and Kyle made the drive, bringing with them for comfort Mr. Darcy, Beth’s dog of 11 years, and the dresses that Beth had made for Star.  
    
            The next day, they signed papers for Pennsylvania’s 24-hour waiting period.  
    
            Because Beth was so far along in her pregnancy – by this time, she was 21 weeks – it was a two-day procedure.  
    
            On January 26, the dresses Beth had made lay on her stomach as she was waiting to go into the operating room. Kyle kissed his wife’s head as she cried and then went to her belly to tell his daughter goodbye, that he loved her and that he was sorry he and her mother couldn’t save her life.  
    
            Heather Bradley, a doula who specializes in helping grieving parents, took close-up pictures of Star’s feet wrapped in one of the dresses Beth had made.  
    
            Bradley, founder of Pittsburgh Bereavement Doulas, said she is usually able to control her emotions even in the saddest of situations, but this one was different.  
    
            “I felt myself tearing up,” she said. The Longs had made “the worst decision anyone ever has to make, and then to deal with all the other logistics they had to deal with was just ridiculous.”  
    
            She said the Longs were “hanging by a thread” after the procedure as they headed back to Columbus.   
    
            “They’re traveling in a car for [three] hours after having an abortion. Things can happen. You should be resting and being monitored, sleeping, letting your body heal. You shouldn’t have to be worrying about where we’re going to stop to eat or the expense.”  
    
            Planned Parenthood gave the Longs $500 for the hotel and the Abortion Fund of Ohio gave them $1,800 toward the $2,500 hospital charge for the procedure, but the Longs say they paid $1,150 out of pocket, which included the rest of the hospital charge and travel expenses. In  addition, they expect bills from the anesthesiologist and other specialists involved in the procedure.  
    
            “It was a tough drive. We drove there with our child, and we were driving home without her,” Kyle said.  
    
            Kyle has reached out to his elected representatives, including Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Sen. JD Vance, both Republicans.  
    
            He told them that Ohio law had “turned a difficult situation into something nearly unbearable.”  
    
            “I am a lifelong Republican, but this has turned me into a one-issue voter for those that support reproductive rights.”  
    
            “I’m writing you to please reconsider how you approach reproductive rights going forward. There are a lot of unintended consequences for families from these laws, and while I can understand you come from a good place, care should ultimately be left to the parents and their physicians. We loved our baby girl and would have done anything to keep her,” he wrote, adding that Ohio abortion laws “prevent grieving parents from the healthcare they need.”  
    
            He says he never received a response from either DeWine or Vance.  
    
            Spokespeople for DeWine and Vance told CNN that they plan on responding to Kyle’s email. DeWine noted that the law banning state insurance from paying for abortions was enacted before he took office.  
    
            A spokesperson for Beth’s workplace, which owns the insurance plan, says it will continue to comply with the law while providing exceptional patient care. 
    
            Beth belongs to the Ohio Nurses Association, a union affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers.  
    
            What happened to Beth is “an abomination,” federation President Randi Weingarten said. “The results of not getting proper and timely care due to egregious systemic roadblocks and financial constraints not only causes bodily harm but trauma that will last a lifetime.
    
            “Reproductive care must be a decision that belongs between a patient and a doctor, not with politicians,” she added.  
    
            Nearly two weeks after the abortion, Beth and Kyle are filled with both grief and anger.  
    
            “We wanted more than anything to have this baby, and the laws in place prevented us from getting the proper health care that we needed,” Kyle said. “It delayed us being able to lay [Star] to rest and grieve our baby for three weeks.”  
    
            As soon as Beth’s doctors tell them it’s OK, they plan to implant one of their two remaining embryos in the hopes of starting a new pregnancy.  
    
            In the meantime, they’re mourning Star and want to help other families who might be in their situation.  
    
            First, they want them to know that there are resources to help, such as Planned Parenthood and groups like the Abortion Fund of Ohio.  
    
            Second, they’re reaching out to state legislators who support the “heartbeat bill” that passed the Ohio legislature in 2019. It banned nearly all abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, about the sixth week of pregnancy, but a judge in Cincinnati issued an injunction in October, and now in Ohio abortion is allowed up to 22 weeks.  
    
            They say they hope their story will help change legislators’ minds.  
    
            “I don’t want any other families to have to go through this,” Kyle said. “I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy, and something needs to change,”  
    
            Beth adds that she thinks all women should have the right to an abortion, not just women like her whose babies have fatal abnormalities.  
    
            “It was the most dehumanizing experience of my life,” she said.

      Texas challenges HHS guidance that pharmacies can’t turn away people who have a prescription for a drug that may end a pregnancy
    ","

    ","
            Texas filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging guidance issued by the Biden administration in July asserting that federal law does not allow pharmacies to turn away people who have a prescription for a drug that may end a pregnancy.
    
            The lawsuit was filed in a division of Texas’ Western District Court, which almost guarantees the case will be before US District Judge David Counts, a Trump-appointed judge.
    
            Texas argues that the policy violates the Constitution and federal law by using federal health programs to force pharmacies to carry abortion drugs in states where abortion is banned. 
    
            “By requiring pharmacies that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds – including retail pharmacies operated by Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center – to dispense abortifacients when the life of the mother is not in danger, the Pharmacy Mandate flouts Dobbs’s holding that States may regulate abortion and directly infringes on Texas’s sovereign and quasisovereign authority,” the lawsuit states.
    
            The US Department of Health and Human Services – which issued the guidance and whose leader, Secretary Xavier Becerra, is the defendant in Texas’ lawsuit – did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    
            Texas has sued or threatened to sue over other attempts by the Biden administration to mitigate the fallout from the Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that overturned the precedent that protected abortion rights nationwide.
    
            Medication abortion, a two-pill regimen for ending a pregnancy, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the post-Dobbs abortion landscape.

      For the first time, US task force proposes expanding high blood pressure screening recommendations during pregnancy
    ","

    ","
            The US Preventive Services Task Force has released a draft recommendation to screen everyone who is pregnant for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, by monitoring their blood pressure throughout the pregnancy, and the group is calling attention to racial inequities.
    
            This is the first time the task force has proposed expanding these screening recommendations to include all hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which are on the rise in the United States.
    
            It means the average person might notice their doctor paying closer attention to their blood pressure measurements during pregnancy, as well as doctors screening not just for preeclampsia but for all disorders related to high blood pressure.
    
            The draft recommendation statement and evidence review were posted online Tuesday for public comment. The statement is consistent with a 2017 statement that recommends screening with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy.
    
            It was already recommended for blood pressure measurements to be taken during every prenatal visit, but “the difference is now really highlighting the importance of that – that this is a single approach that is very effective,” said Dr. Esa Davis, a member of the task force and associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.
    
            The draft recommendation urges doctors to monitor blood pressure during pregnancy as a “screening tool” for hypertensive disorders, she said, and this may reduce the risk of some hypertensive disorders among moms-to-be going undiagnosed or untreated.
    
            “Since the process of screening and the clinical management is similar for all the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, we’re broadening looking at screening for all of the hypertensive disorders, so gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia,” Davis said.
    
            The US Preventive Services Task Force, created in 1984, is a group of independent volunteer medical experts whose recommendations help guide doctors’ decisions. All recommendations are published on the task force’s website or in a peer-reviewed journal.
    
            To make this most recent draft recommendation, the task force reviewed data on different approaches to screening for hypertensive disorders during pregnancy from studies published between January 2014 and January 2022, and it re-examined earlier research that had been reviewed for former recommendations.
    
            “Screening using blood pressure during pregnancy at every prenatal encounter is a long-standing standard clinical practice that identifies hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; however, morbidity and mortality related to these conditions persists,” the separate Evidence-Based Practice Center, which informed the task force’s draft recommendation, wrote in the evidence review.
    
            “Most pregnant people have their blood pressure taken at some point during pregnancy, and for many, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is first diagnosed at the time of delivery,” it wrote. “Diagnoses made late offer less time for evaluation and stabilization and may limit intervention options. Future implementation research is needed to improve access to regular blood pressure measurement earlier in pregnancy and possibly continuing in the weeks following delivery.”
    
            The draft recommendation is a “B recommendation,” meaning the task force recommends that clinicians offer or provide the service, as there is either a high certainty that it’s moderately beneficial or moderate certainty that it’s highly beneficial. 
    
            For this particular recommendation, the task force concluded with moderate certainty that screening for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, with blood pressure measurements, has a substantial net benefit.
    
            Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy appear to be on the rise in the United States.
    
            Data published last year by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that, between 2017 and 2019, the prevalence of hypertensive disorders among hospital deliveries increased from 13.3% to 15.9%, affecting at least 1 in 7 deliveries in the hospital during that time period.
    
            Among deaths during delivery in the hospital, 31.6% – about 1 in 3 – had a documented diagnosis code for hypertensive disorder during pregnancy.
    
            Older women, Black women and American Indian and Alaska Native women were at higher risk of hypertensive disorders, according to the data. The disorders were documented in approximately 1 in 3 delivery hospitalizations among women ages 45 to 55.
    
            The prevalence of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy was 20.9% among Black women, 16.4% among American Indian and Alaska Native women, 14.7% among White women, 12.5% among Hispanic women and 9.3% among Asian or Pacific Islander women.
    
            The task force’s new draft recommendation could help raise awareness around those racial disparities and how Black and Native American women are at higher risk, Davis said.
    
            “If this helps to increase awareness to make sure these high-risk groups are screened, that is something that is very, very important about this new recommendation,” she said. “It helps to get more women screened. It puts it more on the radar that they will then not just be screened but have the surveillance and the treatment that is offered based off of that screening.”
    
            Communities of color are at the highest risk for hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, and “it’s very related to social determinants of health and access to care,” said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, chief health correspondent and medical affairs officer for the federally qualified community health center AltaMed Health Services in California. He was not involved with the task force or its draft recommendation.
    
            Social determinants of health refer to the conditions and environments in which people live that can have a significant effect on their access to care, such as their income, housing, safety, and not living near sources for healthy food or easy transportation.
    
            These social determinants of health, Shapiro said, “make a huge difference for the mother and baby.”
    
            Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy can be controlled with regular monitoring during prenatal visits, he said, and the expectant mother would need access to care. 
    
            Eating healthy foods and getting regular exercise also can help get high blood pressure under control, and some blood pressure medications are considered safe to use during pregnancy, but patients should consult with their doctor.

      Stop calling it ‘mommy brain’ — scientists say the term is wrong and unfair to moms
    ","
			Opinion by Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN

    ","
            Pregnancy brain, mommy brain, momnesia — our culture has learned to use the term to describe moms everywhere when they seem forgetful or scattered before and soon after giving birth. But the idea that motherhood is in itself associated with a decline in cognitive abilities may be both wrong and unfair to moms and their brains, writes a team of scientists in an article released Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology. 
    
            The few studies that have attempted to investigate whether mothers actually suffer from memory loss during pregnancy and in the postpartum period have failed to find significant differences in the abilities of women who have children compared with women without children, according to the new article’s authors, Dr. Clare McCormack, Dr. Bridget L. Callaghan and Dr. Jodi L. Pawluski. 
    
            But ask new moms and 8 out of 10 will say they have experienced the memory loss and brain fog popularly characterized as “mommy brain.” Why then, are the studies not finding what so many women experience? 
    
            One reason, the authors explain, may be the peace and quiet of the labs where most studies are performed. Without screaming children and a long list of tasks to manage right in front of them, thinking becomes easier and moms perform just as well as women without children. 
    
            Another possible reason: “Mommy brain” is not real and people are just quick to judge. A simple slip of the mind in an often overworked and sleep deprived mom is promptly labeled as “mommy brain” by a society expecting women’s cognitive abilities to decline after having children. Women too may have learned to use the term to cope with the impossibilities of new motherhood. Laughing those off and calling it “mommy brain” may well be a cry for help by moms who don’t feel supported.
    
            Finally, studies may not be finding what so many women are experiencing because scientists may simply be asking the wrong questions. 
    
            In attempting to find the supposed loss in brain function women may experience after having children, they may be missing the remarkable adaptation and reshaping of neural connections happening in women’s brains to prepare them for the enormous task that is parenting.
    
            When moms are put through studies that more accurately mimic the reality of their new circumstances, they perform better than women without kids. Testing mothers on parenting tasks found they showed a boost in learning and an improvement in long-term memory overall, the authors explained. 
    
            These types of studies — the ones that start from an understanding of just how complex, busy and dynamic the brains of new and expecting moms are — hold the most potential for a true understanding of exactly what happens when women become mothers, the authors say. Until then, they have one message: Stop calling it “mommy brain.”

      Complications during pregnancy linked to a higher risk of heart disease, study finds
    ","

    ","
            Five major pregnancy complications are strong lifelong risk factors for ischemic heart disease, a new study finds, with the greatest risk coming in the decade after delivery.
    
            Ischemic heart disease refers to heart problems, including heart attack, caused by narrowed or dysfunctional blood vessels that reduce blood and oxygen flow to the heart. 
    
            Gestational diabetes and preeclampsia increased the risk of ischemic heart disease in the study by 54% and 30%, respectively, while other high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy doubled the risk. Delivering a baby early – before 37 weeks – or delivering a baby with a low birth weight were associated with a 72% and 10% increased risk, respectively.
    
            The study, published in Wednesday in the BMJ, followed a cohort of more than 2 million women in Sweden with no history of heart disease who gave birth to single live infants between 1973 and 2015. 
    
            Roughly 30% of the women had at least one adverse pregnancy outcome. Those who had multiple adverse outcomes – whether in the same or different pregnancies – showed further increased risk of ischemic heart disease. 
    
            “These pregnancy outcomes are early signals for future risk of heart disease and can help identify high-risk women earlier and enable earlier interventions to improve their long-term outcomes and help prevent the development of heart disease in these women,” said Dr. Casey Crump, an author of the study and professor of family medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
    
            Heart disease is the leading cause of death among women in the United States and accounts for 1 in 5 female deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This research adds to mounting evidence that pregnancy provides important information about a woman’s cardiovascular health. 
    
            “What happens to a woman during pregnancy is almost like a stress test or a marker for her future cardiovascular risk after pregnancy. And unfortunately, a lot of women don’t get told this by anybody,” said CNN Medical Correspondent Dr. Tara Narula, an associate professor of cardiology and the associate director of the Women’s Heart Program at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was not involved in the new study.
    
            Although it’s not completely clear why, experts say the normal changes that occur during pregnancy may unmask underlying health issues in some women with certain risk factors.
    
            Experiencing an adverse pregnancy outcome – even temporarily – could result in changes to blood vessels and the heart that may persist or progress after delivery, increasing a woman’s risk for cardiovascular disease.
    
            This heightened risk is a particular concern for women in the US, experts say, where the maternal mortality rate is several times higher than in other high-income countries. 
    
            “There’s been a change in the birthing population. US women are getting pregnant at a later age, and they have already accrued maybe one or two cardiovascular risk factors. Perhaps there are other stressors in life – depression, stress, isolation, obesity – lots of different things that are impacting women in the US,” said Dr. Garima Sharma, associate professor of cardiology and director of the Cardio-Obstetrics Program at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who also was not involved in the new study. 
    
            Pregnancy complications are carefully monitored during pregnancy, but there is little evaluation of and education about the effects on cardiovascular health after delivery for women, experts say.
    
            “And so they have their delivery, they’ve had maybe preeclampsia or gestational diabetes, and nobody really follows up with them. They are not told that, in fact, they are at increased risk,” Narula said. 
    
            Gestational diabetes is a marker not only for increased risk of diabetes but also for general cardiovascular disease. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are markers for hypertension risk as well as general cardiovascular risks.
    
            Narula, a cardiologist who specializes in caring for women, regularly considers adverse pregnancy outcomes when evaluating patients and emphasizes the continued need for this. 
    
            “The classic risk calculator that we use doesn’t have anything in there for pregnancy complications, but you know, it should for women, and hopefully someday, they will start to take that into account,” she said. 
    
            The American Heart Association recommends that all health care professionals take a detailed history of pregnancy complications when assessing a woman’s heart disease risk, but this is not consistently done in clinical practice, especially in primary care, where most women are seen, Crump says.
    
            “Raising awareness of these findings among physicians as well as women hopefully will enable more of these women to be screened early and hopefully improve their long-term outcomes,” he said.
    
            Roughly 1 in 3 women will have an adverse pregnancy outcome. Experts say that improving your health before getting pregnant can help avoid these issues.
    
            “Reducing your risk should start preconception, and so getting your body and yourself into the healthiest state possible before you ever even get pregnant is really the first step,” Narula said. 
    
            This includes achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight with a good diet and regular exercise, controlling high blood pressure and diabetes, quitting smoking and managing stress.   
    
            Taking action after pregnancy is equally important, as research has estimated that only 30% to 80% of women have a postpartum checkup 6 to 8 weeks after delivery.
    
            “Making sure that these women actually are appropriately followed after their delivery and that there is a warm handoff between [obstetrics] and [maternal-fetal medicine] to their primary care doctors or preventive cardiologists who can then talk about optimizing cardiovascular risks and reduction of these risk factors post-pregnancy in the postpartum time frame is crucial,” Sharma said. 
    
            Experts hope that increased patient and provider awareness of the connection between pregnancy and heart health will keep birth from being a cause of death.
    
            “Cardiovascular disease is preventable. It’s a leading cause of maternal mortality, but it doesn’t have to be. If we do a better job at screening patients before they get pregnant, if we do a better job of treating them during pregnancy and postpartum, we can improve women’s outcomes,” Narula said. “It’s a tragedy to bring a new life into the world, and then the mother suffers some horrible complication and/or death that could have been prevented.”

      Republican AGs warn pharmacies against mailing abortion pills within their states

            Republican attorneys general from 20 states wrote letters to executives at CVS and Walgreens warning the pharmacy chains against using the mail to dispense abortion pills in their states, in a shot against a new Biden administration policy.
    
            The letters rebuke recent guidance from the Justice Department – issued in an opinion from the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel – that concluded the federal law did not prohibit the mailing of abortion pills. The release of the Justice Department opinion came ahead of the rollout of new rules from the Food and Drug Administration allowing certified pharmacies to dispense medication abortion with a prescription, including by mail order.
    
            “We reject the Biden administration’s bizarre interpretation, and we expect courts will as well,” the GOP attorneys general wrote, while suggesting that they may bring civil litigation to challenge the claim that federal law allows the mailing of abortion pills.
    
            “Obviously, a federal criminal law – especially one that is, as here, enforceable through a private right of action – deserves serious contemplation,” they wrote.
    
            Some states prohibit the use of mail to deliver abortion pills. Missouri – whose attorney general, Andrew Bailey, spearheaded the letters – also “prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices – and trade practices that violate federal law necessarily are unfair and deceptive,” the letters said.
    
            Medication abortion – in which pregnancies are terminated with a two-pill regimen – now makes up a majority of the abortions obtained in the United States. Several states restrict medication abortion, some with blanket bans on abortion and others with specific limits on access to abortion pills. CVS and Walgreens have said that they intend to comply with federal and state law with their plans to dispense mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in medication abortion. (Pharmacies were previously allowed to distribute the second drug, misoprostol.)
    
            Asked about the new letter from the attorneys general, a spokesperson for Walgreens said it is not dispensing mifepristone at this time.
    
            “We intend to become a certified pharmacy under the program, however we fully understand that we may not be able to dispense Mifepristone in all locations if we are certified under the program,” the spokesperson Fraser Engerman said in an email. 
    
            A spokesperson for CVS did not immediately respond to CNN’s inquiry.

      Survey finds widespread confusion around medication abortion in post-Roe US
    ","

    ","
            Nearly half of adults in the United States – including 2 out of 5 women of childbearing age – are unsure whether medication abortion is legal in their state, according to a survey released Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
    
            The survey was conducted in mid-January, more than six months after the US Supreme Court issued the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and revoked the federal right to abortion.
    
            Several states had “trigger bans” that took effect in the weeks after the high court’s judgment, with laws that ban or severely restrict abortion. But some of those laws are in limbo as they face challenges in courts.
    
            The legal landscape around abortion was rapidly even before Dobbs, experts say. New telehealth rules put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic offered additional pathways to access medication abortion. State legislatures are now in session for the first time since that decision, which is sure to bring more change.
    
            “It’s fair to be confused about all of the different ways in which somebody can get access to medication abortion and wonder which ways are legal and which ways are a little bit more outside of the legal framework,” said Asha Hassan, a researcher with the University of Minnesota’s Center for Antiracism Research for Health Equity who focuses on reproductive health.
    
            “We’re in a learning curve right now. But then, the education has to change because it is constantly a shifting climate.”
    
            Both in states where abortion is banned and in those where it is legal, about half of adults are not sure about the legal status of medication abortion in their state, according to the KFF survey. And some are getting it wrong.
    
            In states where abortion is banned, about 13% of adults incorrectly think that medication abortion is legal. And in states where abortion is legal, about 10% think that medication is banned.  
    
            This confusion can be a barrier on its own, said Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project. Spreading awareness and battling misinformation is a key priority for the White House and other advocates.
    
            For politicians and others who are anti-abortion, “it’s not just about actually passing laws that make it illegal. It’s about creating a perception of danger of risk,” she said. “Even if active steps are not taken, the perception of legal risk can deter people.”
    
            President Biden has called for action to specifically protect access to mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortion that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In early January, the FDA approved a measure that would allow certain pharmacies to supply the drug directly to patients with a prescription.  That expands access, as medication abortion was previously available only through certain health care providers. But it has never been available over-the-counter.
    
            Most abortions in the US are medication abortions – as opposed to the medical procedure – according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights.
    
            But there is still some confusion around how to access a medication abortion. About half of adults are not sure whether medication abortion requires a prescription, according to the KFF survey. About 1 in 10 adults incorrectly believe that it does not require a prescription – including nearly as many women.
    
            Most adults (62%) know that emergency contraceptive pills, known as the morning after pill or Plan B, are not the same as the abortion pill. And most adults know that contraceptive pills are available in their state, as they are in all 50 states. But nearly three-quarters think emergency contraceptive pills can end a pregnancy in its early stages.
    
            “There’s a lot of growth and work that we can do within the health care industry and environment to make sure that people know that [medication abortion] is safe, and something that is extremely accessible compared to surgical abortion right now,” Hassan said.

      Minnesota governor signs bill codifying ‘fundamental right’ to abortion into law

    ","
            Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill into law Tuesday that enshrines the “fundamental right” to access abortion in the state. 
    
            Abortion is already legal in Minnesota, but in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, the Protect Reproductive Options Act goes a step further by outlining that every person has the fundamental right to make “autonomous decisions” about their own reproductive health as well as the right to refuse reproductive health care. 
    
            “This is very simple, very right to the point,” Walz said Tuesday on “CNN Tonight.” “We trust women in Minnesota, and that’s not what came out of the [Supreme Court’s] decision, so I think it’s critically important that we build a fire wall.”
    
            With the passage of the bill, Minnesota is now the first state to codify abortion via legislative action since Roe v. Wade was reversed, the office of the bill’s lead author in Minnesota’s state Senate, told CNN. 
    
            “Last November, Minnesotans spoke loud and clear: They want their reproductive rights protected – not stripped away,” Walz said in a news release. “Today, we are delivering on our promise to put up a firewall against efforts to reverse reproductive freedom. No matter who sits on the Minnesota Supreme Court, this legislation will ensure Minnesotans have access to reproductive health care for generations to come. Here in Minnesota, your access to reproductive health care and your freedom to make your own health care decisions are preserved and protected.”
    
            The bill states that local government cannot restrict a person’s ability to exercise the “fundamental right” to reproductive freedom. It also clarifies that this right extends to accessing contraception, sterilization, family planning, fertility services and counseling regarding reproductive health care. 
    
            “The Pro Act also goes beyond just granting those rights to abortion, it really says all reproductive healthcare decisions aren’t our business, including access to contraception, including access to really anything that is related to personal and private decisions about your reproductive life,” Megan Peterson, the executive director of pro-abortion rights campaign UnRestrict Minnesota, told CNN following Walz’s signing of the bill. 
    
            In a letter to Walz ahead of the signing, Republican legislature leaders argued that the bill went too far and urged the governor to veto what they called “an extreme law.” 
    
            “As the PRO Act was being rushed through the legislature, Republicans offered reasonable amendments with guardrails to protect women and children,” state Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson and House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth wrote, “Sadly, each of these amendments were struck down by a Democrat majority.”
    
            In 1995, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in Doe v. Gomez that abortion was a fundamental right protected under the state’s constitution. The Protect Reproductive Options Act ensures that even in the event of a new state Supreme Court reversing the ruling, the right to abortion will be protected under state law. 
    
            “By passing this law, Minnesotans will have a second layer of protection for their existing reproductive rights. A future Minnesota Supreme Court could overturn Doe v. Gomez, but with the PRO Act now in State law, Minnesotans will still have a right to Reproductive healthcare,” Luke Bishop, a spokesperson for Democratic State Sen. Jennifer McEwen, the bill’s author in the Senate, told CNN over email. 
    
            Following the governor’s signature of the bill, the White House applauded Minnesota’s efforts, pointing to the popular support for women’s rights to make their own health care decisions.
    
            “Americans overwhelmingly support a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions, as so clearly demonstrated last fall when voters turned out to defend access to abortion –  including for ballot initiatives in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and Vermont,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. 
    
            “While Congressional Republicans continue their support for extreme policies including a national abortion ban, the President and Vice President are calling on Congress to restore the protections of Roe in federal law,” she wrote. “Until then, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue its work to protect access to abortion and support state leaders in defending women’s reproductive rights.”

      First on CNN: Biden administration to strengthen Obamacare contraceptive mandate in proposed rule

    ","
            The Biden administration wants to make it easier for women to access birth control at no cost under the Affordable Care Act, reversing Trump-era rules that weakened the law’s contraceptive mandate for employer-provided health insurance plans.
    
            The proposed rule, unveiled Monday by the departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, would remove an exemption to the mandate that allows employers to opt out for moral convictions. It would also create an independent pathway for individuals enrolled in plans offered by employers with religious exemptions to access contraceptive services through a willing provider without charge.
    
            The proposed rule would leave in place the existing religious exemption for employers with objections, as well as the optional accommodation for contraceptive coverage.
    
            The administration crafted the proposed rule keeping in mind the concerns of employers with religious objections and the contraceptive needs of their workers, a senior HHS official told CNN.
    
            “We had to really think through how to do this in the right way to satisfy both sides, but we think we found that way,” the official said, stressing that there should be no effect on religiously affiliated employers.
    
            Students at religiously affiliated colleges would have access to the expanded accommodation, just like workers in group health plans where the employer has claimed the exemption.
    
            Now that the proposed rule has been announced, the public will have the opportunity to comment during the next few months. Officials expect there to be many thousands of public comments, and it will be “many months” before the rule could be finalized.
    
            HHS expects the proposal would affect more than 100 employers and 125,000 workers, mainly through providing the proposed independent pathway for employees to receive no-cost contraception.
    
            Women using that pathway would obtain their birth control from a participating provider, who would be reimbursed by an insurer on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The insurer, in turn, would receive a credit on the user fee it pays the government.
    
            “If this rule is finalized, individuals who have health plans that would otherwise be subject to the ACA preventive services requirements but have not covered contraceptive services because of a moral or religious objection, and for which the sponsoring employer or college or university has not elected the optional accommodation, would now have access,” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said in a news release.
    
            How many people benefit, however, would depend on whether women and their health care providers know the independent pathway exists and whether providers and insurers are willing to set it up.
    
            “We’ll just have to see how widely that information is spread and in what way to providers and individuals,” said Laurie Sobel, associate director for Women’s Health Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, noting that the proposed rule would not require data collection to show the pathway’s takeup.
    
            But the Planned Parenthood Federation of America cheered the initiative.
    
            “Employers and universities should not be able to dictate personal health care decisions and impose their views on their employees or students,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, the group’s CEO. “The ACA mandates that health insurance plans cover all forms of birth control without out-of-pocket costs. Now, more than ever, we must protect this fundamental freedom.”
    
            The requirement to provide no-cost contraception is not in the Affordable Care Act itself. Instead, HHS under former President Barack Obama included it as one of the women’s preventive services that all private insurance plans must offer without charge. 
    
            The mandate was controversial from the start, sparking lawsuits from religiously affiliated employers and closely held companies that said it violated their beliefs. Exemptions and accommodations have been available for such employers.
    
            The Trump administration, however, weakened the mandate. Under the rules issued in 2018, entities that have “sincerely held religious beliefs” against providing contraceptives are not required to do so. That provision also extends to organizations and small businesses that have objections “on the basis of moral conviction which is not based in any particular religious belief.”
    
            The rules also include an optional accommodation that lets objecting employers and private universities remove themselves from providing birth control coverage while still allowing their workers and dependents access to contraception. But the employer or university has to voluntarily elect the accommodation, which risks leaving many without access.
    
            The Trump administration changes were temporarily blocked after a Pennsylvania district court judge issued a nationwide injunction in 2019. But the following year, the Supreme Court ruled that the administration could expand exemptions for employers who have religious or moral objections to covering contraception.
    
            At the time, the National Women’s Law Center estimated that the ruling would impact about 64.3 million women in the United States with insurance coverage that included birth control and other preventive services without out-of-pocket costs.
    
            Employers are not required to notify HHS if they have a moral objection. The agency estimates about 18 employers have claimed that exemption and around 15 employees are affected.
    
            Still, if the rule is finalized, senior HHS officials say it is “plausible” there could be potential lawsuits brought by religiously affiliated employers – similar to what has been seen in the past. 
    
            “There’s no new obligation on them to participate in any sort of process. This is simply an additional channel for employees in those employer health plans to receive access to contraceptive services,” another senior HHS official said. 
    
            The contraceptive mandate has taken on increased importance now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing many states to impose severe restrictions on abortion access.
    
            The Biden administration in turn has focused on continuing access to birth control at no cost. The Health, Labor and Treasury department secretaries last year met with health insurers and issued guidance underscoring Obamacare’s contraceptive coverage requirements for private insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
    
            “Now more than ever, access to and coverage of birth control is critical as the Biden-Harris Administration works to help ensure women everywhere can get the contraception they need, when they need it, and – thanks to the ACA – with no out-of-pocket cost,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a news release.

      Opinion: This law from the 1870s could imperil abortion in blue states
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler

    ","
            Since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in June, promising strategies have emerged to protect abortion rights in individual states. Some have begun to pass ballot initiatives to preserve or create state constitutional protection. Others have looked to legislatures to shield doctors and those who help people seeking abortion from potential consequences in conservative states.  
    
            These wins are hardly a silver bullet: not all states allow ballot initiatives and there are any number of states where majorities of voters seem to support abortion rights but are governed by legislators who want to ban the procedure—a result of deep partisan divides, gerrymandering and limits on access to the vote.  
    
            Just the same, supporters of abortion rights have made the most of the best strategies available to them, bolstered by the fact that most Americans support at least some access to legal abortion.
    
            This is, in part, why antiabortion groups have gotten creative and developed new strategies to cut off access to abortion, even in states where voting majorities have already chosen to guarantee it. An obvious target is abortion pills, which now account for more than half the procedures in the United States.  
    
            But the latest approach by abortion opponents to disrupt access in blue states is an archaic law: the Comstock Act, passed in 1873 mainly to target what Anthony Comstock, an anti-vice crusader, viewed as dirty books. Comstock, who was made a special agent of the US Postal Service, was obsessed by what he saw as the decaying morals of a country preoccupied with sex.  
    
            The law he inspired barred not just the mailing of “obscene books” but also birth control and abortion drugs and devices. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Comstock Act was used to prohibit the mailing of many literary classics, from Geoffrey Chaucer’s “The Canterbury Tales” to works by James Joyce and Walt Whitman. 
    
            Comstock himself proudly carried a gun and scoured the mail for cases involving information about abortion or contraception, even if a doctor provided it. By Comstock’s standard, the law was a great success: he claimed to have destroyed 15 tons of books, arrested more than 4,000 people and driven at least 15 people to suicide. 
    
            But by the time Comstock died in 1915, Americans were having second thoughts about his crusade and courts started to limit the application of the law. Judges suggested that there were lawful uses of some drugs, like contraceptives, and that the Comstock Act applied only to those who intended to violate the law. That meant that doctors validly prescribing certain medications might be exempt from the Comstock Act, as would patients acting under a physician’s advice. 
    
            Some members of the antiabortion movement are pushing for a comeback for the Comstock Act, fighting for local ordinances that assert an obligation to follow federal law, including the Comstock Act. 
    
            The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a socially conservative group, has filed a lawsuit in Texas that hinges on application of Comstock’s law. These groups suggest that the Comstock Act applies far more broadly—to the mailing of any abortion pill, to anyone, anywhere. They question the interpretation of the law offered by courts  since the 1910s—and stress that this interpretation only ever applied to birth control, not abortion drugs. 
    
            While the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has already rejected this argument, that seems unlikely to dissuade antiabortion groups. Their hope is surely to bring their arguments about the Comstock Act to conservative judges—and ultimately, to the conservative supermajority of the US Supreme Court.
    
            The goal for many leaders of the antiabortion movement in the US is a national ban on abortion—preferably, one that recognizes the personhood of the fetus and establishes that abortion itself is unconstitutional. Given the Supreme Court’s composition, this kind of personhood argument may eventually capture the support of the justices, but likely not anytime soon. 
    
            Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who holds one of the definitive votes in abortion cases, wrote this summer that the Constitution is “neither pro-life nor pro-choice,” and he is unlikely to reverse course in the near term. But if the Court relies on the Comstock Act, the antiabortion movement might be able to secure the equivalent of a ban on all abortion medication without Kavanaugh having to contradict himself. 
    
            The question before the Supreme Court in a case about the Comstock Act would not likely be a constitutional one. Instead, the justices would have to weigh competing interpretations of the law. Does it apply to the mailing of abortion pills only when there is an intent to violate the law? Or does it bar anyone from ever mailing abortion pills? If the Court says that the Comstock Act bans the mailing of all abortion pills, that would make it difficult for anyone to access them—abortion clinics receive pills from drug companies, as do pharmacies and patients relying on telehealth.
    
            In New Mexico, the attorney general asked the state supreme court to block local ordinances that ban abortion and invoke the Comstock Act. This suit could give conservative judges a chance to hold that the Comstock Act is enforceable everywhere, including in blue states. 
    
            For abortion foes, that’s a key first step in getting their sweeping interpretation of the Comstock Act heard in federal court, with the hope that an appeal makes it to the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority. 
    
            If the Supreme Court interprets the Comstock Act to ban the mailing of abortion pills, the Biden administration’s Department of Justice would likely not make enforcement of the act a priority. That would sharpen the already-high stakes of the 2024 election, especially for blue states. A Republican president could take a very different position on enforcing of the Comstock Act, with dire consequences.
    
            For those in blue states, this growing focus on the Comstock Act should be a wakeup call. Now is the time to begin working toward the repeal of the law.  
    
            True, parts of it may violate the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech, and the law’s provisions on contraception obviously contradict Supreme Court rulings protecting birth control. But the law’s provisions on abortion face no obstacles (and the Supreme Court’s willingness to protect birth control is certainly in question if the Court consistently applies the test it laid out in its decision last summer overruling Roe v. Wade). 
    
            As it stands, supporters of abortion rights may simply hope that courts will see a strategy predicated on the Comstock Act as a step too far, even for conservative judges. But progressives once had a hard time believing that the Supreme Court would destroy abortion rights. We all know how that story ended. 
    
            In the next few years, access to abortion may not be a problem only in the states across the South and Midwest that have chosen to ban it. While much remains uncertain, one thing is clear: if Anthony Comstock knew what was happening with his famous law, he would be pleased.

            The mortality rate of pregnant and recently pregnant women in the United States rose almost 30% between 2019 and 2020, according to a new study.
    
            The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, analyzed information on 4,535 deaths collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics from 2019 to 2020. The researchers looked at deaths in women who were pregnant or were within a year of giving birth. 
    
            The women’s mortality rate from any cause increased from 54 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019 to 70 in 2020, the researchers found. Mortality rates increased 22% for pregnancy-related causes and 36% for nonpregnancy causes.
    
            Causes not related to pregnancy accounted for more than half of the women’s deaths in 2020, the researchers say. Accidental drug poisoning was the most common, followed by motor vehicle collisions and homicide, with mortality rates of 12.2%, 5.9% and 5.5%, respectively. The mortality rate involving suicide did not significantly change.
    
            The study authors also identified significant racial and ethnic disparities. Mortality rates were three to five times higher among American Indian or Alaska Native women for every cause except suicide. Black women had similarly high mortality rates across all causes, with 5.3 times higher risk of dying from homicide. 
    
            “One of the main messages, I think, from this is really that there’s a much bigger societal problem facing pregnant women and new mothers who are in that postpartum period where, you know, that’s a very stressful time of life. What this points to is that there’s particular vulnerability in this population to some of these other social factors,” said Jeffrey Howard, an author of the study and associate professor of public health at the University of Texas at San Antonio. 
    
            He says the research is consistent with increasing death rates among pregnant and postpartum women, but says this trend was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The pregnancy-related mortality rate increased by 4.4% annually from 2015 to 2019 compared with 29% from 2019 to 2020. 
    
            What Howard finds especially striking is the number of deaths not due to pregnancy.
    
            “If you go back to 2015, most of the deaths in this population were from pregnancy-specific causes. I think it was around 60% and 40% were from other causes. By 2020, it’s kind of flip-flopped where the majority of the deaths are coming from other causes, not pregnancy-specific,” Howard said. 
    
            The findings can be largely attributed to the stressors brought on by the pandemic, he said. Rebecca Lawn, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees.
    
            The findings “really just highlight and bring into discussion factors that you don’t traditionally think of with mortality of pregnant women,” said Lawn, who was not involved with the research. “And I think it’s the same with the pandemic. The measures that were put in place to keep people safe from Covid-19, such as stay-at-home orders, actually can exacerbate women’s experiences of intimate partner violence.”
    
            Lawn says pregnancy is a time when intimate partner violence often begins or increases in severity. Along with access to firearms, it’s one of the highest risk factors for women being murdered during or after pregnancy, she said. 
    
            “But [pregnancy] also comes at a time where, if women have access to health care, there is then a time for more opportunities to help and protect women in terms of screening for intimate partner violence or educating on intimate partner violence. So I think that access to care is a really important component.” 
    
            Experts say that addressing substance use during and after pregnancy is also critical as death from opioid overdose among pregnant and postpartum women has increased in recent years, mirroring trends in the general population. 
    
            “We have a duty as a society to acknowledge that it is OK to not be OK and destigmatize mental health so that individuals feel comfortable to seek help,” said Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, an ob/gyn at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans. “We should also be trained on using [the opioid overdose treatment] Narcan and understand how to access it, and we have to address community violence.”
    
            As for racial and ethnic disparities, experts say these findings are consistent with research showing that Native American and Black women are at significantly higher risks of pregnancy-related death and that structural issues must be addressed.  
    
            “We’ve seen study after study show how discrimination and structural racism are at play at multiple levels within our health care system as well as communities at large, preventing women from accessing quality care that is respectful,” said Dr. Kamila Alexander, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.
    
            Research has shown that more than four out of five pregnancy-related deaths are preventable, but experts say systemic changes are necessary. 
    
            “The year after birth is a critical time period. Women are still at risk for a number of pregnancy-associated causes of death; however, for the most part, they are disconnected from the health care system. It is important for community and family to provide support and understand the issues that are facing postpartum women put them at risk for death,” Gillispie-Bell said.

      Opinion: The right-wing approach to ‘parents’ rights’ puts kids at risk
    ","
			Opinion by Jill Filipovic
		;Jill Filipovic","
  Updated
        1:17 PM EST, Wed January 25, 2023
    ","
            Some of the most contentious debates in American education – among them what kinds of stories are (and are not) allowed in the classroom, how teachers should teach US history and navigate LGBTQ issues (when there are states that seek to bar them from discussion) – have led to the resurgence of talk about “parents’ rights.”  
    
            The term is, for a number of Americans, exactly what it sounds like. But therein lies its deceptive risk, because it’s also historically been a conservative talking point, and now it’s back with a vengeance. For the right-wing media ecosystem, “parents’ rights” is now too often a shorthand for a parent’s right to control: the power to decide what their child learns, what their child believes  and what that child does with their body – all while preventing the child’s exposure to anything with which the parent might disagree. 
    
            And while “parents’ rights” or “parental rights” may seem like common sense – of course parents should have the broad ability to guide their children, keep them safe and make decisions that children are too young to take on – those terms are too often trotted out to strip children and teenagers of their basic rights, including to medical care, education, physical safety, freedom (including freedom from sexual violence) and a modicum of privacy. 
    
            Nowhere is this dynamic more visible than in the discourse around trans kids – ubiquitous as a fear tactic in right-leaning media and of late, a point of debate about articles like a recent one in the New York Times asking whether schools should alert parents when their kids change or experiment with their gender identity in school.
    
            It’s understandable that most parents would want to know if their child was undergoing such a significant transition. The question, though, isn’t what it’s reasonable for parents to want, but what it’s reasonable to enforce through laws and regulations. And it is wholly unreasonable to demand that a teenager’s experimentation with identity and belief, so long as that experimentation is not physically dangerous, be disclosed to parents. 
    
            We shouldn’t make laws – or education policy – with only functional, supportive families in mind. It’s tempting to do that, but life experience tells us that not all kids have the families they deserve and research tells us that trans kids without parental support face a host of mental health risks and other challenges. That combination should give anyone pause before deciding what’s reasonable.   
    
            Consider this. Teenagers aren’t yet grownups, but they are in the crucial stages of establishing some independence from their parents, asserting their own identities, forming their own opinions and trying new things. In the hours they are at school, they should find a safe place to do just that, whether that’s the teenager of vegan parents choosing to sample a chicken nugget in the cafeteria or the child of atheists trying out the Christian after-school club or, yes, a teenager who thinks they may be trans trying on a new name and putting on a different wardrobe. 
    
            Context is important here: According to a 2022 report analyzing data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been a marked uptick in the number of minors identifying as transgender. While 0.5% of American adults identify as transgender, 1.4% of young people between the ages of 13 and 17 do. Those numbers are even higher in more liberal regions, this report says – in New York state, for example, 3% of young people now identify as trans, which amounts to some 34,000 teenagers. 
    
            Such social changes of course provoke unease, especially when they pertain to something as fundamental as identity. For many, the very act of an individual crossing or transcending the gender binary challenges long-held assumptions about gender roles and ideas about what’s “natural.”
    
            There was a similar parental panic in the 1990s when high school students began coming out as gay or bisexual. A New York Times article from 1997 now seems quite quaint in its observation that “as gay-straight student clubs have sprung up in the last few years, some parents wonder if their children are now getting what these parents, at least, fear is gay propaganda along with a classical education.” 
    
            Some conservative parents may still agree that the very existence of gay-straight alliances propagandize students toward homosexuality, but I imagine most liberal parents understand that they don’t – and that it could pose real problems for teachers or counselors to out students who identify as gay or bisexual to their parents, and that teenagers should be supported in coming out to who they choose, when they choose. 
    
            The same holds true for trans and non-binary teenagers who are experimenting with social transition during the school day. 
    
            There are a great many people and parents who wonder if some of the teenagers identifying as trans or gender-nonconforming are simply in one stage of their adolescent hunt for identity, are seeking attention and the feeling of being different and therefore special, or are facing other mental health issues or developmental disorders.
    
            A tiny fraction of minors seek gender-affirming care, which can range from assistance in social transitioning – that is, presenting as one’s identified gender in public – to medical interventions, which themselves range from drugs that help delay the onset of puberty to hormone therapy. Last year, the New York Times reported that in 11 of the leading pediatric gender clinics in the US, 203 top surgeries, or mastectomies, were performed on minors in 2021. That’s out of more than 25 million minors in the US aged 12-17. 
    
            Even well-meaning and generally supportive parents may have questions, including about the long-term health risks versus benefits of drugs that delay puberty and the hormones that may follow. In the meantime, many conservatives have exploited understandable parental fears about their kids making significant emotional and physical changes, casting transgender people and those who support them as “groomers” and dangerous sources of indoctrination. They have drawn gender-affirming care and even the simple recognition of transgender people under the umbrella of “parental rights,” and essentially tell parents, “No one should be making decisions about your child’s gender identity but you.” 
    
            There’s no one easy answer to the question: How much power should parents have over their children’s identities and pursuit of information? 
    
            Many on the right are trying to say it’s simple; to them, the answer is “total.” But even some liberal parents are coming undone at the prospect of not knowing that their teenager’s identity is in flux. In that recent New York Times article, a group of largely self-identified liberal parents share that they were upset that their teenagers began to socially transition at school – using a new name, perhaps, or wearing androgynous clothing or clothes associated with a particular sex. These parents felt that they should know if their kid is identifying as a different gender at school. 
    
            It’s hard not to sympathize with their desires, but those feelings don’t exist in a vacuum. They are happening in a country where minors have very few rights. American kids are wildly unprotected. The kind of physical assaults that would be criminal if they were committed by one adult against another adult are in many states legal when the victim is a child. Child marriage remains legal in most states, including, in some cases, allowing children who are too young to legally consent to sex to nevertheless be married off if that’s what a parent deems appropriate – and it’s Republicans who have largely opposed efforts to raise the legal marriage age. 
    
            Meanwhile, parenting norms, like just about everything else, differ widely along political lines. Research indicates that conservative parents are more likely to use authoritarian parenting methods, demanding obedience and respect for elders over the independence, curiosity and self-reliance more often prioritized by liberal parents. It makes sense why parents with this mentality – destructive as I would argue it is, especially when enforced (as it often is) through physical punishment, threats and shaming – believe that their rights over their children’s lives are near-total. In that worldview, their children have virtually no rights at all. 
    
            This is why norms and informal rules are important: when American children are made this vulnerable by their lack of legal protection, the very least they need are communities (including schools) that see them as individual and worthy human beings, not simple extensions of their parents. 
    
            The more liberal-minded among us, in other words, should push back on this authoritarianism and the demand for parental rights to supersede all else. We must assert the rights of all children to live free of violence and to explore their identities in safe ways without being ratted out to their parents. As grownups, we can project the necessary openness and willingness to listen that researchers say makes us potential allies and sources of support for teens – whether we are their parents or not. 
    
            Yes, this can be uncomfortable. But part of being an adult is advocating for rules and laws that are the best for everyone, and not just the rules and laws that reflect what you individually would like for yourself. And that means advocating for a world in which, yes, parents have rights – but so do children and teens.

      Legal fight around abortion drug mifepristone escalates with new lawsuits challenging state restrictions

    ","
            The legal fight around medication abortion – the two-pill regimen that allows women to terminate their pregnancies – escalated Wednesday with separate lawsuits filed in two states challenging their restrictions on the method.
    
            One lawsuit was filed by GenBioPro, a major manufacturer of mifepristone, which is the first drug used in the medication abortion process, in West Virginia challenging the state’s laws limiting access to the drug, including the outright ban on abortion lawmakers passed last year. 
    
            The second lawsuit was filed by an OB-GYN in North Carolina and targets the requirements that state places on obtaining abortion pills that go beyond the federal standards for provision of medication abortion.
    
            The lawsuits represent one of several new legal battlefronts that have emerged since the Supreme Court’s June ruling that reversed the decades-old Roe v. Wade precedent protecting abortion rights nationwide, allowing states to implement restrictions and bans on the procedure. 
    
            Medication abortion, which now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the United States, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the fallout from the Supreme Court’s decision. In November, anti-abortion advocates sued the US Food and Drug Administration, seeking to block its 20-year-old approval of mifepristone; the Texas federal court where that lawsuit was filed could rule as early as next month whether the FDA’s abortion pill policies should be halted.
    
            While many states already have laws that prohibit medication abortion, legislators have signaled they’ll be exploring new ways to clamp down on the avenues abortion-seekers have for accessing abortion pills as statehouses reconvene this year.
    
            The two new lawsuits in North Carolina and West Virginia make similar arguments, alleging those states’ restrictions run afoul of the US Constitution because they are preempted by federal law that gives the FDA the authority to approve and regulate medication abortion.
    
            GenBioPro argues that West Virginia’s laws violate the authority the Commerce Clause grants Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Amy Bryant, the medical provider suing in North Carolina, alleges that the state’s stringent requirements on where women can access abortion pills, as well as its mandated waiting period for obtaining an abortion, are imposing “unnecessary costs on Plaintiff and her practice and interfere with her ability to provide medical care to her patients according to her best medical judgment and in accordance with federal law.”
    
            A spokesperson for North Carolina’s Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat who is a defendant in the North Carolina lawsuit, said that his office was reviewing the complaint.
    
            West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican who was sued in the GenBioPro lawsuit, said in a statement his office was “prepared to defend West Virginia’s new abortion law to the fullest.”
    
            “While it may not sit well with manufacturers of abortion drugs, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that regulating abortion is a state issue,” Morrisey said. “I will stand strong for the life of the unborn and will not relent in our defense of this clearly constitutional law.”

      Justice Department to monitor new anti-abortion bills in state legislatures
    ","

    ","
            Upcoming state-level pushes to further restrict abortion access will be on the radar of the US Justice Department, top DOJ officials said Monday as they touted the work the Biden administration has sought to do to shore up abortion access in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade reversal last year.
    
            “We’ve obviously been very active in monitoring what’s happening in the states and locally, and given that most state legislatures now are coming back into session, we’ll be continuing to do so and looking at any laws that may get passed that infringe on federal protections,” said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, who leads a department task force on reproductive rights that was launched after the Supreme Court’s decision.
    
            She was joined by Attorney General Merrick Garland to speak briefly to reporters at the top of a task force meeting, timed to the 50th anniversary of the Roe decision, which protected abortion rights nationwide before the ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court in June.
    
            Several states had restrictive laws and bans already on the books that went into effect after the ruling – though some were blocked in state court in lawsuits challenging them under state constitutions. 
    
            In the coming weeks, however, many state legislatures will be reconvening for the first time since the Dobbs decision and anti-abortion lawmakers are expected to further tighten up laws around the procedure.
    
            “Many of us feared that that decision would deal a devastating blow to reproductive freedom in the United States, that it would have an immediate and irreversible impact on the lives of people across the country, and that the greatest burdens would be felt by people of color. And those of limited financial means,” Garland said. “Unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened.”
    
            The options the federal government have for mitigating the effects of the June decision are limited. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority said in the ruling that the US Constitution did not guarantee a right to abortion, freeing the states to limit or fully outlaw the procedure.
    
            Garland and Gupta pointed to a lawsuit that the Justice Department brought against Idaho for its extremely strict abortion ban, which was partially blocked by a federal judge last year to the extent it prevented women from receiving abortion care in medical emergencies. The judge agreed with the DOJ’s arguments that federal law protected abortion access in those situations, but a judge in Texas – in a separate case brought by Texas to challenge the Biden administration’s guidance – has disagreed with that interpretation.
    
            On Monday, the DOJ leaders also pointed to the counsel the department has given agencies to bolster reproductive access – including advice on a Department of Veterans Affairs policy to offer abortion services at its medical facilities in certain circumstances, and an internal executive branch opinion interpreting federal law as allowing the mailing of abortion pills.
    
            The former policy is subject of litigation and the latter move may be targeted by anti-abortion state legislatures, which are expected to act aggressively to stymie the ability of residents to obtain medication abortion. Some state lawmakers have floated clamping down on websites and other modes of communication that would assist women seeking abortions.
    
            “Every day that passes there are still more reports of new efforts not only to restrict access to abortion, but also to chill and intimidate women from seeking abortion and other reproductive health services even where they remain lawful,” Gupta said.

      Kamala Harris mourns victims of Monterey Park shooting before speech to mark 50 years since Roe
    ","

    ","
            Vice President Kamala Harris declared Sunday that “this violence must stop” in her first on-camera remarks about the mass shooting in Monterey Park, California, that has left at least 10 people dead.
    
            “I do want to address the tragedy of what happened in my home state,” Harris, a former California senator and state attorney general, told a crowd in Tallahassee, Florida, at the beginning of her speech to mark 50 years since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision.
    
            “A time of a cultural celebration … and yet another community has been torn apart by senseless gun violence,” the vice president said, noting that the shooting took place on the weekend of the Lunar New Year. The attack happened at a dance studio Saturday night near a Lunar New Year festival celebration in the city approximately seven miles from downtown Los Angeles.
    
            “So Doug and I join the president and Dr. Biden, and I know everyone here, in mourning for those who were killed, as we pray for those who are injured, and as we grieve for those many people whose lives are forever changed. All of us in this room and in our country understand this violence must stop,” Harris said. “And President Biden and I and our administration will continue to provide full support to the local authorities as we learn more.”
    
            President Joe Biden said in a Sunday morning tweet that he is monitoring the aftermath of the mass shooting “closely as it develops.”
    
            “Jill and I are praying for those killed and injured in last night’s deadly mass shooting in Monterey Park,” he said. “I’m monitoring this situation closely as it develops, and urge the community to follow guidance from local officials and law enforcement in the hours ahead.”
    
            The White House announced earlier Sunday that the president had been briefed by Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall and had directed her to “make sure that the FBI is providing full support to local authorities,” while providing him regular updates.
    
            The Bidens remain at their vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and are expected to return to Washington, DC, on Monday.
    
            Harris’ high-profile speech in Tallahassee came on the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which the Supreme Court overturned in June, ending federal protections for abortion.
    
            The vice president sought to draw a direct throughline between abortion access and the freedoms enjoyed by Americans, arguing that limits or outright bans on reproductive health care threaten the rights of ordinary citizens. 
    
            “There’s a collection of words that mean everything to us as Americans. The heartfelt words of our great national anthem, that America is the land of the free and the home of the brave. But let us ask, can we truly be free if a woman cannot make decisions about her own body?” Harris said as the crowd at The Moon nightclub responded with a loud “no.”
    
            The vice president’s office said there were 1,500 people in attendance.
    
            Harris’ office said earlier that the choice of Florida for the vice president’s speech Sunday spoke to the reality that the Sunshine State, which enacted a 15-week abortion ban last year, is now at the forefront of the abortion debate.
    
            Harris did not mention the state’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, by name in her remarks, but she appeared to speak directly to the potential 2024 presidential contender, as well as other Republican opponents of abortion rights.
    
            “Republicans in Congress are now calling for a nationwide abortion ban,” she said.”The right of every woman in every state in this country to make decisions about her own body is on the line. And I’ve said it before, and I will say it again: How dare they?”
    
            Harris in her speech announced a new presidential memorandum Biden will sign to protect access to medication abortion.
    
            “I’m pleased to announce that President Biden, I’m announcing it today, has issued a presidential memorandum on this issue. Members of our Cabinet and our administration are now directed as of the president’s order to identify barriers to access to prescription medication and to recommend actions to make sure that doctors can legally prescribe, that pharmacies can dispense and that women can secure safe and effective medication,” Harris said.
    
            As vice president, Harris has claimed the issue of reproductive rights as her own, becoming the administrations most visible advocate for abortion rights since news leaked last year that the Supreme Court was all but expected to overturn Roe v. Wade. Harris traveled the country to convene state legislators, activists, lawyers and educators to discuss the issue and set a national message for Democrats.
    
            The Biden administration has taken steps in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision last June to ensure access to abortion care. The president signed an executive order in August that he said would help women travel out of state to receive abortions; ensure health care providers comply with federal law so women aren’t delayed in getting care; and advance research and data collection “to evaluate the impact that this reproductive health crisis is having on maternal health and other health conditions and outcomes.”
    
            Harris, touting the White House’s strategy, called Sunday on Congress to pass federal protections for abortion.
    
            But any legislation to enshrine abortion rights into federal law is unlikely to get far in the Republican controlled-House, which passed a bill earlier this month that would require health care providers to try to preserve the life of an infant in the rare case that a baby is born alive during or after an attempted abortion. The bill is not expected to be taken up in the Democratic-controlled Senate, but passage in the House serves as a messaging opportunity for the new Republican majority.
    
            Still, Harris encouraged abortion rights advocates to stay positive.
    
            “To all the friends and leaders, I say let us not be tired or discouraged because we’re on the right side of history,” she said Sunday. “Here now, on this 50th anniversary, let us resolve to make history and secure this right.”

      Republicans are now splintering over abortion rights

    ","
            Sunday marks exactly 50 years since the US Supreme Court granted American women abortion rights with the Roe v. Wade ruling – and comes about seven months after the court opened the door for much of the country to take them away with Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
    
            The court instantly created new fault lines throughout the country when it handed more control of abortion rights back to states. It also may presage a new rift within the GOP.
    
            At this moment of greatest triumph for abortion rights opponents, there are real questions about how far lawmakers and potential 2024 presidential candidates will go to prove their opposition to abortion.
    
            One potential presidential candidate, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, told Virginians to “choose life” during his State of the Commonwealth address this month. He’s backing that call up by pushing toward a 15-week ban. Current state law allows for abortion care up to about 26 weeks. 
    
            It would be a genuine achievement for Youngkin in Virginia, since he shares power at the legislative level in the state with Democrats, who have vowed to scuttle his plan.
    
            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week ban into law before the Dobbs decision last year, but given the Republican majority in his state, he’s now being criticized by some conservatives for not going nearly far enough.
    
            An aide to another potential GOP presidential candidate, Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, has criticized DeSantis for not endorsing a more forceful restriction on abortion rights.
    
            South Dakota has a near-total ban and, asked about DeSantis, Noem told CBS News this week that other Republican governors should do more.  
    
            “I would nudge every governor to do what they can to back up their pro-life record,” she said.
    
            When I asked CNN’s Florida politics expert Steve Contorno how far he expects DeSantis could go to restrict abortion rights, he told me the normally bombastic DeSantis has been sidestepping specifics ever since the Dobbs decision came out. 
    
            DeSantis released a vague statement promising to “expand pro-life protections” but has otherwise used an ongoing legal case over the 15-week ban as a shield for discussing what further steps he would take.
    
            “People on both sides of the abortion debate have told me they expect some kind of legislation will come up that pushes the limit earlier than 15 weeks that could blunt further attacks like the one from Noem, but it’s not clear if DeSantis would support a full ban,” Contorno told me.
    
            A ban that goes into effect after fetal cardiac activity is detected could be an alternative, he added, pointing out that DeSantis supported that type of legislation during his first run for governor in 2018.
    
            Contorno also pointed out that Florida’s new Senate president, Kathleen Passidomo, told the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald she wants a 12-week abortion ban, but that she would include exceptions for rape and incest that are absent from the 15-week ban DeSantis signed into law last year.
    
            Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump – who has announced he’s running again in 2024 – wants more credit from evangelical leaders for delivering the right-wing Supreme Court that is working its way through a total reexamination of US legal precedent and individual rights.
    
            “Nobody has ever done more for Right to Life than Donald Trump,” Trump told the conservative journalist David Brody. “I put three Supreme Court justices, who all voted, and they got something that they’ve been fighting for 64 years, for many, many years.” 
    
            He alleged “great disloyalty” among evangelical leaders not appropriately supporting him now.
    
            CNN’s Kristen Holmes, Gabby Orr and Kaitlan Collins wrote this week about Trump’s frustration with anti-abortion activists for not bringing more voters to the polls last November.
    
            On his social media platform, Trump said abortion hardliners cost the GOP votes, especially “those that firmly insisted on No Exceptions, even in the case of Rape, Incest, or Life of the Mother.”
    
            It is the definition of a Trumpian contradiction to both want credit for overturning Roe and be frustrated by the activists who wanted Roe overturned. But it also speaks to this larger issue of how Republicans should proceed on the issue.
    
            Opponents of abortion rights want to go further and are plotting a series of new laws in GOP-controlled states. 
    
            CNN’s Jessica Schneider and Devan Cole note that 22 state governments are under unified GOP control, and as state legislatures come into session for the year, they are looking to further restrict access to abortion services. Read their full report.
    
            Republicans in Wyoming, for example, have introduced a bill that calls for a full abortion ban, including on medication abortion, without exceptions for rape or incest, and which includes criminal penalties for anyone who performs abortions. The only exception would be in cases where the life of the mother is at risk.
    
            Nebraska Republicans introduced a ban on all abortions after embryonic cardiac activity is detected at about six weeks of gestation.
    
            Schneider and Cole note that Democrats are pushing back. Michigan Democrats, who now control the state government, are working to repeal an abortion ban in the state that dates back to 1931 but was on ice during the Roe years and was blocked by a judge in the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs decision.
    
            Meanwhile, in Maryland, where Democrats have complete control, voters may see an amendment on their ballot in 2024 that would add abortion rights to the state constitution.
    
            CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi talked to anti-abortion rights groups before they gathered Friday for the annual March for Life – which first occurred in 1974, a year after Roe, and now finds activists focused on passing more restrictive laws in states and trying to rebuild anti-abortion rights momentum after their Supreme Court victory in June.
    
            “The pro-life movement has just experienced a major victory in the fall of Roe v. Wade, but our work to build a culture of life is far from complete,” Jeanne Mancini, the head of March for Life’s Education and Defense Fund, told Stracqualursi. Read her full report.
    
            That may not be the case for supporters of abortion rights, many of whom credit the end of Roe with Democrats’ better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterm election. While Republicans will be recalibrating, Democrats will try to carry that momentum built around abortion rights into the presidential election.

      Opinion: On the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I can’t stop thinking about how abortion changed my life
    ","
			Opinion by Claudia Dreifus

    ","
            On Friday, members of the right to life movement converged on Washington to mark the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. They were also celebrating last June’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision which abrogated it.  
    
            Among my friends – many of them veterans of the 1970s women’s rights campaigns – there’s no celebration.   
    
            The Roe decision of January 22, 1973, effectively legalized abortion throughout the United States. On a human level, it freed women of child-bearing age from the pain and danger of illegal abortion.   
    
            I went to college in the pre-Roe era of the early 1960s. I still remember what it was like to be a young woman in a time when malfunctioning birth control could destroy one’s future.  
    
            If that happened, illegal abortion—often in the underground world of criminality and with physical danger—was, for most of us, the only option.  
    
            Young people are sexual; young people get pregnant. In my college circle, one routinely heard the most horrific stories: operations in motel rooms, surgeries without anesthesia, abortionists who’d raped women seeking their services. Strange as it seems today: this was common. I had a friend who developed a pelvic infection after a back-alley abortion; she was rendered infertile.   
    
            I found myself pregnant in 1964. I was 19.  At first, I tried to self-abort. I failed. A friend of my mother’s connected me with a doctor in Pennsylvania.   
    
            On the way there, I felt terrified. What if he wasn’t a genuine physician? Would I contract an infection like my friend did? The thought that I might die kept repeating itself. As I drove through the bleak January landscape of rural Pennsylvania, I thought “Whatever the risks, you must do this. There’s no turning back.” 
    
            I’d drawn the lucky card. He turned out to be a real physician. I had the operation under anesthesia and with proper medication. He provided abortions because he believed in it, never charging more than $100. His community protected him.     
    
            At the end of a very long day, the doctor handed me a packet of birth control pills and said, “I don’t want to see you here again.” 
    
            At that moment, my life began anew. My future was mine. Today, I am a professor and a writer. None of that would have been possible if, as a teenager, I’d been forced to have a child.
    
            I’ve been reliving all of this since the Dobbs decision was announced. After Roe, so many of us believed that the era of backroom abortion was forever gone. We couldn’t imagine a society where rights, once granted, could be rescinded. 
    
            Yet here we are. The Guttmacher Institute, which collects data on reproductive matters, notes that since Dobbs was decided, some 24 states “have banned abortion or are likely to do so.” 
    
            Today, for the first time in half a century, one hears stories that echo experiences in the bad old days.   
    
            There are some differences, of course. Birth control options are more plentiful and widely accessible. And abortion is not entirely underground—it remains fully legal in more than half of all states and in the District of Columbia. But in those entities with new restrictions, health care for women—whether they seek an abortion or not—has been compromised. 
    
            In multiple states, doctors frankly are scared. State laws are changing. Lawyers and judges are making decisions about whether or not women – and in some cases young girls – can get the care their doctors know they need. Women are afraid of being investigated if they suffer a miscarriage. Politicians are advocating for abortion to be declared homicide. 
    
            Meanwhile, people who use the drug Methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain. The medication can induce miscarriage. Pharmacists fear that under post-Dobbs laws, they can be prosecuted for dispensing it.   
    
            The current landscape is especially disheartening for women of my generation and terrifying for women of childbearing age. But it’s also important to remember that the Roe decision of 1973 happened in a context of a wider societal expansion of women’s rights – and that the fight isn’t over. 
    
            In the 1970s, women were demanding equal access to male-dominated professions, an end to discrimination in education and, above everything, fairness from the law. In those years, I remember feeling that for women, it was a completely new chapter.    
    
            What Roe did was enable women to decide if and when they’d have children. That made the progress in work, education and personal relationships possible. It’s not a coincidence that recent research shows that women living in states with abortion bans contend with greater economic insecurity. 
    
            Does the Dobbs decision mean that the era of gender progress is now over? Not necessarily. Since Dobbs, state legislators, particularly in red states, have been falling over each other to enact new laws restricting access. But these moves are unpopular—especially with the millions of Americans who’ve benefited from legal abortion.  
    
            In five states, voters have defeated anti-abortion initiatives on the ballot.  
    
            This past November, the US Senate stayed Democratic, in part because of voter anger about abortion restrictions.    
    
            On a less formal level, as in the past, Americans are finding creative ways to circumvent the new limitations. In Texas, where a plethora of draconian laws have been enacted, many women are now going to Mexico for their gynecological care. In blue states, clinics have expanded to accommodate women from neighboring jurisdictions seeking abortions.  
    
            Of course, travel takes money. Many of the most restrictive states are among the poorest—Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma. NGOs like The Brigid Alliance and local pro-abortion funds provide travel expenses for women in need, but they can’t possibly meet the demand. Yet, they are an indispensable lifeline for as many as they are able to help – as is the corporate support available for some workers to travel out of state for abortions.
    
            As the fight continues, supporters of reproductive rights shouldn’t underestimate the determination of the anti-abortion community. Fifty years ago, they vowed to undo Roe v. Wade. For a half century, they marched and lobbied and saw to it that sympathetic conservatives were appointed to the Supreme Court.  
    
            And so, after decades of persistent work, their efforts bore fruit on June 24, 2022, when Justice Samuel Alito, writing on behalf of the six conservatives on the high court, opined, “we hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.” Writing for the seven-justice majority 50 years ago in Roe v. Wade, Justice Harry Blackmun found that the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides a fundamental “right to privacy” that protects the liberty of pregnant individuals to abort. 
    
            In the pro-choice moment from which Roe emerged, few thought that what happened in Dobbs could ever occur.  
    
            As a journalist, I try to avoid taking partisan positions. However, this issue is personal. I’m still haunted by that trip to Pennsylvania and how frightened I was. Today I have students and friends who are just beginning to move into their promising futures. It hurts to think that they might experience the same suffering that was so routine for my cohort.

      Prosecutors say Brian Walshe searched online for, ‘Can you be charged with murder without a body?’ The law says you can
    ","

    ","
            Ana Walshe – a Massachusetts mother of three who hasn’t been seen since the new year – is still missing, even as her husband was charged this week with her murder.
    
            Getting a murder conviction without a body may seem next to impossible. But with strong evidence – as prosecutors have argued they have against Brian Walshe – it’s not that rare, legal experts told CNN. 
    
            Some 86% of more than 500 so-called “no-body murder cases” that made it to trial from the 1800s to 2020 resulted in convictions, said Tad DiBiase, a former Assistant US Attorney for the District of Columbia who’s tracked such cases for years.
    
            Among them is a former New York City plastic surgeon serving life in prison after killing his wife and dumping her body from a plane. A mother and son also were convicted of murdering a Manhattan socialite whose body never was found. And a jury last year convicted a man of murdering Kristin Smart, whose body hasn’t been seen since she went missing in 1996.
    
            “Among prosecutors, the old adage was: no body, no murder. You had to have a body to prove that someone was actually killed. That has changed a lot over the years,” CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller told “CNN Tonight.”
    
            “We know this can be done. And in (the Walshe) case, with DNA, blood evidence, cell phone, you know, E-ZPass, all of the things that string together for circumstantial evidence that didn’t exist just a short while ago, it’s not what defense lawyers used to have the advantage on.”
    
            Walshe, 47, has pleaded not guilty in state court to charges of murder and disinterring a body without authority, as well as misleading investigators who were searching for his wife, for which he was jailed January 8. He is being held without bail.
    
            “It is easy to charge a crime and even easier to say a person committed that crime. It is a much more difficult thing to prove it, which we will see if the prosecution can do,” his defense attorney Tracy Miner said Wednesday in a statement.
    
            “We shall see what they have and what evidence is admissible in court, where the case will ultimately be decided.”
    
            Corpus delicti – Latin for “body of the crime” and a common American law principle – holds that sufficient evidence a crime occurred must be shown before someone can be convicted of it. 
    
            But that doesn’t necessarily mean a physical body, DiBiase said.
    
            A murder conviction without a body can be relatively easy to prove when “circumstantial evidence is overwhelming,” criminologist Casey Jordan told “CNN Newsroom” on Wednesday.
    
            And it seems to be in the Walshe case, she added.
    
            A central example may be a key question Googled by Brian Walshe just days after he said he last saw his wife – “Can you be charged with murder without a body?” – according to prosecutors who cited his online browsing history.
    
            Indeed, in the days after 39-year-old Ana Walshe’s disappearance, Brian Walshe allegedly made a series of Google searches: “dismemberment and the best ways to dispose of a body,” “hacksaw best tool to dismember” and “can you identify a body with broken teeth,” according to prosecutors, including Lynn Beland on Wednesday in court.
    
            Brian Walshe’s phone data also shows he traveled to apartment complexes in nearby towns, where prosecutors accuse him of disposing of evidence in dumpsters, they’ve said. Surveillance video from two complexes shows his Volvo and a figure fitting his description throwing bags into the dumpsters, Beland alleged.
    
            Ten trash bags of evidence found at a garbage collection station contained apparent blood stains, a hacksaw, hatchet, towels, rags, gloves, a heavily stained rug and a full-body hazmat suit, Beland said. In the bags, investigators also found Ana Walshe’s Covid-19 vaccination card, a Prada purse she carried and part of a necklace consistent with one she can be seen wearing in photos, she said.
    
            DNA from Ana and Brian Walshe was found on some bloody items in the bags, she said.
    
            A search of the couple’s home uncovered blood stains and a bloody knife in the basement, prosecutors have alleged. And blood was found in Brian Walshe’s car, Beland said.
    
            Prosecutors also have listed items Brian Walshe allegedly bought that they believe are tied to his wife’s killing. At a Home Depot on January 2, Walshe wore a face mask and rubber gloves as he bought mops, brushes, tape, a Tyvek hazmat suit with boot covers, buckets, baking soda and a hatchet, they’ve said. 
    
            No-body murder cases typically don’t feature witnesses but have at least one of three key types of evidence, said DiBiase, who in 2006 prosecuted the second such case in Washington, DC, according to a news release from that federal prosecutor’s office. 
    
            The types, he said, are:
    
            • Forensic evidence – the gold standard and most common – can be DNA from blood or hair fibers or cell records placing a person in a particular place.
    
            • Specific evidence can include a defendant’s confession to friends and relatives or simply their retelling to someone of the crime. 
    
            • Confessions to law enforcement usually come when a criminal’s conscience overwhelms them.
    
            The law treats confessions to friends and family very differently than confessions to law enforcement, DiBiase said, because police must advise a suspect of their rights before getting a statement, whereas friends and family don’t have to. 
    
            Confessions to people who aren’t police – including jailhouse informants – also typically not recorded or written down, while most police confessions are, he said.
    
            In the Walshe case, prosecutors have not obtained a confession, but what they’ve said so far offers “a map of forensic evidence and placing Brian Walshe in the locations where that forensic evidence was found,” defense attorney Misty Marris told “CNN Newsroom” on Wednesday. 
    
            “This all under the guise of those very, very damaging social media searches that really was that blueprint of his actions, according to prosecutors,” she said. “This really put the puzzle together to show the story, which is what was needed in a circumstantial evidence case to establish probable cause.” 
    
            Over time, the notion a body is needed prove someone was killed has changed a lot, Miller said.
    
            It wasn’t until nearly 40 years after the infamous disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz that prosecutors in 2017 – using the suspect’s own words to investigators and mental health experts – secured a murder conviction. The case lacked forensic evidence tying the suspect to the crime, and Patz’s body was never found.
    
            To convict Smart’s killer some 26 years after she vanished, prosecutors relied on soil samples from the suspect’s father’s home that tested positive for human blood, photos of the suspect’s dorm room and the detail that cadaver dogs had been alerted to the smell of human remains while searching the building, CNN affiliate KSBY reported.
    
            And a New York City plastic surgeon was convicted in 2000 based entirely on circumstantial evidence – with no forensics or eye witnesses – of killing his wife, Gail Katz, whose body was never found, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The widower was serving to up life prison sentence when he made a chilling confession to the crime during a 2020 parole board hearing.

      Anti-abortion activists attend first March for Life ‘with fresh resolve’ post-Roe
    ","
			By Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN

        4:26 PM EST, Fri January 20, 2023
    ","
            Anti-abortion advocates from across the country gathered in Washington, DC, on Friday for the annual March for Life – the first since the Supreme Court’s conservative majority ended the federal constitutional right to an abortion.
    
            This year’s march marks a turn in the fight against abortion rights, with opponents’ primary goal of overturning Roe v. Wade met and half of all states having banned or restricted access to abortion in most cases. But anti-abortion advocates contend that their work isn’t finished as they aim to advance legislation that restricts abortion at the state and federal levels, including setting a minimum federal standard on the procedure.
    
            “The pro-life movement has just experienced a major victory in the fall of Roe v. Wade, but our work to build a culture of life is far from complete,” Jeanne Mancini, the head of March for Life’s Education and Defense Fund, told CNN via email before the march, the theme of which was “Next Steps: Marching Forward into a Post-Roe America.”
    
            Mancini said the march represented a time to “reflect upon the Dobbs decision as a critical milestone” – a reference to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case that led to Roe’s reversal – as well as “a time to look forward to the next steps.” 
    
            Attendees at Friday’s rally who spoke with CNN expressed excitement but noted that more work needed to be done to stop abortions, help mothers and change the culture around the issue. 
    
            “What we’re here to do is say, ‘We’re not done. We have more progress that needs to be made on this issue,’” said William Herb, 24, a Catholic school teacher from New York. 
    
            “That’s still a fight that we need to continue with, that’s something that we still need to persuade large portions of America that that’s not something that’s acceptable. This isn’t something that’s OK,” he said.
    
            Justin Rino and Hallie Gift, 18-year-olds who were among the students from Liberty University leading off the march, told CNN that it was “necessary” as Christians to make their voices heard.
    
            “There are still states that legalize abortion. This is only the first part. Overturning Roe v. Wade wasn’t the last victory,” Rino said. “So, yes, we can celebrate that Roe v. Wade was overturned, but there’s still a lot more work that needs to be done before we can celebrate.”
    
            Attendees traveled from all over the US for the march, like Julz Savard, a first-time rallygoer from California who was representing the Colorado-based organization Save the Storks, which partners with pregnancy centers.
    
            “I’m so elated. I’m on the edge of tears because, you know, sometimes you feel like you’re fighting this fight alone,” Savard said.
    
            Friday’s rally began at noon and featured speakers including Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, former NFL coach Tony Dungy and Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, who won the case that resulted in the overturning of Roe.
    
            Scalise – with Republican Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana, Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, Andy Harris of Maryland, Michelle Fischbach of Minnesota, Mary Miller of Illinois and Chris Smith of New Jersey standing behind him – called the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade a “huge victory.” 
    
            “That’s only the end of the first phase of this battle. The next phase now begins, and that’s what this year’s march is all about, the next steps in a post-Roe era,” the Louisiana Republican said, telling rallygoers to urge their senators to support legislation known as the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.
    
            Smith, a co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, said that the House “in the coming weeks” would be voting on another anti-abortion bill, entitled the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, that he sponsored and introduced in the chamber earlier this month.
    
            Ahead of Friday’s march, National Right to Life Committee President Carol Tobias said that while she anticipated “a celebration” among those gathered, activists were “realistic.” 
    
            “We will protect unborn children and their moms through the law where we can and, where we can’t, we will work through educational efforts and resources to make abortion unthinkable,” she said.
    
            Leading anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said this week it was focused on pushing “strong pro-life protections” in Florida, Nebraska, Virginia and North Carolina this legislative session.
    
            “How we figure out what our goal is, our legislative goal in each state, is to ask the question: What is the most ambitious we can be, truly ambitious, for life and for moms, and when?” the group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, told reporters in a press call.
    
            She acknowledged that there’s “very little that can be done at this particular moment” on the federal level given that Democrats hold the White House and the Senate and noted that Congress is unlikely to set a federal minimum standard on abortion this session.
    
            Still, she said the movement is “building momentum.”
    
            “This year, we march with fresh resolve as a brand-new pro-life movement,” Dannenfelser said, adding, “This is week one and the very beginning of a new life for a new movement – a moment of innovation, a moment of excitement, and a moment where we are building momentum.”
    
            The first March for Life in January 1974 was organized to lobby Congress in hopes of a legislative solution to the court’s landmark Roe decision handed down a year earlier. Realizing that such a solution would take time, founder Nellie Gray vowed to hold the march each year until the court’s decision was overturned, with its route came to typically ending on the steps of the Supreme Court.
    
            This year, the route will end at the US Capitol “to symbolize that the battle post-Roe has shifted to the legislature,” Mancini told CNN before the march.
    
            Outside the legislative push, Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said the march provided a chance for activists to network and strategize about how they can further expand abortion restrictions.
    
            March for Life plans to continue its annual march in DC and expand its state program so that they’re marching in as many as 10 states this year, according to Mancini.
    
            The group is also encouraging marchers to “support the pregnancy resource centers and maternity homes which are the hands and feet of the pro-life movement, providing support and resources to women in need who want to choose life, and we advocate for public policy that would aid them in their mission to offer women authentic choice,” Mancini said.

      Opinion: What the FDA’s moves on abortion pills mean for the future
    ","
			Opinion by Mary Ziegler and Aziza Ahmed

    ","
            This month, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that retail pharmacies will be able to sell the abortion pill mifepristone for the first time. 
    
            The move — which will allow pharmacies to request certification to offer the pill and then fill valid prescriptions for it — is part of the Biden administration’s effort to address the erasure of abortion rights in many areas of the US. 
    
            As a White House statement put it this summer, the goal is “to identify all ways to ensure that mifepristone is as widely accessible as possible”. 
    
            Since then, the FDA and the administration as a whole have faced pressure to expand access to abortion medication — or even contend that state laws criminalizing the pills are preempted by the FDA’s approval of them.  
    
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists hailed the FDA’s move to widen access to mifepristone as “an important step” in expanding access. And already, two of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, have announced that they will seek certification to distribute the pills. 
    
            But this question must be asked and answered: Will the FDA’s decision to allow pharmacies to dispense the abortion pill make a tangible difference?
    
            While the move sends an important signal that the administration is supportive of increasing access to abortion pills, the reality is much more complicated.  A person seeking abortion medication would still require a prescription from a physician in order to access the pills. 
    
            For some women, especially those in states with complete or nearly complete abortion bans, it will still be illegal to mail abortion pills or to fill prescriptions for them (CVS and Walgreens have noted that they will only keep certification to dispense the pills in states where it’s legally allowed). For the women who need it most, the rule change does little.  
    
            So, the FDA’s announcement may not be as transformational as the Biden administration would have us think, but it does deliver a potent reminder of the stakes of the 2024 election: Who sits in the White House may, in part, decide the fate of abortion pills. 
    
            While it’s true that the White House may not be able to ensure abortion access in states with criminal bans, a Republican president just might be able to make sure that abortion pills are unavailable in places where abortion is legal — or even a protected right.  
    
            The abortion issue seems to have been costly for Republicans during the midterm, and it may make sense for them to proceed cautiously, even after 2024. Within the GOP, many, including former President Donald Trump, have blamed the Republican stance on abortion for the GOP’s poor showing in the midterm. 
    
            When majority leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana unveiled House Republicans’ priorities, his proposals on abortion were strikingly unambitious. And some anti-abortion groups are promoting more elaborate proposals, such as an executive order recognizing fetal personhood, but a Republican president might not need to go that far. One reason for that is the Comstock Act, a federal obscenity law passed in the 19th century. 
    
            Part of the Comstock Act, which was once best known for suppressing literature, sex education materials and even anatomy texts deemed to be obscene, seems to make it illegal to send via mail “[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” 
    
            Under Biden, the Department of Justice recently released a definitive memo suggesting that mailing abortion pills is perfectly legal unless it is done with the intent of violating the law. But in a Republican administration, the DOJ could interpret the Comstock Act to apply to the mailing of every abortion pill and decide to aggressively enforce the law against those thought to violate it.  
    
            Despite the current DOJ’s interpretation of the law, anti-abortion groups are supporting local laws and bringing lawsuits suggesting that abortion pills are functionally illegal nationwide because of the Comstock Act. And neither telehealth nor in-clinic medication abortions would be possible if pills could not be mailed. 
    
            For the moment, this argument is doomed, but anti-abortion activists might not care. Their argument could succeed before a Supreme Court already transformed by one Republican president. Or a Republican DOJ in a future administration could change course.
    
            Control of the FDA can be as much of a gamechanger as power over the DOJ.   This has been true since the early days of abortion drugs’ approval in the United States, and the FDA now returns to center stage as more women and providers need access to medication abortions.  
    
            Meanwhile, anti-choice groups are getting creative in approaching the agency. Students for Life, a major anti-abortion group, has a petition before the FDA asking the agency to require any doctor prescribing abortion pills to be responsible for fetal remains — and to bag them and treat them as medical waste.  
    
            If Students for Life won, the new FDA rule could create insurmountable obstacles for abortion providers, who would have to monitor and dispose of medical waste in every procedure, including those done through telehealth. 
    
            The Alliance Defending Freedom, another major player in the anti-abortion movement, already went to court to ask federal judges to declare that the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved abortion pills. 
    
            Even a long shot may seem worth a try with the current ultraconservative Supreme Court, and besides, with a Republican in the White House, the FDA may change radically. 
    
            In 2020, a group of Republicans, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, sent a letter to the FDA asking that abortion pills be pulled from the market. With a Republican in the White House, they just might get their wish.
    
            So, the latest FDA announcement may be much ado about relatively little. As far as access to abortion pills is concerned, this move must be contextualized withing the web of legal action, both at the state and federal level, which will continue to determine who can access abortion resources and who cannot. But in a different administration, both the DOJ and FDA might target abortion pills, and that means your vote for who sits in the White House matters more than you think.

      Activists preparing for ‘an absolutely crazy year’ in first full statehouse sessions since Supreme Court overturned Roe

            Restricting abortion is at the top of the to-do list for many Republicans around the country as state legislatures gavel in for their first full session since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.   
    
            “We’re definitely preparing for an absolutely crazy year,” said Ingrid Duran, the director of state legislation for the anti-abortion group National Right to Life Committee. Her group has tracked more than 200 bills related to abortion in the last year, and she expects that number to skyrocket. 
    
            “We can see maybe a 100% increase in states on both sides of the issue,” Duran said.
    
            Wyoming Republican state Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams introduced a full abortion ban this week, with no exceptions for rape or incest. 
    
            The bill would ban all abortions – including medication abortion – except to save the life of the mother.  It would also make performing an abortion a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $20,000 fine, though it specifically exempts women who have an abortion from being prosecuted. The bill also would allow women to sue providers who have performed an abortion on them.   
    
            “Every child’s life is of equal worth, no matter how they were conceived,” Rodriguez-Williams told CNN.    
    
            “The people of Wyoming, through their elected representatives, have made clear that they believe life is a human right and that women deserve real support,” Rodriguez-Williams added. “My colleagues and I want to preserve the lives of the most vulnerable, while ensuring that women have real support.” 
    
            Wyoming tried to ban abortion last year – Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a trigger law set to take effect when the Supreme Court overturned Roe, but state courts have since blocked the ban. 
    
            The latest Wyoming bill is partly a result of a push from the anti-abortion lobbying group Americans United for Life. According to its general counsel Steven Aden, AUL provided the template for the Rodriguez-Williams bill, and Aden says more states are considering introducing similar legislation, though he would not disclose specifically which states. 
    
            “We expect the interest to begin to snowball as we go forward into the spring legislative sessions,” Aden said. AUL has already doubled the size of its staff since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that overturned Roe came down last June. 
    
            Even more lawmakers in Republican-led states are expected to make a big push to limit abortion rights in the months ahead, since legislatures had limited time to act last summer. By the time the Supreme Court overruled Roe, nearly every state had already wrapped up its legislative session for the year, making it almost impossible for lawmakers to respond with legislation in the immediate wake of the ruling.   
    
            “It feels like we’re really entering into a period of experimentation when it comes to the types of legislation we’re going to be seeing,” said Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state action on abortion for the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research group. “Once they ban abortion and they’re still seeing people accessing medication abortion, the question becomes, ‘how can we limit access to medication abortion?’ They’re trying to build up a mountain of barriers for someone getting an abortion.” 
    
            Twenty-two states are now solidly controlled by Republicans – meaning they have majorities in their state legislature and control the governor’s office. Seventeen states are all blue – meaning Democrats control the state legislature and governor’s office.   
    
            The split is highlighting a stark contrast in priorities: Republican-led states are leading their new sessions pushing bills that limit, or even eliminate, the right to abortions; Democratic-led states like Michigan are putting greater protections in place for women.  
    
            Advocates watching this year’s sessions unfold are keeping a keen eye on four states in particular: Virginia, Nebraska, North Carolina and Florida, said Katie Glenn, the state policy director at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.  
    
            Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin asked the state’s lawmakers to “choose life” in his State of the Commonwealth address delivered last week on the first day of the state’s legislative session.   
    
            “As we embark on the next 46 days, when it comes to unborn children, we can come together,” Youngkin said, laying out his proposal to ban abortion after 15 weeks in the state. “It is clear, Virginians want fewer abortions, not more.” 
    
            Under current law, Virginia allows abortions during the first two trimesters, up until about 26 weeks, and only allows the procedure in the third trimester if three doctors certify the mother’s life or health are in serious jeopardy.  
    
            But the 15-week abortion ban, and other calls to ban abortion outright in the state, will face an uphill battle given the split in control at the legislative level: Democrats control the state Senate and Republicans control the House of Delegates. This week, for instance, Democrats passed the Contraceptive Equity Act out of a Senate committee. The bill would require insurance companies to cover the price of birth control without cost sharing.
    
            Nebraska Republicans introduced the Nebraska Heartbeat Act this week – a bill that would ban abortions around six weeks, when embryonic cardiac activity is detected. The ban would provide exceptions for medical emergencies, and would not apply in cases of rape or incest.
    
            The state’s lawmakers failed to approve a trigger law that would have automatically banned abortion after the Dobbs decision last summer, but Glenn said the state’s new anti-abortion governor is likely providing the greatest impetus for this latest attempt to restrict abortion.  
    
            “There is a definitely a lot of political will and interest in passing more protective laws,” Glenn said.    
    
            Nebraska currently allows abortions up until 20 weeks, but Gov. Jim Pillen said during his campaign that completely banning abortion in the state would be a “top priority” of his administration and he vowed to do everything in his power to protect the unborn.  
    
            In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the state’s 15-week abortion ban into law in April, but lawmakers there are saying they’re ready to go further.    
    
            Republicans won supermajorities in Florida’s legislature in the midterms, and state Senate President Kathleen Passidomo told reporters there will be an avalanche of bills filed to restrict abortion even more. Passidomo is already advocating support for a 12-week ban with exceptions for victims of rape and incest, citing the fact that 80% of all abortions in the states are performed in the first 12 weeks.   
    
            The leaders of North Carolina’s House and Senate promised greater abortion restrictions even before Republicans secured majorities in the midterms.    
    
            In a statement released after the Dobbs decision in June, state House Speaker Tim Moore said, “North Carolinians can also expect pro-life protections to be a top priority of the legislature when we return to our normal legislative session in January.” State Senate Leader Phil Berger echoed the sentiment with his own statement, saying he remained “committed to the right to life and protecting the unborn.”   
    
            But lacking a veto-proof majority in the North Carolina House, GOP efforts to further restrict the procedure will likely be undermined by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who has previously said he’ll use his veto power to preserve existing protections in the state, which currently allows abortions up until 20 weeks.   
    
            The first effort to push the envelope could unfold in South Carolina, where the state’s Supreme Court recently ruled that the state’s six-week abortion ban violated the state Constitution. The ban is struck down, and since it can’t be appealed to the US Supreme Court because it doesn’t involve federal law, the only option is for state lawmakers to draft a new law. South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Kaye Hearn wrote the majority opinion, which left the door open for future restrictions as long as the “time frames imposed … afford a woman sufficient time to determine she is pregnant and to take reasonable steps to terminate that pregnancy.”   
    
            Republicans responded immediately, promising they’d go back to the drawing board to draft new abortion restrictions that might pass muster if they’re challenged up to the state’s Supreme Court again. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster promised he would “work with the General Assembly to correct this error,” and state Attorney General Alan Wilson noted his office would work with the “Governor’s office and legislature to review all our available options moving forward.”  
    
            Democrats aren’t standing by. While Republicans are introducing abortion restrictions or even all-out bans, Democrats are looking for ways to bolster protections for women, and in some cases protect abortion in the long-term. 
    
            Michigan Democrats – who now control the governor’s office and the state legislature for the first time in four decades – are emboldened after big wins in November, and the approval from voters of a ballot proposal that enshrined abortion rights in the state’s constitution.   
    
            Michigan state Senate Leader Winnie Brinks told CNN one of the first priorities will be to repeal a 1931 abortion ban that has long been on the books but was put back in play after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. A state court blocked the law in September, but Democrats are still looking to fully repeal it this session.   
    
            “We’re definitely going to take that law off the books,” Brinks said. “It’ll be early in our session.”   
    
            In Maryland – which Democrats completely control after increasing their supermajority and electing a Democratic governor – lawmakers are also working to shore up protections for the procedure.    
    
            Maryland House Speaker Adrienne Jones wants to enshrine the right to abortion into the state constitution – she plans to reintroduce a bill that would put a constitutional amendment question on the ballot in 2024.   
    
            “Body autonomy should never be up for debate,” Jones told CNN. “This year, we’re passing legislation guaranteeing that women’s reproductive health care is never bargained for and that abortion providers and patients are protected. Maryland will be a safe haven for reproductive liberty.”

      Alabama police identify remains of ‘Baby Jane Doe’ found in 2012 and charge her father with murder

        3:53 AM EST, Fri January 20, 2023
    ","
            Police in Opelika, Alabama, have arrested and charged the father of a young girl who investigators have affectionately known as “Baby Jane Doe” since her unidentified remains were found in 2012, authorities announced Thursday.
    
            Lamar Vickerstaff, Jr., 50, was arrested Tuesday and charged with murder in the death of his daughter, Amore Joveah Wiggins, who would have been about 6 years old when she died, the Opelika Police Department said in a news release. 
    
            Vickerstaff’s wife, Ruth Vickerstaff, was also arrested and charged with failure to report a missing child, police said. 
    
            CNN has yet to determine if either has an attorney.
    
            Investigators have been trying to identify Amore’s remains since they were found at a trailer park in January 2012, police said. A skull was found in the yard of a residence and most of the bones were found in woods nearby, the release said. Police also found a pink shirt and a small lock of curly hair. 
    
            The remains were sent to an FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where examiners determined they belonged to a Black girl between the ages of 4-7, police said. Investigators believe she was killed between the summer of 2010 to 2011, the release said. 
    
            An autopsy revealed the child had suffered more than 15 fractures to her skull, arms, legs, shoulders and ribs, all attributed to blunt force trauma, the release said. The injuries all showed signs of healing and police said they occurred sometime prior to her death. A medical examiner also concluded she may have been malnourished and blind in her left eye due to a fractured eye socket, according to police.
    
            In October, with the help of DNA genealogy, investigators were able to identify Lamar Vickerstaff as Baby Jane Doe’s father, police said. 
    
            When investigators visited the Vickerstaffs’ home in Jacksonville, Florida, to notify the father of her death, the father did not provide them with the child’s name or information about her identity, police said. Ruth Vickerstaff, who has been married to Lamar since 2006, also told police she never knew the child and did not know who her mother could be, according to the release.
    
            In December, investigators narrowed down possible matches for the girl’s mother to Sherry Wiggins, who confirmed she gave birth to the child in January 2006 and named her Amore Joveah Wiggins, the release said. She also said the Vickerstaffs obtained sole custody of Amore in 2009, it said.
    
            After reaching out to schools and pediatric clinics in several states where the Vickerstaffs have lived, detectives learned that Amore had never been enrolled in school or reported missing, police said. 
    
            Lamar and Ruth Vickerstaff were arrested in Jacksonville on Tuesday and are being held at the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office pending extradition back to Alabama, the release said. 
    
            The investigation is still ongoing and police have asked the public to come forward with any information about the Vickerstaffs’ relationship with Amore or her time spent in Opelika.

      Trump struggles with the new politics of abortion as a triumphant March for Life arrives in Washington
    ","
			Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN
		;Stephen Collinson","
  Published
        12:04 AM EST, Fri January 20, 2023
    ","
            The anti-abortion “March for Life” for decades demonstrated to Republicans that they could not reach the Oval Office without the support of the anti-abortion movement.
    
            On Friday, marchers will gather in Washington with a decades-long mission accomplished, after the Supreme Court’s removal of a constitutional right to an abortion by overturning the Roe v. Wade decision last year.
    
            That means this year’s march will be a time for celebration but also of debate about where the movement goes next with some campaigners seeking to restrict the procedure everywhere. But such a refocused goal carries big risks. Democrats after all belatedly leveraged their own energy over abortion in the midterm elections in a backlash against the right-wing Supreme Court majority that helped stave off a big Republican midterm election wave.
    
            The March for Life also comes at an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump, the president who did more than any other to end Roe after a pact with social conservative voters that helped win him the 2016 GOP nomination, has launched an extraordinary attack on evangelical leaders he sees as insufficiently loyal, as CNN’s Gabby Orr, Kristen Holmes and Kaitlan Collins reported this week.
    
            “Nobody has ever done more for Right to Life than Donald Trump. I put three Supreme Court justices, who all voted, and they got something that they’ve been fighting for 64 years, for many, many years,” Trump said in an interview on Real America’s Voice Monday, referring to the overturning of federal abortion rights.
    
            “There’s great disloyalty in the world of politics and that’s a sign of disloyalty,” Trump told conservative journalist David Brody.
    
            The comment was a window into Trump’s psychology, revealing his transactional understanding of politics and his highly developed sense of fealty he sees owed to him.
    
            The former president is specifically angry over the failure to immediately endorse his 2024 White House bid by some evangelical leaders who remain influential figures in the conservative movement. Trump’s third White House run has so far failed to pick up significant energy.
    
            But Trump has also shown signs recently of questioning whether his purported greatest domestic achievement – the building of a generational conservative Supreme Court majority and its subsequent overturning of Roe – may end up hindering his hopes of a return to the White House in 2025. He wrote on his Truth Social platform earlier this month that the “abortion issue” had been poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those who insisted on no exceptions in the case or rape, incest or life of the mother, which he said “lost large numbers of voters.” 
    
            The former president’s comments are backed by exit polls from November’s midterms that showed more than a quarter of voters listing abortion as a top issue. About 61% said they were unhappy with the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, and about 7 in 10 of those voters backed a Democratic House candidate.
    
            In his Truth Social comments, Trump appeared to be seeking to offload blame for the Republicans’ failure to win back the Senate and the party’s smaller-than-expected House majority. Trump took on waves of criticism after the election for promoting extreme, election denying candidates who often lost in swing states in the midterm elections.
    
            But it is notable seeing Trump navigate the shifting politics of abortion and apparently sizing up how it could affect his political prospects in future. After all, he was once unapologetically pro-choice before his foray into Republican politics dictated a shift in position and led to the bargain with evangelicals, which included an effective commitment to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court in return for the crucial votes of social conservatives.
    
            In the past, Trump has been a fixture of the March for Life rally, and in 2020, he became the first sitting president to attend in person as he geared up for his reelection race. He told marchers that “unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.” 
    
            There is no sign yet that he will call into Friday’s event, which will include a detour to the US Capitol on its usual route to the Supreme Court to underline how Congress is now a focus of the movement, as Democrats seek to codify Roe v. Wade protections into law.
    
            Trump’s comments on abortion and his feuding with evangelical leaders raise the question of whether the former president has made a tactical error and is harming his 2024 candidacy by targeting a critical GOP primary voting bloc at a time when there are growing questions over whether he is still the dominant force in Republican politics. 
    
            Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, told CNN that there is “no path to the nomination without winning the evangelical vote. Nobody knows that better than President Trump because, to the surprise of almost everyone, he won their support in 2016.”
    
            This question is especially acute in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucuses – for Republicans at least – in the 2024 primary season, which will be the first test of the ex-President’s hold over conservatives and evangelicals especially.
    
            Trump didn’t actually win in Iowa in 2016, coming second to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and just beating out Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and the state has often not been a true barometer of how the GOP nominating contest will go.
    
            However, it will take on extra significance in 2024 and is likely to be seen as a strong indicator of Trump’s appeal to the conservative base. A loss there would create a painful narrative as he headed into subsequent contests – especially since he strongly carried the state in the general elections in 2016 and 2020. 
    
            And it’s easy to come up with a list of potential GOP candidates that might have appeal in the state if they challenge Trump, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, former Vice President Mike Pence or Cruz once again. Only Trump so far is a declared 2024 Republican presidential candidate.
    
            Trump would be in an odd situation in 2024, in that he is in many ways effectively an incumbent given his strong support in the GOP and the fact that he didn’t go away after losing reelection. But at the same time, he’s not a sitting president and looks likely to face a contested primary and so may be more exposed in early contests.
    
            Still, while some conservative base voters might want to move on, there’s still strong goodwill among many toward Trump, gratitude for the change he brought during his term and admiration for his attitude.
    
            “Many people forgave him for his misstatements and his missteps because they generally liked his ability to fight, even if that became a cliché for some people, Trump’s detractors,” said Timothy Hagle, an associate professor of political science at the University of Iowa who is an expert on the state’s politics.
    
            This gets to point often missed about Trump. For many of his supporters, he offered an emotional as much as a political connection. His willingness to say what many grassroots conservatives thought and to assail institutions they despised, like the media or Washington experts and other elites, were as important as many of his often-ill-defined individual political positions. 
    
            And it’s also often forgotten that evangelical voters in places like Iowa do not necessarily vote as a bloc, or according to what their leaders or pastors recommend and may prioritize issues such as taxes over social questions if a candidate is deemed to be generally acceptable. That may give Trump more leeway than more conventional candidates in departing from traditional conservative orthodoxy even over abortion.
    
            Still, Hagle said, even small numbers of disaffected Iowa voters could make a difference to Trump’s chances in the state if they don’t show up for him, as could more mainstream GOP caucus voters who may be taking a look at other aspects of his candidacy and those of potential rivals.
    
            “Are they going to support Trump because he fights, or because of his economic position or his position on the border?” Hagle said. “The abortion stuff may not be as important to them, or will they go a different direction at this point?”

            Ireland Baldwin is getting candid about the difficulties she’s facing during her pregnancy.
    
            The daughter of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger posted a lengthy note on her verified Instagram account on Wednesday about her experience. 
    
            “Pregnancy is hard,” the expectant mother wrote. “It takes so much out of you. I wasn’t ready for that.”
    
            Baldwin, 27, is expecting her first child with her boyfriend, musician RAC, with whom she lives with and owns a business in Gearhart, Oregon. 
    
            In her note, Baldwin wrote that she “grew up with a very jaded perception of what love really looked like” and touched on the difficulties of being away from family during this time.
    
            “It’s hard not being really close to family to begin with because they live far or are idiots that I want nothing to do with,” Baldwin wrote. “It’s hard seeing other people go through this and have their parents close by.”
    
            She praised her boyfriend, writing that without him, she feels like she would have “lost my mind.”
    
            Baldwin ended her post with encouragement for others.
    
            “All of this is still worth it but its ok to admit how hard and scary it can all be,” she wrote. “You are not alone.”

      New York City starts offering free abortion pills at sexual health clinics

    ","
            New York City on Wednesday began providing free abortion pills at a city-run sexual health clinic in the Bronx. 
    
            The city already offers medication abortions at its 11 public hospitals, but the new program will eventually expand access to four public health clinics and provide an avenue to the procedure at no cost to patients.
    
            Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, announced the program at a City Hall news conference on Tuesday, in which he hailed an endeavor that “no other city in the nation or in the world” has undertaken via its public health department providing medication abortions.
    
            “We are the first,” Adams said.
    
            Clinics in Queens, Harlem and Brooklyn will offer the pills by the end of the year, the city said.
    
            The pills at the clinics will be provided to patients at no cost and are being funded as part of a $1.2 million package for sexual health services, according to the city’s Department of Health.
    
            Ashwin Vasan, the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene commissioner, said that once the four public health clinics are up and running, they will be able to provide up to 10,000 medication abortions annually in addition to the medication abortions its public hospitals already offer.
    
            Vasan also said the medication abortions would be “open to anyone” who needs them from in or out of New York City. The city currently provides abortion services to anyone regardless of immigration status.
    
            Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer New York City has launched several programs in recent months to help women access abortions.
    
            In August, Adams signed a package of six bills from the City Council known as the NYC Abortion Rights Act, which paved the way to make medication abortions free at Department of Health clinics.
    
            And in November, the city launched the first Abortion Access Hub in the country that confidentially connects women seeking abortions to abortion providers across the city. The hub is open to women from any state and also helps connect them with financial support services, transportation and lodging for the procedures, if needed.
    
            Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration allowed certified pharmacies to dispense the abortion medication mifepristone to people who have a prescription.
    
            Mifepristone can be used along with another medication, misoprostol, to end a pregnancy. Previously, these pills could be ordered, prescribed and dispensed only by a certified health-care provider. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA allowed the pills to be sent through the mail and said it would no longer enforce a rule requiring people to get the first of the two drugs in person at a clinic or hospital.

      Brian Walshe accused of killing and dismembering his wife Ana Walshe, prosecutors say

            Brian Walshe killed and dismembered his wife Ana Walshe and disposed of her remains in dumpsters because he wanted to end their marriage, a prosecutor with the Norfolk district attorney’s office said at his arraignment on Wednesday.
    
            “Rather than divorce, it is believed that Brian Walshe dismembered Ana Walshe and discarded her body,” prosecutor Lynn Beland said.
    
            In their criminal complaint prosecutors stated that Brian Walshe assaulted and beat his wife to death.
    
            Beland read aloud the allegations and suspected motive in Quincy District Court as Walshe, 47, was arraigned on charges of murder and disinterring a body without authority. He has been in jail since January 8, when he was arrested and charged with misleading investigators searching for his wife.
    
            The hearing was the first time that prosecutors definitively said Ana Walshe, the 39-year-old Massachusetts mother of three who has been missing since the new year, is believed to be dead. Prosecutors did not say whether they had found her remains.
    
            In court, Beland laid out some of the evidence that led to the charges, including the discovery of Ana Walshe’s belongings and blood in the garbage and Brian Walshe’s Google searches about dismemberment and disposing of dead bodies.
    
            Live updates: Brian Walshe arraigned on murder charge
    
            According to the prosecutor, surveillance video captured Brian Walshe tossing heavy bags into dumpsters in Abington and in Swampscott and cell phone data showed he visited a dumpster near his mother’s home in Swampscott.
    
            The bags in Abington had been destroyed by the time police located them, Beland said. However, the trash bags in Swampscott were discovered in a collection site in Peabody and contained blood stains, cleaning equipment, a hacksaw, a hatchet, boots and a Prada purse carried by Ana Walshe and her Covid-19 vaccination card, the prosecutor said.
    
            The state crime lab tested some of the bloody items in the bags and found DNA from Ana and Brian Walshe, Beland said.
    
            Further, in the days after her disappearance, Brian Walshe allegedly made a series of unsavory Google searches, including on his son’s iPad: “Ten ways to dispose of a dead body if you really need to,” “dismemberment and the best ways to dispose of a body,” “can you be charged with murder without a body,” and “can you identify a body with broken teeth,” according to the prosecutor.
    
            And on December 27, he had Google searched, “What’s the best state to divorce for a man?” 
    
            At arraignment, Brian Walshe shook his head once but did not otherwise react to the gruesome allegations. He spoke in court to say he acknowledged the charges, and a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf. He also has pleaded not guilty to the charge of misleading investigators.
    
            The judge ordered him held without bail. His next court date is February 9.
    
            In a statement, Brian Walshe’s defense attorney Tracy Miner said she would not comment on the case and suggested the evidence was not strong.
    
            “I am not going to comment on the evidence, first because I am going to try this case in the court and not in the media.  Second, because I haven’t been provided with any evidence by the prosecution. In my experience, where, as here, the prosecution leaks so-called evidence to the press before they provide it to me, their case isn’t that strong,” she said. 
    
            “When they have a strong case, they give me everything as soon as possible. We shall see what they have and what evidence is admissible in court, where the case will ultimately be decided.”
    
            The arraignment comes after a massive search for Ana Walshe since she was reported missing by her workplace on January 4.
    
            Since then, authorities have scoured the couple’s Cohasset home, performed a sweeping search of the town, and pored through dumpsters looking for any sign of what happened to her.
    
            Police found blood stains and a bloody, broken knife in the couple’s basement, prosecutors have said.
    
            Investigators have also accused Brian Walshe of intentionally delaying investigators to cover up evidence, alleging he lied about some of his actions in the days following his wife’s disappearance.
    
            He told police he last saw his wife the morning of January 1 when she left for a work trip to Washington, DC, according to a police affidavit. The husband said he spent the rest of the day running errands for his mother and spent time on January 2 with his kids. 
    
            However, prosecutors say there is no evidence Ana Walshe took her usual rideshare or taxi to the airport, or that she took a flight or arrived in Washington. Her phone also pinged near the couple’s home overnight on January 1 into January 2. 
    
            Additionally, investigators allege Brian Walshe did not run errands for his mother on New Year’s Day and say he took an undisclosed trip to Home Depot on January 2, where prosecutors say he spent about $450 on cleaning supplies, including mops, a bucket and tarps.
    
            On January 4, Ana Walshe’s employer, real estate company Tishman Speyer, called police to report her missing, according to investigators. A Cohasset police log says, “Company has contacted the husband. He has not filed a police report.” 
    
            Brian Walshe called his wife’s workplace before they reported her missing to say he hadn’t heard from his wife, defense attorney Miner has said.
    
            The charges against Brian Walshe in his wife’s disappearance are the latest in a string of legal troubles for the husband. 
    
            In 2021, he pleaded guilty to three federal fraud charges related to a scheme to sell fake Andy Warhol art online. He was placed under house arrest as he awaits sentencing and was required to get approval to leave his house for specific activities at specific times.
    
            Investigators allege Walshe took several unapproved trips the week after his wife disappeared that could be violations of the terms of his house arrest, a police affidavit says.
    
            Additionally, a police report obtained by CNN shows Ana Walshe reported someone threatened to “kill (her) and her friend” in 2014. Brian Walshe was the person involved in the report, a spokesperson for the Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department confirmed. 
    
            The case was closed because the victim refused to cooperate with the prosecution, police said. 
    
            In 2019, a relative and family friends also painted Walshe as a violent and untrustworthy person during a legal battle over his father’s estate. Two friends of Brian Walshe’s father accused Walshe of financial misconduct and said he is “a sociopath,” according to affidavits filed in the case.
    
            Ana Walshe’s friend and former colleague Pamela Bardhi felt rage and relief upon hearing investigators believe her friend was murdered, she told CNN.
    
            “I just had this horrible gut feeling and I prayed I was wrong,” she said Tuesday. “I prayed that it wasn’t the case. And here we are now finding out a few hours ago there’s a murder charge … That’s a heavy, heavy thing,” 
    
            Though Bardhi is terrified to learn the details in the case, she hopes the truth will emerge, she said.
    
            “I think that the truth is a real double-edged sword. It’s painful to know, but it’s necessary,” she said. “I think that those kids deserve to know what happened to their mother, no matter what, and her family and her friends.”
    
            The couple’s three children, between the ages of 2 and 6, are in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, a spokesperson said.
