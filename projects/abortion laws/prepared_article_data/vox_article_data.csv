"1",1,"Yes, Banning Abortion Reduces Abortion Rates","Stone","Lyman",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-05-20"," Does banning abortion actually reduce abortions? The answer seems obvious. Of course it does. But an undercurrent of left-leaning argument suggests otherwise, that banning abortions won’t reduce abortions, or at least not very much. The argument comes up a lot; it lurks in the background anytime a progressive says something like, “If you were really pro-life, you would support more welfare for families.” The implicit argument here is that banning abortion won’t save lives but that supporting progressive priorities will, or at least that progressive policies will save more lives.  Perhaps the most recent incarnation of this idea is from David Frum:  Hypothesis: a $500/month per child mother's allowance – not a tax credit, a check – would do more to reduce abortion than any law.
— David Frum (@davidfrum) May 15, 2019  So is this claim true? Would a $500-per-month check reduce abortion by more than, say, a ban? There’s a simple way to check what effect a change in abortion legality might have. For example, we could look at three example countries to see what happened when they changed their laws. For completeness’ sake, to the extent possible we’ll try to account for changes in stillbirth, miscarriage, or cross-border abortions, to really see the effect of abortion laws. I include miscarriages and stillbirths because it is possible, and many progressives claim, that abortions often affect children who would have died in the womb anyways. To the extent that increased abortions are offset by reduced stillbirths or miscarriages, abortion supporters would have a point. So wherever data can be found on those other forms of fetal death, I include it.  We’ll start with Poland. Poland Shows Abortion Laws Do Reduce Abortions Poland banned abortion from the 1920s until the 1950s when, under pressure from Soviet authorities, they legalized it. During the 1960s, the abortion policy became increasingly liberal, and Poland became a destination for “abortion tourism.” But then in the late 1980s, as Poland began to secure greater autonomy, incremental measures to reduce abortions began. Then in 1990 and 1993, after the fall of the U.S.S.R., a sweeping law banned abortion in all but a few cases. Since the early 1990s, fewer than a thousand legal abortions have been conducted there per year. But there are illegal abortions. Estimates of this vary. Progressive groups claim there are more than 150,000 abortions every year performed on Polish women illegally, informally, or abroad. Conservative groups, disagree, and say it’s something more like 5,000 to 20,000.  The graph below shows legal abortions and stillbirths as a share of reported conceptions, as well as the same figure under different assumptions of abortions conducted illegally, informally, or abroad. The high range is lower than progressive groups claim, while the low range is higher than conservative groups claim, as both groups are probably exaggerating for political affect.  As you can see, the legalization of abortions led to a huge increase in abortions. Then over time, as Poland modernized and unwanted fertility declined, abortion rates fell too. Then in 1980s as restrictions were put in place on foreign abortion tourism, and new rules were put in place on how to procure abortions, abortion rates fell sharply. Subsequent legal restrictions successfully reduced the legal abortion rate to essentially zero. But the true abortion rate probably didn’t fall by as much. Abortion restrictions probably only actually reduced the share of reported conceptions ending in fetal death by between 5 and 10 percent. That is, abortion restrictions probably reduced abortions in the short term by about a quarter to half. South Korea Shows Abortion Laws Do Reduce Abortions South Korea banned abortions until 1961. In 1961, South Korea adopted a formal policy trying to reduce birth rates and control population growth. Access to abortion slowly eased over the next decade, but abortion was not generally legalized until 1973. But in 1987, things started to change. Korean officials became concerned about sex-selective abortion. They began to restrict doctors’ ability to tell parents about the sex of an unborn child. Over the next decade, Korean policymakers and doctors waged a concerted campaign against sex-selective abortion. Then in 2005, Korea changed its official policy stance from trying to reduce births to trying to increase them. Since then, more restrictions on abortion have been put in place.  When Korea liberalized abortion, abortion rates rose, generally by about 10 percent of reported conceptions within a few years. When Korea took measures to reduce abortion access, abortion rates fell. There is a jump from the 1990s to 2005, but it should be noted the data from 1961 to 1997 is from a different source, which collected its data using a different method, than the data from 2005 to 2010, so that jump may not be real. In general, increased abortion restrictions tended to be followed by about 10 percentage points lower abortion rates. Austria Shows Abortion Laws Do Reduce Abortions But these data sources all have shortcomings. Data collection was inconsistent or interrupted. Plus, while they include stillbirths, they have no measurement of miscarriages. Data from Austria corrects this deficiency: reliably reported around the window of time Austria legalized abortion, with data on stillbirths and reported miscarriages. While Austria has not restricted abortions, we can at least see what legalizing abortion did.  Legalizing abortion in Austria led to an immediate increase in the share of conceptions ending in death by about 8 percentage points. From then until the end of complete data reporting, fetal deaths fell. But it’s worth looking at why. Allowing abortion did reduce miscarriages right away. But the cost was enormous, in terms of the lives of children. Many progressives suggest that abortions are vital for women’s health, and to avoid pregnancies that would have ended in death anyways. An increase in the abortion rate of 11 percentage points led to a reduction in miscarriages of 1 percentage point. There was no meaningful break in the trend of stillborn children. In other words, abortion access had a modest impact on miscarriages, and not on stillbirths. But today, even as abortion rates have fallen by more than half in Austria, miscarriage rates have not risen. Indeed, what we see in Austria is common in countries around the world, including the United States: even in the absence of legal changes, abortion is becoming rarer, and at virtually no health cost to women and children. Abortion was a crude tool implemented by 20th-century states to manage what was then perceived as excessively high fertility, but whatever function it may have served is now pretty much passed. Recent U.S. State Policies Have Reduced Abortions Of course, there’s no shortage of academic research on this topic. A 2017 study of Texas’s 2011 to 2014 abortion regulations found they reduced abortions by 20 percent. Another study of the same regulations found a smaller effect: just a 10 percent decline. A study of abortion legalization in the 1970s found that when a state legalized abortion, births fell by at least 5 percent. The authors find that recriminalizing abortion would result in 320,000 additional births per year. Another study found that restricting Medicaid funding for abortions could reduce abortions among Medicaid-dependent populations by 22 percent. A study of Texas restrictions imposed in 2004 found that abortions fell by a whopping 88 percent among affected women. Another study suggests repealing Roe v. Wade and allowing states to set their own abortion policies would reduce abortions nationally by 6 to 15 percent. In other words, restricting abortion does reduce abortions, by a lot. People living in states that restricted abortion would experience enormous declines in abortions. So the view that abortion restrictions simply don’t work is wrong. But of course, it is possible that financial support for women could reduce abortion by even more. There’s less research on this topic. But one clever study has looked at it obliquely. By exploiting variations in when states adopted modern methods to enforce child support payments, it’s possible to see what happens to abortion rates when women are guaranteed more money to support children. The answer is striking: an approximately $1,000 increase in payments to single moms reduced the abortion rate about 7 percent. Single moms are about half of all moms, so that probably shakes out to about $500 per month to all moms reducing abortions by about 7 percent. But modest restrictions on abortion, like closing a few centers or reducing Medicaid access, created abortion reductions of between 5 percent and 88 percent. According to one of the studies discussed above, repealing Roe would only reduce abortions by about 6 to 15 percent, because not all states would change their laws. People living in states that restricted abortion would experience enormous declines in abortions. In other words, giving financial support to parents would indeed reduce abortions. I’ve argued in favor of such financial support in this publication and elsewhere. Pro-life conservatives really should support more subsidies for children and families. But let’s not kid ourselves. Abortion restrictions work. They have large, rapid effects and save tens of thousands of lives from the cruelty of murder in the womb. While more taxpayer spending on families is important, it is morally imperative that state governments act now against the wholesale slaughter of the unborn. Yes, if we pay people not to murder the unborn, some people will choose not to do so. But that’s an absurd calculation to make. Abortion is murder, and as murder, should be a crime. So ban it.

"2",2,"Are Abortion Reversals Science Or Scam?","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-05-16"," “The light of our life.” “My little girl is the joy of my life and I truly don’t know what I would do without her.” “There is a new light in my home that brings a smile to everyone in my family and I would not change it for the world.” “Active, precocious and healthy.”
These are just a few of the ways families describe some of the hundreds of their children almost lost to abortion. Those children may well owe their lives to a promising new medical protocol called abortion reversal, which may increase in demand due to the new ten-week abortion pill. https://twitter.com/MarkDever/status/863062835957551104  How We Got Pill-Induced Abortions Abortion reversal refers to halting a chemical abortion, an abortion caused by ingesting a drug. The abortion pill first made headlines when the French government approved RU-486 for sale in 1988. In September 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the abortion pill to terminate pregnancies up to seven weeks old. Then in 2016, the FDA expanded the label to include terminating pregnancies up to ten weeks. Sold in the United States under the brand name Mifeprex and generically known as mifepristone, the abortion pill, as the FDA explained, “is used, together with another medication called misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy.” Mifeprex, which is taken first, binds to a woman’s progesterone receptors, blocking progesterone from the uterine lining. Progesterone deficiency causes the uterine lining to break down, depriving the embryo of the nutrients necessary to live. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours later, the woman takes the second drug, misoprostol. This drug induces uterine contractions, which expel the now-dead embryo (or fetus, depending on the stage of human development, as Mifeprex is also used off-label for second-trimester abortions). While French pharmaceutical company Roussel-Uclaf developed Mifeprex to cause abortions, first testing its chemical actions in vitro (in labs) and later running clinical trials, the abortion reversal protocol developed by happenstance, necessity—and prayer. ‘There’s Nothing You Can Do’ The story begins in North Carolina in 2007, in the family practice of Dr. Matthew Harrison. A patient sought Harrison’s help in stopping the abortive effects of Mifeprex. Harrison said that at the abortion clinic, “they gave her no hope. They said, ‘There’s nothing you can do; you have to complete this procedure.’”  As Harrison later recounted, he stepped out of the exam room then “said a prayer and started looking through books and thinking about how RU-486 works…It essentially just blocks the progesterone receptors and starves the baby. Harrison then immediately took some progesterone he had on hand for fertility treatments and, after informing the mother that the treatment might not work, injected her with the hormone.” The unborn baby survived, and half-a-dozen months later the first known woman treated with the abortion reversal protocol gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Two years later, on the other side of the country, Dr. George Delgado made the same deduction after receiving an urgent request for help from a friend. The friend had fielded a desperate call on a pregnancy helpline from a woman who had begun the chemical abortion process by ingesting Mifeprex, but now wished to carry her baby to term. As the Indianapolis Star explained: “Delgado had frequently prescribed progesterone to women at risk of miscarrying. Knowing of mifepristone’s progesterone-blocking properties, Delgado calculated that adding progesterone into the system could counteract the drug’s effect. From his southern California offices, he located a doctor in El Paso who agreed to treat the woman. Her child is now about 7 years old …Word got out, and Delgado started receiving more calls about the procedure.”  The Abortion Pill Reversal Program Is Born With interest in the abortion reversal protocol growing, doctors Delgado, Harrison, and Mary Davenport established the Abortion Pill Reversal program in 2012, operating within the Culture of Life Family Services, a nonprofit organization in San Diego, California. The Abortion Pill Reversal program maintains a website and a 24/7 hotline. When women call, a medical professional answers and, if the caller chooses, Delgado’s team helps connect her with a local doctor for treatment. The treating physician then follows the abortion reversal protocol: In 2012, Delgado and Davenport published a paper in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy, a peer-reviewed journal. It reported the results of Delgado’s protocol, noting that four out of six women who had undergone treatment with progesterone after ingesting mifepristone successfully carried their babies to term. With the publication of their article and establishment of the webpage, the abortion pill reversal protocol began receiving growing attention within the pro-life medical community. As the IndyStar reported, while originally a small operation, the program now connects women worldwide to a network of more than 350 physicians. These doctors have treated more than 300 women and the abortion reversal protocol boasts a 60-70 percent success rate. From Doctors’ Offices to Legislative Chambers Then came a presentation on the abortion pill reversal protocol at the annual conference of the American Association of Pro-Life Ob-Gyns (AAPLOG). In attendance that year was Ovide Lamontagne, the former legal head of Americans United for Life, a national pro-life public-interest law firm. As AUL spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick explained in an email interview, based on the science shared at the AAPLOG annual conference, AUL lawyers drafted an informed consent model law for abortion reversal—the Abortion Pill Reversal Act, which provides, in part: In 2015, the AUL claimed its first legislative victories when Arkansas and Arizona passed this model legislation. Abortion Supporters Fight Back As AUL moved forward with its abortion reversal legislation, abortion advocates fought back in courts, legislatures, and the press. While Arkansas’ law went unchallenged, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Health, and the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in federal court against Arizona’s law. However, before the court reached the merits of the litigation, Arizona’s legislature amended the law. It now only requires abortion clinics to inform women that use of mifepristone alone may not terminate the pregnancy “and that she should immediately consult a physician if she would like more information.” Shortly after Arizona’s initial abortion reversal legislation passed, the Arizona section of the pro-abortion American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a purported “Fact Sheet” on “Medication Abortion Reversal.” However, that “Fact Sheet” was both false and misleading. After proclaiming, “Facts Are Important,” the Arizona branch of the ACOG stated: With this support from the “professional” ACOG Arizona Section, abortion-rights advocates were off and woozling. Here’s abortion doctor Cheryl Chastine: “The medical literature is quite clear that mifepristone on its own is only about 50 percent effective at ending a pregnancy. That means that even if these doctors were to offer a large dose of purple Skittles, they’d appear to have ‘worked’ to ‘save’ the pregnancy about half the time. Those numbers are consistent with what these people are reporting.” Nearly every media outlet unquestioningly accepted the 30-50 percent figure in the ACOG statement. Some writers even rounded up, as Chastine did, presenting the probability of survival at 50 percent, such as seen in this Daily Beast article: “Simply put, it would be akin to taking credit for a coin flip.” Delgado disputes the ACOG figure, but few media outlets bothered to report that fact and those which did failed to explain the basis for the disagreement. I asked AAPLOG Executive Director Dr. Donna J. Harrison to comment on the ACOG’s assertion that in 30-50 percent of the cases the pregnancy would have continued without progesterone supplementation. She stated: “That is a claim based on studies looking at ‘complete abortion’—i.e. situations where all of the tissue has passed and the uterus is empty. That statistic is NOT the number of living unborn children after the use of a single dose of mifepristone.” The facts back up Dr. Harrison’s claim: In 2015, in response to the abortion reversal legislation, Dr. Daniel Grossman (an often-quoted critic of the protocol) co-authored an article reviewing the scientific literature on the effectiveness of abortion reversal and the reported cases of continuing pregnancy without progesterone supplementation. As the lead author, Grossman explained that based on Delgado’s 2012 case series, “the proportion of pregnancies continuing after this [abortion reversal] therapy was 67%…” In comparison, the literature review showed a range of continuing pregnancies at a follow-up visit (one to two weeks later) at a low of 8 percent and a high of 46 percent. This range differs greatly from the 30-50 percent figure. A closer reading of the journal article provides the explanation—the same one Dr. Donna Harrison provided: There is a difference between a “medical abortion failure” and a “continuing pregnancy.” Grossman’s literature review also “excluded studies that only reported medical abortion failure after mifepristone alone and did not specify the number of continuing pregnancies.” Slandering the Science Arizona’s ACOG also asserted in its “Fact Statement” that “[c]laims of medication abortion reversal are not supported by the body of scientific evidence.” This statement is not wrong, but it is misleading. It leads the public to believe that abortion reversal is “fake science,” whereas the “body” of scientific evidence develops over time and the abortion reversal protocol is emerging science, so there isn’t a “body” of evidence—yet. But this language gave abortion advocates room to run and claim, as Jodi Liggett, the public policy director of Planned Parenthood Arizona, did in an interview with The Guardian, that no science supports the procedure: “Women in their most vulnerable moment are going potentially to be given information that has no science to back it up.” It is Liggett, however, who is pushing an anti-science agenda by ignoring the scientific basis for the protocol. After all, that is what the abortion reversal protocol rests on—a fundamental understanding of the science underlying the reproductive system. A snippet from a 2015 New England Journal of Medicine article explains the basics: Progesterone is essential to achieve and maintain a healthy pregnancy. It is secreted naturally by the corpus luteum during the second half of the menstrual cycle and by the corpus luteum and placenta during early pregnancy. . . .The physiological importance of progesterone in early pregnancy has prompted the performance of several trials to evaluate the effect of progesterone supplementation in the first trimester of pregnancy among women with a history of recurrent miscarriages. This scientific knowledge led to the development of RU-486, with researchers “envisioning” a new method of abortion based on a chemical interruption of progesterone. All Delgado and Matthew Harrison did was apply the same logic in reverse. As Dr. Donna Harrison (no relation to Matthew Harrison) explained, it’s also the same standard of care that “has been used for over 40 years in the treatment of women who are likely to miscarry from progesterone deficiency called Luteal Phase defect.” Staff counsel for AUL Mailee Smith explained these concepts in more detail, adding that the protocol replicates “a well-established medical regimen that is used in other areas of health care — in particular, methotrexate and ‘leucovorin rescue” that physicians use to treat cancer patients. But It’s Not FDA Approved! Opponents of the abortion reversal protocol are also exploiting the public’s ignorance about the FDA approval process and the proper use of off-label prescriptions. You saw this misdirection in House Democrats’ press release criticizing Colorado’s abortion-reversal informed consent law: “The reversal method referred to in the bill, which consists of administering a large dose of the hormone progesterone after the abortion process has been initiated, hasn’t undergone clinical trials or been approved by the FDA.” Abortion advocates have painted the abortion-reversal protocol as dangerous and doctors prescribing progesterone as conducting unethical studies on human subjects. But, as the FDA explains, a drug approved for one purpose can be prescribed for any purpose. This practice, known as “off-label” use, is not just legal, but in many cases the standard of care. Further, clinical trials are but one form of scientific evidence that supports off-label use. While a large randomized placebo-controlled trial provides the best evidence, it is well-established that “[o]ff-label uses can be supported by different levels of evidence,” including “case reports” and the “logical extension of an approved use, [such] as when a drug approved for one condition is prescribed for another condition that has genetic or physiologic similarities to the first.” Off-label applications may emerge “through ‘field discovery,’ in which clinicians identify new applications as they care for patients.” That is what happened here. Yet abortion advocates have painted the abortion-reversal protocol as dangerous and doctors prescribing progesterone as conducting unethical studies on human subjects with no oversight. Wrong. “The ethical justification for off-label prescribing is that it can provide the best available therapy for a particular patient. This contrasts with the ethical justification for conducting clinical trials, which is to develop new therapies or clarify the best use of existing treatments for future patients…But clinical off-label prescribing has a therapeutic purpose and individual patient interests should guide such use.” Knowing that progesterone injections safely prevent women from miscarrying, Delgado explained “we think that a control trial where we deny some women treatment and give it to others would be unethical.” But What About Safety? The lack of clinical trials has prompted others, such as Dr. Leah Torres, an OB-GYN and abortion rights activist, to argue you “have to amass significant evidence until they can make it part of standard practice, . . . . They need to be able to answer the questions of: ‘What are the risks of stopping a medical abortion? What are the risks to the baby? What are the risks to the mom?’” The ‘fact statement’ acknowledged that ‘mifepristone is not known to cause birth defects,’ so not proceeding with the abortion does not present a risk to the baby. But even the Arizona ACOG “Fact” statement acknowledged that “mifepristone is not known to cause birth defects,” so not proceeding with the abortion does not present a risk to the baby. (Whereas proceeding definitely does!) As Dr. Donna Harrison explained, “[p]rogesterone has been demonstrated in the extensive infertility literature to be safe for both the mother and the fetus.” Grossman, a critic of abortion reversal legislation, also candidly admitted to Slate that “progesterone probably won’t hurt a woman if she’s under medical supervision…” Grossman’s real concern is “that the advertising of this procedure could mislead the public about the prevalence of abortion regret.” Seeking to push back against “junk science” and other false and misleading narratives, the AAPLOG joined a press conference and issued a statement supporting the abortion reversal protocol. It also later it issued its own Fact Sheet detailing the safety of progesterone supplementation, the scientific theory behind the abortion reversal protocol, and the most current evidence supporting its effectiveness. Legislators Adopt a More Circumspect Approach With the popular press’s consistent (and unquestioning) reporting of preferred pro-choice narrative, pro-life politicians have backed away from AUL’s model legislation. Rather than requiring abortion clinics to provide information on the possibility of reversing the abortive effects of Mifeprex, states are following Arizona’s lead and instead merely mandating that women be told that mifepristone alone may not terminate the pregnancy. South Dakota and Utah took this approach, while legislation in Colorado and Indiana has been sidelined. How abortion activists respond to further scientific evidence supporting the reversal protocol will be telling. The Louisiana legislature took yet another approach: It directed the state Department of Health to study whether the effects of a chemically induced abortion could be reversed. The agency recently issued its report and conclusion: “There is neither sufficient evidence nor a scientific basis to conclude that the effects of an abortion induced with drugs or chemicals can be reversed.” Look for abortion-rights activists to cling to this conclusion, even though the report ignored the scientific theory behind the protocol and included this glaring error: “The only professional association that has expressly stated a position on the procedure is the Arizona Section of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.” This completely ignored the position of the national professional association—AACLOG—that supports the abortion reversal protocol. The battle over abortion-reversal is far from over. The sponsor of Louisiana’s bill has promised to push forward. Legislation has been proposed in several other states, including California, Georgia, Idaho, and North Carolina. AUL representatives told me they intend to continue the organization’s legislative push. With chemical abortions on the rise—they increased from 6 percent of all abortions in 2001 to 31 percent in 2014—the fight over abortion reversal legislation is here to stay. While state lawmakers continue to grapple with the issue, scientific knowledge will continue to advance. A follow-up journal article by Delgado detailing the continued success of the abortion reversal protocol is expected soon. While critics denounced his initial case study, given the limited number of patients treated off-label with progesterone, this article will include more than 300 patients and report a success rate in the 60-70 percent range. How abortion activists respond to further scientific evidence supporting the reversal protocol will be telling. Will they continue to deprive women who choose no longer to abort of information indicating that progesterone improves the chance their babies will survive? If so, it will continue to show the Left is not just anti-science but anti-choice and anti-life. Correction: The U.S. FDA approved the abortion pill in 2000, not 1990.

"4",4,"6 Ways To Help Women When Abortion Is Finally Outlawed","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-05-24"," Western civilization is at a tipping point over the value of human life. Protesters in Ireland are screaming “Hoes need abortions” as citizens debate whether to repeal their Eighth Amendment that secures a right to life. Meanwhile, Mississippi passed the United States’ toughest restriction on abortion, a ban of abortion past 15 weeks with minimal exceptions. A judge temporarily blocked it, since it violates court precedent protecting abortion before a baby’s viability outside the womb.  At the same time, a Republican Congress keeps failing to defund abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, possibly prompting President Trump’s reinstatement of a Reagan rule prohibiting federal funds for women’s centers located with abortion facilities. The final end to abortion in America probably won’t come all at once. When Roe v. Wade is finally overturned, the matter will be left to the states. Some states will ban the practice, and more will follow suit. But many pro-lifers believe we will end state sponsorship of the death culture. Regardless of how many states ban abortion or how long it takes, it’s important to address concerns about how women, especially women in desperate circumstances, can be supported when abortion is no longer a legal option. 1. Improve Reproductive Education There’s no getting around it. Where legal abortion access is restricted, demand for illegal abortions increases. According to research by the Guttmacher Institute, the state with the highest number of searches related to DIY abortions was Mississippi, where only one legal abortion facility exists.  This is not a reason to keep abortion clinics open, however. It’s a pressing reason to educate women on the dangers of trying to kill their preborn babies themselves, or by the hands of unlicensed and unaccountable abortionists. Reproductive education should include a thorough examination of the consequences of abortions, both DIY and “back-alley.” DIY abortions are extremely dangerous. They can kill you, put you in the hospital, or leave you infertile. The World Health Organization estimates 22 million “unsafe” abortions happen annually across the world, leading 47,000 women to death and 5 million to disabilities over the past two decades. An “unsafe” abortion is “carried out either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.” WHO estimates that 20-30 percent of unsafe abortions cause infection of the reproductive tract, and one in four women who’ve undergone an unsafe abortion will develop temporary or lifelong disabilities. Since back-alley abortionists operate outside the law, they don’t adhere to health codes. There are no consequences if the mother dies on the table, as long as practitioners aren’t caught by law enforcement.  Reading descriptions of the horrid conditions of abortionist Kermit Gosnell’s facility should give you an idea of the danger a woman would put herself in by entering a black market abortion mill. According to a grand jury report, “The medical practice by which he [Gosnell] carried out this business was a filthy fraud in which he overdosed his patients with dangerous drugs, spread venereal disease among them with infected instruments, perforated their wombs and bowels – and, on at least two occasions, caused their deaths.” Gosnell’s clinic was licensed, and many reports were made to the Department of Health about his facility. Complaints about unsanitary, unsafe practices have been made against many other legal abortion facilities, and they often skirt consequences for years at the expense of their clients. If this is the status quo for legal clinics, imagine what black market operations will look like. Again, because illegal abortions will be the only kind (save in cases where the mother’s safety is threatened), demand for illegal abortions will increase, and therefore the number of women back alley practitioners could prey upon. Gosnell was at a deeper level, but plenty of people are willing to exploit and kill for profit, both legally and illegally. Women must be equipped with the truth if they and their babies are to stay safe: about what unsafe abortions can do to them, and to the lives within them. Both young women and men should be educated on babies’ development in the womb. When can heartbeats be detected? Do middle schoolers and high schoolers know it’s as early as six weeks? Do they know that tiny babies at this age already have eyelids? Do they know they’ve developed arms and legs in week 9, and teeth and nails at week 12? Children deserve the truth. Early fetuses aren’t globs of undifferentiated cells or tumor-like masses. They’re unique human beings, with their own unique DNA. Abortion ends a human life. We don’t lie to our young people about the evils of slavery, and we shouldn’t lie to them about this. It’s also important that young women hear from women who regret their abortions, and to hear how many women regret or felt they had negative outcomes from abortions. Fully half of women who volunteered survey data at a pregnancy resource clinic (out of 987 respondents) said they took prescription medications for mental health issues after their abortion. Nearly a third (32 percent) said there were absolutely no positive outcomes. In The Federalist, A.D.P. Efferson highlighted one woman’s response: “None, there are no positives. My life is no better, it is much worse. I carry the pain of a child lost forever… I would rather have been a single mother of two and have my baby here.” Respondents also registered rates between 9-14 percent for depression, guilt, self-hatred, shame, addiction, and regret. 2. Encourage Adoption, Especially Cross-Racial Adoption is the most widely used talking point on abortion, and for good reason. If a mother truly is not in a position to care for her child, and neither is her family, then adoption is her only answer. While plenty of agencies connect prospective parents with mothers, we must prepare to address the race disparity in adoption. Black babies are “harder to place” than white babies. They make up 21 percent of all adoptions, 62 percent higher than the percentage of blacks in America (13.1 percent). The latest data reveals black women have 391 abortions per 1,000 live births and black abortions make up 36 percent of all U.S. abortions. When abortion is finally outlawed on the state level, adoption agencies will see an increase in black babies up for adoption, since not all women will be able to afford to travel out of state for an abortion (and many more will be waitlisted due to restricted abortion supply, which will probably mean some women can’t get the procedure before the gestational cutoff age). In Ohio, probably the most likely state to ban abortion outside states with “trigger laws,” which already outlaw abortion in the event Roe is overturned, black abortions make up 40 percent of total abortions, although black Americans are only 14.2 percent of the population. In Louisiana, which has a trigger law, they make up 60 percent of the state’s abortions, though blacks account for 32 percent of the population. Many women who abort do so under the pretense that, for whatever reason, their babies wouldn’t be loved and deserve better than their mothers can offer. Those women need to trust that their babies will find good homes. Are enough prospective parents willing to adopt children of a different race? The disparity in adoption fees between black babies and white babies indicate that’s not the case. If every baby is to be placed in a loving home, we need to encourage biracial families. Pop culture can have a strong influence in how people perceive biracial families (think “This is Us”), but if racially divisive politics and far-left ideas of segregation gain traction, we won’t be able to fulfill the goal of “every child a wanted child.” 3. Support Pregnancy Centers and Other Pro-Life Ministries More than 4,000 pregnancy resource centers operate nationwide. We should expect demand for their services to explode post-Roe, so one practical way to help pregnant women in challenging situations is to donate or volunteer at one. Business owners can offer free advertising or partner with them for fundraising or supply drives. You can get also get involved through your congregation; churches frequently do fundraising for local PRCs. Through Care-Net, one of the nation’s largest PRC networks, 948,780 ultrasound scans have been provided at no cost to the mothers, more than 1 million clients received parenting support and education, more than 1.5 million people received material resources, and 2.5 million no-cost pregnancy tests were administered. Do these services help women choose life? Care-Net claims it saved 71,497 preborn babies in 2016 alone, and the impact of PRC work will only increase in a post-Roe culture. You can also support ministries dedicated to educating and persuading women. The Radiance Foundation produces high-quality messaging, and End Abortion Now has a record of turning women away from abortion by bringing them the gospel and the truth about abortion. 4. Support Fatherhood Some partners cruelly pressure women into abortions. Such evil cannot go unpunished. Other fathers are left out of the decision entirely, though, perhaps because women have been inculcated with the idea that “reproductive rights” belong to them alone. What if fathers were asked to step up as parents and providers, instead of being written off as unqualified sperm donors? But what if fathers were asked to step up as parents and providers, instead of being written off as unqualified sperm donors? What if our culture demanded it? It’s hard to be a single mother at any income level, but abortion-seekers are disproportionately poor (half are below the federal poverty line). Is it any wonder half of women cite not wanting to be a single parent as a reason for their abortion? Almost half of women who abort are living with a partner (45 percent). To be sure, many of those fathers aren’t up the task, but some are. Having a child to care for is the most sobering responsibility of adulthood. Its psychological impact cannot be fully realized until that child becomes a reality to the parent. Millions of fathers have been robbed of this opportunity since Roe, and our welfare system has enabled this by disincentivizing marriage and fatherhood obligations. That system is perpetuating poverty and fatherlessness, putting more women at risk of choosing abortion. Instead of affirming mothers’ unilateral decisions by default, we should encourage fathers’ involvement (including marriage), reforming welfare policy and offering more robust community support to fathers who want to get on the straight and narrow for their children’s sake. It’s only fair to the father, the woman with whom he’s created a child, and their child. 5. Criminal Consequences for Illegal Abortionists Almost all prolifers and moderate pro-choicers agree virtue-signaling isn’t enough. It’s not enough to simply make abortion illegal: we want to see fewer abortions. Advocates of legal abortion often argue that banning abortion doesn’t end abortion, it simply makes all abortions illegal, and therefore more dangerous. But their arguments fail to take deterrence into account. We cannot drastically reduce the abortion rate by only going after the supply (abortionists); we have to reduce demand. That’s why education about preborn life is so important. Those facts have helped tremendously in reducing the abortion rate over the past 20 years, but not enough. Prosecuting women who willfully extinguish the human life within them is not only just, it’s necessary for deterrence. The consequences of illegal abortion must be painstakingly clear: risk lethal infection, infertility, or a very long prison sentence. Tough as it is to swallow, harsh penalties for abortion are one of the best things we can institute for the welfare of women and the preborn. Not only does abortion produce death in every circumstance, but as previously stated, abortion yields negative mental, spiritual, and physical outcomes for women. We can’t skirt the fact that if we refuse to seek justice on behalf of the murdered, we don’t really value all human life. 6. Value Life and Celebrate It A real culture of life is comprehensive and consistent: it values human life from womb to tomb, from the preborn to the dying and disabled. Utilitarianism and “quality of life” arguments are the same from abortion to assisted suicide: they deny the inherent dignity and sanctity of human life and the fact that it is not ours to take. If we concede on any one of these fronts, we lose the fight on the others. The support and esteem of women who give birth to and raise children with special needs should therefore be of utmost concern, and the support of terminal relatives and their caretakers (family or others). To view a child or any relative as a “burden” lays on them a guilt they should not have to carry. It not only pressures parents to consider illegal abortion, but risks a policy backslide that would open the door once again to legalize the act. To view a child or any relative as a ‘burden’ lays on them a guilt they should not have to carry. Although comparatively minor, we must also oppose our culture’s fecundophobia. Caring for children is an awesome responsibility, and kids aren’t to be dreaded. We should embrace the value of big families and the prudence of starting childbearing in one’s twenties, what second-wave feminists consider critical career-building years. Babies are a joy, so make a fuss over their entrance into the world. Throw elaborate baby showers. Gift a maternity photo shoot, a new baby shoot, or a cute maternity swimsuit or dress to a struggling mom. Take a pregnant mom out for ice cream or a pedicure. Invite friends with children into your home. Provide ongoing support after the baby is born. Drop off some diapers or offer to drive to well-baby visits. Help moms connect with other mothers through church or organizations like MOPS, which even has a group for teen moms. Offer to watch kids so their parents can have an evening out (59 percent of women seeking abortion have already given birth). A pro-family culture makes the hard times with children a little less hard, and it could make choosing death even more unthinkable. Although one can’t draw a causal relationship between generous parental leave policies and lower abortion rates, we should also encourage baby-friendly and mother-friendly policies in the workplace, including paid maternity and paternity leave and flex-work or work-from-home options. Both parents need time to bond with their newborns and mothers need time for their bodies to heal. All the little things add up to a culture that’s not only comfortable with children, but welcomes them gladly. A pro-family culture makes the hard times with children a little less hard, and it could make choosing death even more unthinkable. We need pro-life education, vigorous prosecution and sentencing, and support for adoption, for fathers, and for prolife organizations. No matter what the courts rule, abortion bans will never survive the onslaught of pro-abortion advocacy if we don’t foster a culture that cherishes human life in all its forms and stages.

"5",5,"A Conservative’s Guide For Talking About Rape, Religion, And Abortion","Brody","Shlomo","M.",NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-28"," Can conservatives talk coherently in 2018 about abortion in case of rape pregnancies? The implosion of the Republican Party in these elections has been painful for many conservatives, and for good reason. Donald Trump’s positions on issues like free-trade, immigration, and America’s role in the world have gone against long-time conservative stances. On other issues, such as abortion, his confusing and baffling remarks have made it difficult to understand what he believes. Yet the party’s current unravelling also paves the way for thinking anew about how to formulate a renewed conservative agenda, including its pro-life dispositions on abortion. Even before Trump, pro-life Republicans like Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, and John Koster committed blunders that cost key votes in important races.  Admittedly, rape pregnancies are one of the more difficult subjects to discuss. Yet one wonders how people believe such politicians deserve a place in public office when they remain so inarticulate yet so dogmatic on one of the most controversial questions of our times, especially when they invoke religious beliefs in their defense. Fluency and eloquence will not necessarily convince others to change their minds on this issue, but they will at least make the candidate seem rational and empathetic, not rash and heartless. With late-term abortions and Planned Parenthood funding back in the headlines, and the vice presidential candidates renewing discussion about the role of faith in these debates, conservatives must recognize the imperative of developing a more articulate and coherent position on this divisive and sensitive question. This essay elucidates the positions of several major faith traditions on abortions in cases of rape. These faith traditions present varying positions which are defendable and reasonable. The position that abortion should not be allowed even in cases of rape is neither dumbfounded nor indefensible, even as I do not find it compelling nor do I think it accurately reflects that of many Bible-loving, pro-life Americans, including that of my own Orthodox Jewish faith. As I will argue, this should be a factor for many politicians when thinking about American public policy and the electability of a pro-life candidate in swing states. Hard Cases Make Bad Law, And Bad Arguments From all the heated rhetoric, one would think that abortions in rape pregnancies represent a significant percentage of American abortions. In fact, according to research published by the National Abortion Federation and the Guttmacher Institute, only 1 percent of women in the years 1987, 2004, and 2009 who elected to abort claimed their pregnancy was a result of coerced intercourse.  The consistency of this figure over a large number of years highlights that we are dealing with a small percentage of abortions, the vast majority of which involve unmarried women who are not interested in raising their child. In parallel, the “hard case” with which pro-choice liberals struggle, mid- or late-term abortions in the case of severe or fatal birth defects, similarly represents roughly 1 percent of abortions in the United States. Accordingly, much of the heated rhetoric in the United States on the abortion debate is dealing with highly emotional circumstances that represent a miniscule percentage of abortions. Yet these hard cases incite such passion because they put into relief the moral issues that underlie the abortion debate. In the case of rape pregnancies, this challenge leads to two faulty claims pro-life advocates make, one scientific and the other theological. Akin became notorious for asserting that during rape, “The female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” Following widespread media coverage after Akin’s bungle, one hopes that by now most people understand that rape can lead to pregnancy. This is true in all scenarios of rape, ranging from violent attacks in dark alleyways (the scenario I presume Akin intended when he infamously invoked a “legitimate rape”) to relationships between a 22-year old college student and a 15-year old high school girl (“statutory rape”). While estimates vary greatly, it is widely assumed that thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur every year in the United States alone. The most frequent incident of rape pregnancies, according to a widely cited 1996 study, involves cases of “date rape” or “marital rape” in which a known partner imposes sexual relations.  As noted in a medical comment published alongside this article, it remains possible that in some of those cases, the women were actually impregnated from a different consensual encounter with their partner. Be that as it may, health professionals agree that there is no reason ovulating rape victims cannot become impregnated in any form of rape, broadly defined as sex without valid consent. Unfortunately, 2012 was not the first time pro-life politicians have claimed that rape pregnancies cannot occur. The continued use of this false scientific claim presumably reflects the challenge that rape presents to pro-life activists: most people, religious or otherwise, feel intuitively uncomfortable with a woman being violated and then being forced to bear the weighty responsibility of having a child from that traumatic event. Trying to Understand Why God Gave This Life This discomfort leads to the problematic theological claim Mourdock made against abortion in rape pregnancies: All life, even when produced from rape or incest, is a gift from God, and therefore one cannot destroy this divine present. Let’s assume one believes all pregnancies stem from God’s intervention. Does that necessarily mean that every fetal conception is a gift? Would you make the same argument for fetuses who die in utero or cause their mothers to die in childbirth? Then there are the fetuses born into the world to live a brief life of suffering before dying. Do you really believe every life is a gift from God? Ultimately, this is a form of theodicy, and like all theodicies, it brings solace to some but certainly not for others. As we learned from Job’s friends, it is inappropriate to preach your theodicy to those suffering rape victims who might not share your theology and find your homiletics patronizing, or worse, as implying that their pregnancy was a punishment from God. Their tears might not override an ethical claim against abortion, but they do demand a certain amount of theological modesty. Instead, serious thinkers who oppose abortion in rape pregnancies make a substantive moral claim: one may not kill a human life simply to prevent the mental anguish of another person. Let us take, by way of an imperfect analogy, the case of a victim of violent rape who had been trying to conceive with her husband at the time  and elected not to abort out of hope that the fetus was from her husband’s sperm. At the time of birth, DNA tests determined the child was the seed of the rapist. It’s a tragic situation, yet certainly one which would not justify killing the newborn. (Today, women in this situation would likely perform a paternity test toward the end of the first trimester through chorionic villius sampling or amniocentesis). Consequently, the critical moral question remains: When does life begin, or, to put it more precisely, when does the zygote, embryo, or fetus achieve a status that deserves to be considered human life requiring protection? The simplest argument against abortion in all cases of rape at any stage or pregnancy begins with a fundamental moral premise: human life begins at conception. ‘Life Begins at Conception’ Is an Ethical Argument Science can neither prove nor disprove that claim, just as science cannot “prove” when a human organism has died. Doctors can depict the different stages of development, but ultimately it is a moral claim—which can be based on ethics, religion, or culture—to determine at what stage of embryonic development we afford legal recognition to that life form. This is an important point some 2016 Republican candidates bungled in early debates. Science can support the reasonableness of one’s position, but ultimately one must make an ethical argument to explain why conception, birth, or any biological stage in between should be the legal commencement of life. This is a general ethical claim, not an exclusively religious one, and one that I presume many Americans share. Once one has established conception as the beginning of life, the argument against abortion in rape pregnancies then applies natural law theory which asserts that one may never directly intend to kill an innocent human. This is a general ethical claim, not an exclusively religious one, and one that I presume many Americans share (or at least respect). Consequently, it proceeds to assert two additional claims: 1) once life has begun, we cannot take the fetus’ rights to life, and 2) this remains true even if it was created under tragic circumstances that were traumatic for its mother. For most advocates of this approach, exceptions are only made when the mother’s life is endangered because the intent is to heal or save the mother, with the tragic death of the fetus deemed an unfortunate and indirect side-effect. Unfortunately, politicians sometimes botch the natural law argument with a claim against abortions in rape pregnancies that goes something like, “How does it help to place even more violence onto a woman’s body and take the life of an innocent child?” This type of rhetoric is terribly misguided. Firstly, it is insensitive to a victim to compare the excruciating torment of rape with the difficult choice to abort, especially when dealing with a stage of pregnancy at which we do not know whether a fetus cannot feel pain. Secondly, unwise rhetoric leads to a (mistaken) counterattack: “If that’s the case, why allow such violence against the innocent child when the mother’s life is in danger—how does that help?” The ethical claim, however, is not one of violence against the fetus, but rather the goal or intent of the abortion. Politicians who stay focused on the natural law claim will remain clear and coherent regarding their moral stance. Amongst contemporary religious groups, this approach is known as the position of the Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention, whose members included several 2016 presidential candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. Of course, the political stances of candidates regarding American public policy may differ from their religious denominations, as in the case of Gov. Chris Christie and Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, Catholics who believe abortions should be legal for rape-related pregnancy. Yet religious affiliation will certainly draw questions on this matter, and candidates should be prepared to give articulate answers, including their position regarding government funding for immediate post-rape treatment and morning-after pills. This is an inevitable question since many pro-choice groups accuse Catholic hospitals of not making rape victims aware of the full range of medical care that would be available at other facilities. Moral Traditions that Place a Value on Individual Agency Those who believe abortions should be allowed in cases of rape pregnancy, which include many religious believers otherwise inclined against abortion, may challenge these three Catholic premises by claiming: 1) life does not begin at conception, and therefore we would allow for an abortion at some stage of pregnancy; 2) an unborn fetus does not have absolute rights to life (primarily, although not necessarily, because of its utter dependence on its mother), with mitigating factors overriding its limited claims to protection; 3) the circumstances of conception or pregnancy impact the mother’s rights to control her body, which might trump the rights of the fetus. Politicians wishing to adopt this approach should prepare themselves to passionately speak of the responsibilities taken upon consensual sexual activity. While affirming that life begins at birth, Mormons adopt the third approach, and therefore allow for abortions in the case of rape pregnancy, as publicized by Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign. While deeply rooted in biblical verses and religious belief, one Mormon elder, Dallin H. Oaks, has further explained this dispensation in terms of choice and moral agency. Women who voluntarily engage in sexual relations have chosen to risk pregnancy and must bear responsibility for that choice. However, in the case of rape or incest, “The woman has the moral as well as the legal right to an abortion because the condition of pregnancy is the result of someone else’s irresponsibility, not hers. She does not have to take responsibility for it. To force her by law to carry the fetus to term would be a further violation of her right.” In other words, even if life begins at conception, the mother has the right to abnegate accountability for this life since she never chose to take on such a moral responsibility. Should the victim decide to bring the baby to term, however, she has then chosen to take upon the moral obligation for its care (i.e. to raise the child or to place it for adoption). One might challenge this position by arguing that many moral obligations are imposed upon us against our will, even if it comes at great personal cost. For example, we would expect an airplane crash survivor on a desert island to care for the sole other survivor, a young child. Be that as it may, similar dispensations in rape pregnancies, albeit not necessarily for the same reasons, are issued by the Episcopal Church (followed by Carly Fiorina) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Accordingly, politicians wishing to adopt this approach should prepare themselves to passionately speak of the responsibilities taken upon consensual sexual activity, even as this might go against the grain of the mores of some Americans. Some Lessons from Orthodox Judaism Yet beyond understanding those denominations that allow exceptions in cases of rape pregnancies, it remains important for advocates of the Catholic or Southern Baptist position to appreciate the extent of the broad range of positions within the “pro-life” camp. In this regard, it pays to examine the approach of Orthodox Jewish law and the public policy stances Orthodox political organizations take. Undoubtedly, Jewish law clearly maintains a generally conservative outlook that rejects the pro-choice mantra of abortion on-demand. Based on select verses in Genesis, the Talmudic Sages concluded that as a general rule, feticide is prohibited under the seven Noahide laws for Jews and gentiles alike. As such, it remains prohibited to request or perform abortions not justified by Jewish law. In the initial weeks of pregnancy, the organism is like ‘mere water’ that does not receive the protective rights of a human. Yet instead of operating under one dominating moral claim, Jewish law introduces several ethical variables to address the complexities of the dilemma. While Orthodox Judaism has no centralized institution that issues authoritative rulings for its followers, various rulings of leading legal decisors reject, at least in part, all three premises of the Catholic position, and permit abortions in cases of rape, at least in the earlier stages of pregnancy. This nuanced approach, surveys indicate, reflects the sentiments of many Americans, who see “pro-life” versus “pro-choice” semantics as overly simplistic. For this reason, it pays for conservative candidates who are generally averse to abortion on-demand to pay attention to a biblically inspired moral perspective that may attract swing voters. When does Jewish law recognize the beginning of life? According to several Talmudic sources, Jewish law does not yet recognize a zygote or fetus as a full-fledged life force within the first 40 days of embryonic development from fertilization. This is roughly equivalent to the seventh to eighth week of gestational pregnancy, as calculated from the mother’s last menstrual period, the method of calculation most frequently used in medical circles. In the initial weeks of pregnancy, the organism is like “mere water” that does not receive the protective rights of a human. In fact, for limited legal purposes, Jewish law does not acknowledge the pregnancy for the first trimester, although the earlier date remains decisive in most legal contexts. To provide perspective on the consequences of these dates, note that according to the Centers for Disease Control, roughly 50 to 60 percent of all abortions in the United States take place by the seventh to eighth week of gestational pregnancy, while about 90 percent occur by the end of the first trimester. When a Fetus Becomes a Person Conservative critics of this position contend that Orthodox Jews are adopting an antiquated date that does not take into account contemporary knowledge of the continuous fetal development that occurs from fertilization. Some Orthodox bioethics respond that this terminus remains logical since until this point the physical features of the zygote have not yet developed, thereby precluding it from the status of a human. Only after the eighth week has the human structure more or less developed and the baby, now called a fetus, begins to develop functionally. The fact that the fetus might not yet achieve personhood is insufficient cause to destroying this future life. Whatever the scientific merits of this cutoff date, the Orthodox position distinctly reflects a certain intuition that at the earliest stages of development, the zygote is not a full-fledged human life. This seems particularly compelling when one recognizes that because of natural biological processes, the vast majority of conceptions do not actually result in pregnancies or births. Yet no Orthodox scholar liberally licenses an abortion before the fortieth day of gestation. Under normal circumstances, everything is done to save the fetus’ life, including violating the Sabbath, because of the deep value attributed to saving lives, including ones not yet born. The fact that the fetus might not yet achieve personhood is insufficient cause to destroying this future life. (In this respect, the Jewish perspective parallels the position of Aquinas and other medieval Christian thinkers who believed that life does not begin at conception, even as they still deemed abortion a grave sin.) As such, other mitigating considerations must be invoked—against the second assumption of the Catholic position—to override the obligation to protect this fetus, the scope of which relates to a deep-seated dispute between various Jewish scholars regarding the nature of the general prohibition against abortion. Based on verses in Exodus, the Jewish tradition has rejected equating feticide with homicide because before birth, a fetus does not have the complete status of a full-fledged human. If feticide is prohibited, but is not homicide, then what is it? Historically, many scholars viewed feticide as a lower-level form of manslaughter that is permitted only when it will save the mother’s life. In that case alone, we treat the fetus as a “rodef,” a potential assailant, and assert that “the mother’s blood is redder than that of the fetus,” so to speak. This includes cases of direct physiological danger as well as mental imbalance to the point of becoming suicidal. Otherwise, abortion remains a very severe offense. This position was adopted in the 1960s and 1970s by, amongst others, British Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, Israeli Chief Rabbi Isser Unterman, and America’s most prominent rabbinic decisor, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. Significantly, however, most asserted that feticide is not full-fledged homicide, especially when addressing a zygote or even within the first three months or before the fetus would be viable out of the womb. Nonetheless, it remains clear that according to this school of thought, one requires a very compelling reason to waive this fetus’ right to life, even at the earliest stages of pregnancy. Great Mental Anguish Can Be a Mitigating Factor Yet other scholars greatly reduced the severity of abortion, even as they firmly maintained its general prohibition. Some asserted that abortion falls under the general prohibition of battery, while others include it within a general rabbinic proscription of preventing the creation of life. These lenient assessments clearly allow for a broader range of dispensations, including cases in which the pregnancy might aggravate preexisting medical conditions that are not life-threatening. The Talmud asserts that when a pregnant woman sits on death row, we kill the fetus before the execution to prevent undue embarrassment to the mother. In fact, the Talmud asserts that when a pregnant woman sits on death row, we kill the fetus before the execution to prevent undue embarrassment to the mother. Consequently, one eighteenth-century scholar allowed a repentant married woman to abort following a consensual adulterous affair, since the fetus would have become an illegitimate child with severely limited marital rights while causing tremendous shame to the mother and her family. Although this wasn’t the case at hand, he further noted that by the same logic, one could also permit an abortion even for a single woman. Others strongly disagreed with this opinion, contending that such dispensations would encourage promiscuity and that the analogy to the Talmudic death row case is inappropriate since the fetus would anyway die with its executed mother. Be that as it may, on the basis of this Talmudic passage, the factor of great mental anguish or shame entered into the lexicon of mitigating circumstances for abortion. Some scholars complained that such a variable remains too fluid and subjective, while others limited its application to cases in which a woman would suffer from severe psychological paralysis or become suicidal. Yet many decisors asserted it remains a significant legal consideration which can be employed in a variety of situations. The most well-known application of this debate involved Tay-Sachs and other catastrophic genetic diseases. Adopting the more lenient approach, Rabbi Eliezer Waldenburg, head of Israel’s Supreme Rabbinical Court, allowed for an abortion up to the seventh month of gestation in part because of the torturous life the child would suffer, but also because of the severe mental anguish such a child would cause its parents. Feinstein and many others strongly opposed this, arguing that future deformities remain a moot point, especially after the first trimester when prenatal diagnosis of Tay-Sachs may be performed. What This All Implies for the Public Discussion Where does this all leave us with regard to abortion in the case of rape pregnancy? Naturally, choosing to raise the baby or placing it for adoption remains a viable and even encouraged option, if so desired. In fact, in a study published in “Victims and Victors: Speaking Out About Their Pregnancies, Abortions, and Children Resulting From Sexual Assault” (2000), up to 73 percent of women in this category carried their babies to term, which a significant majority choosing to raise the child. (Other studies show vastly different numbers, but even they claim that nearly 40 percent carry their child to term.) The Torah, in short, sees rape as an act of devastating physical and mental assault, akin to murder. As such, one should not assume that every rape victim wants to abort her fetus, and each case must be evaluated individually. But if the rape victim remains distraught at the prospect of carrying the child to term, raising significant fears for her mental well-being, what are the options? For starters, the consensus of contemporary rabbinic scholars agrees that the medical treatment given to rape victims should include post-coital steps to prevent pregnancy. Given the relatively weaker legal status of a zygote as well as the question whether medical intervention at this stage really functions as an abortifacient, Orthodox scholars do not have the same qualms or dilemmas found within the Catholic Church. It remains legitimate, as a matter of ethics and health-care policy, to provide treatments like morning-after pills. There is a similarly widespread consensus that within the first 40 days (i.e., even after the victim misses her first menstrual period), one can perform an abortion if one fears the pregnancy will cause continued mental anguish or psychological trauma. Of course, it can sometimes be difficult to make such an evaluation, as in the case of single women who get pregnant after consensual promiscuous sex and fear lasting emotional trauma and embarrassment. Yet as Rabbi Dr. Moshe Halevi Spero, an expert on psychology and Jewish law, has written, trauma from rape can lead to bona fide psychological torment covered by the “anguish” category. In this regard, we can add another mitigating argument which undermines the third assumption of the Catholic argument in ignoring the circumstances of conception. Addressing a case of post-rape pregnancy treatment, Rabbi Yehudah L. Perilman of Minsk (d. 1896) poignantly declared, “A woman is not like Mother Earth that she may be illegally sown against her will.” This claim, reminiscent of the Mormon argument cited earlier, recalls a striking biblical passage in which the Torah compares rape to murder. In describing why a rape victim is not penalized, the Torah declares, “But you shall do nothing to the girl, for the girl has committed no sin, for like a man who rises up against his fellow and murders him, so is this thing. For he found her in the field, and the betrothed girl cried out but she had no savior” (Deuteronomy 22:25-26). The Torah, in short, sees rape as an act of devastating physical and mental assault, akin to murder. Now one might fully sympathize with a victim—as I’m sure Catholics and Southern Baptists do—but argue that for various reasons this sympathy does not trump countering ethical considerations. Yet it strikes me that this sentiment, along with the reduced gravity of abortions within the initial stages of pregnancy, tip the scales within Jewish law toward allowing for abortions from rape pregnancies during this earlier period should concerns be raised for the victim’s emotional well-being. From Ethics to Public Policy How has this nuanced position play itself out on the political and legislative level? Given the complex balance between competing moral values and the need to evaluate each case on an individual basis, Orthodox political activists have consistently favored legislation that keeps abortion legal in cases of rape and incest, which matches current Israeli law. While other aspects of this code have remained somewhat controversial, this provision has been largely accepted without protest, with Israeli government further covering the costs of the operation. Orthodox political activists have consistently favored legislation that keeps abortion legal in cases of rape and incest. In America, the Orthodox Union’s advocacy center had repeatedly abstained from taking stances in the national abortion debate, seemingly contending that the Orthodox position does not get easily categorized as “pro-life” or “pro-choice.” Instead, it has more modestly argued for “workplace religions freedom” legislation that will allow a person to abstain from performing an abortion against his or her religious conscience. More radically, the political wing of the ultra-Orthodox umbrella group, Agudath Israel of America, has repeatedly filed legal briefs against any U.S. legislation that argues life begins at conception or that fetuses retain the status of personhood, even as they continue to claim that the rationale behind Roe v. Wade to define abortion as a fundamental right was flawed. Their legal counsel, David Zwiebel, has defended this policy in stating that they wish to protect the possibility of an abortion in cases when a woman’s life is endangered “or when a woman’s religious beliefs require that her pregnancy be terminated.” What cases are covered under that latter clause? They might want to protect the legal rights of those Jews who believe abortion is permitted in cases of genetic diseases. Yet I suspect they also want to ensure that if one of their adherents suffers from rape, she may be treated safely and legally. Accordingly, pro-life activists operating with monochromatic guidelines have not found political bedfellows with the Orthodox Jewish community on this issue, in spite of its generally prohibitive stance toward abortions-on-demand. To my mind, this is unfortunate, as Orthodox Jews should ideally be joining with other pro-life advocates (religion and non-religious alike) in advocating for a more conservative approach to abortion. This, in fact, would fulfill the broader commitment of teaching the ethos of the Noahide laws to wider society. Yet Jews have understandably feared that support for the “pro-life” camp would also abandon Judaism’s more nuanced approach to this deep ethical question. Given the strident insistence of many pro-life advocates to prohibit abortion in all cases, including those of rape, can one really blame these Orthodox political groups for not joining the broader cause? Don’t Overlook the Tragedy for the Mother The Orthodox Jewish vote, of course, is a tiny constituency. Yet pro-life abortion activists looking to win elections would be wise to look at this example and ask themselves a basic question: If a Bible-loving people who oppose abortion-on-demand refuse to join hands with us, how can we expect to draw swing voters afraid of our stance on this controversial issue? Ultimately, what’s at stake is the willingness of pro-life advocates to make compromises in public policy to create a big-tent conservatism that can win close elections. In this regard, Catholic and Southern Baptist thinkers might follow the example of Lord Jakobovits. A pioneer in the field of Jewish medical ethics and an outspoken participant in the public square, Jakobovits was a social conservative ideologically tied to Margaret Thatcher. When he was granted peerage, she remarked that she wished he were the Archbishop of Canterbury! In a widely-cited article written during the 1960s, Jakobovits initially wrote that abortion was only allowed to save the mother’s life, but never in the case of rape. However, in later versions of that essay, as well as in letter penned in 1982, he recognized that Jewish medical ethics had come to allow abortion in cases of rape. If a Bible-loving people who oppose abortion-on-demand refuse to join hands with us, how can we expect to draw swing voters afraid of our stance on this controversial issue? What caused this change? The extensive influence of Rabbi Waldenburg clearly played a role, but I suspect another factor impacted this shift. In his original article, Jakobovits attempted to debunk many liberal approaches which he believed encroached on the sanctity of life, a trend one finds throughout his writings. As such, one finds repeated references to the infinite value of life, such as his declaration that fetuses with severe genetic defects should not be aborted. “So long as the sanctity of life is recognized as inviolable, the cure to suffering cannot be abortion before birth, any more than murder (whether in the form of euthanasia or of suicide) after birth.” With regard to rape, he similarly declared, “The circumstances of such a conception cannot have any bearing on the child’s title to life, and in the absence of any well-grounded challenge to this title there cannot be any more justification for an abortion.” Such rhetoric had its place in the 1960s and still remains quite valuable, even as it underplays some of the nuances with Jewish medical ethics. I suspect Jakobovits later came to understand that even in the midst of significant culture wars, one cannot overlook the personal tragedy presented by rape, including its potential ability to trump the fetus’ claim to life. While fighting broader legal and ethics battles over the status of the fetus, one can allow for certain exceptions in difficult cases without losing the thunder of one’s broader agenda. It would, of course, be unethical and unreasonable to request such a shift from Catholics or Southern Baptists in their personal beliefs and actions. Yet pro-life advocates should ask themselves whether they can adopt—out of realpolitik considerations, if not from a place of moderate pluralism—a modest shift in public policy that would allow more Americans, religious and non-religious alike, to enter their camp. Is the pro-life camp willing to open its tents to those who deeply respect the life of a fetus but ultimately believe that the Bible compares rape, not abortion, to murder? The future of pro-life advocacy may hinge on this question. ","https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/28/conservatives-guide-talking-rape-religion-abortion/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"6",6,"‘Bojack Horseman’ Shows Why Art About Abortion Is Failing","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-08-03"," For years, abortion advocates have complained about the lack of film and TV storylines in favor of abortion. Millions of women have abortions each year, they argue, so why can’t movies and TV shows feature characters having abortions, much less having them survive as protagonists afterward? The first time the unborn child of a TV character was aborted was in 1972, and it’s happened intermittently since then. It’s never considered a great way to advance a plot for a major character on account of the stigma attached to killing humans. This stigma remains, despite the well-funded communication and lobbying efforts of those who support abortion practices.  Art tends to celebrate life, as the somewhat recent movies “Juno” and “Knocked Up” demonstrate. Both movies surround women who get pregnant outside of healthy relationships. And the plots of both movies are built around the women carrying the human life they created to term. The movies wouldn’t exist in any recognizable, much less comedic, sense if the female leads had snuffed out the baby. This is profoundly frustrating for abortion activists and their agents in the media. The media, the courts, and artists themselves couldn’t be much more supportive of abortion. Some abortion activists have put out studies funded by the abortion lobby trying to shame Hollywood into more positive abortion storytelling. Strident abortion supporter Katha Pollitt wrote the book “PRO,” part of which is devoted to getting abortion-positive storylines in the media. ‘Finally, a Romantic Comedy about Abortion’ But popular opinion continues to regard abortion as a tragedy, not something to be celebrated. So they were elated by last year’s release of “Obvious Child.” So subtle and nuanced a treatment of abortion that it was marketed by NARAL and supported by Planned Parenthood and National Organization of Women, it could not have been praised more by critics activists. “The most winning abortion-themed rom-com ever made,” a critic from an unknown website quoted on the movie’s poster announced, an honorific akin to “least dirty rest stop on the Jersey Turnpike.” “Finally, a romantic comedy about abortion,” gushed the Los Angeles Times. “Someone finally made an honest abortion movie,” enthused Slate abortion enthusiast cum film critic Amanda Hess. To round out the Slate opinion, Dana Stevens praised the movie as perfect before saying, “I have the feeling this modest little 83-minute comedy will reverberate like a gunshot in our national conversation about abortion.”  The New York Times gave it repeated attention, including a 1,300-word tribute. Another New York Times piece encouraged mothers to watch the film with their 14-year-old daughters to get them comfortable with having an abortion. Cosmopolitan said it was an abortion fairy tale, the summer’s most important movie. NPR said “A Momentous Film Of Small, Embarrassing Truths.” Media outlets gave out free passes to see the film and drum up excitement. Variety said it was a “fresh and funny chronicle … quickly racking up some of this year’s best word of mouth.” It said it was going to be a huge hit. It was promoted on all the late-night shows. The filmmaker was so agenda-driven that she asked Planned Parenthood to vet the script. Yet the actress who played the abortive mother claimed “Our film is not an agenda movie in any way,” before saying the point of the movie is that there is nothing wrong with abortions. Even after all that promotion and the combined efforts of Planned Parenthood, NARAL, NOW, other abortion lobby groups, and a generally liberal critic class, the movie was a clunker. As in, all the promotional efforts in the world couldn’t get it to gross more than $3 million. That other indie film “Juno,” by contrast, grossed $231,411,584. So if all the resources of the abortion lobby couldn’t generate excitement around an abortion rom-com, what about all the brilliant talent of the “Bojack Horseman” writers?  The Best Show on TV Takes on Abortion Netflix’s “BoJack Horseman” is a top-rated show about a humanoid horse, an alcoholic who hates himself. During the 1990s, he was the star of the popular sitcom “Horsin’ Around,” playing the adoptive father of three orphaned children. It was a huge hit, financing his subsequent decades of unfulfilled but high living in Hollywood. Bojack wants meaning and dignity in his life, and the show is about his failed attempts to gain those things. It is heartbreakingly depressive, beautifully written, and the best show on television. The third season was released in late July. This trailer sums up where we are:  Bojack’s former ghostwriter/current social media guru Diane Nguyen is a human married to a complex but good natured golden retriever named Mr. Peanutbutter. They’re experiencing marital difficulties but love each other very much. Diane accidentally takes some hallucinogenics that enable her to finally express to Mr. Peanutbutter just how much she loves him and wants their marriage — his third — to work. Just as that happens, she finds out she’s pregnant. Both immediately announce they want her to abort the child. An episode built around abortion should be perfect for the writers of Bojack. The show is about death, dying, growing old, bad decision-making, self-hatred, depression, and failure — and somehow milks poignant comedy from it all. Instead, the abortion episode was a huge disappointment. Here are three ways that the writers of Bojack filed their own show. 1) It Was Too Simplistic For being a cartoon show about humans and humanoid animals, this show has remarkable depth. As Rolling Stone put it in the preview above, it’s “emotionally hardcore.” The stories are complicated and tangled. Nobody is a good guy. Nobody is one-dimensional. The bad actions taken by the characters might break your heart, but they have understandable motivations. It’s a painful show to watch, not an easy one. This episode was easy as pie. It was an uncomplicated exploration of how abortion was great and how there were no good arguments against it. Or as cartoonist Seamus Coughlin mocked, “Bravest. Show. Ever.” I’m sitting there, my jaw nearly on the floor. Abortion is okay? Planned Parenthood is good? The issue is about women’s choice and nothing else? You can imagine my shock at hearing these kinds of messages from the mouths of Hollywood voice actors. And what’s this? They’re poking fun at pro-lifers? Not even seriously addressing a single argument from the other side of the aisle? Good for them! For years and years, Hollywood has been modestly tip-toeing around this issue, horrified of imposing their values on middle America, but not any more! They’re sick and tired of giving the pro-life movement their fair shake! No more dialogue with you right-wing bullies, everyone’s already familiar with your positions, Hollywood has been representing them for long enough! Now is the time to be blunt: if you don’t agree with abortion, you are backwards and you hate women. These and many other original, valuable insights made by BoJack and Co. make a welcome new addition to the already rock solid case for abortion on-demand and without stigma. That may be what you expect from, oh I don’t know, Amy Schumer, but not from people playing their comedic A game week after week. To be fair, even though this episode was disappointing in its shallowness, it wasn’t a complete trainwreck. It started out downright promising when Mr. Peanutbutter demurs about what he wants Diane to do by saying, “There’s no ‘I’ in uterus, there’s only ‘us.'” He adds, “And ‘u,’ and another ‘u.’ (But that’s the “u” that’s in ‘us,’ so I already said that ‘u.’)” But in general, Coughlin’s commentary is right. There is a comedically unchallenging scene of a cable TV anchor (voiced by Keith Olbermann) interviewing “a panel of white men in bow ties to talk about abortion.” They each produce straw man arguments, such as “This is not just a woman’s issue. I’m a man, but if I got pregnant, would I put my life on hold for a child I didn’t want? Yes, I would. I can say that with confidence, because I will never have to make that decision, so I’m unbiased.” Yawn. Another says his abortion conspiracy theory is rooted in “the Bible.” If one wanted the stupidity of a network sitcom, one would watch a network sitcom. 2) It Undermined Its Own Themes The entire arc of the show is Bojack’s life being ruined because he is unable to accept responsibility for his actions or even tell the truth about himself. The repercussions of his failures in intimate relationships is a major plot driver. The meaninglessness and shallowness of entertainment is a frequent topic. Diane, who was previously a love interest of Bojack’s, has a parallel storyline. She wants to be an empowered woman who finds meaning in her work, but she ends up in a stable relationship with a loving celebrity dog, and in an unfulfilling line of work. “You’re not good enough at this job to be too good for this job,” Princess Caroline tells her at one point. Like Bojack, she had a horrible childhood that messed her up. Also like Bojack, she’s horrible with intimacy. HaramBWHe, a Bojack fan who blogged about the disappointing shallowness of the episode, noted that Bojack’s low-point the previous season was when he tried to steal an old friend from her husband, didn’t care about her feelings, and then corrupted her 17-year-old daughter. Similarly, Diane’s reason for getting an abortion was simply ‘I don’t want kids.’ She doesn’t particularly care about the other two people directly involved in the situation (Mr. Peanutbutter, and her unborn child). She shows no real interest in how her actions affect anybody else. Rather than consider other people, both born and unborn, she makes an instant decision to do what she feels will make her happy. But instead of exploring the potential damage of her actions, the episode wraps up neatly and without any conflict between any of the main characters.
The fact that she is so averse to having a child is fertile ground for a fuller analysis of her character, from her background as a neglected girl in a family full of boys, to her current situation as a celebrity’s wife with a dead-end career. It is a shame that they did not take it in that direction…
The writers could have opened up the point to analyze how Diane’s abortion was an incredibly selfish act. She conceives a child with her loving husband, a man (well, dog) of means and stature. Then it could have been expanded to point out that the characters in this show are largely self-centered and miserable, and those two things go hand-in-hand.
They could have gone that direction, but they resolved the story without ever really exploring these topics. The story was wrapped up with a fairly neat ‘Diane has an abortion, ends up feeling okay about it. Also it’s good for women to open up and talk about abortion.’ This is a show where characters have relatively minor life events that inspire introspection. But abortion was NBD? Also, what about the recurring theme of the meaninglessness of entertainment? In the trailer above, Bojack says something to the effect of, “If I win an Oscar, my life will have meaning!” Time and again the characters try to squeeze real-life meaning out of parts they played, only to find out that the fleeting nature of television and film is no match for the day-after-day grind of relationship building. The abortion episode features a pop starlet releasing an abortion single, which you can watch here:  She jokes in lyric and video about a targeted and violent killing of the life in her womb. Diane is worried that the song will hurt the abortion cause (more on that in a bit). Just before she kills her own unborn child, though, she talks to a human at the abortion clinic who insists the song is deeply meaningful. “She is so cool. Sextina’s music makes me feel strong, like I can do anything,” the young woman says. When Diane protests, she says, “You get that it’s a joke, right?” And then she adds, “Getting an abortion is scary. With all the protesters out front, how you have to listen to the heartbeat and all that. When you can joke about it, it makes it less scary, you know? Yeah.” Perfectly good writing for an after-school special about how abortion is totes awesome. But for Bojack, it’s a complete betrayal of the larger themes of the show. As one brilliant writer with a protected Twitter account Tristyn Bloom noted, “A major theme of the show is how sad it is that people rely on hollow entertainment to fill their lives and give them hope. So when the woman at the end says something earnest and reasonable sounding about the impact [the abortion song] had on her life, you wonder, is this a blind spot for the writers? Is entertainment sad when it’s glorifying suburban family life but important and beautiful when it flatters controversial moral stances?” 3) The Worst Part: It Was Not Funny Enough Comedians can get away with anything provided they’re funny. Louis CK took some heat for his “Saturday Night Live” opening about pedophilia, but he would have been destroyed if it hadn’t been funny. The episode was fine, but it placed preachy politics over comedy. There were parts that were identical to Amy Schumer’s not-groundbreaking abortion sketches. There were parts that were identical to NARAL’s horrifically unfunnny “Comedians In Cars Getting Abortions.” It was almost as if the Bojack writers were operating from a Planned Parenthood playbook, as if there had been some ghoulish agreement to insert the exact same unfunny and untrue characterizations of pro-lifers in each bit. To be fair, this general political approach was cheered by the A.V. Club’s Les Chapell, who wrote that it reminded him of the Planned Parenthood/NARAL vehicle “Obvious Child.” Of the Olbermann panel, Chapell wrote, “This entire scene is a straight-up glorious ‘f*** the patriarchy’ moment, presenting clearly defined models for everyone who’s taken a stance on a woman’s right to choose and showing just how callow and hypocritical those opinions are.” So if propaganda is your comedic vehicle of choice, you might exit now for the nearest “Funny or Die” clapback. When Diane is preparing to get her abortion, a doctor is telling her she’ll need to look at an ultrasound and listen to the heartbeat of the child she’s about to abort. This is put in the show to mock informing women about what abortion does to an unborn child. The writers add silly things like, “Also, by law, I have to tell you that at one month, your puppies have a favorite color and that color may be blue.” and “Also, before your procedure, you’ll need to watch 20 hours of cute puppy videos as Sarah McLachlan’s ‘I Will Remember You’ plays softly.” NARAL’s pro-abortion propaganda had the same bit. Diane is upset by the pop star’s abortion single for political reasons and political reasons alone! We get so little exploration of Diane’s emotions — about abortion, or about the single — that it’s bizarre. “My concern is that you’re actually giving the pro-life movement something to latch onto as an example of … I really think we have the chance to say something here, and all we’re saying is Pshew pshew pow.” She adds, “everyone’s listening to you now. Soon people are gonna get bored and move onto the next thing and you’ll hate yourself that you weren’t able to make a difference when you had the chance.” The only introspection in a show that is otherwise known for intense emotional omphaloskepsis is when Diane says, “I know from the outside, it might seem like I should be ready for kids, but I can’t.” Mr. Peanutbutter says, “Diane, you don’t need to explain anything to anyone.” What a disappointment. The show writers didn’t need to write a pro-choice or a pro-life show. But they did owe it to their viewers to present Diane as a real person whose character is the same depressed, deeply conflicted, angst-ridden character battling demons as she is in each and every other episode. Bojack has previously been quite brave in taking on Hollywood values or the lack thereof. Bojack has previously been willing to hold up a mirror at our own selfishness, shallowness, and dangerous decision making. Why not now? If “Bojack Horseman” writers can’t write thoughtfully about abortion, maybe it’s time for the abortion rights movement to give up on the goal altogether. It was obvious that good art about abortion couldn’t be done with one-sided preaching such as that from “Obvious Child,” NARAL propaganda videos, or Amy Schumer’s sketches. None of these give even passing consideration to the seriousness of ending a human life after it’s begun, or a culture that accepts such death as the price of sexual liberation. If any show could pull this off, it’s “Bojack Horseman,” which is a rare combination of hilarious and elegiac. That they tried and failed isn’t just an indictment of how our culture treats lives as disposable; it’s a devastating pro-life argument, even when it’s unintentional.

"7",7,"Abortion Doesn’t Just Kill The Child, It Psychologically Kills The Mother","Morabito","Stella",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-01-28"," As human beings, we all have preferred realities that live in our heads. It’s natural to think everybody else should adopt our personal preferences because then, at least to us, it seems our personal lives would be easier. When something conflicts with our preferred reality, we tend to go into denial about it. This is especially true for major and irreversible actions––those really big gaps between our preferred reality and the facts that can’t be reversed. Hence, denial, and a lot of it. So it is with abortion. The illusion of choice is that abortion doesn’t hurt anybody. Women who openly regret their abortions shatter that illusion. They shine light on the truth that the act of abortion is deeply damaging to women, as well as lethal to children. This frightens pro-abortion activists, who prefer and propagate the propaganda line that abortion regret is a “myth.” We can call them regret deniers.  The central problem is that actual reality––otherwise known as the truth––doesn’t care what you or I think about anything at all. Reality is always out there, like it or not. Abortion, for example, produces dead people. That’s reality. As long as we are a society that at least pays lip service, to varying degrees, to the sanctity of (most) human life, it’s a reality that still, so far, has a grip on our consciences. Pretending It’s About ‘Empowerment’ People can pretend abortion produces something else, like “choice” or “empowerment.” They can even agree it’s killing and say it’s still no big deal, as more bold-faced abortion activists are increasingly doing these days. But no amount of verbal or emotional gymnastics will ever change the fact that abortion produces dead people. Since nobody ever gets a chance to meet the deceased, it’s easier to pretend they never existed. But we all know they existed, because their existence was the very reason their lives were terminated. The pro-choice editors of the journal California Medicine made this very point in 1970, just a couple of years prior to the Roe v. Wade decision. Here’s a tidy excerpt from that article that predicts the sharpening divide between abortion regret and regret denial (emphasis mine):  It has been necessary to separate the idea of abortion from the idea of killing, which continues to be socially abhorrent. The result has been a curious avoidance of the scientific fact, which everyone really knows, that human life begins at conception and is continuous whether intra- or extra-uterine until death. The very considerable semantic gymnastics which are required to rationalize abortion as anything but taking a human life would be ludicrous if they were not often put forth under socially impeccable auspices. The laughable reference to “socially impeccable auspices” presumably refers to Planned Parenthood and its ilk. In any case, the article pretty much argues that our old ethic, that life is sacred, has not yet been replaced by a new ethic––that the value of human life is “relative.” So while we’re in the process of changing our ethics, the editors brazenly add that “this schizophrenic sort of subterfuge is necessary.” Regret Denial at the March For Life At one end of the debate over abortion regret are the women who openly regret their abortions and have come to terms with reality in order to heal. At the other end are those who vehemently deny the existence of regret, or protest (methinks too much) that abortion regret is very “rare.” I observed both sides in action at the recent March for Life. There had to be at least 150,000 marchers this year. It was a massive turnout. Among them were many women who carried signs saying “I regret my abortion,” as part of the Silent No More campaign. Prior to the March for Life, some of the regretters––along with many pro-life demonstrators––were in front of the Supreme Court building, the endpoint of the march. There were also about two dozen pro-choice counter-protesters gathered there at the time. (They dispersed with the massive arrival of the marchers an hour or so later.) I watched as one regretter gave personal, heartfelt testimony. Then the counter-protesters went into full denial mode.   They tried to drown her out with loud chants of “Facts not given!” Of course, facts are exactly what they were hiding from, or they wouldn’t have been so defensive, or acted so threatened by a few women who talked about personal experiences of grief, pain, and healing. Watching the deniers was like watching children who cover their ears and shout “I can’t hear you!” when confronted with something they don’t want to hear. Regretters of abortion often testify about being haunted by visions of the sons and daughters they never knew. They are dealing with death, after all. As Elisabeth Kubler-Ross spelled out in her modern classic “On Death and Dying,” the first of the five stages of grief is denial. The emotionally stable person arrives at the final stage––acceptance––after going through mid-stages Kubler-Ross identified as anger, bargaining (rationalizing), and depression. If you are forever stuck in the denial and anger stages, you’ll never be able to find wholeness and healing. But by coming to terms with the reality, abortion regretters go through the stages of grieving. The anger stage is probably magnified for many who felt coerced into their abortion by boyfriends, family members, counselors, or others. (An acquaintance in college cried hard when she told me about her abortion, adding, “It really makes you hate men.”) Those who heal name their aborted children, in order to validate that a relationship was broken. In the end, they are able to find some peace. Abortion does more than kill a child in utero. It’s also an act of virtual assisted suicide because it kills the mother of that child. It kills any tangible relationship between the two. Regretters can feel that wound, and only by recognizing the destroyed relationship can they move on. Abortion Is About A Broken Relationship The deniers of abortion regret definitely seemed to be dealing with open wounds they fear to address. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more angst-filled, confused, and bitter group of people. As one abortion regretter told me on the spot, the deniers are suffering deeply but are stuck in the lies. She remembers what it was like to be in that place. By contrast, the regretters struck me as very calm and at peace. They were engaging, clear-eyed, and had a lot of personal warmth. Kevin Burke and Janet Morana work in post-abortion ministries and co-authored a very insightful Public Discourse essay about the wounds abortion inflicts on women. Their key point is that “Abortion is fundamentally about relationship, a relationship that is broken by the procedure—and one that desperately needs to be healed.” This paragraph is key: For a woman to consider abortion her best option, she must reject any intuitive sense that she is already a mother to her child. This denial, whether conscious or unconscious, is the beginning of a powerful conflict between the natural love of a parent for her developing child and a pressing need to repress this truth of the human heart, burying any painful feelings and memories of the abortion. The enduring consequences of this internal conflict can contribute to the common symptoms experienced after abortion, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and sleep disturbance. David Reardon is a biomedical ethicist who has done extensive research on the effects of abortion on women. In this article he quotes extensively from pro-choice activist Linda Bird Francke’s 1981 book “The Ambivalence of Abortion,” which is out of print and difficult to obtain. Reardon then cites some of his research about how most women eventually confront their regrets: Abortion is such a profound event in one’s life, that one must either thoughtfully integrate it into one’s life, or fearfully suppress it. Neither is easy. The former requires great fortitude and honesty. The latter is simply unhealthy. It is a fundamental principle of psychiatry that suppression of emotions is the cause of numerous psychological and physical ailments. Suppressed feelings create their own internal pressures, sap emotional energy, and cause turmoil in one’s life until they burst forth in a way which can no longer be ignored.
Suppression and denial are the most common means of coping with abortion. Between 60 and 70 percent of women who eventually confronted negative feelings about their abortions admit that there was a period of time during which they would have denied to others and themselves any regrets or negative feelings. On average, this period of denial was about five years, with a low of one month and a high of twenty years. More Denial Coping Mechanisms Are on Display Today Denial is an ancient coping mechanism humans use when we can’t come to terms with reality. It seems to have hardened as the propaganda media force-feeds the public a strict diet of illusions. Deniers seem to be hard at work to prop up hookup culture, and all manner of destructive acts that cause people pain, grief, and emptiness. As promoters of abortion get more desperate to prop up its illusions, they display more manifestations of denial that are increasingly ridiculous and cruel. Consider the recent campaign to “Shout your Abortion!” complete with an illustrated coffee table book ordering woman to express happiness and pride in their abortions. One clear intent of “shouting” is to drown out the voices of those who feel sadness or grief about their abortions, as demonstrated by the deniers at the Supreme Court building. One of the authors of “Shout Your Abortion,” Amelia Bonow, even staged a video of herself talking about her abortion to a bunch of children, basically hounding them to applaud abortion. Her exercise was especially ghoulish since children are the people most likely to have instinctive qualms about abortion, as well as about being ridiculed if they disagree. As if that’s not enough, there’s a macabre new genre called abortion comedy. It’s led by “comedians” like Michelle Wolf and a group calling itself the “Ladyparts Justice League.” The whole idea is literally a case of whistling past the graveyard. I suppose they believe that if they just crack enough jokes about abortion, they’ll feel good about it. Yet another offshoot of denial is the attempt to mimic the success of the regretters’ Silent No More campaign of testimonials. The idea of their campaign, called “Draw the Line,” is to get celebrities and others to open up and talk, talk, talk, and talk some more about their abortions as a good thing. But regret has a way of slipping through those cracks because the reality of what abortion is and what it does to mother and child never changes. Celebrities Express Regret about Abortions Even celebrities who claim to support abortion have expressed regret, often in their work, but in interviews as well. Consider that, in 2014, Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac confirmed to Billboard Magazine that her hit song “Sara,” with its haunting lyrics of sorrow and loss, referred to a child she aborted. In the 1950s, the Academy Award-winning actress Pat Neal aborted the child she had with Gary Cooper. In her autobiography, “As I Am,” Neal stated that she grieved her entire life over that child. Although she later had five children, she wrote: “If I had only one thing to do over in my life, I would have that baby.” Writer Alice Walker said she was lucky to have a safe abortion before it was legal, but she struggled with anxiety and depression afterwards, and wrote a short story about it called “To Hell With Dying.” Some who specifically state they have no regrets about their abortions go on to show that the experience affected them deeply and not for the best. Sharon Osborne told The Daily Mail “I’d never recommend it to anyone, because it comes back to haunt you.” Sinead O’Connor told Elle Magazine that she wrote the song “My Special Child” after her abortion. According to Penny Marshall, “That situation was one of my life’s only big regrets.” Nicki Minaj said “It has haunted me my entire life.” She also wrote a song about it called “All Things Go,” with the line “My child with Aaron would’ve been 16 any minute.” One of the saddest and strangest attempts at denial and rationalizing is that of songwriter Ani Difranco. She claims to be a big supporter of no-qualms abortion. The song she wrote about her clinic experience, “The Lost Woman,” contains a lot of predictable pro-abort sentiments: how she crossed a line of pro-life protesters at the clinic, how great the clinic staff was, and how she won’t sacrifice her freedom of choice, etc. An interesting twist is that DiFranco dedicated that song to the poet Lucille Clifton (1936-2010), who was twice a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Within DiFranco’s song is the line “Lucille, your voice still sounds in me.” Why does Lucille’s voice still sound in DiFranco? Is it simply a political statement? Is it simply because Clifton’s abortion wasn’t legal while DiFranco had the presumed benefit of legality? In her song, DiFranco claims her abortion was “a relatively easy tragedy” compared to Clifton’s. But she still calls it a tragedy. DiFranco’s song seethes with contradictions while insisting that the woman must reign supreme, although there’s no mention of any child. It’s basically a tribute to the triumph of self-will. Yet she claims, right after saying “My heart hit absolute zero,” that Lucille’s voice “sounds in” her. Why? It’s worth peeling back a layer, and going directly to Clifton’s poem, entitled “The Lost Baby Poem.” Clifton provides a lot more clarity and honesty about what the lost relationship does to the mother. She grieved for the person of her baby. Clifton testifies to actually seeing and experiencing the reality of the death of the child as a person. She speaks directly to him. In short, Lucille’s is a voice of remorse, while DiFranco’s is more like a cover-up, like regret denialism. What Clifton Wrote about Her Abortion A big part of the lure of abortion is the belief that abortion-on-demand shields women from the harsh realities. That way they are more able to deny it and “get on with life.” Clifton describes this bait-and-switch in a cri de coeur at the beginning of her “The Lost Baby Poem:” the time i dropped your almost body down
down to meet the waters under the city
and run one with the sewage to the sea
what did i know about waters rushing back
what did i know about drowning
or being drowned What do we know about denial of abortion regret? Why don’t we understand that reality has a way of coming back at us like rushing waters to haunt and drown us?

"8",8,"Injury, Infertility, And Death From Chemical Abortions Are A-OK With The FDA","Stone Hamrick","Kristi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-01-12"," Big changes are coming in abortion law as the Supreme Court contemplates the many flaws of Roe v. Wade in the context of Mississippi’s limit on abortion at almost four months of pregnancy and beyond. Roe could go or be significantly weakened, returning the issue of abortion to the states where people could have a voice and a vote.



But Corporate Abortion wants to be sure that the death toll stays on the rise from abortion and is willing to sacrifice their customers—women having abortions—in their zeal to ensure that babies don’t draw their first breath. As the Senate prepares to take up President Joe Biden’s pick for Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf, a force for deregulated chemical abortion pills in the Obama administration, it’s vital to understand the changes in abortion policy now affecting abortion industry tactics for years to come.



In December, the FDA (the virtual Keystone Kops of science that handled the opioid and COVID catastrophes with equal skill, according to the Biden administration’s FDA nominee) bowed to the wishes of their friends in the abortion lobby (and their bosses) deciding that the pesky health and safety standards in place to ensure that women don’t suffer injury, infertility, or death from chemical abortion had to go.



Consider that early in 2021, the day the FDA pulled a COVID vaccine after one woman died, we learned that they were loosening restrictions on chemical abortion pills even though 26 women are confirmed dead from chemical abortion pill complications. Perhaps they figure since death is the goal of chemical abortion pills, what’s one more? 



But in their diminutive wisdom, the Biden-supervised science guys decided that no-test online abortion pill distribution was just the thing to dump onto America’s strained health-care system. In their words, health and safety had to go “to minimize the burden on the health care delivery system” and because they said they found “that the benefits of the drug outweigh(ed) the risks.”



Risk to whom? The abortion vendor risks nothing, sending pills through the mail to whoever claims to be pregnant, abandoning the recipients to whatever happens next. Nothing says “we care” like the FDA’s new, easy access to abortion pills, especially for the likes of sex offenders or sex traffickers looking to cover up crimes, to name just two of the demographics excited about this change. 



To assist in understanding this experiment in DIY health care, here are a few facts to ponder. 



1. These Pills Kill



Chemical abortion pills cause four times the complications as surgical abortion, with a risk of death that is ten times higher, according to a National Institute of Health Study. In fact, 26 women have died that we know of, reports the errant FDA. Some abortion activists try to argue that the pills are safe for a lot of women, which is slim comfort to those who die taking them. 



Consider that most people won’t die in their car or in any accident, but we still wear seat belts just in case. Leave it to the FDA to abandon the women risking death just because not everyone will die, which doesn’t seem to be their universal policy. (Is this a good time to note that lots more people are wearing masks than will ever die of COVID?) 



2. Women Can Be Sterilized



Consider that 15 percent of the population has Rh-negative blood, which means that when the blood of a pregnant woman mingles with her child in birth, miscarriage, or abortion, she will need treatment to prevent antibodies forming that could attack a future child, leading to miscarriages and infertility. As an Rh-negative mother, I’ve had multiple shots through four healthy pregnancies to treat that reality.



But abortionists don’t want to deal with that anymore because it’s a pain to stock the needed drugs, they write in the journal Contraception. As they put it: “Early abortion continues to expand outside of traditional clinics, through telemedicine, self-managed medication abortion, or in smaller offices that do not specialize in obstetrical care. Consequently, requiring Rh testing and anti-D immunoglobulin as part of abortion care is becoming a barrier.”



It’s a barrier to their quick money and a “hassle” if they actually had to treat a woman with a blood test and an injection, but not so much for the woman who may want her fertility to survive a chemical abortion. 



3. DIY Abortion Isn’t Working



Women continue to need real medical care after exposure to chemical abortion. From Charlotte Lozier: “The rate of abortion-related emergency room visits following a chemical abortion increased over 500% from 2002 through 2015, according to an analysis of Medicaid claims data.  Over the same period, chemical abortions within the study population increased from 4.4% to 34.1% of total abortions” (emphasis added). 



So, at a time in which COVID cases are on the rise, with many stories on strained emergency care, the FDA thinks it’s a good idea to ship out pills that cause extreme bleeding and complications, which we know has already resulted in increased pressure on emergency care.



4. Hear No Evil, See No Evil



Corporate Abortion is refusing to screen for the two, well-known risks of death with a widely available technology. Women have died when taking chemical abortion pills later in pregnancy or when they are experiencing an ectopic pregnancy (one that implants in a mother’s body, outside the womb). A simple ultrasound test can check for both, but why bother when the FDA lets you off the hook? 



5. It’s a Boys’ Club for Big Abortion



After seven men wiped out all the pro-life laws in the country in Roe v. Wade, abortion became big business. Planned Parenthood and company later turned to Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden when they wanted to force a French drug company to allow their concoction on the U.S. market and then expand their sales. 



As CNN reported when Clinton made his Faustian deal in 2000, he convinced Roussel-Uclaf to give a patent to the U.S. Population Council (founded by 1950s men like John D. Rockefeller) that gave rights to Danco Laboratories (that set up business with money titan David Packard among others) that started a secret manufacturing process that has led to chemical abortion pills used to end 54 percent of pregnancies aborted by nine weeks.



If that sounds suspicious and complicated, well, you could be right, because what could go wrong with shipping drugs that cause death and extreme bleeding to women across America? You trust secret, corporate backroom deals for your health-care, right? Can anyone think of a time in which buying drugs from unknown manufacturers has caused any issues? 



6. The World Is Not Enough



As soon as the ink dried on the FDA’s ringing endorsement of death by mail, one of the nation’s leading abortion “experts” and researcher, Dr. Daniel Grossman, took to virtual pages of The Nation to attack a provision of the regulations in place since 2000 that had survived the FDA’s review.



As part of the deal in which Danco was created to run the drugs, those selling them were supposed to register and promise to report complications, among other things. Tracking the traffickers and complications was truly the least they could do and is not a new criterion. It’s old news.



But apparently the risk of a virtual papercut troubles the good doctor, who feels strongly that nothing should stand between his desire to push pills and any effort at all. Corporate Abortion apparently wants a participation trophy for medical care, points just for showing up, no points lost for losing the patient, and bonus points if a baby dies.



7. Trust But Never Verify



Also, in his “analysis” of the FDA’s free for all, Grossman repeated the canard about just how “safe” chemical abortion is. But there is one problem with that whopper, the complications of abortion pills are not tracked like Tylenol or Viagra, and abortion is not tracked liked childbirth data. 



The United States has no National Abortion Reporting law, so all we think we know about abortion “safety” comes from the pinky swear promises of abortion vendors nationwide, voluntary data given to perhaps the Centers for Disease Control or the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, and four states, including California, report nothing at all.



In fact, Planned Parenthood goes to court to stop reporting of abortion data, offended apparently that we don’t believe their insistence that there is nothing to see behind the closed doors of Corporate Abortion. Given all the certainty that abortion in general, and chemical abortion pills in particular, are safe, does this mean a pro-life, pro-choice consensus has finally taken place, with all of us calling for a full accounting of just what happens to the women exposed to abortion? I hesitate to hold my breath on that one. 



8. You Can Take It Back



The one story unreported by all the media frenzied in their love for death by mail is the fact that, should a woman act quickly, she can reverse the impact of these deadly drugs. In the United States, an abortion pill regime is a two-step process in which the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol are used together to deliberately end a life. The first drug starves a baby by cutting off the pregnancy hormone known as progesterone. 



As detailed in Students for Life of America’s “This Is Chemical Abortion” docuseries, the impact of the first of the abortion pills can be reversed by flooding the woman with more progesterone. In fact, more than 2,500 babies have been born as living proof of that, although that’s sadly not nightly news.



Corporate Abortion’s objection to women having that kind of information seems strange at first glance. After all, they’ve made their sales of the pills and can walk away. But the interests of the death lobby are clear: no information that interferes with the widespread sale and use of chemical abortion is to be tolerated. 



If you needed convincing that elections have consequences, a recklessly expanded abortion pill market is a case in point. All of this now leads to coming battles at the state level, where courageous legislators will have to do the job that the FDA has refused, protecting, and defending women from a predatory industry that wants death by mail no matter the cost in human suffering.



Corporate Abortion has made it clear that, to sell abortions, they are willing even to sacrifice the women getting them as well as the innocent, preborn babies. But the Pro-Life Generation is not, and we will see you in statehouses nationwide in 2022.

"9",9,"3 Negative Consequences From Not Prosecuting Parents For Obtaining Abortions","Boorman","Georgi",NA,"Silberman, James",NA,NA,"2019-05-21"," In March 1994, in Florida, 19-year-old mother Kawana Michele Ashley put a pillow over her stomach and “fired a .22 caliber pistol into the right side of her womb” in order to kill her six-month-old unborn daughter. Shot in the wrist, her baby was delivered by C-section and died of kidney failure two weeks later. In May 1997, in Georgia, Jacquelyn Aretha Hillman, a 19-year-old single mother, shot herself in the stomach and killed her unborn child. She was eight months pregnant.  In Virginia, in March 2006, 22-year-old mother Tammy Wynette Skinner intentionally shot herself in the stomach the day she was supposed to give birth, after having contemplated “several ways to abort her child, including punching herself in the stomach and drinking bleach.” Her baby would have been named Kysharia. In all of these cases, prosecution for the crimes of criminal abortion, murder, and manslaughter was dropped. The perpetrators could not be held liable because the statutes under which they were being prosecuted only applied to situations in which a third party committed the crime. As the Florida Supreme Court put it, the court would not “pit woman against fetus.” Yet it is obvious that these mothers had pitted themselves against their unborn babies. This ugly truth is not overshadowed by the law’s refusal to acknowledge it. A Miscarriage of Justice These miscarriages of justice can’t be blamed on pro-choicers. These three children did not receive the justice they deserved because pro-life legislators and lobbyists have insisted that women are always victims in the abortion act, even if they do it themselves. When they aren’t the victim of an abortionist, they’re a victim of difficult circumstances, of poor mental health, or of society more generally.  These prosecutions weren’t dropped due to psychotic breaks or evidence of duress, though. They were dropped because pro-life statutes are intentionally written to exempt mothers from liability. Georgia’s Code Section 16-12-140 is a prime example: (a) A person commits the offense of criminal abortion when, in violation of Code Section 16-12-141 , he or she administers any medicine, drugs, or other substance whatever to any woman or when he or she uses any instrument or other means whatever upon any woman with intent to produce a miscarriage or abortion. Any self-described pro-lifer should feel a flush of rage and heartbreak when reading about these cases. Heartbreak that a child died by the hands of his own mother; rage that no real justice was done on his behalf. Yet leaders of the pro-life movement proudly proclaim that women will not be prosecuted for abortions under heartbeat laws. When smart, sincere pro-life thinkers like David French casually gloss over a court case in which a woman shot her own unborn child and wasn’t convicted for it, as if the horror of both the crime and the lack of justice isn’t at least worth mentioning, we have a problem. When based on model legislation written by organizations like National Right to Life, Susan B. Anthony List, and Faith 2 Action, every piece of pro-life legislation introduced excludes mothers and fathers from legal penalty (bills put forth by abolitionists, on the other hand, don’t give exemptions). This includes Alabama’s recently signed abortion ban and Georgia’s recently signed “heartbeat bill,” as French aptly points out.  Unfortunately, the motherhood exemption to abortion prosecution will yield more tragic and unjust results. This principle, while seemingly compassionate and sensible on its face, is unjust and unloving toward unborn children and abortion-minded parents. 1. Exemptions Effectively Create a Right to a DIY Abortion The motherhood exemption provides a tremendously flexible framework in which pro-choice lobbyists can still achieve their goal of “safe” and accessible abortions. The New York Times published an article last week from Cari Sietstra, a board member of the National Abortion Federation, encouraging pro-choice advocates to work toward a do-it-yourself (DIY) abortion industry that is allowed under pro-life legislation. We can work to fully decriminalize self-induced abortions. This is an area where all Americans, including pro-life Americans, can work together. The pro-life movement has insisted for decades that women should not be prosecuted for self-abortion … Working together to decriminalize self-managed abortion will curb these risks. Abortion abolitionists have been sounding the alarm on the rise of DIY abortions for years, yet have made little headway in getting pro-life leaders to factor it into their policy proposals. As Sietstra pointed out, the pro-life legislative agenda literally creates a right to abortion as long as the killing isn’t done by a third-party. The abortion industry is already expanding its push for DIY abortions. Pro-life regulations may shut down a few abortion mills and reduce surgical abortions, but the real accomplishment of such regulations is expediting the evolution of the abortion industry toward earlier, self-induced abortions. For years, mail-order abortion pill services and abortion counseling services have been helping women kill their unwanted unborn children in countries where it is illegal. Two of them, Women on Web and Aid Access, recently began shipping to the United States. Another organization called Self-managed Abortion; Safe and Supported (SASS) has sprung up to “train” women how to kill their fetuses on their own, having already hosted more than 20 workshops before January. Surveys reported on by Rewire News found that 2 percent of abortion patients had performed self-induced abortions. Also, there were 700,000 Google searches for self-induced abortion in 2015, and 200,000 Google searches for self-induced abortion within a 32-day span in 2017. Hotlines such as the Self Induced Abortion Legal Team have been established to help mothers skirt the law while self-inducing abortions. These hotlines, working in tandem with abortion-pill-to-your-door companies, make self-induced abortion easily obtainable. Those who think they can prevent DIY abortions by simply cutting off the black market supply of abortion-inducing drugs have another thing coming. The most effective of these drugs, misoprostol, is used to induce labor (when oxytocin isn’t available), as well as treat ulcers and postpartum hemorrhaging. Used alone, it’s estimated to be more than 90 percent effective at ending pregnancies, and the rate goes up when used in conjunction with mifepristone. Sietstra argues, “We should start seeing [misoprostol] as a prophylactic drug that deserves a place in our medicine cabinets. We should ask our clinicians for prescriptions before we need it.” If the pro-life movement’s goal is merely to shut down abortion mills and make sure abortions are done chemically rather than surgically, none of this matters. But if the goal is to actually prevent abortions, DIY abortions cannot be ignored. 2. Penalties Are Deterrents Penalties for stealing don’t completely thwart thieves, but there’d be a lot more theft if such consequences didn’t exist. One of the few things on which pro-choice and pro-life people agree is that killing a baby in the womb is often an excruciating decision. While some women have an abortion without ever even considering keeping their baby, it is a close call for most. Pro-lifers see this as a reason to build a shield of “compassion” into the law by exempting everyone from prosecution but the abortionist. This is a deeply flawed position. Pastor and activist Jason Storms illustrated why from experience at a hearing for the Abolition of Abortion in Texas Act (HB 896) on April 8. “I was guilty as an accomplice in the murder of my own child, and I should have been prosecuted accordingly,” Storms told the Texas House Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence Committee. Mothers and fathers – parents – right now in Texas can be charged with parental neglect, parental abuse, and even parental homicide when we see the tragedy of parents taking the lives of their own children. It’s because mothers and fathers have a duty to love and protect their children. That responsibility doesn’t start when they’re born, but it starts when they’re conceived.
Here’s a fact: my girlfriend and I, if we knew we would’ve been facing homicide charges, would never have aborted that child. That child would be alive today. I’d have a 22-year-old little child that I could celebrate life with right now that’s not here. The law is a deterrent to crime. We shouldn’t think of this only as a matter of putting a woman on the stand. We should think of this as a great deterrent. Men and women would not think of doing this if we stood firm on the law and provided equal protection for these children. The calculus about ending the life of a unborn son or daughter changes drastically when severe penalties are implemented. If the potential for homicide charges is added to one side of the scale, abortion is no longer a close call for anyone for whom it was previously. It is illogical to consider parents’ behavior in a future where abortion is legally considered murder exactly the same way their behavior is considered now when abortion is legal, widely accessible, and thoroughly destigmatized in many communities. Removing immunity for mothers who choose abortion doesn’t mean we’ll charge a million mothers and fathers who made excruciating decisions with murder. It means the vast majority wouldn’t have made that choice. We should all appreciate that difficult circumstances often factor into mothers and fathers aborting their babies, and no bill has proposed any sort of retroactive punishment of parents who made this decision legally. (Even if some legislator wanted to, retroactive penalties are unconstitutional). Pro-lifers are also right to point out the damage done to the souls and psyches of those who have their children killed, which in itself is a form of punishment for those who eventually admit to themselves what they did. But it is not “loving them both” to leave such a ghastly option on the table that people are free to make with impunity as if it were on par with running a red light when no cops are present. Rather than denying unborn boys and girls equal protection and allowing parents to self-induce abortion, it’s loving to instead provide robust support for mothers and fathers before, during, and after birth, from diapers to formula to medical care to shelter to adoption services. Pro-lifers have built incredible networks of support to save babies and show mothers and fathers facing difficult circumstances the love of Christ, no matter what they did or didn’t do to contribute to their present dilemma. 3. Roe v. Wade Relied on Pro-lifers’ Inconsistency As they argue for blanket exceptions, pro-life leaders often highlight the fact that pre-Roe abortion laws did not penalize mothers and fathers for abortion, only abortionists. Many pro-lifers would be surprised to find out that abortion bans that provided full and automatic immunity to parents who have their children killed formed part of the rationale for the majority ruling in Roe v Wade. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade, who was representing the state of Texas in the 1973 case, argued that the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause provided unborn human beings protection against murder, just like the law protected everyone else against murder. However, Texas’ anti-abortion laws at the time didn’t legally penalize anyone but the abortionist. Justice Harry Blackmun thus saw an avenue by which to claim that Wade and pro-lifers didn’t even believe the argument they were making. Blackmun details this in footnote 54 of the Roe v. Wade decision. There are other inconsistencies between Fourteenth Amendment status and the typical abortion statute. It has already been pointed out, n. 49, supra, that in Texas the woman is not a principal or an accomplice with respect to an abortion upon her. If the fetus is a person, why is the woman not a principal or an accomplice? Further, the penalty for criminal abortion specified by Art. 1195 is significantly less than the maximum penalty for murder prescribed by Art. 1257 of the Texas Penal Code. If the fetus is a person, may the penalties be different? Abortion was not even categorized as murder pre-Roe. Giving commissioners of the murder full immunity in all cases meant the standard of justice afforded to unborn human beings was far lower than the standard of justice afforded to born human beings. These laws are not a standard to try to return to, but a terrible mistake that we must learn from. The Alternative: Abolition There is a better way to end abortion than the tactics currently pushed in the mainstream pro-life movement: abolition. Abortion must be abolished through laws establishing the equal protection of the laws against murder for born and unborn humans alike. The murder of an unborn boy or girl will be treated exactly the same as the murder of a toddler or older child. Such laws are nothing more than the application of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to state law. Any true abolition bill must ignore the precedent of a lawless Supreme Court that has, for 45 years, denied an entire class of human beings their fundamental rights. Abolitionists of slavery were right to nullify the Supreme Court’s dehumanizing decisions then, and abolitionists of abortion are right to do so now. States are under no constitutional obligation to abide by Roe, and are in fact obligated to ignore it and provide equal protection of the law to all human beings, as described in the 14th Amendment. According to the Article VI, the Constitution itself is supreme—not a rogue court’s twisting of it. Such legislation has been introduced in Oklahoma, Indiana, Texas, Idaho, and Washington. These bills were not killed by Democrats and the abortion lobby; they were killed by Republican politicians and prominent pro-life lobbyists. Oklahoma state Sens.Jason Smalley and Greg Treat killed the Abolition of Abortion in Oklahoma Act (OK SB13) with the blessing of National Right to Life Vice President Tony Lauinger, who refused to even call abortion murder when asked point-blank in this 2016 interview. State Rep. Jeff Leach killed the Abolition of Abortion in Texas Act (TX HB896) with the blessing of Texas Alliance for Life, Abby Johnson, Brian Fischer of Human Coalition, and others. Indiana State Reps. Ben Smaltz and Brian Bosma killed the Protection at Conception Act (IN HB1430) with the blessing of Indiana Right to Life. And so on. These efforts to thwart the attempts at achieving full equality for the unborn were deeply misguided and immoral. They illustrate the desperate need for leadership who understand the terrible position conventional pro-life thought has put us in, and whose primary objective is nothing short of justice. Pro-life legislation that creates the right to DIY abortion and fails to categorize abortion as murder does not deserve our support.

The practice is so common that it’s a TV trope—fans of “Mad Men” watched the quintessential example in the show’s verbal sparring over the purported health benefits of smoking. In the real world, this behavior can be devastating. As U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in United States v. Philip Morris USA, “In short, [the companies] have marketed and sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted.”  The same could be said of the abortion industry, which hides year after year behind reports generated by the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion advocacy organization created to be Planned Parenthood’s research arm. Unsurprisingly, the Guttmacher Institute consistently releases data they say shows that their allies and funders have done no harm. Founded in 1968 “within the corporate structure of Planned Parenthood Federation of America,” the Guttmacher Institute was championed by Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher, an associate of Margaret Sanger, after the two had worked together in the American Eugenics Society. As NPR notes: “Eugenics, a dark offshoot of the science of genetics, was an early 20th century movement that sought to prevent social ills by seeing that those who caused them were never born.” “Never born.” That is a crucial component of so much of the work of both Planned Parenthood and the Guttmacher Institute. It’s so much so that, as numerous studies come to light from around the world documenting the many dangers, risks, and harms of abortion, the Guttmacher Institute can see no evil in how women are affected. Science Versus the Guttmacher Institute For example, Guttmacher recently released a report claiming that science doesn’t support legislation regulating the abortion industry. In response, Americans United for Life’s legal team prepared a “Fact v. Fiction” analysis, evaluating Guttmacher’s claims. Here are a few examples of how the scientific facts compare to Guttmacher’s fiction.  Guttmacher Fiction: Ambulatory surgical center requirements for abortion clinics and admitting privileges requirements for individual abortion providers are not necessary because abortion is “safe.” Fact: Abortion carries inherent medical risks, and U.S. abortion clinics have a deplorable track record of substandard conditions and practices. After Karnamaya Mongar died in the “house of horrors” abortion clinic run by convicted murderer Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the grand jury report released findings of filthy conditions, unlicensed personnel, and deaths of women and babies born alive. In Mongar’s case, after several hours in the clinic her life hung in the balance. When paramedics were finally called, they faced obstacles in getting her to the hospital: “(B)ecause of the cluttered hallways and the padlocked emergency door, it took them over twenty minutes just to find a way to get her out of the building.” In failing to follow laws regulating health facilities, Gosnell’s clinic endangered women and the abortion procedure itself.  It is undisputed that the potential immediate medical complications from abortion include blood clots, hemorrhage, incomplete abortions, infection, and injury to the cervix and other organs. Other complications from abortion include cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, renal failure, metabolic disorder, shock, and missed ectopic pregnancy. One recent study concluded that immediate medical complications affect approximately 10 percent of women undergoing abortions, and approximately one-fifth of these complications are life-threatening. While Guttmacher points to a study finding that less than 0.3 percent of women require hospitalization for abortion-related complications, under that conservative estimate, 3,180 women were hospitalized following abortions in 2011 (using Guttmacher’s latest abortion surveillance data). Moreover, the abortion industry routinely claims that 2.5 percent of women who have a first-trimester abortion will “undergo minor complications.” Taking this conservative estimate at face value and using the latest abortion statistics from Guttmacher (again for 2011), this means that 26,500 women experienced abortion-related complications in 2011 alone. Further, data keepers have meticulously documented longstanding and pervasive problems with substandard and often dangerous abortion providers. Most recently, following an examination of confirmed reports of dangerous abortion clinic conditions over the last eight years, Americans United for Life released a groundbreaking investigative report in December 2016: “Unsafe: How the Public Health Crisis in America’s Abortion Clinics Endangers Women.” The report details horrific abortion clinic conditions, documents that at least 227 abortion providers in 32 states were cited for more than 1,400 health and safety deficiencies between 2008 and 2016, and discusses hundreds of significant violations of state laws regulating abortion providers. Sure, Induce an Abortion at Home with Dangerous Drugs Guttmacher Fiction: “Telemedicine” abortions are safe. Fact: “Telemedicine” abortions put women at even greater risk of injury. After working for Planned Parenthood for 17 years, Sue Thayer understands both how the abortion industry uses chemical abortion drugs and their risks. Testifying before a U.S. House Judiciary Committee hearing, she spoke of how Planned Parenthood’s business model shift toward pushing life-ending drugs made her rethink her support of her employer. She said: “Planned Parenthood cut costs to the bone by performing abortions on a shoestring budget with little medical involvement. But none of this was focused on the woman’s health or her best interests. When I raised concerns about this, I was forced out.” In a “telemedicine” abortion, an abortion provider consults with a woman via webcam then remotely dispenses the dangerous abortion-inducing drug known as RU-486. Both the Food and Drug Administration and the drug manufacturer have acknowledged that RU-486 poses serious health risks for women, including the risk of death. In fact, the drug label for Mifeprex (the first drug in the two-drug regimen) acknowledges that “[n]early all of the women who receive Mifeprex and misoprostol [the RU-486 regimen] will report adverse reactions, and many can be expected to report more than one such reaction.” In fact, the same study Guttmacher cited, as evidence for why ambulatory surgical center requirements and admitting privilege mandates are not necessary, found that the complication rate for RU-486 (or chemical) abortions was nearly four times as high as that for surgical abortions, with approximately 5.2 percent of women experiencing a complication requiring medical attention within six weeks of their abortions. Abortion Hurts Many Women Long-Term Guttmacher Fiction: Abortion does not increase women’s risk of mental health problems. Fact: Decades of medical evidence has revealed that abortion carries significant psychological risks, including increased risks of depression, anxiety, and suicide. More than 110 studies establish a connection between abortion and subsequent mental health problems. A growing number of medical studies demonstrate a high correlation between abortion and an increased risk of mental health problems. More than 110 studies establish a connection between abortion and subsequent mental health problems. A study team headed by Dr. John M. Thorp found that women whose first pregnancies ended in abortion were 65 percent more likely to score in the “high risk” range for clinical depression than women whose first pregnancies resulted in a birth. Importantly, studies have found that up to 10 percent of mental health problems women suffer are directly attributable to abortion. Medical studies also reveal an increased risk of suicidal ideation and suicide following induced abortion. One of the leading studies, led by a pro-abortion researcher and controlling for all relevant factors (including prior history of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation), found that 27 percent of women who aborted reported experiencing suicidal ideation, with as many as 50 percent of minors experiencing suicide or suicidal ideation. The risk of suicide was three times greater for women who aborted than for women who delivered. The study also found that 42 percent of women who aborted reported major depression by age 25, and 39 percent of post-abortive women suffered from anxiety disorders by age 25. Push Studies Aren’t Science We shouldn’t be surprised that an abortion industry advocate like the Guttmacher Institute would ignore the true science behind the dangers women face from abortion. After all, they are paid to produce research that allows their allies to keep profits high and medical standards low. But those who promote abortion face a different legal environment since the Supreme Court said in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt that health and safety standards for abortion clinics could be found constitutional with proof of the need. AUL’s legal team has answered that challenge, equipping legislators with facts about the health risks of abortion and evidence of dangerous conditions in abortion clinics. The science and evidence is on the side of life. When considering the science and sociological data associated with abortion, it’s important to look beyond the findings of those who make a living on behalf of a point of view. As Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, said of tobacco industry spin doctoring in defiance of scientific evidence: “These are people who make their living producing results that their clients want.

Instead, it will seek to create an abortion-on-demand regime via activist state judges. Countering this strategy must take priority, or Dobbs will be for naught.



In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and held there is no federal constitutional right to abortion. Contrary to the misperception of some, the reversal of Roe and Casey did not make abortion illegal. Rather, Dobbs removed stringent judicial oversight on abortion laws.



Pre-Dobbs, under the controlling Casey framework, any law passed by a legislative body, whether Congress or a state legislature, was subjected to judicial scrutiny to determine whether the statute imposed an “undue burden” on a woman’s alleged right to have an abortion. That standard of judicial review prevented elected lawmakers from regulating abortion in most ways and left many universally supported laws, such as bans on abortion after 20 weeks, voided by judicial fiat.



What Dobbs did in overturning Roe and Casey was restore “the Constitution’s neutrality” to the issue of abortion and return the “authority to address the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic self-government established by the Constitution” to the people.



The abortion lobby and the extreme abortion left do not want “the people” to have a say, however, and have been working for years to ensure that if Roe and Casey were overturned, abortion-on-demand would remain the law of the land. To circumvent the democratic process, abortion apologists have been turning to activist state court judges for years.



Working to Lock Down State Courts



Long before Dobbs came down, the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion advocacy organization, has been implementing this strategy. “For decades,” the Center bragged recently, it “has brought cases in state courts to strengthen abortion rights and guarantee access beyond the federal system’s growing constraints.” The state courts “offer wider possibilities,” the Center explained, with each state having “a unique constitution and court system that is free to protect reproductive autonomy under novel legal theories and rights.”



Currently, the high courts in at least nine states have held a right to abortion exists in the state constitution separate and distinct from the federal constitutional right to abortion declared in Roe and Casey, making the Supreme Court’s Friday decision in Dobbs irrelevant in those states.



That left-wing state justices in California and Massachusetts would find a right to abortion in their states’ constitutions should come as no surprise, but it is not merely blue states where activists have found success with this approach. Rather, this strategy worked even in Kansas, which has voted for Republican presidential candidates in every election cycle but one since 1940.



In 2019, in response to a lawsuit brought by two abortion providers challenging a state law that criminalized dismemberment abortions—in which live fetuses are killed by being ripped apart limb by limb—the Kansas Supreme Court declared for the first time that the state’s constitution provides a fundamental right to abortion. That decision, Hodes and Nauser v. Schmidt, thwarted the will of Kansans, “who have consistently elected one of the most pro-life and pro-active state legislatures in this country.”



Now Kansans Have to Amend the State Constitution



While Hodes conflicted with the pro-life principles held by the majority of Kansans, that did not dissuade the state supreme court from finding a constitutional right buried in the state’s 150-plus-year-old constitution. Those justices, after all, were not beholden to ordinary Kansans, with four of the Kansas Supreme Court justices in the Hodes majority having been appointed by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a supporter of legal abortion.



The Kansas Supreme Court justices in Hodes did precisely what the U.S. Supreme Court in Dobbs condemned—they misused their raw judicial power to prevent the populace from addressing “the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic self-government.” Kansans are attempting to reclaim that authority and have been for the last three years, but to do so and overturn the Hodes decision requires citizens to amend the state constitution.



On August 2, 2022, Kansans will have the chance to do so when citizens go to the polls to vote on the Value Them Both Amendment. The ballot summary of the proposed amendment explains that “a vote for the Value Them Both Amendment would affirm there is no Kansas constitutional right to abortion or to require the government funding of abortion, and would reserve to the people of Kansas, through their elected state legislators, the right to pass laws to regulate abortion.” In other words, the state constitution would remain neutral on abortion and leave the decision to the people and their elected representatives.



Here’s What Pro-Lifers Should Do



Kansas should serve as a warning to the pro-life movement of the risk activist state courts pose in other states and prompt a three-prong approach to counter the abortion lobby’s strategy.



First, the right-to-life movement should work to tee up constitutional amendments that clarify there is no state constitutional right to abortion. Four states currently have constitutional amendments expressly providing that the state constitutions do not include a right to abortion, with Tennessee passing the first amendment in 2014. Alabama and West Virginia followed in 2018, and Louisiana voters approved a similar amendment in 2020.



Second, just as elections matter on the federal level for determining the composition of the U.S. Supreme Court, the pro-life movement must make clear the importance elections hold at the state level for both governors, who may appoint justices, and the justices themselves. Also, politicians and their staff responsible for vetting or appointing justices must take that responsibility more seriously and consider the potential jurist’s judicial philosophy.



Finally, politicians and pro-life advocates must educate the public on the value of allowing abortion policy to be decided by the legislative process instead of by judicial fiat. The public needs to hear the truth that if a state court declares a state constitutional right to abortion exists, a handful of justices will have the power to mandate an extreme abortion regime, allowing for post-viability abortions and taxpayer-funded abortions, and putting at risk even the most popular bipartisan legislation.



Governor Pushing for Human Dismemberment



With the volume of discourse raised since Friday’s release of Dobbs, it will be difficult to break through the noise, especially in states led by Democrats, such as Michigan. In Michigan, Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been using her bully pulpit to frame the public debate over abortion while she uses her office to push the Michigan Supreme Court to declare a right to abortion under the Michigan constitution.



Earlier this year, Whitmer first filed a lawsuit in her role as governor asking the court to declare that a 1931 Michigan abortion ban violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Michigan constitution. That 1931 ban has been unenforceable since Roe was decided but remains on the books.



A lower court had stayed enforcement of the law pending the Dobbs decision. On Friday, in response to Dobbs, Whitmer filed a motion “asking the Michigan Supreme Court to immediately consider her lawsuit asking the court to decide if Michigan’s state constitution protects the right to abortion.”



Since the draft opinion in Dobbs leaked last month, Whitmer has also been whipping up public sentiment in advance of any hearing before the Michigan Supreme Court. “Now is the time to use every tool in our toolbox to protect all aspects of reproductive health care,” Whitmer said in a May press release, promising that she is “going to fight like h-ll so every Michigander can make decisions about their own body.”



“However we personally feel about abortion, health, not politics, should drive important medical decisions,” Whitmer argued, adding that “a woman must be able to make her own medical decisions with the advice of a health-care professional she trusts. Politicians should not make that decision for her.”



Lying to the Public



Beyond her euphemistic reference to “health care” and “medical decisions,” Whitmer seeks to hide the extreme abortion regime she wants for Michigan by diverting attention from the impact of a Michigan Supreme Court decision declaring the existence of a state constitutional right to abortion. She does this in two ways.



First, Whitmer focuses on the lack of a rape or incest exception to the 1931 abortion ban to create the impression that her lawsuit would merely render just that aspect of the law unconstitutional. But, if Whitmer succeeds in having a state constitutional right to abortion divined in the due process or equal protection clauses of the Michigan constitution, the state legislature would be unable to regulate abortion and taxpayer-funded abortions could be mandated.



Whitmer also misleads the public by citing a poll that 77 percent of Michiganders “believe abortion should be a woman’s decision.” That poll, however, failed to inquire about respondents’ views on any specifics, such as whether taxpayer-funded abortions should be constitutionally required or late-term abortions permitted.



What about parental notification or consent laws? Or laws banning abortions based on the sex of the unborn child? Such laws are widely supported, yet if Whitmer succeeds in her lawsuit, the Michigan Supreme Court would wrest those questions away from the legislative branch.



That is precisely what Whitmer and other abortion apologists want. They know that no matter how many polls they trot out, most of America does not want the extreme abortion regime that exists in California and the other states where courts have declared a state constitutional right to abortion exists.



The justices of the Michigan Supreme Court, like those on the Kansas Supreme Court, may not care. But on August 2, 2022, we’ll know if Kansans do, and pro-life advocates would be wise to watch the developments in both states to ensure that Dobbs’ promise to return the question to the people is fulfilled.

"12",12,"Pro-Abortion Crowd Silences Women Who Regret Them","Lewis","Brenna",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-28"," Abortion proponents have embraced a drastic shift in messaging over the past few decades. In the 1990s, Bill Clinton’s “safe, legal, and rare” was the standard line — which is a far cry from today’s well-traveled maxims like “Free Abortion on Demand Without Apology” and “Shout Your Abortion.” Indeed, in the heart of abortion’s most ardent base, the strategy entails encouraging pride over shame and celebration over regret. But does this shift reflect the experiences of those who are disinclined to “shout” their abortions?   



There’s an accusation lurking in the subtext of the abortion debate over abortion regret, implying that no woman should feel bad “terminating a pregnancy” if it was never suggested that abortion itself is bad. How paternalistic. First, “Big Abortion” sells women short by suggesting they will never be able to handle both a career and a family, and then they sell them an abortion. And now, abortion zealots make themselves the masters of how women must feel about it. 



The pro-life movement at large has consistently perceived two victims in an abortion scenario — a child whose life is on the line, and a mother who is vulnerable to an industry that profits from violence and deceit. Those selling abortion must sever the one-of-a-kind physical relationship between mother and gestating child through abortion — lethal pregnancy violence that will be painfully understood by a mother when she finds herself empty of life.



Widespread abortion regret is supported by data, yet seldom reported. The physical and psychological risks of abortion are well known to those of us who support post-abortive women. New studies have shown that women who have abortions are 81 percent more likely to experience subsequent mental health problems. This includes being 110 percent more likely to abuse alcohol and 115 percent more likely to develop suicidal behavior following abortion. Another study notes women who ended their first pregnancy by abortion are five times more likely to report subsequent substance abuse than women who carried the pregnancy to term and four times more likely to report substance abuse compared to those whose first pregnancy ended naturally.  



But the best source for understanding abortion regret is the women who have experienced it firsthand. Consider an entire legion of both men and women who were traumatized by abortion yet feel unwelcome in the Shout Your Abortion era. 



For every handful of celebrities shouting their abortions, there’s one who courageously goes against the abortion-loving mob to tell a different truth. In 2015, Nicki Minaj said in an interview that her high school abortion has “haunted her all her life.” Eminem’s 2017 song “River” puts on full display his abortion regret as a father. In 2020, Kanye West broke down in public while explaining how much pain he suffers for even considering aborting his daughter, North, as well as his wrestling with the knowledge that he himself was almost aborted.  



From our own work at Students for Life of America’s Standing with You program. We know that women struggle for years to grapple with the loss of their child through abortion or the fallout of abortion fathers and families experience. Healing ministries like Project Rachel, Rachel’s Vineyard, and Support After Abortion exist to offer loving care to those experiencing grief.  



But the second flaw in the argument against the realities of abortion regret is in who is making it. Consider that those encouraging the celebration of abortion are also in the abortion business. This is further evidenced by the fact that a disproportionate number of abortion ‟researchers” are funded by pro-abortion entities.   



If, for example, the “everyone loves abortion” research comes from the Bixby Center at the University of California (as it often does), it’s highly relevant that the Center is funded and organized to find in favor of abortion. The Bixby Center trains abortionists through its Ryan Residency Training Program and is funded by population control-loving Warren Buffett, along with Planned Parenthood and their Guttmacher Institute and Gynuity Health Projects, which profits from chemical abortion sales and so on. The Bixby Center is as unbiased on abortion as The Tobacco Institute is on cigarettes.    



Even worse than the clear and present bias in abortion data is the audacity of those blaming pro-lifers for abortion regret to cite The Turnaway Study, which is famously so flawed that a Planned Parenthood exec could drive their Lamborghini through the holes in its reasoning.   



The study was published in 2015 by the abortion group ANSIRH and, in simplest terms, is an attempt to dismiss the trauma and long-standing pain many women feel following an abortion. It tries to conclude that women are hurt by being denied an abortion, but as explored at length by Live Action, Turnaway has four glaring problems: a bad study sample, no true control group, a lackluster assessment of physical health, and misleading questions.



The study tracks only a small number of women — fewer than 200 — who were denied abortions. Additionally, the results were only presented at an academic conference. This data has not appeared in an academic journal nor gone through the peer-review process. Finally, the study — and the full results — do not appear to be publicly available. Thus, despite shamefully poor research practices and an utter failure to prove the claim it set out to, that women don’t regret abortion, it’s still propped up “Weekend at Bernie’s” style by abortion proponents.  



Furthermore, these women were denied abortions not because of legal restrictions, but because many facilities do not carry out late-term abortions.   



It’s fascinating that a movement once sold as “pro-choice” refuses to allow women the freedom to feel loss after receiving an abortion. Every parent who made an abortion decision, from the main streets of pro-life communities to the pro-abortion hills of Hollywood, deserves the freedom to be honest about their experience. And for those who want to process those feelings, the pro-life community is here to help.

"13",13,"How Overturning Roe Could Expand Abortion Inside The United States","St. Onge","Sarah",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-01-29"," While many political observers will say the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade is on the verge of being overturned due to Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, many pro-life activists are not so certain the end of legalized abortion is approaching. Overturning Roe would indicate an exciting shift. It most likely won’t happen. Yet even if it did, it won’t be the boon that uninformed pro-life believers are expecting. Losing Roe won’t criminalize abortion but send its regulation back to state courts.  What does a future without Roe look like? It looks like a future where abortion access may be expanded in most states, even those with pro-life legislators and citizens. What A New Abortion Map Might Look Like In about 21 states, abortion is secure. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion access probably won’t be restricted in those states. Twenty-two other states have legal restrictions that will make abortion virtually illegal once Roe is gone. These 22 states facing an almost immediate end to abortion are currently the primary focus of pro-choice activists’ attention. (The remainder of states are vulnerable to abortion prohibitions, but not immediately, and the likelihood of them remaining vulnerable is low.) In pro-abortion states that presently rely on Roe for protection, lawmakers are already working hard to enshrine abortion rights more liberal than Roe via proactive legislation. Their hope is to safeguard what they see as a critical freedom in the event Roe is sent back to the states. In New York, for example, Democrats have the majority for the first time in decades, and just passed comprehensive abortion expansion legislation, including making it easier for women to seek third-trimester abortions, a proposal that had consistently failed in previous years. The issue was a main talking point in this year’s midterm elections. Not only have they safeguarded Roe, but abortion access has been expanded far beyond what even the most abortion-friendly states have written into law.  In addition, pro-choice advocacy groups are using judicial activism to push through abortion allowances in states where it seems legislators may not support abortion access. Case in point: The much-lauded “Iowa Heartbeat Bill” passed last May was struck down by the Iowa Supreme Court. Abortion As a Constitutional Right At the State Level We could have predicted the Iowa bill’s eventual failure based on another decision, made last June, in which a law requiring a 72-hour waiting period between pre-abortion counseling and a termination of pregnancy was rejected by Iowa’s Supreme Court. More important than the rejection of the waiting period was the basis for the rejection: The court found the right to abortion in the Iowa State Constitution. This means if Roe v. Wade is overturned, Iowans could find themselves living in a state where almost any abortion is legal. After all, abortion is now a constitutional right in Iowa, and there are few limitations to that right, unlike the “viability” standard set forth in Roe. While pro-life activists have been assiduously lobbying to pass incremental and unenforceable targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) and “trigger” laws to limit abortions should Roe be overturned, pro-choice groups have been bypassing state legislatures altogether and focusing their attention on amending state constitutions to favor abortion through lower courts. Activists are cautious to avoid any considerations in their filings that could move their cases into the federal court system. If successful, these efforts will serve to expand abortion once Roe is overturned, even in states with life-affirming governments and voters.  In the end, the only way to completely stop abortion is by teaching people to recognize fetal life as human life. This can be accomplished through cultural change, but until that time, focusing on state-level constitutional protections for prenatal humans is a vital part of pro-life activism. Midterms Offer Some Positive News For Pro-lifers The recent midterm election offers some hope. Alabama and West Virginia voters approved amendments declaring there was no right to abortion implied in their constitutions. The language mirrored a previously successful constitutional amendment passed in Tennessee, which has been working its way through the courts. These amendments don’t guarantee these states will remain abortion-free should Roe be overturned, but they most likely end the possibility of well-funded pro-choice activists using judicial activism to bypass the wishes of voters in the states involved. Kavanaugh may end up affirming reasonable anti-abortion laws. But realistically, we have no way of determining how he will vote on cases set before him. He has clearly stated that Roe is precedent. He also recently declined to hear a lower court ruling that involved defunding Planned Parenthood (although there were other reasons given). No one can truly claim to know how he’ll vote when faced with the upcoming, myriad cases regarding life issues. We can better predict what may happen should he and the rest of the court overturn Roe. Our focus on fighting abortion through incremental laws may fail. If pro-choice groups continue to target state constitutions, it won’t matter how many small pieces of legislation lawmakers pass: once a state successfully finds the right to an abortion in its constitution, every new pro-life law will be held up against that standard. We must begin to address the possibility of personhood being the most reasonable option. Unfortunately, personhood is not a popular initiative even within the pro-life movement. Giving Unborn Children Proper Rights While most of us understand a fetus is a living human being at all stages of development, many Americans are conflicted about giving an unborn child the same rights as her mother. We have lived with abortion for so long it seems inconceivable it will ever completely go away. Horror stories of what happened before abortion was legalized have become deeply ingrained into our national psyche, and, deep down, we cling to the belief that minimal legal abortion is better than no legal abortion. It seems the only way we can possibly balance the life of a mother and her child is to permit abortion in some form. We see newscasts of places like El Salvador, where women are jailed for miscarriages and stillbirths due to strict abortion laws. We fear women ending up in jail for losing a preborn baby. We understand personhood may call abortifacient contraception into question. We also need to find a middle ground on bodily autonomy for pregnant women while protecting the rights of the unborn child. We can all agree a pregnant woman shouldn’t be abusing drugs while pregnant, but there are gray areas involving lifestyle habits that may be less savory, but not life-threatening for either mother or baby. These are very real concerns, and they need to be addressed by activists and lawmakers. There are ways to assure women are safe from prosecution using “whistleblower” laws, or by including language in proposed legislation that absolves post-abortive women of criminal penalties, should their abortion be discovered. We can concede personhood at implantation rather than fertilization, so that birth control access is not threatened. We can highlight the fact that American women have been historically protected from prosecution for abortion, as have women in most Western societies, and those cases highlighted by abortion advocates as proof of our mendacity in this respect usually involve women who have aborted late-term pregnancies, in effect killing viable babies through violent means. In many of those cases there is conflicting evidence as to whether the child was actually born alive and discarded — in at least one of those cases the baby was born alive, and severely disabled due to the attempted abortion. In the United States, these women are still ultimately given the benefit of the doubt and freed. We can create special circumstances within our personhood legislation for mothers to be given immediate access to curative methods, rather than incarceration, if they’re engaged in dangerous activities, and accept that some mothers will not choose to parent the same as others, in the case of less troubling issues. Whatever the case, we must stop relying on the federal government to “fix” abortion. Ultimately, Kavanaugh may be the conservative justice we had hoped for, but his confirmation is no guarantee of an abortion-free America. That designation lies with us. Until we boldly stand up for unborn children, we will continue to see expansions of abortion rights through judicial activism aimed at altering state constitutions. Continuing to deny the possibility of personhood is a failure to promote a consistent stance on abortion. In the end, this may be a fatal mistake for both the pro-life movement and the thousands of babies whose lives are at stake.

"14",14,"The ‘Shout Your Abortion’ Coffee Table Book Fights Off The Real Abortion Conversation","Wolfe","Liz",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-12-18"," “I have had four abortions. I didn’t talk to anyone about them for years,” says a woman named Erin, photograph placed opposite her story, adorned in colorful, watercolor tattoos, and a dark beanie, standing tall behind what looks to be a marimba, on a stage somewhere––presumably in Seattle, the place most of these activists call home. I thought about including details about my abortions in this story. I thought about talking about the circumstances surrounding them and the men who were involved. I thought about talking about how the life I have now would have been wildly different, if not impossible, without abortion access. I thought about talking about how I don’t want to be a mother. I thought about talking about how much I love my nieces (so I must not be a ‘bad person’ who hates children). But ultimately I don’t think any of these things are relevant. They feel like justifications, and I don’t believe justifications are necessary. This passage is par for the course in “Shout Your Abortion,” the book compiled by Lindy West, Amelia Bonow, and Emily Nokes. It’s zine style, but higher production quality and finely polished. If you didn’t know what abortion was, it would look like a tasteful coffee table book, ready to be flipped through, with photos of fashionable women and embedded images of posters advertising #SYA events in the Seattle area.  I’m sure for some people it is a coffee table book. A light read. A celebration of rights and female liberation. Not for me, but I do have a sort of macabre fascination with the marketing tools and rhetoric of the pro-choice movement. It is, after all, what I’m supposed to believe as a city-dwelling, educated, inked-up woman with no hangups about sex, who isn’t a Republican, and spent a long time as an atheist. The Shout Your Abortion (SYA) activists held a book launch party a few weeks ago, at the Neptune Theater in Seattle. To garner publicity for the book’s thrilling release, activist Lindy West was invited onto Trevor Noah’s “The Daily Show” to talk about removing the abortion stigma. It was a jumbled mess of mental leaps.  ‘Anti-Choice People’ Don’t Want To Stop Abortion? West claimed: “Anti-choice people are not trying to stop abortion. They’re trying to legislate who can and cannot have abortions. Because conservative politicians—their wives, and mistresses, and daughters are always going to be able to go get an abortion somewhere.” She went on:  Really, all anti-choice rhetoric does…is keep people trapped in poverty and drowning in poverty for generations. That’s the goal. If it wasn’t the goal, they’d spend their time and money on comprehensive sex education, free birth control, free contraception, and all the things that pro-choice people do spend their time on that actually do affect the abortion rate.” According to West, the SYA movement started in 2015 when the Planned-Parenthood-sells-baby-parts videos were circulating. “My friend Amelia went on Facebook kind of spontaneously and wrote a beautiful post that said ‘I had an abortion at Planned Parenthood and it was an overwhelmingly positive experience, I felt nothing but relief…and I’m a good person. My abortion made me happy.” West screengrabbed this, posted it on Twitter, and hashtagged it “#shoutyourabortion.” Thus, the movement began. West claims they get letters of support from religious people and conservatives, as well as the usual obvious ardent abortion advocates. “The conversation has really been dominated by what’s essentially a fringe opinion. Anti-choice rhetoric is not actually the norm,” she tells Noah. West goes on to claim that 70 percent of Americans support Roe v. Wade. She’s right, in a sense––a December 2016 Pew poll found that 69 percent of Americans are not interested in overturning the seminal abortion case. As of 2018, nearly 60 percent of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. But 2018 polling from Gallup supports the idea that Americans do not believe all women should be given carte blanche to do whatever they want at any age of gestation. Roughly 60 percent of American adults support legal abortion in the first trimester, about 28 percent support legal abortion in the second trimester, and only a measly 13 percent support abortion in the third trimester (but per the book’s logic, if all abortions are morally okay, there’s no need to feel icky about late-term abortions, right?). To further complicate matters, Pew reported in 2013 that only about 62 percent of Americans surveyed were aware that Roe v. Wade had anything to do with abortion. (Interesting, Pew found that more Republicans knew that Roe concerned abortion than did Democrats.) So there is a decently high degree of broad public support for abortion in some form, but opposing it isn’t nearly as fringe of a belief as West makes it out to be. Most people still have moral hangups in some form about the ethics of it, especially as the pregnancy progresses, whether it should be used as a form of birth control, and whether they perceive a woman to be aborting out of “necessity” or out of selfishness.  But West acknowledges none of this, and goes on to use ye olde catchphrase, claiming that her activist group is comprised of “those of us who are trying to be on the right side of history” and that there’s just a “tiny fringe group”––pro-lifers, or anti-choice people, as West terms us––controlling the abortion discussion. Noah plays right into West’s agenda and ends the segment proclaiming, “It’s a beautiful book with an amazing movement behind it.” Is it really? Or is West promulgating her own peachy form of propaganda, aided and abetted by the late-night talk show industrial complex, which churns out standard comedic fare for coastal elites with the “correct” politics? I ordered the book to get more insight into how the more radical wing of the pro-choice movement brands themselves. Disconcerting Mental Leaps For the sake of fairness, I appreciate the candor and diversity of stories presented. The authors clearly demonstrate that there’s no singular correct script or set of priorities that women must adhere to. As a libertarian woman, and one who revels in making my own choices, this appeals. But it’s hard to look past many of the mental gymnastics clearly going on within these pages. One woman’s story begins with “I was as young and dumb as every 20-year-old has every right to be.” She goes on to detail how she conceived her baby because she didn’t put her diaphragm in before having sex (she had gone through considerable pains to get birth control at all, so you’d think it would be used). She goes on to detail how a kind woman arranged an abortion on her behalf, since she was a foreigner living in Israel, where abortion was illegal in the 1960s. She says the woman “made three calls. The first was for an appointment with a leading gynecologist who didn’t believe in forcing women to have children.”  This use of the word “force” is repeated many times. In the beginning of the book, West claims, “On an individual level, those who are forced to bear children are denied the ability to lead self-determined, fully realized lives.” Another account reads: “The simple truth is this: if a sperm and egg come together when a child is desired, a human being is born. But if a sperm and egg come together when a woman knows in her bones that it is not the right time for her to be a mother, then perhaps what is born is her own confident agency over her life.” And another: “Pregnancy is what happens sometimes when people have sex, and an abortion is what happens when a woman becomes pregnant and does not wish to procreate.” Yet another: “I’m telling you my story plainly, proudly, flippantly even, because we’ve all been brainwashed to believe that the absence of negative emotions around having an abortion is the mark of an emotionally bankrupt person. It’s not. I am a good person and my abortion made me happy. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel happy that you were not forced to become a mother.”  For people who ostensibly support “the party of science,” these explanations don’t make sense. Unless it’s a rare situation of rape or coercion, or a woman is kept in some sort of cult-like environment where the possibility of pregnancy resulting from sex is never mentioned, women are not “forced” to have children; they freely consent to sex, which has the sometimes inconvenient side effect of conceiving a baby. The pro-choice side would be wise to acknowledge this and adjust their language to make it more honest. Furthermore, a baby’s (or a fetus’s, or a zygote’s, depending on your word of choice and the stage of development) humanity isn’t contingent on whether it’s wanted, though that seems to be the dominant way of thinking in our culture. In no way does that hold up to scientific scrutiny, or apply at any other stage of development (i.e., an elderly person isn’t any less of a person if none of their family members wish to take care of her, nor is a person with an intellectual disability any less of a person if his family members feel burdened by his existence and tired by the significant feat of helping him live a decent life). The Stigma of Multiple Abortions One woman talked about the stigma of having multiple abortions and using abortion as birth control, saying: Here’s a radical idea––who cares if that’s how people use abortion?
Listen, we aren’t born with a single token that’s good for one abortion each until we’ve used it up and then too bad, you have to become a parent now! Abortion is a medical procedure that we use as part of reproductive health care. We are allowed to have as many of them as we like, and certainly as many of them as we need. It is nobody’s business but our own how many abortions we choose to have in our lifetimes, and the only people we are obliged to even discuss it with are the people who are trained to provide them.
But it is also okay to use abortion as a form of contraception because abortion is a form of contraception. One woman, Angela Garbes, was raised by immigrant parents from the Philippines, a Catholic country where abortion remains illegal. When she told her mother, she recounted, “She began crying immediately.” ‘Well it was your choice,’ she said. ‘But you have to know it goes against everything your father and I fundamentally believe in our hearts.’ 
She went on to tell me about how she would have taken care of my baby, how my cousin in the Philippines, who is unable to have children, would gladly have taken my baby. How so many people would have wanted my baby.
My baby. I realized quickly there was nowhere for the conversation to go. The life she was concerned about was that of a weeks-old embryo. I was thinking of my own. It’s hard not to approach these stories with a bit of compassion; these women, in my mind and the minds of most, if not all, other pro-lifers, made selfish decisions and now take part in a weird activist culture that glorifies them and makes Froot Loops-colored zines about them. But it’s sad that our culture led them to this––it’s sad that, in many cases, they didn’t feel like they would be supported in choosing motherhood. It’s sad that abortion was a more appealing option than all the other ones on the table. It’s sad that, per many accounts, adoption wasn’t really seen as a viable option, for one reason or another (probably mostly because it’s challenging, and if you see abortion as morally fine––akin to any other type of birth control––why would you not go the easier route?). Mostly, it’s sad that the rhetoric surrounding the abortion debate has strayed from honest assessment of the moral trade-offs and priorities at play. This conversation should be about whether ending a life is morally permissible at any stage; about whether ending a life takes on less weight early in development compared to later; about whether a woman’s ability to pursue a child-free life should trump her fetus’s right to be kept safe and secure, able to enter this world. As a pro-lifer, I have my opinions on all these questions. But it feels near-impossible to actually explore these diverging ethical lines when pro-lifers are smeared as woman-hating, internalized misogyny-ruined, prudish bigots who hate female sexual pleasure, and when pro-choicers defensively clothe themselves in rhetoric that absolves all responsibility and couches their decisions in the verbiage of rights and freedoms (or in this case, pithy “f-ck the patriarchy” shirts). Rights are absolutely important, and any adherent to the non-aggression principle must grapple with the fundamental question: at what point do I begin to do harm toward another being? What happens when my right to make a self-interested choice, in pursuit of career or comfort or financial security, impedes another being’s right to get a chance at living a meaningful life? Have I been tasked with keeping this living being safe, and do I have a moral responsibility to help it grow and develop, accepting the consequence of my choice to have sex? Does my responsibility to my unborn child rub up against my belief that I cannot realistically give my child a chance at a good life? You Don’t Have To Be a Prude to Abhor Abortion Women celebrating their sexual agency by having sex with as many people as they want does not skeeve me out. These women look like me; for all intents and purposes, I should believe what they believe. They, like me, have tattooed arms and legs and torsos, sometimes dyed hair or an undercut. They wear fashionable dresses and don matte lipstick. They live in Seattle or NYC or Portland or San Francisco or Austin. If the goal of this book is to make them relatable, it succeeds a bit, but I already knew women who get abortions are relatable. I have many friends and acquaintances who have had abortions, and I think about them every time I write an article on abortion. Their choices eat at my soul, but so does their pain. I have very few moral qualms with other people having as much sex as they want, but I feel complete moral clarity that abortion is wrong — clarity that was formed via secular beliefs, not religious ones, and exploration of the stages of fetal development. I feel no such clarity––especially as a libertarian––on what to do about it, and what sort of legal framework prioritizes harm reduction while sending the clear message that innocent life in the womb absolutely deserves to be valued and protected. But what I’m saying is that these are all discussions worth having, and much of America, or at least a good chunk of those polled by Pew and Gallup, believes that the answer might not simply be “ban all abortions” or “legalize all abortions and never ask any questions or pass any judgement.” “Shout Your Abortion” and Lindy West and Trevor Noah all make me feel like hope is lost in terms of having that discussion, like it’s futile to try to push for a more intellectually honest way of framing abortion. Like it’s pointless to try to write about it from a place of nuance and charitable framing with, yes, an inescapable pro-life bent. Most of all, they make me worried that our culture isn’t one that rallies for mothers––like the only way for women to become equal is to erase or hide our status as givers of life, lest we be unable to get ahead. “Shout Your Abortion” is complicit in this, and in reducing our discussion surrounding abortion to one that does not actually confront the issue, but hides behind zine illustrations and parties with indie bands and fashionable women celebrating their faux liberation in a way that feels sad, empty, and divorced from the issue at hand.

"16",16,"Pushing Abortion On Rape Victims Only Adds To Their Trauma","Bustamante","Kathleen",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-09-26"," Upon the reversal of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court, pro-abortion groups predictably cling to rape and incest as loopholes to maintain abortion in some states. Some Republicans have sided with them — several lawmakers have indicated that they cannot support an abortion ban bill in South Carolina without exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape and incest.



This change of heart comes as a surprise considering the advantage that pro-life Republicans hold in red states across the country following the Supreme Court’s decision. While some pro-life advocates have switched their stance for political gain, others fear that they will appear unsympathetic to the victims of these heinous crimes.



The truth about abortion violence and the physical, psychological, and emotional effects of post-rape and post-incest abortions must be acknowledged by both pro-abortion and pro-life advocates.



Rape and incest are violent. Abortion is equally violent.



Accurate and detailed information about abortion is difficult to find online and, as a result, many Americans remain ignorant about the topic. Abortion advocates such as Planned Parenthood promote this ignorance by downplaying the brutal events that occur when a pregnancy is ended, stating, “Most patients feel pain similar to menstrual cramps” and for others “it is more uncomfortable.” The Planned Parenthood website describes an abortion as a quick procedure during which “a small, hand-held device … removes pregnancy tissue out of the uterus.” The site adds “you’ll hang out in a recovery area until you feel better and are ready to leave.”



The truth is that the physical trauma of abortion can be horrific and can lead to increased miscarriage, breast cancer, and infertility. And for many women, the spiritual, emotional, and psychological side effects of abortion last a lifetime. The trauma of rape and incest, which is then compounded by the trauma of abortion, can leave women even worse off than had they not chosen abortion as an option. 



Post-Abortion Depression



The Guttmacher Institute and other pro-abortion entities claim that women do not suffer mentally or emotionally post-abortion and that if depression or suicidal ideation occurs post-abortion, it is most likely due to hormonal changes.



The American Psychological Association also downplays the significance of post-abortion depression, stating it is most likely associated with “perceived stigma and lack of social support, a history of mental health problems, personality traits, such as low self-esteem, features of the pregnancy, including whether the individual wanted it or not.” However, two studies from Finland, which were based upon medical records rather than interviews, show that women who had abortions were six times more likely to commit suicide than women who gave birth. And a study on statistics of suicide following abortions in Denmark showed that “Compared to women who delivered, women who had an early or late abortion had significantly higher mortality rates within 1 through 10 years.” 



A follow-up study published in 2019 in Lancet Psychiatry by Julia Steinberg, et al., countered the Danish study by indicating that abortion did not cause or increase women’s risk of suicide attempts “[b]ecause the risk was the same before and after the abortion, relative to women who did not have an abortion, the abortion cannot be the reason for the increased risk of suicide attempts.” However, one wonders about the objectivity of the report considering that Steinberg had previously served on legal challenges and as a consultant for legal teams regarding abortion and mental health for the Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood.



While it is true that many women experience a sense of relief immediately following an abortion, a long-term study by abortion proponent Dr. Brenda Major analyzed female depression rates and found that the rates of depression in women two years after their abortions were three to five times higher than the general population of women. Another study found that two years after an abortion the participants had significantly rising rates of depression and negative reactions and lowering rates of positive reactions, relief, and decision satisfaction.



Post-Rape and Post-Incest Abortion



Perhaps the most convincing proof of the damaging effects of post-rape and post-incest abortions comes directly from the women who have suffered this trauma.



In her book “Forbidden Grief: The Unspoken Pain of Abortion,” therapist Theresa Burke, who works with post-abortive women, shares accounts of those who underwent abortion following rape. One woman explained:



The fact that I got pregnant because of the rape was disgusting. I felt like I had to get rid of it. Somehow, I figured that because I got pregnant I must have enjoyed it. I couldn’t tolerate that concept. I was so ashamed…The rape was nothing compared to the abortion … The rape was bad but I could’ve gotten over it. The abortion is something I will never get over. No one realizes how much that event damaged my life. I hate my rapist, but I hate the abortionist too. I can’t believe I paid to be raped. This will affect the rest of my life.



Serena Dykson was a 13-year-old victim of rape whose parents determined she would undergo an abortion. She described the procedure as follows: 



We enter the clinic, and I was called back to a room alone. I remember the woman talking about clumps and describing abortion. She asked me if I understood, and I nodded yes, but I had no clue what was happening to me. She took me into another room where I lied down. The doctor came in and smiled at me and said, ‘This won’t take long.’ I remember experiencing the most excruciating pain that I had ever felt, and I began to scream. The doctor shouted at me to shut up. A nurse came in and held my hand, but nothing helped to relieve that kind of pain. They then moved me into a room with other women, and I sat down on a recliner chair. When I stood up from that chair, I remember a gush of blood coming out of me. My dad came in and carried me out to the car. After that day, my abortion was never talked about again.



Ten years later, Dykson was married and had two children, but after another traumatic experience, she discovered that the emotional scars of her abortion had not healed, stating, “I realized that I had not dealt with my rape and abortion, and it led me to a path of destruction.” She explained, “I moved out of the house, leaving my husband and my two children, and turned to drugs and alcohol to numb my pain. My husband was always there for me, but I pushed everyone away. I was running full-speed to hell!”



Counselors and ministry leaders who meet with thousands of women post-abortion can speak to the long-term effects of the decision. Brett Meador, a pastor of 25 years in Portland, Oregon, describes what people in ministry regularly encounter, stating “ten, twenty years down the road, that poor woman who had the abortion is feeling condemned and grief in her heart” because of a decision she knew was wrong. “Nobody wants to talk about the psychology of that — the hurt that comes years after an abortion.”



More Trauma Ahead



Ministry leaders like Meador will most likely find themselves providing grief support to an increased number of these women as states such as Oregon, California, and Washington declare themselves havens for women seeking abortion access. In fact, Governors Kate Brown, Gavin Newsom, and Jay Inslee issued a Multi-State Commitment to Reproductive Freedom vowing to “Promote greater access to abortion care services, including by expanding access to medication abortion, removing barriers to telehealth for reproductive healthcare services, and growing the pool of qualified practitioners who may provide abortion and other reproductive healthcare services.”



Compassion toward victims of rape and incest proves farcical unless lawmakers are willing to have an honest conversation about the truly violent nature of abortion and its long-term physical, psychological, and emotional effects on women. Advocating for women to endure a second traumatic situation does not heal them from the first, but instead will only increase occurrences of mental and emotional problems.

"17",17,"Democrats’ Rabid Abortion Stance Is Endangering Their Appeal To Millennials","Hawkins","Kristan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-06-16"," When Democrats passed the most extreme party platform at their convention last summer, the abortion lobby cheered. Their takeover of the party was near completion. The president of NARAL, one of the top abortion groups in the country, spoke about her abortion at the convention and met thunderous applause. No pro-life Democrats spoke at the convention, which included no semblance of anything that could be construed as anti-abortion. Abortion had become the litmus test for Democrats. After all, the party nominated Hillary Clinton, whose radical views on abortion—that abortion should be legal for any reason, at any point in pregnancy—resonated with a paltry 17 percent of millennials. Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion vendor, supported Clinton in the primary and after she won the nomination. They boasted they would spend $30 million and have a bigger ground team than the campaign did. They also gave 99 percent of their donations to Democrats, not surprisingly.  This issue blew up last month when failed presidential candidate Bernie Sanders campaigned for a mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska who has a record of voting anti-abortion. That’s a candidate for mayor, not a member of Congress or U.S. senator. NARAL President Ilyse Hogue, the same woman who shouted her abortion at the Democratic convention, immediately released a scathing statement: “The actions today by the DNC to embrace and support a candidate for office who will strip women—one of the most critical constituencies for the party—of our basic rights and freedom is not only disappointing, it is politically stupid.” What did this candidate, Heath Mello, do to anger the abortion lobby? Rewire, a liberal outlet, enlightened readers: “Mello is a sponsor of the final version of a 20-week abortion ban approved by the governor in 2010, and cast anti-choice votes in favor of requiring physicians to be physically present for an abortion in order toimpede access to telemedicine abortion care, and a law banning insurance plans in the state from covering abortions. He has previously been endorsed by anti-choice group Nebraska Right to Life.” Mello Can’t Be a Democrat Because He Cares About Pain The funny thing about this whole story is what Democrats are so angry with Mello about. He sponsored a 20-week abortion ban, which is when babies have scientifically been able to feel pain. Banning abortion at 20 weeks is popular among Americans, with nearly six in ten saying they favor such laws, including 49 percent of Democrats. According to the same Marist poll, 61 percent of Americans, including 39 percent of Clinton supporters, oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. A different Marist poll released last summer showed 78 percent of Americans believe that abortion facilities should be held to the same medical and safety standards as other outpatient facilities. Even 74 percent of “pro-choicers” agreed with this statement. The Pew Research Center found that 28 percent of all Democrats believe abortion should be illegal in all or most circumstances—a not insignificant number.  This demonstrates the abortion industry’s complete lack of awareness of not only the national consciousness on basic abortion restrictions but a complete cutoff from the reality of what even Democrats and self-identified pro-choicers believe. NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and all their buddies who are pushing taxpayer-funded abortion to the general masses are clueless that their views are competing against a culture that is not okay with abortion at any time in the pregnancy for any reason, much less paid for by taxpayers. Sure, they will sometimes to try use fluffy words like “access to healthcare,” “women’s healthcare,” “abortion care,” or “reproductive rights” to disguise their true intention, but it doesn’t take away from the fact that they have spent years trying to take over the Democratic Party and say goodbye to pro-life Democrats—and they are succeeding. Creating the Litmus Test New Democrat National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tom Perez drew a line in the sand: “Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state. At a time when women’s rights are under assault from the White House, the Republican Congress, and in states across the country, we must speak up for this principle as loudly as ever and with one voice” (emphasis added). House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) countered Perez on a Sunday show, answering “Of course” to journalist Chuck Todd’s question if one could be a member of the Democratic Party and still hold anti-abortion views. She has since reiterated her position, perhaps realizing that alienating voters on this issue will be the death of her party.  Not satisfied with Pelosi’s answer perhaps, Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), a high-ranking Democratic senator, went on CNN’s “State of the Union” and basically said one can be personally pro-life as a Democrat but must support pro-choice policies in public, which more or less lines up with what Perez said: “When it comes to the policy position, I think we need to be clear and unequivocal. As long as they are prepared to back the law, Roe vs. Wade, prepared to back women’s rights as we have defined them under the law, then I think they can be part of the party.” This is where the Democratic Party is about to crumble. Millennials are more politically liberal in general, except on abortion. While the majority will identify as “pro-choice,” 53 percent say abortion should be illegal in all or most (rape/incest/life of the mother) circumstances. The Boston Globe noted the huge polling swing on abortion from 1991-2010 among the younger generation: Young Americans — voters under 30 — were once the most gung-ho in support of unfettered legal abortion. In 1991, fully 36 percent believed abortion should be legal under any circumstances. But by 2010, 18-to-29-year-olds had become more pro-life than their parents — only 24 percent still wanted to keep abortion legal in all cases. More than any other age cohort, in fact, young adults are now the most likely to think abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. It’s more than polling. In 2012, outgoing NARAL president Nancy Keenan noted something she called the “intensity gap” among young pro-choicers and young pro-lifers, saying that young pro-lifers were much more intense in their views than their pro-choice counterparts. She wasn’t wrong. Students for Life of America surpassed the 1,000-group mark last year, and works with more than 1,150 student pro-life groups on middle, high school, and college campuses. Planned Parenthood boasts about 275 campus groups. SFLA outnumbers Planned Parenthood campus groups about four to one. Embracing Abortion Has Hurt Democrats Electorally Late last year, the president of Indiana and Kentucky Planned Parenthood saw the writing on the wall: “The biggest challenge reproduction rights advocates face is the generational gap.” If the abortion industry is looking to the Democratic Party and the next generation to continue their dirty work, it’s not going to happen. The abortion industry has taken over the Democratic Party and is at least partly to blame for their loss in November. And it’s tragic they have allowed that to happen. Democrats believe in many worthy policies meant to care for humanity, but if someone is not pro-abortion, they are being told they have no place in that party. There were once a dozen or so pro-life Democrats in the House of Representatives, but when they sold out their votes on Obamacare in 2009, giving former House speaker Pelosi the votes she needed to pass the bill, all but one of these representatives were defeated the next election cycle. Also following the election, a pro-choice millennial took to Paste Magazine, a left-leaning outlet, with a commentary headlined, “In Order to Compete Nationally, Democrats Must Embrace Pro-Life Candidates.” Unlike many other issues about which my generation has become vastly more left-wing than our parents or grandparents, abortion remains stuck in an even divide. While support for LGBT preferences has skyrocketed, while notions of environmental protection and income inequality and war and peace and race have moved front and center, creating a burgeoning progressive majority in demographic terms, the needle on abortion has not moved at all. Fifty-three percent of 18- to 34-year-olds identify as pro-choice, fewer than in 2001. There is some evidence that young people are even less accepting of abortion than their parents. Unlike many other issues about which my generation has become vastly more left-wing than our parents or grandparents, abortion remains stuck in an even divide. There’s a fantasy bubbling up on the Left that Clinton’s defeat marks an opportunity for a major realignment of the Democratic Party, a shift away from corporate-friendly attitudes and policies towards a true progressive vision. Sure, count me in. But the idea that candidates like Elizabeth Warren or Zephyr Teachout are going to sweep to victory in rural parts of the country with working-class voters by criticizing Wall Street and the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a fantasy of the first order. While many pro-life millennials don’t align themselves with the ideals of the Republican Party, they also have no interest in aligning themselves with the pro-abortion Democratic Party. This demographic is politically up for grabs, especially on abortion. They passionately care about women harmed by the abortion industry and protecting preborn babies, seeing abortion as the greatest human rights injustice of our time. They aren’t going to go where they feel ostracized and abandoned. But they aren’t going to go someplace where, in their view, everyone isn’t treated equally. No place feels like home for these pro-life millennials. But right now it’s Democrats who are insisting pro-lifers will never be welcome.

"18",18,"Why Abortion Won’t Make A Difference To The Presidential Election","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-02-07"," Fresh off the well-worn pavement at the capitol, participants in the March for Life are fired up and optimistic about the future of the movement and its effect on the 2020 presidential election. The Knights of Columbus’s Carl Anderson told Kylee Zempel here at The Federalist, “‘The fact that most Americans want significant restrictions on abortion will affect the results of the 2020 election ‘big time.’” “While abortion may not be the most-discussed issue in the campaign, most Americans, I’m convinced, will vote for a president on the basis of pro-life or pro-abortion,” he said.  The latest Marist poll sponsored by the Knights of Columbus purports to show seven in 10 Americans “would limit abortion to, at most, the first three months of pregnancy.” It also found that 65 percent of respondents said they “‘are more likely to vote for’ candidates who would limit abortion” to the first trimester. That paints quite the rosy view of American sentiments on abortion. But other, stronger lines of evidence, including polling data, indicate pro-life sentiments will have little effect on the 2020 presidential race. It’s easy to curate a set of results that make the pro-life movement look successful in turning the tide of public opinion. For instance, late-term abortions are deeply unpopular among Democrats, with only 22 percent expressing support for abortion through the whole pregnancy. This stat is often batted around as evidence that pro-life leanings might make a difference in who Democrats elect. Yet what respondents tell pollsters they’d prefer, all other things being equal, is a far cry from indicating what citizens are likely to do in the voting booth.  In Polls, Weak Support for Strong Restrictions How do I know? Past performance is the best indicator of future results. Look at the politicians Democrats have voted into office. Of Democrat U.S. senators and representatives, 81 percent have a 100 percent rating from the abortion organization NARAL, as of 2017. A majority of Americans elected Barack Obama president twice, who was a pro-choice as they come, if not overly vocal about it. The entire lineup of major Democratic candidates supports abortion up to birth with the exception of Tulsi Gabbard, who still supports about 97 percent of abortions. But if you need more evidence, a variety of more appropriately worded and contextualized polling responses severely weaken the contention that Americans’ widespread preference for “significant restrictions” will make a difference on election day. These broadly-favored restrictions aren’t as “significant” as pro-lifers would have us believe. Ninety-one percent of abortions are committed in the first trimester, and 98.7 percent occur before the age of viability outside the womb, according to the Centers for Disease Control. If the public favors broad legality for first-trimester abortions, that would devastate the belief that harnessing the power of the majority will eventually majorly curtail abortion.  Polling on the legality of abortion by trimester or “in all or most cases” (which implies first-trimester abortions), then, is the gold standard for examining what the public really thinks about abortion. According to Gallup, in 2018 60 percent of respondents said abortions should “generally be legal” in the first three months of pregnancy, although when asked if it should be legal to abort in the first trimester “for any reason,” support drops to 45 percent (notably up from 41 percent 15 years ago), while 53 percent thought it should be illegal. However, only 36 percent of respondents said they would favor a state law that would “ban all abortions except those necessary to save the life of the mother.” That’s a 17-point difference, probably due to the resistance to banning abortion in cases of rape and incest (75 percent believe it should be legal)—a position many pro-lifers embrace as a practical matter but contradicts the fundamental pro-life belief that killing innocent human life is unjust. More recent results from Gallup reveal 53 percent believe abortion should be legal “under certain circumstances” (as compared to “any circumstances”). A stronger result comes from last year’s polling from Pew Research Center, however. It shows 61 percent of respondents support legal abortion in “all or most cases,” compared to 38 percent who say it should be illegal in all or most cases. “Most cases” certainly implies first-trimester abortions. You could be the least informed citizen in the country and still grasp that the vast majority of abortions are done early in pregnancy and for reasons unrelated to health. Gallup has also found that respondents disfavored overturning Roe v. Wade 60 percent to 33 percent. Many polling respondents apparently don’t know Roe v. Wade allows no restrictions on the “right to choose” in the first trimester, a good indication they don’t care enough about the issue to get a hold of the facts. Further confusing matters, only 50 percent of respondents were willing to say abortion “in general” is “morally wrong.” It stands in contrast to Anderson’s claim that most Americans think “it is fundamentally unjust to intentionally kill an innocent human being.” Polling, if anything, reveals that Americans are confused, conflicted, and ignorant about abortion. The most appropriate measures of abortion opinion—chiefly, opinions on the legality of first-trimester abortion—don’t indicate pro-life attitudes will prevail come election day, or will even register. Ultimately, if the pro-life movement wants to insist their education campaigns are making a difference in elections and ultimately policy, they have to show that there’s been a shift in voter behavior on the issue. Declaring pro-lifers “have the majority” on abortion is as wishful as thinking storks are baby-friendly. Bad News: Voters Have Other Priorities While abortion is considered “very or extremely important” to nearly two-thirds of voters, it is not a priority for the 2020 presidential election. At 64 percent, abortion ranks behind a slew of other economic and social issues: health care (81 percent), terrorism and national security (80 percent), immigration (74 percent), and a host of others, including infrastructure, gun policy, race relations, and taxes. The GOP base is pro-life. But Democrats’ base is fervently pro-abortion, and the base decides primaries. So-called “moderate” or “pro-life” Democrats don’t hold any power, particularly on the national level. A look at the official Democrat Party platform, which explicitly opposes efforts “to impede a woman’s access to safe and legal abortion,” is enough to confirm that fact. If you’re banking on Independents to make the difference in the 2020 general election, only a quarter of them rank abortion as “extremely important,” behind health care, the economy, climate change, and gun policy, among other issues. Fifty-six percent of Independents believe abortion should be legal “under certain circumstances” and 24 percent believe it should be legal in all circumstances. Forty-eight percent of them consider themselves pro-choice compared to 44 percent pro-life. The bottom line: If the abortion issue decides the next president, it probably won’t be Donald Trump. Conventional Wisdom Is Failing Pro-lifers The false perception that pro-lifers can harness the power of the majority—at least on second- and third-trimester abortion—exposes a reasoning flaw. Like Anderson, many pro-lifers operate on the premise abortion moderates have more in common with pro-lifers than with supporters of full-term abortion. Given the genuine revulsion both groups show for late-term abortion (generally considered post-viability, about 22 weeks) when it makes headlines, they can’t wrap their heads around how Democrat candidates can hold such radical positions when so many Democrats disagree with them. Nearly half a century after Roe v. Wade, the pro-life movement has barely achieved any serious restrictions on abortion. As I wrote previously: “If abortion is acceptable [to the voter] on some level, then it is not hard to stretch a tacit blessing over all forms of abortion to protect popular entitlement programs, increase federal education spending, combat climate change, or whatever other policy positions are more important to the voter. For ‘moderate’ pro-choicers, it’s not an all or nothing moral issue; it’s some, or some more.” To tout widespread opposition to “radical” positions like third-trimester abortions “for any reason” as evidence that Democrat candidates are “out of step” with the American people is to exaggerate to the point of inaccuracy.  The space between an abortion “moderate” and an abortion “radical” is miniscule, since both deny that intentional killing of preborn life is unjust. The space between abortion “moderate” and abortion opponent, on the other hand, is a vast chasm. It requires conversion, not affirmation. As inconvenient as this information is to pro-lifers, it needs to be said. The end of abortion in America is not going to come by drumming up attention for massive pro-life marches or slight shifts in results from biased poll questions. It won’t come by insisting that “the people are on our side” or that Americans “overwhelmingly support abortion restrictions,” as if opposing only the murder of more developed preborn babies is some sort of great moral triumph that will turn the tide in abortion policy. It isn’t. Nearly half a century after Roe v. Wade, the pro-life movement has barely achieved any serious restrictions on abortion.

"19",19,"12 Pro-Life Truths To Counter Every Abortion Myth","Bartow","Eleanor",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-10-11"," The divisive national debate about abortion is in the news as much as ever. Texas’ new ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy was blocked by a judge on Wednesday but allowed to continue on Friday, Democrats’ huge spending bill is in part being held up by an amendment allowing federal funding of abortion, and, in what will be the most-watched case in decades, the Supreme Court may overturn its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling later this year. The Roe ruling highlighted the greatest logical flaw in support for abortion: for abortion to be illegal at some point before birth (and even most pro-choice Americans agree it should be illegal in the very late stages), you have to pick that point in time. But when?  With Roe, the Supreme Court first took a trimester approach to when abortion should be permitted. As the Roe opinion was drafted, the justices disagreed on the stage at which abortion should be regulated, even changing that point from the end of the first trimester to the end of the second. In its final form, Roe forbade virtually all abortion regulation in the first trimester, allowed regulation only if serving the mother’s health in the second, and banned prohibition in the third trimester when a mother’s “health” was a consideration. The latter was broadly defined in the companion case Doe v. Bolton to include “emotional, psychological,” and family health, thus effectively allowing all abortions. The justice who wrote the majority opinion in Roe, Harry Blackmun, even wrote in a memo to his colleagues that Roe’s use of trimesters was “arbitrary … but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability (of the fetus), is equally arbitrary.” In Roe, the court did not resolve the question of when life begins but ruled that a fetus did not qualify as a “person” as used in the Constitution. Later, the Supreme Court abandoned the arbitrary trimester framework in favor of another “arbitrary” and “selected point” Blackmun had identified in that memo. In its 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling, the court barred “undue burdens” on abortion before fetal viability.  But drawing the line at the point of viability is also problematic — that point will continue to get earlier in the pregnancy as medical advances create better means of keeping the unborn alive outside the womb; indeed, viability is now weeks earlier than it was when Roe was decided. Yet the unborn child did not become a person because it could survive due to modern science. Newborns are not technically viable either, as they cannot survive on their own. By this logic, we should consider it acceptable to kill newborns. As the issue comes to the forefront of national debate yet again with the court hearing oral arguments on December 1 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, here are the many reasons the arguments in favor of abortion are wrong. Pro-Abortion Claim: The government should stay out of people’s private lives. This is a woman’s choice, not anyone else’s, and a women’s rights issue. Why It’s Wrong: Laws often restrict an individual’s rights, including the right to hurt another person or infringe upon another’s rights. In taking the life of an unborn child, a woman is taking away the most basic of all rights.  An unborn child is not part of a woman’s body, but a separate, individual human being with its own rights. It is not the mother’s property, just as parents are legal guardians of children but not the children’s owners and are not allowed to abuse their children. Pro-Abortion Claim: When most abortions take place, in early pregnancy, a fertilized egg is just a mass of cells, not a human being. It doesn’t feel pain. Why It’s Wrong: A new life begins at conception and should not be destroyed by human interference. First, one-third of abortions take place after nine weeks of pregnancy. From the moment of conception, the zygote has its own unique DNA structure, is alive and growing, and is equipped to become a mature human being. Six weeks after conception, the unborn child’s heartbeat is detectable – but began beating before then. At week three, neural development begins. At week four, the eye, ear, and respiratory systems begin to form. At week six, the mouth and lips are present. At week seven,  the embryo looks like a baby. The beginning of life could be defined by many different points of development — fertilization (the fusion of the nuclei of the sperm and egg cell), implantation, the first movement, heartbeat, or brain waves, consciousness, or birth. Any point you choose could be just a day’s difference between life and death for an unborn child. Nor does the absence of pain at early stages make it moral to kill the unborn child, just as it would not with an adult. Abortion can involve sucking a baby out of the uterus (or as Planned Parenthood puts it, “the suction machine is turned on and the uterus is gently emptied”), causing a stillbirth by injecting a salt solution into the uterus, and other horrors. Pro-Abortion Claim: Abortion can’t be a crime against nature if fertilized eggs are spontaneously miscarried in nature. Why It’s Wrong: The occurrence of an event in nature does not justify deliberately mimicking that event. The elderly die of natural causes, but that doesn’t make it right to kill them. And many miscarriages are associated with extra or missing chromosomes. Pro-Abortion Claim: Birth control isn’t 100 percent effective. When it fails, women have been responsible and need abortion as another method to avoid having a child. Why It’s Wrong: Seven percent of women report having unprotected sex in the past three months, not including 8 percent who have unprotected sex but are seeking pregnancy or already pregnant. Many people who use birth control do not do so effectively. The pregnancy prevention rate of birth-control pills used consistently and correctly is 99 percent. For that small portion who correctly used birth control but it did not work, they have to accept the risks of sexual activity, which include a child. Contraception is free with most health insurance plans and easily available. Pro-Abortion Claim: In the case of rape or incest, when a woman was an innocent victim of an involuntary act, she should not be forced to carry a child. She would be forced to suffer even more. Why It’s Wrong: One percent of women say they want an abortion because they were raped, and less than 0.5 percent say they are pregnant as a result of incest. Even in such very rare cases, an unborn child should not be killed for another person’s evil deed. The pregnant woman needs love and support, not more trauma. An estimated 800,000 abortions take place in the United States each year. Common reasons given for seeking an abortion are that a child would disrupt the mother’s education (38 percent), interfere with job or career (38 percent), or be unaffordable (73 percent). About half of respondents said they didn’t want to be a single mom or were having relationship problems. About a third said they didn’t want any more kids; 25 percent said they didn’t want people to know they had sex or got pregnant; 32 percent said they weren’t ready for a child; and 22 percent didn’t feel mature enough to raise children. More than half of those seeking abortion have had at least one previous birth. Pro-Abortion Claim: Minors are too young for the responsibilities of parenthood. Why It’s Wrong: About 3 percent of females who get abortions are younger than 18, and 8 percent are 18 to 19 years old. Parents of minors should teach their children about the consequences of sex, the benefits of abstinence, and the limitations of contraception, among other things: Sex can lead to pregnancy and if it does the unborn child should not be killed. Accepting truths that you don’t like is part of maturity and sex should be reserved for mature people ready to care for a child. Pro-Abortion Claim: If abortion were made legal only in cases of rape or incest, women would lie. Why It’s Wrong: The court system could settle the truth of their claims and more reporting of rape and incest would help bring perpetrators to justice. Pro-Abortion Claim: Abortion is safer than continuing a pregnancy to term. Why It’s Wrong: Even if abortion is safer than pregnancy, that doesn’t make it right. But with modern medicine, the death risks for both abortion and pregnancy are low. Pro-Abortion Claim: It would be better for abnormal fetuses to be aborted than live with poor health or a disability. Why It’s Wrong: In the case of the small minority of fetuses with a potentially life-threatening abnormality, a natural death may result, but, if not, the child should be given the benefit of the doubt, not be killed. It’s wrong to kill disabled people for their disabilities. Pro-Abortion Claim: If abortion were outlawed, women would just get riskier, dangerous abortions. Why It’s Wrong: People break other laws with repercussions too, but we don’t avoid that outcome by not making those laws. Plus, outlawing abortion would save millions of unborn babies’ lives. It is difficult to know the number of abortions resulting in death before abortion was legalized, because many illegal abortions went unreported. Education is the best alternative, so that women know the risks of trying to get an abortion illegally, how to effectively use birth control, and how they can receive assistance as mothers. Pro-Abortion Claim: The right to an abortion has led to a more prosperous society as women have continued in their careers and low-income couples have not been burdened with an additional expense. Abortion has reduced the child abuse and crime that arise from unwanted children. Why It’s Wrong: Abortion has been bad for our society, as it devalues human life and the fulfillment that only family and children, not a job, can provide. If women want to put careers first or can’t afford children, they should practice abstinence or correctly use birth control and accept the consequences if that fails. If women are poor and do have children, the government provides assistance. Adoption is also a better option than killing an unborn child. Many loving, screened, financially stable parents are waiting to adopt babies. As for whether studies prove that abortion has reduced crime or abuse, this is a dangerous line of argument. Should we abort babies of certain groups more likely to be criminals? Pro-Abortion Claim: A woman has a right to privacy, as recognized by the Supreme Court, and to make her own decisions about her life and happiness. Why It’s Wrong: Roe v. Wade continues to be so strongly resisted because it was deeply legally flawed. In the majority opinion in Roe, Justice Blackmun acknowledged that “the Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy,” and thus abortion, but that a number of prior court decisions have found “a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy” grounded in the First, Fifth, and particularly the Ninth and 14th Amendments. The latter reads, “No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The Ninth Amendment states, “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” The legal arguments are lengthy, but the short version is that the constitutional right to liberty simply does not grant the right to kill another person, and an unborn child is a person. The Constitution does not explicitly guarantee a right to privacy or, by extension, abortion. The Supreme Court has been gravely wrong before (such as with racist rulings in Dred Scott v. Sandford and Plessy v. Ferguson). Abortion is a deeply divisive issue, and about half of Americans consider themselves pro-life and half call themselves pro-choice. Overturning Roe would not end abortion rights but return the issue to the states, allowing for a more democratic process.

"20",20,"Abortion Is Not Safer Than Giving Birth","Paprocki","Anna",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-05-04"," It’s understandable that pro-abortion advocates were eager to circulate a Vox video purporting to prove the safety of abortion last week. After all, yet another abortion clinic was making headlines for unsanitary conditions and harm to patients, drawing attention to the need for enforcing the health and safety laws abortion proponents bitterly fight. But the attempted defense of abortion Vox’s Liz Plank offered may actually be worse than her attempt at humor with a “Knock, knock. Who’s there? Abortion” joke. Notably, before repeating the discredited myth that “abortion is safer than childbirth,” Plank admits a profound truth that abortion advocates generally avoid. By prefacing her arguments with the statement “if you only look at the safety of the mother,” she tacitly recognizes that abortion concerns the safety of two human beings. Abortion is always unsafe for the baby. (You know, that whole “crushing of body parts” that Plank displays annoyance over pro-lifers being “particularly vocal” about lately.)  After acknowledging that pregnant women are, in fact, mothers, Plank alleges “abortion is actually safer than childbirth” by comparing two data points from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that the CDC itself has said are not comparable. Maternal mortality and abortion mortality “measures are conceptually different and are used by CDC for different health purposes.” In other words, Plank peddles apples-to-oranges numbers as the basis of her claim. Abortion Is Much Riskier Than Birth Contrary to Plank’s attempt to soften abortion’s image by alleging that “most abortions don’t involve any form of cutting or surgery,” the vast majority of abortions are accomplished by invasive procedures that carry risks including, according to Planned Parenthood: “injury to the cervix or other organs.” The risks to a woman’s short- and long-term physical health are real and deserve serious attention. Other immediate physical risks from abortion procedures that even Planned Parenthood acknowledges include “allergic reaction, blood clots in the uterus, incomplete abortion — part of the pregnancy is left inside the uterus, failure to end the pregnancy, undetected ectopic pregnancy, very heavy bleeding.” These risks “increase the longer you are pregnant. They also increase if you have sedation or general anesthesia.” Chemical abortions have a lengthy list of known complications, too. Some recent studies have even found higher incidences of immediate adverse events for chemical abortions than for surgical abortions.  Regardless of what type of abortion a mother undergoes—a 15-minute invasive procedure, a lengthier surgery, or multiple days of potent drugs—an abortion’s consequences are profound. The risks to her short- and long-term physical health are real and deserve serious attention. Also, Abortion Data Is Unreliable The problems with Plank’s defense of abortion run deeper than her euphemisms and faulty use of dissimilar CDC statistics, because U.S. abortion data is known to be incomplete and unreliable. There is no federal abortion reporting requirement. Even the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute acknowledges that the current “patchwork of surveillance efforts” relies on “incomplete” reports from states and that California—estimated to account for 17 percent, or one out of every six abortions in the country—is one of three states that “do not report to the CDC at all.” Guttmacher uses voluntary reporting from abortionists, filtered through its own ideological lens, which fails to fill these gaping holes. Even pro-abortion advocates have said women face significant obstacles when reporting complaints against abortion providers. Other factors compound the poor quality of reporting on abortion and abortion complications. Even pro-abortion advocates have said women face significant obstacles when reporting complaints against abortion providers. Susan Schewel, the executive director of the Women’s Medical Fund in Philadelphia, explained that, in her experience trying to work with women to file complaints with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, “The women found the complaint process so onerous and the telling of their stories so personally difficult that they failed to complete the paperwork and abandoned the effort.”  Abortionists have allegedly discouraged women from being truthful about their abortion complications. A former Planned Parenthood employee’s “whistleblower” lawsuit explains that chemical abortion patients who later experienced significant bleeding were told “to go to an emergency room and report that they were experiencing a spontaneous miscarriage.” Still other complications are unreported because they go unconnected to the abortion that caused them. Jayne Mitchell-Werbrich, a nurse who left Planned Parenthood of Delaware because of its “meat market type assembly line care,” not because of any change of heart on abortion, testified before the Delaware Senate that “the sad thing is that these women may not even realize the fact that Planned Parenthood could be at fault for these medical tragedies even years after they had their abortions at Planned Parenthood.” Women Deserve to Know These Risks Further, Plank uncritically parrots the abortion industry’s talking points about the impact of Texas health and safety standards on clinic closures—talking points Texas has already exposed in its brief before the Supreme Court as “inaccurate representations about whether HB 2 caused certain abortion clinics to close.” In an “Impact of HB2” map they created and provided to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the abortionists challenging the Texas law went so far as to include clinics that closed before HB2 even passed. Plank’s attempt to discredit proponents of health and safety standards ignores the ugly realities of the abortion industry these laws address. While Plank would have viewers blindly mourn any clinic closures, her attempt to discredit proponents of health and safety standards ignores the ugly realities of the abortion industry these laws address. The inherent risks of abortion are amplified by an industry that has a long history of bad actors placing profit as their highest priority. On one point Plank and I agree. We should be talking more about abortion and its risks. Although another talking point she repeats—that about 1 out of every 3 women will have an abortion in their lifetimes—has earned a “Two Pinocchios” rating in the Washington Post as a stale claim that fails to take into account declining abortion rates, the high numbers of annual abortions should elevate concerns about the unarguable risks. Even modest risks of harm have a large impact. Plank set out to prove that passion clouds facts, and ends up proving her own point. If Plank is genuinely interested in helping women, instead of dialing up an abortionist to give a sales pitch for the business she profits from, she should join us in calling for national abortion reporting laws.

"21",21,"The End Of Abortion Moderates","Fiene","Hans",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-09-30"," Not too long ago, abortion moderates ruled the political landscape. After solidifying their respective positions on Roe v. Wade, Republicans and Democrats spent a few decades seeking to woo those who didn’t like the extreme-sounding idea of banning the procedure outright but found a complete lack of restrictions equally unsettling. Attempting to convince the Goldilocks vote that their position was perfectly reasonable, Republicans identified as pro-life, but noted they believed in exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Likewise, Democrats adopted the Clinton mantra that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare.” Republicans were opposed to abortion, but wanted to tell you all the times it should take place. Democrats wanted abortion legal, but didn’t want it to happen. That’s six one way, half a dozen the other for an abortion moderate.  Each side has been singing a different tune lately. During the first Republican presidential debate, Sen. Marco Rubio visibly bristled at the suggestion that he supports rape and incest exceptions, a position held by every Republican nominee since Reagan. Likewise, when Hillary Clinton was recently asked whether she favored any restrictions on abortion, she couldn’t name one, not even a federal ban on late-term abortions such as the one Senate Democrats blocked last Tuesday. Clinton, it seems, has traded the “safe, legal, and rare” mantra for the battle hymn of the leftist radicals, of abortion on demand and without apology. One could make the argument that, typical of primary season, both Republican and Democrat candidates are appealing to their respective bases, but that only strengthens the point. Far more vociferously than in the past, the Republican base is telling those who seek the nomination, “You will ban all abortions.” The Democrat base, on the other hand, is saying to its suitors, “You will celebrate all abortions.” What happened to those from each party who simply said that abortion is an ugly business, but one we’re stuck with? Why is there no place on the Left or Right for those who say that not all abortions are created equal? What happened to the abortion moderates? Each Side’s Ace of Spades To understand the moderate position on abortion, and why it’s doomed to disappear from political discourse, imagine the competing abortion worldviews as two different forms of a card game. Pro-lifers are playing by the rules, formed by natural law and reproductive science respectively, that no one has the right to take an innocent life and that life begins at conception. Because of this, the right to life is the ace of spades. It always trumps the right to end innocent life, even if that innocent life was conceived without the mother’s consent.  Pro-lifers are playing by the rules formed by natural law and reproductive science. Abortion advocates, however, have designed their game with the presupposition that bodily autonomy is the ace of spades that any amount of fetal development cannot defeat. Moderates, however, want to insert themselves into each side’s game and change the rules into a scenario where trump is determined by comparing abortion to an unwanted pregnancy and deciding which one is sadder. For abortion moderates, why does support for abortion drop the further into a pregnancy a fetus gets? Because the more a child develops, for many people the sadder it becomes to take that child’s life, giving less power to the emotional status of the woman carrying a baby she doesn’t want. Why do pro-life-leaning moderates favor exceptions in cases of rape and incest? Because, in that scenario, the emotional trauma of being reminded of the terrible thing that happened to you every time you look at your growing belly is so high that it trumps the normally unbeatable right of a child to live. For the abortion moderate, empathy is the ace of spades and whichever position has more of it in a given scenario is the winner. Why Abortion Subjectivity Will Lose The problem with the moderate approach to abortion, however, is that subjectivity always loses to objectivity in the end. If you join the liberal poker table and accept its objective presupposition that bodily autonomy is the supreme right of humankind, you will eventually quit playing Calvinball and rationalize any abortion-related discomfort because, if a woman always has the right to do whatever she wants with her body, then it doesn’t matter if what she wants to do with her body takes the life of an innocent child.  Modern abortion advocates have no problem making this argument. It doesn’t matter if the woman’s offspring can feel pain or recoil from the abortionist’s scissors or even survive outside the womb. The woman gets what she wants. Them’s the rules. This is why the Right will continue to grow righter, the Left will grow lefter, and the moderates will grow fewer. Likewise, if you embrace the objective presuppositions of the pro-life side, you can spend one or two generations inventing wild cards and rationalizing why it’s acceptable to take innocent life simply because that life was conceived through an act of violence. But by the third generation or so, those who believe the foundation of the game is the inherent value of all human life won’t continue hacking away at that foundation simply because the violated mother is an empathetic figure. This is why the Right will continue to grow righter, the Left will grow lefter, and the moderates will grow fewer as Roe v. Wade recedes further behind us. The moderate position on abortion can’t survive a long-term cultural battle because the moderate position on abortion isn’t actually a position. It’s the deliberate avoidance of a position, an exercise in running away from the logical conclusions that all of us must eventually draw from the principles we accept. And we must accept one worldview or the other. If the greatest right in the world is the right to life, then abortion is evil, indefensible in all circumstances*, and should be outlawed. If, however, the greatest right in the world is a woman’s freedom to control her uterus at all times, then abortion is good, empowering, and deserving of celebration. When People Celebrate Abortion What happens when people celebrate abortion? Abortion moderates get very uncomfortable. Last week, the Twitter hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion appeared, encouraging women to boast of how their abortions liberated them, and many were happy to oblige. Here are a few samples: I’ve had 2 abortions. I don’t have to justify or explain them to anybody. My life is more valuable than a potential life. #shoutyourabortion
— Clementine Ford (@clementine_ford) September 21, 2015 Abortion is a medical procedure, not a moral quagmire. It is more dangerous to give birth than it is to have an abortion. #shoutyourabortion
— Clementine Ford (@clementine_ford) September 21, 2015 I’ve never wanted to have children, so I had an abortion. I’m thriving, without guilt, without shame, without apologies. #ShoutYourAbortion
— favianna rodriguez (@favianna) September 21, 2015 Many responses to the hashtag campaign, however, were observations like this: I’m pro choice but I think #ShoutYourAbortion is stupid. It’s a deeply personal and emotional thing for most women. Why shout about it?
— Phantom Socks (@Rinaxas) September 22, 2015 In other words, the moderate voice says, “I guess abortion should be legal, but abortion isn’t something we should celebrate.” An abortion moderate says this because he recognizes that abortion isn’t a morally neutral medical procedure like an appendectomy, for which no one need be guilt-ridden. He realizes that abortion is a procedure that begins with an unborn child living in a mother’s womb and ends with that child dead in a medical waste bin. No matter how he may justify preserving its legality, the abortion moderate recognizes that abortion itself is sad, heartbreaking, shameful. If You Don’t Celebrate Abortion… If abortion is not something to celebrate, the objective presupposition that leads people to celebrate abortion is proven false. If we cringe as people boast of preserving bodily autonomy by ending human life, this shows we know and believe that the right to life is, in fact, the ace of spades, that it should trump all other factors in addressing an unwanted pregnancy. If we cringe as people boast of preserving bodily autonomy by ending human life, this shows we know and believe that the right to life should trump all other factors. Quite simply, you can’t remain an abortion moderate. You have to join one card game or the other. If you’re sickened by people speaking of dismembering their offspring as though they’d been liberated from slavery, you’ve already chosen your side. So come join your fellow radicals who believe that precious, God-given life begins at conception, regardless of how conception occurred. Come join the throng of lunatics who would give up their plans for a vacation home to help raise an unexpected grandchild because they told their teenage daughter she didn’t need to accept the quick, easy, and deadly fix offered by Planned Parenthood. Come join the raging extremists who would tell a woman who has been raped, “Your child deserves to be protected from violence, just as you did, and that’s why we’ll love you both, feed you both, clothe you both, and welcome both of you into our homes.” Come align yourself with the war-on-womeneering priests and pastors who will hear the tearful confessions of women who can no longer shout away their guilt over their abortions, and hear those anti-choice zealots say in response, “You don’t need to cry any more because, in His dying words, Jesus shouted your abortion into the grave and shouted His forgiveness onto you.” *If you have raised the “what about the life of the mother” exception for abortion, this article from Lila Rose is quite helpful.

"22",22,"5 Sad Predictions For Ireland In The Wake Of Its New Abortion Laws","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-06-01"," On May 25, voters repealed Ireland’s abortion ban, which had been in place for 35 years. The Irish Times reported exit polls showed 68 percent voted “yes” on a referendum to repeal the ban and only 32 percent voted no. The former law had essentially made abortion illegal, except when the mother’s life was in danger from her pregnancy. In light of the repeal passing, here are five predictions for our friends across the pond, based on statistics and experience.  1. More Moms Will Experience Mental and Emotional Pain Based on the mantra that it’s “my body, my choice,” women in Ireland largely supported the referendum: 70 percent voted to repeal the ban. Unfortunately it’s women who will suffer the most emotionally, psychologically, and mentally. While studies that show women suffer mentally following an abortion were rare decades ago, they have been increasingly common and relevant. In a study titled “Women Who Suffered Emotionally from Abortion: A Qualitative Synthesis of Their Experiences,” Patricia Coleman tried to capture the thoughts and emotions women experience following their abortions. As my colleague A.D.P. Efferson explained, “One interesting result was the increase in women seeking mental health care and prescription drug use pre- and post-abortion. Prior to their first pregnancy resulting in an abortion, 13 percent of those surveyed reported having visited a psychiatrist, psychologist, or counselor, compared to 67.5 percent who received mental health services after their first abortion.” In a 2011 study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, abortion was “tied to [a] sharp decline in women’s mental health.” The authors of the study wrote, “Results indicate quite consistently that abortion is associated with moderate to highly increased risks of psychological problems subsequent to the procedure.” While it was once common to believe abortion was “only” harmful for the baby being aborted, it’s now obvious abortion has long-lasting and often devastating psychological effects on many women who choose it. Sadly, many women of Ireland who voted to repeal their country’s abortion ban will discover these negative results firsthand.  2. An Increase in Unintended Pregnancies In 2016, 3,265 women living in Ireland sought abortion services in another European country.  But that number that has declined every year for more than a decade until this year, the lowest it has been since 1980. To say that another way, every year that abortion has been illegal in Ireland, the number of women who sought abortion elsewhere in Europe peaked in 2001, then steadily declined for another 15 years. Amazingly, the birth rate in Ireland hasn’t increased that much during that time. From 1916 to 2012, overall births only increased by approximately 8,000. By 2016, the overall birth rate had fallen, just as with every other developed nation, nearly all of which allow abortion. Clearly banning abortion did not force Irish women to have scads of children. In 2016, reports showed the number of teenage pregnancies had fallen a whopping 64 percent in 15 years. This is likely to change over time. In the United States, which has allowed abortion on demand for several decades, half of all pregnancies are unintended and half of those end in abortion. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the U.S. unintended pregnancy rate dropped 18 percent between 2008 and 2011, to its lowest level in 30 years, likely due to the increase in abortion restrictions and overall decrease in abortions. The opposite may well happen in Ireland. With abortion now readily available, the use of contraception may increase as it has here in the United States, but so will abortion and thus, possibly, unintended pregnancies and sexual promiscuity. Studies have found that abortion availability increases unintended pregnancies by encouraging riskier sexual behavior by providing a “fail-safe” to circumvent the natural consequences of sex.  It will take time, but over the course of the next few months and years, the availability of abortion will seep into couples’ subconscious ideas about sexuality, promiscuity, contraception, and pregnancy. Without abortion, all of those things bore consequences. Now, these consequences can be reduced to the parents of a child by killing the child. Because of this, Ireland is likely to see a huge shift in contraception use and unintended pregnancies, particularly among millennials and younger generations. 3. Medical Advancement and Care May Decrease One of the reasons the pro-life campaign in Ireland believed so strongly in “Saving the 8th,” as their slogan read, is because the abortion ban strengthened Ireland’s medical industry. While pro-choice Irish claimed abortion was medically necessary, the opposite had actually proven to be true. Since abortion was not a legal option, Ireland became a world leader in medical care for women and babies. According to the Maternal Death Enquiry, Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world in which to have a baby. The maternal death rate is extremely low compared with the United Kingdom and United States, both of which boast abortion on demand. Ireland’s law, which at first seemed restrictive, helped neonatal medicine flourish because there was no other option—the baby must be saved. The survival rate of babies born prematurely rose. For example, little Ailbhe Byrne was born in 2012 at Holles Street Maternity Hospital at 23 weeks of gestation and weighing less than one pound! Saving her life was a record-breaking achievement at the time. Today she is four years old and doing well. Widely available abortion may decrease this focus on neonatal and maternal care. If more and more women simply decide to abort their difficult pregnancies, Ireland may eventually lose their impetus for developing such a robust medical focus. 4. More Babies Will Die, Of Course Because abortion has been legal for so long in America, it’s almost hard to imagine this culture without it. Many no longer even flinch at the word or even the description of this ghoulish act. Still, that doesn’t change that abortion is murder and a particularly gory kind. The fact that Ireland has always had an abortion ban means they have yet to fully realize this fact. So far, Ireland’s repeal only addresses first-trimester abortions. Here is a description from the World Health Organization, ironically entitled, “Safe abortion.” An abortionist uses metal rods or medication to dilate the woman’s cervix and gain access to the uterus, where the baby resides. The abortionist then inserts a suction catheter to vacuum the child from the womb. The suction machine has a force approximately 10 to 20 times the force of a household vacuum cleaner. The procedure is completed as the abortionist uses a sharp metal device called a curette to empty the remains of the child from the mother’s uterus. While it’s not nearly as traumatizing as a second- or even third-trimester abortion sounds, a first trimester abortion still causes a baby with a beating heart to feel pain and die. There is no such thing as a safe abortion, only a childless mother and a dead baby. Also, let’s not pretend that just because this repeal didn’t cover second- and third-term abortions, Ireland won’t soon decide to allow those later. The likelihood of them stopping at first-trimester abortions, especially since the repeal passed with such a large margin, is small. Second-trimester abortions are particularly awful for a baby who has developed nerve endings, feels pain, and can recognize the sound of his mother’s voice. Abortion is cruel, inhumane, and demoralizing, both for mom and baby, and the citizens of Ireland will soon know this horrible truth. 5. Ireland’s Culture Will Degrade Its Respect for Life This might seem like an obvious point, but it’s different than the loss of unborn babies. It’s hard to underestimate how big of a hit to its general culture of life Ireland will take now that they have legalized abortion. While much of the rest of the world has been slaughtering babies in utero, Ireland stood firm to defend the most defenseless amongst them. Now that that has changed, the rest of the defenseless in Ireland—the aged, the infirm, the mentally ill—will be next. That’s how it has happened everywhere else across the world. Abortion first, then other types of euthanasia. Devaluing life in all its stages, particularly that of the youngest and most defenseless among us, is not moral or joyful. Currently, it’s illegal in Ireland to assist with someone’s suicide, even with their consent. This carries a penalty of 14 years in prison. As the United States, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and other countries can attest, when a country is free to murder babies, the slope toward doing likewise to other people who seem ill, defenseless, or a burden is a lot more slippery. The same logic applies towards killing them as it does to killing the unborn. In the United States especially, abortion paved the way to euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Seven states now allow the latter here. The U.K. is arguably worse, what with cases like Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans—ill toddlers whose parents lobbied for medical care elsewhere and were denied despite offers across the world—because the culture of life in England has devolved so much. The devaluation of life is not only clear in both the fact that Ireland voted to repeal this ban but how they reacted when it happened. Irish citizens came home in droves, voted to allow for their own people to devalue and demoralize other humans made in the image of God, then celebrated as if they had experienced a joyous event. Devaluing life in all its stages, particularly that of the youngest and most defenseless among us, is not moral or joyful. As this act trickles down to other kinds of demoralizing laws, Ireland will soon discover, like the United States did long ago, it’s very hard to go back.

"23",23,"6 Reasons Treating Abortion Like A Spa Makes Sense","Otto","Amy",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-05-01"," Carafem is a new abortion-pill clinic opening in Maryland that is committed to providing a “spa-like” experience for women. According to their business plan, they plan to charge around $400 dollars for a service that includes the following: Carafem will offer only the abortion pill, not vacuum aspiration or other surgical procedures, prospective clients must be no more than 10 weeks pregnant. (Roughly two-thirds of all abortions occur in the first eight weeks of pregnancy, according to Guttmacher.)
After receiving counseling and some basic tests, Carafem clients will take an initial pill at the clinic. Purdy’s team expects to get them in and out quickly, within about 60 minutes. They will be sent home with a second set of pills to take the next day. The second dose induces the abortion, which resembles a miscarriage, typically within six hours.
By offering only pharmaceutical abortions, Purdy says, he can avoid purchasing expensive surgical equipment and can keep prices low for clients. The average pharmaceutical abortion cost about $500 in the United States in 2011, Guttmacher figures show; Purdy plans to charge around $400. Purdy, one of the business’s founders, also told the Washington Post that in some countries, women can procure their own chemical abortions by visiting a pharmacy. In the United States, however, concerns about safety mean some states regulate abortion-inducing chemical packages. This can make it especially hard for women in rural areas to execute their own abortions. So, of course Purdy’s first move is to open his clinic in “Montgomery County’s tony Friendship Heights area.”  In its effort to destigmatize abortion, which abortion advocates have renewed lately (just check out Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards’ recent Time article), this business’s existence implicitly admits that a few things are key to its success. 1. Nobody Likes Killing Big Babies Its focus on terminations during a child’s first ten weeks of life acknowledges that support for late-term abortion is low among Americans. In fact, “A Quinnipiac poll found that 60 percent of women support limiting abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.” A CBS News poll found that 60 percent of Americans thought abortion “should not be permitted” or available only under “stricter limits.” A CNN Poll found that 58 percent of Americans believe abortion should legal only in a “few circumstances” or “always illegal.” 2. The Abortion Industry Knows It’s Going Down Focusing on early terminations takes into account likely future regulatory changes in the United States. In other modern western countries, abortion is heavily restricted after 12 weeks. Per the BBC, here’s a short version of what abortion regulations look like in Denmark. Availability: On requestGestational limit: 12 weeksConditions: After 12 weeks, if the pregnancy does not pose a risk to the woman’s life or of serious deterioration to her physical or mental health, the abortion must be approved by a committee of four people.
The procedure must be performed by a physician in a state or communal hospital or in a clinic attached to a hospital. No cost, part of the public health system.
Abortion for non-residents is not allowed unless they have some special relationship with Denmark. Here’s Germany:  Availability: On requestGestational limit: 12 weeksConditions: The woman must receive proper counselling three days before the procedure. The state-regulated counselling is required to inform the woman that the unborn have a right to life and to try to convince her to continue her pregnancy.
The procedure is not covered by public health insurance except for women with low income. The law includes penalties for people who force a pregnant woman to obtain an abortion or who induce a pregnant woman to have an abortion by maliciously withholding support payments. And Italy: Availability: On requestGestational limit: 12 weeksConditions: A one-week reflection period is imposed unless the situation is one of urgency. A certificate confirming the pregnancy and the request for termination must be issued by a doctor and signed by the woman and the doctor.
Parental authorisation is required if the woman is under 18. After 12 weeks, abortion is allowed only if the foetus has a genetic deficiency or to preserve the physical and mental health of the mother. An abortion must be performed in a public hospital or authorised private facility – if there are staff willing to perform the procedure.
The influence of the Roman Catholic Church – and the threat of excommunication for anyone performing an abortion and any woman obtaining an abortion – means the majority of physicians and other healthcare professionals invoke a conscience clause allowing them to be exempted on moral or religious grounds. While many pro-life folks would initially see the creation of an abortion spa with horror, some major caving is happening here. It’s clear that late-term abortion bans can be implemented successfully when even a pro-abortion business plan admits its focus on pregnancies 10 weeks and younger. Further, to verify pregnancy status, one suspects Carafem will have to perform a sonogram to ensure that a pharmaceutical abortion is even possible. Again, more support for clear regulatory reform on abortion. The Left always likes to see itself as sophisticated, Eurocentric folks. Look across the Atlantic for the norms in regulating abortion that are already culturally accepted in most Western countries. 3. Abortionists Play the Numbers Game Despite the pretense of wanting to expand access, these business owners know who their target is based on numbers. Hint: it’s not rural areas. Single, upper-class women are four times more likely to abort than women in any other income bracket. Cultural acceptance of abortion varies across income levels. Many push back on this narrative to make the case that the poor should have better access to birth control, but if wealthy women who can clearly afford birth control still are having the highest rate of abortion—at 31.9 percent versus 8.6 percent for the poorest—that tells you that access and cost are not the reasons for this gap. Wealthy women have the means to avoid needing an abortion by availing themselves of birth control. Despite that, they are overwhelmingly having more abortions than poorer women. In its recent ad, Carafem is trying to support the façade that it’s upper-class women who speak in hushed tones about abortion, but the numbers tell an opposite story. Carafem’s ad is meant to maintain the delusion that abortion is ubiquitous for its wealthy target client base.  4. Planned Parenthood Isn’t Up to Snuff Planned Parenthood is not providing many women a suitable “experience” and apparently a more expensive one if they charge more than $400. According to Planned Parenthood’s own website, first-trimester abortions can run up to $1,500. That price is despite Planned Parenthood’s enormous subsidies from American taxpayers: “The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has finally confirmed what we’ve been saying all along: Planned Parenthood is using your tax dollars to promote abortion—more specifically, 1.5 billion tax dollars over three years were used to promote abortion as ‘reproductive health care.’” 5. Abortion Is Not Health Care If the private market can build a business model that outperforms Planned Parenthood, one can also ask why that organization needs taxpayer dollars. This has a few implications. First, regarding health insurance, it enables the argument that abortion is not health care. Unless the mother’s life is in danger, abortion is an elective procedure like plastic surgery or Lasik. This is a broad simplification for a very contentious cultural issue, but bear with me. The outcome of a pregnancy is a child. That is not a disease needing a cure. Health care is to prolong life, not eliminate it. 6. Abortion Is an Indulgence Creating a spa-like environment around an activity tells you it’s a selective procedure. Abortion is an indulgence. Pairing it up with a “spa-like” experience reinforces that brand. This provides an unexpected opening for those in the pro-life movement. Selling abortion as the new manicure is the exact place it belongs in people’s minds. It’s not health care, it’s a wealthy person’s self-centered indulgence. This time though, it’s harming people who cannot speak for themselves. No matter what wood paneling one puts up at his abortion spa, attempts to rebrand it only make it more clear how self-indulgent an act it really is. Carry on with this overreach. These people cannot sell death, but they’ve opened a window for pro-life folks to fight back.

"25",25,"4 Ways Planned Parenthood Has Billed Taxpayers For Elective Abortions","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-10-14"," In her testimony before Congress, Planned Parenthood CEP Cecile Richards repeatedly insisted that federal law already prohibits Planned Parenthood from using tax dollars for abortions. The Hyde Amendment does prohibit Planned Parenthood from billing federal taxpayers for any abortion except those for rape or incest, or that are necessary to save the mother’s life. These exceptions are so exceedingly rare that states will report only a handful of those Medicaid-paid abortions annually—if any at all. But it is also undeniably true that taxpayer dollars have been and are paid to Planned Parenthood for abortions and to subsidize abortions. Since money is fungible, when Planned Parenthood is receiving over a half billion dollars annually—well over $127 million of that “excess revenue”—taxpayers are effectively freeing up other funds to pay for Planned Parenthood’s abortion business. Other than Planned Parenthood pledges, we have no evidence that taxpayer dollars aren’t keeping the lights on and running the water in the abortion room.  One important admission from Richards’ testimony is that a shocking 86 percent of Planned Parenthood’s non-government revenue stream is from abortion. That abortion revenue appears to make up a sizable part of the $765 million profit Planned Parenthood has made over the last decade. More troubling still, in several instances Planned Parenthood directly billed and bills taxpayers for elective abortions. 1. State Medicaid Abortion Funding Mandates The Hyde Amendment does not prevent states from making taxpayers pay for elective abortions, and many states are effectively doing this through their Medicaid programs. Thus, in 17 states taxpayers are compelled to pay for most abortions. In California alone, it appears taxpayers are paying for roughly 80,000 abortions per year—in the state where StemExpress has been buying infant body parts from Planned Parenthood clinics. Richards intentionally and carefully worded her answer to say that federal taxpayer dollars cannot be used for abortion. She failed to acknowledge that an unknown but sizable part of the $528 million Planned Parenthood received from federal and state taxpayers last year was to reimburse it for abortions. In fact, the largest state, California, has taken it several steps further and forced not just taxpayers but the insurance plans of churches (paid from tithe money) to pay for elective abortions. While this abortion mandate blatantly violates federal law, the Obama administration has refused to intervene.  2. Billing Federal Taxpayers for Abortions in New York The Alliance Defending Freedom has compiled the known federal and state audits of Planned Parenthood and state family planning programs, revealing millions of dollars in waste, abuse, and potential fraud by Planned Parenthood, including a $4.3 million settlement after the Obama administration’s Department of Justice contended that Planned Parenthood had overbilled Texas’s Medicaid program. Some of these audits have demonstrated that Planned Parenthood has billed federal Medicaid for abortions. Audits have demonstrated that Planned Parenthood has billed federal Medicaid for abortions. New York requires its taxpayers to pay for elective abortions through Medicaid, but these abortions are still not supposed to be paid by federal taxpayer dollars because of the Hyde Amendment. But audits have revealed that New York, and apparently Planned Parenthood specifically, was billing federal taxpayers for elective abortions. In 2008, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General examined billings by family planning programs in New York. During one four-year audit period, HHS found that hundreds of thousands of abortion-related claims were billed unlawfully to Medicaid by improperly labeling them “family planning” and thus receiving the higher federal share of the reimbursement. One 2008 federal audit looked at just a small sample of 119 Medicaid claims and found that 27 of them were abortion procedures. It also found that one unnamed provider was responsible for 25 of these, representing four different services performed in conjunction with abortions. The auditors believed that this provider billed for at least 3,900 abortions during the audit period, improperly labeling them as “family planning,” and thus federal taxpayers paid them at a 90 percent rate. While these federal audits of state family planning programs typically do not identify the providers actually submitting the false claims, the HHS inspector general did identify “especially Planned Parenthoods” specifically as simply billing almost everything as “family planning.”  3. Washington State Bills Taxpayers for Chemical Abortions A Washington state audit of Planned Parenthood in 2007-2008 found that it had billed taxpayers for a drug used in abortion. Because the audit looked at only a small sample of Planned Parenthood’s billings, this may not have been an isolated event. 4. Billing Taxpayers for Everything But the Actual Baby Cutting Sue Thayer worked for 17 years for Planned Parenthood in Iowa, directing two clinics. After her employment at Planned Parenthood ended in 2009 over its implementation of webcam abortions, she became a whistleblower, alleging over $26 million in fraud against U.S. and Iowa taxpayers by Planned Parenthood of the Heartland. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reinstated Thayer’s case last year, saying, “we conclude that Thayer has pled sufficiently particularized facts to support her allegations that Planned Parenthood violated the FCA by filing claims for … abortion related services.” Hospitals would unwittingly bill Medicaid for services directly related to elective abortions. Thayer had access to computerized billing records for the Planned Parenthood affiliate. Among Thayer’s claims is that Planned Parenthood: “billed taxpayers for services and supplies rendered as part of the provision of abortions, including, without limitation, office visits, ultrasounds, Rh factor tests, lab work, general counseling, and abortion aftercare, all of which were, when provided, integral to and/or related to surgical and medical/Telemed abortion procedures and thus not properly reimbursable pursuant to the Title XIX-Medicaid Program.” While no longer part of the case, Thayer also alleged that Planned Parenthood instructed women completing a chemical abortion at home “to report to the local hospital emergency room in case of hemorrhage or other serious side effect and to advise local hospital emergency room personnel that the client had suffered a ‘miscarriage’ and to seek Title XIX-Medicaid coverage.” The result was that those hospitals would unwittingly bill Medicaid for services directly related to elective abortions, while Planned Parenthood would absolve itself of responsibility for the negative effects of its at-home chemical abortion protocol. Contra the mantra of Planned Parenthood defenders, taxpayers are being required to pay for Planned Parenthood’s abortions. Our money is paying for what we’re seeing on those videos. Planned Parenthood’s abortion business is our business. ","https://thefederalist.com/2015/10/14/4-ways-planned-parenthood-has-billed-taxpayers-for-elective-abortions/",0.592,0.408,"male",2012,2012
"26",26,"What You Need To Know About The Major Abortion Case The Supreme Court Just Took","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-10-07"," On Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal involving a challenge to a Louisiana law that requires abortionists operating in the state to maintain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. As the first abortion case to be considered by the high court since the confirmation of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the significance of this development cannot be overstated. Yet it is not just the new composition of the court making this case consequential, both legally and politically. The case proves of further significance because the details buried in the briefing expose the abortion industry as a self-interested player putting women’s health at risk under the false flag of Roe v. Wade.  Kennedy Affirms Garbage Abortion Precedent When news broke late last week that the Supreme Court’s 2019-2020 term would include the high-profile abortion case of June Medical Serv. v. Gee, Sec., LA Dep’t of Health, the press quickly focused on the change in the make-up of the high court since the Supreme Court struck down a similar Texas law in 2016. The 2016 decision of Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt followed the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The court in a 5-3 decision held that Texas’s requirement that abortionists maintain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their abortion facility was unconstitutional. Since then, the Senate has confirmedGorsuch to replace Scalia, and Justice Kennedy—who sided with the liberal wing of the court in Whole Woman’s Health—has retired and been replaced by Kavanaugh. With two more originalists on the court, abortion apologists fear Whole Woman’s Health risks being overturned. Others, though, speculate that a respect for precedent may push Justice John Roberts to switch his previous vote and instead affirm Whole Woman’s Health. There is yet a third option: The Supreme Court could uphold Whole Woman’s Health yet conclude that the facts in the Louisiana case are distinguishable from those at play Texas. In upholding the Louisiana law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals took that tack, explaining: Careful review of the record reveals stark differences between the record before us and that which the Court considered in [Whole Woman’s Health.] Almost all Texas hospitals required that for a doctor to maintain privileges there, he or she had to admit a minimum number of patients annually. Few Louisiana hospitals make that demand. Because Texas doctors could not gain privileges, all but 8 of 40 clinics closed. Here, only one doctor at one clinic is currently unable to obtain privileges; there is no evidence that any of the clinics will close as a result of the Act. In Texas, the number of women forced to drive over 150 miles increased by 350%. Driving distances will not increase in Louisiana. Unlike the record in Louisiana, the record in Texas reflected no benefits from the legislation. Finally, because of the closures, the remaining Texas clinics would have been overwhelmed, burdening every woman seeking an abortion. In Louisiana, however, the cessation of one doctor’s practice will affect, at most, only 30% of women, and even then not substantially. Yet a Third Possibility There is still another possibility that has yet to garner much media attention: The Supreme Court could hold that the abortion providers lack standing to challenge Louisiana’s admitting-privileges law.  While Louisiana had argued against the Supreme Court taking the June Medical Serv. appeal, alternatively, it contended in a “conditional cross petition” that if the high court intervened, it should further determine whether the abortion providers litigating this matter have standing, or the right to sue, on behalf of women. In agreeing to hear the abortion providers’ appeal, the Supreme Court also granted Louisiana’s cross petition to resolve that issue. Of the two questions before the Supreme Court, this latter question of whether abortion providers have standing to challenge the Louisiana law presents the bigger risk to abortion apologists, both legally and politically. Legally, since a plurality of the Supreme Court in 1976 in Singleton v. Wulff concluded that it would “‘generally [be] appropriate’ for abortion providers to challenge abortion regulations on behalf of their patients,” the Supreme Court and “lower courts have assumed abortion providers have standing to represent their patients’ interests.” However, as Louisiana argued in its brief, that proposition is suspect and given the Supreme Court granted the state’s cross petition, it appears the high court believes that issue deserves further consideration. Should Louisiana convince a majority of the Supreme Court that this assumption cannot stand, the legal ramifications would be huge. No longer could the abortion lobby march from the capital to the courthouse with a parade of horribles in tow. Instead, actual women alleging a real constitutional injury would need to pursue the litigation. And it will be more difficult for individual plaintiffs to hide behind the rhetoric of hardship that abortion providers bandy about.  Abortion Industry’s Terrible Record on Women’s Health The political risk is even greater because Louisiana’s argument exposes the dark underbelly of the abortion industry. Here is the overview of the argument made in its petition to the Supreme Court: Plaintiff abortion providers, nominally proceeding on behalf of their patients, challenge a law intended to provide patients with greater health and safety protections by ensuring abortion doctors are subjected to meaningful, ongoing credentialing review by their peers. Yet there is little evidence that their patients’ interests actually align with Plaintiffs’ position that the burdens of such protections exceed their value. On the contrary, undisputed record evidence (including of Plaintiffs’ poor safety record, inadequate credentialing practices, and questionable efforts to undermine the law at issue) shows Plaintiffs are directly adverse to their patients.’ The details will shock the public and destroy the many abortion apologist talking points. For instance, the “abortion is a matter between a woman and her doctor” soundbite cannot withstand the reality there is not “her doctor” involved. Instead, “the doctors’ interactions with patients are limited” and the “doctors may see as many as thirty patients per day for only a few minutes each.” And “the required pre-abortion counseling is often not provided by the doctor who performs the abortion, but by different doctors hired solely for that separate purpose.” So, “apart from the brief procedure itself, an abortion provider may not interact with a given patient at all.” Then there is the evidence Louisiana highlights to illustrate how the abortion providers’ objections to the admitting privileges mandate directly contradict the interests of the women on whose behalf the doctors claim to be speaking. Plaintiff Doe 1 provides a perfect case in point. He was one of the only abortion providers to make a good-faith attempt to obtain admitting privileges, but was denied that privilege. And no wonder! “Doe 1, a graduate of Saba University medical school in the Dutch Caribbean, is not an obstetrician or gynecologist. Instead he is a specialist in ‘Family Medicine and Addiction Medicine’ — and he has never actually practiced family medicine.” Additionally, “Doe 1 conceded he had no training in abortion practice during his medical school or residency; instead he was principally taught on-the-job by Doe 3.” Doe 1 is not an anomaly. Doe 3, who served as the medical director for the plaintiff abortion facility, “admitted he hired a radiologist and an ophthalmologist to perform abortions there and when hiring doctors he performs no background check and makes no inquiry into their previous training,” and “such poor hiring and credentialing practices are common among other Louisiana abortion clinics, which ‘beyond ensuring that the provider has a current medical license, do not appear to undertake any review of a provider’s competency.” Doe 1, Doe 3, and the abortion clinic may object to the admitting-privileges law because it will keep unqualified doctors from performing abortions and force clinics to expend more resources to retain qualified and competent physicians, or close, but those interests are very different than that of the women whose interests they claim to represent in challenging this law. ‘Horrifying’ Safety Violations The clinics litigating this case likewise have interests far different than the women whose interest they purport to champion. As Louisiana detailed in its petition: The Plaintiff clinic in this case has a history of serious regulatory violations which the panel characterized as ‘horrifying.’ It was undisputed at trial that the Plaintiff clinic has been cited for improper administration of intravenous medications and gas, failure to document patients’ physical examinations, administration of anesthesia by employees who were not qualified, inaccurate reporting of abortion procedures to the State, and miscalculation of medication dosages, among other violations. In 2012, [the Department of Health] revoked the Plaintiff clinic’s license for failure to comply with health and safety regulations. The underlying documents related to the Plaintiff clinic, which were admitted into evidence under seal, contain even more violations. Eerily striking in similarity to these details from Louisiana’s petition are the facts that shuttered now-deceased George Klopfer’s Indiana abortion facilities. Before the nation ever heard his name after more the remains of more than 2,000 unborn babies were discovered stored in his rural Illinois home, Indiana state officials were well familiar with the man known as the most prolific abortionist in the Hoosier state. A law like the Louisiana one led to closing Klopfer’s Fort Wayne facility well before his death. At the time, Klopfer ran a circuit of abortion facilities, driving to different locations to perform abortions. After several of his Fort Wayne patients ended up in the emergency room, the local county passed an ordinance “requiring traveling doctors to have backup physicians that could take their patients in case of complications.” Dr. Geoffrey Cly originally agreed to serve as Klopfer’s backup. But Cly, who had previously testified that Klopfer had injured his patients “being sloppy and leaving pieces of tissue and fetuses inside,” stepped down after learning Klopfer had performed an abortion on a young rape victim and failed to report the abuse to authorities. Unable to find another backup physician, Klopfer’s Fort Wayne clinic was forced to close. To the abortion provider, it is the law that shuttered the clinic and deprived women of access to abortion, when in reality, the law served its purpose of protecting women. Louisiana made a solid argument in its petition that this conflict in interests prevents abortion providers from obtaining third-party standing to assert a woman’s constitutional right under Roe v. Wade, and its progeny. And the Klopfer case just gave them more ammunition to illustrate this point. It is unlikely the latest horror will sway the liberal wing of the court, however, as the Whole Women’s Health case came on the heels of abortionist Kermit Gosnell’s conviction, yet had no impact on the majority’s analysis. But with Kennedy gone, the question is whether it will resonate with the new swing justice Roberts—at least enough to push him to rule abortion providers lack standing absent evidence they can adequately represent their patients’ interests.

— Frank Pavone (@frfrankpavone) September 30, 2019  There are the revelations in recent California court hearings, of sworn testimony from abortion industry employees that they deliver babies live in order to cut out their beating hearts for “scientific research.” And then a dramatic article appeared recently at Vice.com with this actual title: “I Learned How to Do an Abortion on a Papaya.” It poses as a serious essay. Zoey Thill, a New York City abortionist, holds regular classes for anyone who wants to play at sucking a growing child, limb from limb, out of a warm, safe, nurturing womb. She does so with a papaya. It’s presented as a super casual, fun way to spend an evening with like-minded friends. The author of the story learned about it on Facebook. ‘We’re Not Going to Shame Perforators’ Thill explains the papaya is the perfect teaching tool, as it mimics a cervix and uterus because of its shape, and it doesn’t matter if you puncture the wall of a piece of fruit like abortions can do to a uterus. “We’re not going to shame perforators,” she reassures her newbies.  Thill demonstrates to students the abortion technique and excitedly points out the black seeds moving through the suction tube. She exults, apparently in the best clinical language she can muster, “This is a really f-cking good one.” Remember, she’s a professional abortionist. The attendees then get to insert their own plastic tubes into a papaya and attach them to an actual suction machine. They find it all pretty easy. “Next to me,” the author recounts, “others were doing the same, rejoicing with every successful extraction. ‘Yes!’ they exclaimed each time.” Is it common practice to high-five a successful abortion? Apparently. Thill, who was 38 weeks pregnant on this evening, assured the class, “It’s even more satisfying when it’s a real abortion.” Yes, she used the words “more satisfying” in direct reference to a successful abortion. There’s more. Thill hopes “participants might capture some of the buoyant energy they felt while extracting seeds.” Who says such things? Abortionists and their activist defenders, and they do so without an ounce of shame. Do they not appreciate how drastically out of step this puts them with regular folk? That’s a rhetorical question.  We Know It’s Murder, and We Don’t Care The article goes on to speak of a new development among abortion activists. They are growing terribly impatient with their own leaders using any language that appears to soften the reality of what abortion is. One attendee remarked, “[I] believe in an unapologetic abortion rights movement. ” They complain that too many in their movement have actually acquiesced to the pro-life movement in seeing abortion as unfortunate. They cite President Bill Clinton’s “safe, legal, and rare” mantra as the most egregious and damaging example. They want people to know exactly what abortion does and celebrate it. Another equally stunning article laments “the most ardent feminist activists might find themselves inadvertently apologizing for abortion even as they fight for the universal right to access it.” Abortion activists are now opposing the euphemistic term “pro-choice” as an antiquated PR construct to gloss over what abortion really is. Toni Van Pelt, the president of the abortion activist National Organization for Women, explains that the movement is choosing to use the term “pro-abortion” instead, “because there’s nothing wrong with abortion and there’s nothing wrong with using the term ‘abortion.’ It shouldn’t be stigmatized.” In fact, this is exactly why Planned Parenthood recently unceremoniously fired its relatively new president, Leana Wen. She was working to downplay the organization’s standing as the largest single abortion provider. Why accentuate the negative, right? Wen’s cautious approach was the exact opposite of the new and unapologetically celebratory #ShoutYourAbortion and #SayAbortion campaigns. So she’s now looking for work. Putting Babies in the Trash After Harvesting Their Limbs While Planned Parenthood tries to downplay their abortion activity on one hand, falsely claiming it’s a minuscule fraction of what they do, on the other they are also extremely proud of what they do to babies. Millions of tiny humans enter through the front door of a Planned Parenthood clinic warm and secure in their mother’s wombs with a beating heart and a growing body. They leave out the back door as trash, alone and in parts. It’s impossible to make that look virtuous, but these folks try their best. As the abortion industrial complex grows bolder in telling us what it’s actually about, it is time for all decent people of conscience to join them. Stop glossing over what abortion actually is. Cease being reticent about explaining its reality. It’s time for gentle boldness, to call out what these people do (and literally exult in) for the dark atrocity it is. It might seem unsettling, but truth often is. Its tellers should not feel shame for revealing it. That belongs to the perpetrators. It comes down to this: Abortion is pure evil. It has its roots in that which is evil, and its fruit is evil. Celebrating it is evil. (Women who are made to believe it’s their only option are certainly abortion’s second victim.) The evilness of the procedure is obvious to anyone who looks at the actual, physical result of an abortion, even as early as eight weeks of gestation (graphic warning). Abortion speaks for itself. No, that’s not right. It screams, and what it says is vile. This Is Undisputable If You Consider the Facts Let’s just think about the basic aspects and consequences of the thing. Abortion is designed and performed for the sole purpose of ending a human life because at least one person sees that life as problematic. Often, this is not the mother, but others around her, applying emotional pressure for her to destroy her own child. The dead, and clearly human, child is thrown out with today’s trash as if he were so many used coffee grounds. The mother is given the false hope that this will be good for her and that the act itself is righteous. Abortion turns the natural maternal instinct on its head. The most important, complex, and powerful life-giving protector in all of nature, the human mother, is persuaded to become the exact opposite of what she so deeply is. That is anti-woman if anything is. The mother is given the false hope that this will be good for her and that the act itself is righteous. Doctors who are trained to heal, save life, and take a solemn and sacred oath to do no harm become those who intentionally destroy life as a regular part of their practice. They are shamelessly celebrated as brave, moral leaders by our cultural elites. A government, tasked with protecting and enhancing the life of every citizen, instead becomes the defender, funder, and facilitator of those who kill millions upon millions of tomorrow’s educators, caregivers, inventors, business owners, job providers, public servants, military members, philanthropists, and political leaders, not to mention its essential taxpayers. Such a government is killing its own future. Anyone offended by abortion is harshly denounced as the enemy of women and their health. This breaks down quickly because women oppose abortion at about the same rate as men do, if not more. Thus, abortion activists charge that billions of pro-life women are the enemies of women’s health. That’s quite patriarchal. Death Isn’t Something to Celebrate A good and moral society does not celebrate death. A good and moral society does not celebrate those who do. It does not assume a baby is a problem to be destroyed. It does not tell women in crisis that their only solution lies in betraying their own natures and ending the glorious, miraculous life that grows right below her heart. Abortion is unnatural, dramatically so. It is anti-human. It does not enhance or enrich our collective humanity. It comes to her aid, giving her hope and everyday, practical help, before, at, and after the birth of her child. That’s what the pro-life movement does. It doesn’t give her a cold, sterile procedure for a fee and wish her well. That’s what abortionists do. Which is truly more pro-woman? Abortion is unnatural, dramatically so. It is anti-human. It does not enhance or enrich our collective humanity. It is vile and it is evil. It springs from and reveals our worst natures. No amount of anger, violence, name-calling, knitted “genitalia” caps and profanity screamed from bullhorns during so-called women’s marches can justify it. It’s a fool’s errand to make what is inherently wicked seem moral. It’s a soulless people who try. At this moment of anxious freak-out from the pro-abortion ranks, it’s time a good and moral people call abortion precisely what it is and do so without shyness or apology. There is no need to be dramatic. There is no need to crank up the volume. There is no need for theatrics. There is only the need to speak truthfully about what abortion does to the child, the woman, her family, and the nation. Abortion condemns itself. Its advocates, in their frantic madness, seem set on helping it do so. We should certainly join them. It’s the right thing to do.

"28",28,"No Fact-Checkers Can Cover For Hillary Clinton’s Ghastly Abortion Views","Payne","Daniel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-21"," How do you “beat” abortion—how do you ultimately convince enough people it is an indefensible practice that should not, in any civilized society, be legal? You do so by exposing it to the light of day, in the same way that was done with, say, slavery, or civil rights abuses. The great liberation movements of the past knew how to use effective exposure to get their messages across. The pro-life movement need not necessarily use photographs to transmit its worldview (although I think there are times when it’s appropriate). Rather, the most salient and effective tools in the pro-life arsenal are the cold, hard facts about abortion: it is a medical procedure that kills innocent human beings.  No serious person can deny this in any meaningful way. The only response that the pro-abortion movement can muster is to lapse into confused quack philosophy regarding the matter of “personhood.” For all practical legal purposes, pro-choicers generally put forth the same legal argument as did the majority in Dred Scott v. Sandford. Quite a legacy. Donald Trump Gave Us a Good Example Then there is the good rhetorical tool of simple, forceful language. Proving that even he can get something right every now and then, Donald Trump gave a great example of this at the final presidential debate this week, criticizing Hillary Clinton’s position on infanticide: “Well, I think it’s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.” This is indeed the case: under Clinton’s proposed abortion regime, it would be entirely legal to “rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.” She has personally defended partial-birth abortion in the past. As Hillary put it when pressed on late-term abortions, “there can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester,” but this is clearly a cowardly and meaningless evasion: Clinton carefully avoiding saying there should be restrictions at the very end of the third trimester. She also asserted the restrictions have to take into account “the life and health of the mother,” but as abortion activist Ron Fitzsimmons demonstrated years ago, late-term abortions were performed with great frequency on “healthy women bearing healthy fetuses.”  This is how abortion “exceptions” generally work. The “health of the mother” is broadened to cover just about every possible consideration, and it becomes an effectively toothless qualifier. Hillary knows this. Panicked and blindsided by Trump’s accurate description of the brutal procedure that she fully supports, Hillary countered: “Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.” It’s not scare rhetoric, though—it’s true. But pro-abortionists hate the truth. They despise it, they cannot tolerate the thought of it, and they attempt to bury it at every possible opportunity. Wouldn’t you? Who would want to be caught defending such barbarity? Let’s Avoid the Truth Because We Hate It Fascinating to watch in the wake of this debate has been the reaction from “fact-checkers,” the class of pundits and journalists who, in spite of their titles, are not actually all that interested in “facts” and are generally committed to “checking” things only insofar as the facts can be obscured. Take, for instance, Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post: THE FACT CHECKER | Trump suggested that abortions can take place just two or three days before birth. That doesn’t really happen.
Most abortions take place early in the pregnancy. One-third take place at six weeks or pregnancy or earlier; 89 percent occur in the first 12 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Only 1.2 percent of abortions—about 12,000 a year– take place after 21 weeks. (The Supreme Court has held that states may not prohibit abortions ‘necessary to preserve the life or health’ of the mother.)
On top of that, Guttmacher says that 43 states already prohibit some abortions after a certain point in pregnancy, such as fetal viability, in the third trimester or after a certain number of weeks. So this is already a rare procedure that is prohibited in much of the country. What kind of a “fact check” is this? It is pure, unadulterated drivel. Trump made a statement about Hillary’s position on late-term abortions. Kessler “fact-checked” it, and this is what he came up with: “This is already a rare procedure.”  That doesn’t address the substance of Trump’s assertion, or anything even approaching the substance of it. Was what Trump said true, or not? Since it was true—and since truth is inconvenient for the pro-abortion movement—we are left with senseless, incoherent babble from the people who purport to “check” “facts.” What about the Los Angeles Times? Did they “fact-check” Trump’s accurate claim with any grace? “Donald Trump offers graphic description of later-term abortion, but such procedures are extremely rare.” Gee, thanks. Notice that the papers can’t dispute Trump’s “graphic description,” nor can they really mount an effective defense of Clinton. So they are reduced to this petty and genuinely irrelevant distinction: “Such procedures are extremely rare.” Good to know! Politico, too, claimed that Trump “miss[ed] the mark” on abortion. But it is Politico that missed the mark. Indeed, it is not at all clear that Politico knew there was a mark to hit: Trump’s graphic description doesn’t provide a fair characterization of how abortion procedures take place. The Supreme Court has held that so-called ‘partial-birth’ abortions are banned nationally, except for when the woman’s life is in danger.
Additionally, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, only 1.2 percent of all abortions in the U.S. take place after 20 weeks of gestation. Many states also impose restrictions on later term abortions. Under the Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision, states may restrict or ban abortions after fetal viability, although they may not prohibit abortions that are needed to protect the life or health of the woman.
Abortion restrictions vary by state but many ban the procedure after viability or at a particular point in pregnancy, such as 20 weeks or 24 weeks. Technically Trump is right that in a handful of states, abortions may be performed late in pregnancy. But late-term abortions are exceedingly rare. But Trump wasn’t commenting on what the Supreme Court has held; nor was he remarking on the frequency of late-term abortions, or the scope of abortion restrictions across the United States. He was commenting solely on Hillary Clinton’s position on abortion. The fact-checkers are checking “facts” that were never even addressed at the debate. Now We Get to the Truth Perhaps the most viciously mendacious quibble came from Dr. Jennifer Gunter, an OB/GYN who, writing at the Huffington Post, claimed late-term abortions are generally undertaken to kill a baby who has birth defects. As she put it, “There are no ninth month abortions. Really. A ninth month abortion is a unicorn and so it’s ridiculous to even discuss it.” How does Gunter characterize this “unicorn?” Simply put: “[T]erminations for birth defects isn’t ripping ‘the baby out of the womb in the ninth month.’ At 38 or 39 weeks, it’s always an induction and is simply called a delivery.” Got that? Killing an unborn human isn’t an “abortion” if you don’t call it an abortion. Rather, it’s a “delivery.” That makes it better. I have very little faith that Trump, if elected, would do much of anything about abortion. His own ostensible conversion to the pro-life movement feels insincere and opportunistic, like most of the rest of his campaign. But at the very least he spoke accurately about Hillary Clinton’s position on abortion. The least the fact-checkers and the journalist class could do is assess his claim honestly. But why would they start now? ","https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/21/no-fact-checkers-can-cover-hillary-clintons-ghastly-abortion-views/",0.9986,0.0014,"male",2012,2012
"29",29,"Supreme Court Review Puts Abortion At A Crossroads","Burke","Denise",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-11-16"," The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear its first abortion case since 2007, when it upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortion. Regardless of how the court ultimately rules, abortion is at a crossroads in America. At issue is whether what happens to a woman once she goes behind the closed doors of an abortion clinic matters, whether the veneer of the Constitution will protect medically substandard abortion facilities, and whether the abortion industry will be permitted to keep profits high by keeping standards low. Women will be front and center in the case. As a result of the Supreme Court’s commandeering of the abortion issue in Roe v. Wade, it alone defines states’ ability to protect maternal health. In Whole Woman’s Health v. Cole, the abortion industry is challenging a Texas requirement that abortion clinics comply with medically appropriate health and safety standards.  Importantly, states set medical standards for surgical facilities in consultation with medical authorities so that, in the event of an emergency, precious time won’t be lost. A plan will be in place for emergency medical care and to avoid disasters. What is shocking about the current status of the under-regulated Wild West of the American abortion industry is that abortion facilities, where anesthesia is administered and invasive surgeries are performed, have largely avoided the comprehensive health and safety standards that professional medical facilities comply with every day. Abortion: The Medical Red-Light District While “historic” is a word that can be overused, it certainly applies here. The impact of the court’s ruling will sweep more broadly than Texas. Currently, 29 states prescribe health and safety standards for abortion facilities, and 15 states require abortionists to maintain hospital admitting privileges or a written patient transfer agreement with a physician who maintains such privileges. Importantly, these protective, women-centered laws have been enacted over the last two decades in direct response to the abortion industry’s increasingly deplorable safety record. Legal abortion clinics across the country continue to offer dangerous ‘back alley abortions.’ The reality of abortion in America is truly disturbing. A far cry from what was promised by the activist Supreme Court in Roe, legal abortion clinics across the country continue to offer dangerous “back alley abortions.” Over just the last six years, more than 170 abortion providers in 30 states have faced investigations, criminal charges, administrative complaints, and civil lawsuits or have been cited for violating state laws governing the provision of abortion. Abortion industry profits continue to trump both maternal health and compliance with the law, as demonstrated by Planned Parenthood’s trafficking of the broken bodies of aborted infants and the abortion industry’s ongoing and desperate efforts to avoid both accountability and meaningful oversight.  The sobering reality that abortion operates in the “red light district” of medicine must guide the court’s ultimate decision in the case. If the court instead adopts the abortion industry’s argument that easy access to an abortion clinic trumps all concerns about health and safety, there will be far-reaching and catastrophic consequences for American women who are routinely victimized by an abortion industry that cannot be counted on to police itself. If an organized, profit-centered, politically well-connected abortion industry triumphs by convincing the court that it should not be required to comply with the same patient-centered standards that are commonly applied to other outpatient surgical facilities, dangerous, substandard abortion clinics will proliferate. “Circuit rider” abortionists who travel into town for the day perform abortions on women they have not previously met or counselled, and leave others to deal with the inevitable post-abortive complications will continue to be the norm in an industry that prioritizes mere access to abortion over women’s health and safety. To Protect Women, Abortion Needs Oversight State legislators seeking to protect women from an increasingly predatory abortion industry will be effectively thwarted. Instead, renegade abortion clinics will have been given a preemptive “veto” over commonsense regulations that they decide to ignore. Abortion clinics will have been given carte blanche to operate outside medical norms and immune from following the best medical practices. Unlike legitimate medical practices operating under appropriate regulatory oversight, abortion clinics will have been given carte blanche to operate outside medical norms and immune from following the best medical practices, such as high standards of cleanliness and sanitation, comprehensive pre-procedure medical evaluations, advance preparation for medical emergencies, and adequate credentialing of providers.  Alternatively, if the court gives appropriate deference to a state legislature’s determination that abortion providers must be held to medically appropriate health and safety standards and upholds the Texas law, women would receive better and more competent care. There would also be a significant reduction in the more than 26,000 women that the abortion industry conservatively estimates suffer abortion-related complications each year. The high-quality, women-centered standards at the heart of the Texas law will result in fewer complications, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer women’s deaths from abortion. To rule in favor of the abortion industry, the court will have to ignore an increasingly dismal health and safety record and the dangers faced by every woman who walks through the doors of an abortion clinic. To rule in favor of women’s health and safety, however, the justices will simply have to remember what was decided more than 40 years ago in Roe: a state’s legitimate interest in regulating abortion “obviously extends at least to [regulating] the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that may arise.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/16/supreme-court-review-puts-abortion-at-a-crossroads/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"31",31,"Finally! Rand Paul Exposes Media’s Serious Abortion Double Standards","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-04-09"," The other day I was on KCRW’s “To The Point,” hosted by Warren Olney. One of my fellow guests was Alex Roarty, who is Hotline’s chief political correspondent. Toward the end of the show, Olney asked him a question: OLNEY: Is the issue of cultural insensitivity, which is sort of behind all of this–broader than the argument over gay rights or same-sex marriage–is that going to be a major issue for the Republicans? Are they going to have to seem to be culturally sensitive in order to win the presidency?ROARTY: Yes. And some people would say that it’s actually their biggest hurdle to winning the White House. It’s not just gay marriage. You can include gun rights, you can include abortion rights, there is this sense that Republicans are out of the step with the mainstream of America when it comes to a lot of social and cultural issues. And that’s the Democrats’ biggest advantage at this point. I will point out Democrats tried to use that to their advantage in 2014 midterms and it didn’t work out so well for them then, so it’s unclear if those kind of issues, as important as they might be to some people, are still more important than things like foreign policy or the economy. I don’t mean to pick on Roarty. Indeed, his claim is identical to those I’ve seen and heard reporters make for years. It’s just that his is the most recent example.  It’s an absolutely stunning claim. Stunning. Let’s set aside same-sex marriage, which the media are just completely incapable of covering with even a semblance of fairness or awareness of how people outside their newsrooms think about it. And let’s set aside the curious assumption that if these issues hurt Democrats in 2014, it’s not because of voters’ response to those issues but something about “foreign policy or the economy.” Wait, guns? Can we think of a single instance where Republican defense of 2nd Amendment rights did anything other than help them win elections? I mean, I know a few people in Colorado, including the president of the state senate, who were recalled for passing restrictions on gun rights in 2013. Recalled. In Colorado. I’m from Colorado. We’re not a recalling people. It was the first time in our state history any of our legislators had done anything to anger us sufficiently. There was President Obama’s attempt, with much assistance from the media, to pass restrictions on gun rights in 2013 in the aftermath of the horrific Sandy Hook slaughter. That attempt “suffered a resounding defeat Wednesday, when every major proposal he championed fell apart on the Senate floor.” And as for public opinion? Well, beyond elections we have a recent Gallup poll showing 38 percent of Americans supporting gun laws as they are and 14 percent wanting them liberalized. I know math is hard, but I think that when a majority of Americans say they don’t support any more restrictions on gun rights, the mainstream might not be where the media think it is. Pew also reports that more Americans support gun rights than restrictions on same.  Abortion? Likewise, let’s look at how actual Americans outside of newsrooms report their views on abortion. Given the media coverage I’ve closely looked at for decades, I have no doubt whatsoever that the “mainstream” in newsrooms on abortion is somewhere far to the left of Planned Parenthood chair Cecile Richards. But actual Americans turn out not to be quite where the most strident supporters of abortion are. Did you know that 71 percent of Americans support at least some protections for unborn children? That 71 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, support at least some restrictions on abortion? Huge majorities support protections on children who have made it through the first three months of pregnancy, with other polls showing as many as three out of four supporting bans on late-term abortion. It’s not that the country is full of consistent pro-lifers, but the idea that the country is as radical on abortion as its most strident supporters are has no relationship to reality. Rand Paul mentions the donkey in the room Many in the media have been more or less unable to hide their general disdain for Sen. Rand Paul, who announced his bid for the presidency earlier this week. Many in the media have also been more or less unable to hide the fact that they take their marching orders from Planned Parenthood, the country’s largest seller of abortion services.  Since his announcement, the $1 billion abortion provider Planned Parenthood and their friends in the Democratic Party pushed the idea that Rand Paul’s views on abortion were disconcerting. Allies in the media stepped right up and began peppering him with questions about his pro-life stance. The Associated Press’ Philip Elliott, whose struggles covering abortion are legendary (seriously, check out the correction he had to run for somehow turning pro-choice Satanists into a pro-life problem), did what he does and, well, ran a story with the headline “Paul won’t spell out abortion ban exceptions.” By the time all the other Planned Parenthood-directed reporters spent the day asking him about abortion, Paul pointed out the rather obvious problem with media coverage of political views on abortion: Only pro-life candidates are asked tough questions about it. You can watch Paul’s answer to a reporter’s request that he respond to the Democratic National Committee’s take on his abortion views here, as uploaded by one Dave Weigel. (Go to 8:00 minutes into the video):  The reporter said the Democratic National Committee, chaired by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, didn’t like his views on abortion and asked for a response on what exceptions he’s willing to grant for when unborn lives can be ended. He responded: We always seen to have the debate wayyyyyy over here on what are the exact details of exceptions, or when it starts. Why don’t we ask the DNC: Is it okay to kill a seven-pound baby in the uterus? You go back and you ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she’s OK with killing a seven-pound baby that is just not yet born yet. Ask her when life begins, and you ask Debbie when she’s willing to protect life. When you get an answer from Debbie, come back to me. I’m not sure if any reporter did ask Wasserman Schultz about her views but she volunteered Dave Weigel at Bloomberg News asked Wasserman Schultz for comment and she said she favors zero restrictions on abortion. Reporters should follow-up with her to make sure she meant what she said. She probably did, since it’s also the Democratic Party’s platform. But just to be sure, does that mean she thinks it should be legal to kill a child as she’s exiting the birth canal? Just for the crime of being female? Does that sound as inhumane to her as it does to her critics? What about aborting a baby because she has a cleft palate? Could Wasserman Schultz tell us when human life begins — not when she feels it begins or believes it begins but when we know from scientific discovery that it begins? And after she answers those questions, maybe she can tell us when human life should be protected? And why? Maybe she could tell us the difference between what murderer Kermit Gosnell did and the late-term abortions she supports? And maybe when she’s asked, New York Times political reporter Jeremy W. Peters could avoid laughing. Certainly if political reporters have spent the last 40 years nailing down pro-lifers’ thoughts on rape and incest, we can spare a few questions for pro-choice politicians. If, contra many reporters’ beliefs about the mainstream nature of their abortion views, as much as 75 percent of the population outside the DNC and America’s newsrooms supports restrictions on abortion in the third trimester, maybe we could interrogate that a bit. If every single GOP candidate from president to neighborhood dogcatcher had to answer questions about a certain Missouri candidate’s unorthodox thoughts on rape in 2012, maybe we can just get the same media to ask some mild questions of a few national Democrats who all have the same radical position on what can be done with seven-pound babies. It’s far, far, far too late to even hope the media might do their job with regard to President Obama, but the failure to accurately describe his radicalism on abortion is scandalous. Think I’m exaggerating about disparate coverage? I’m not. As I wrote when the media had a wee bit of trouble — for years — coming up with any story ideas whatsoever for coverage of the murder trial of serial murderer-cum-abortionist Kermit Gosnell: When Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin made a comment about women being raped last year, the New York Times responded with, according to a search engine count, about 250 stories in under three months. A sample of the 19 (!) headlines from just the first two days*: “Republicans Press Todd Akin to Quit Race,” “Romney Condemns Akin Remarks on Rape,” “Romney and Ryan Team Up on Trail Amid Criticism on Abortion,” “Akin’s No-Show on ‘Piers Morgan’ Is Boon for Program,” “Romney Statement on Abortion Contradicts Ryan’s Earlier Stance,” etc., etc., etc.
It didn’t slow down. That search engine shows 22 stories about Akin on August 21 alone. An August 22 story was headlined “Ryan Pressed to Explain Position on Rape and Abortion.” I’m not sure if the New York Times will make it to 19 stories in two days. They have one, thus far. It’s a piece that reads like it could have been written by a Democratic communications shop, that probably should have been headlined “we have to run a brief mention of Paul’s epic takedown of our biased coverage of abortion, but we really wish we didn’t have to” and is instead headlined “Rand Paul Tangles With Democrats Over Abortion Rights.” I mean, technically he was also tangling with the media’s coverage of abortion politics. Either way, perhaps it’s a fitting and economical slip to say he’s tangling with Democrats. Someone should remind the media that Hillary Clinton is running for president with the aforementioned Democratic Party. Given her position and all, we should ask her whether or not she thinks it barbaric to kill a full-term child at 39 weeks. What about at five months? She has had quite a bit of time to distance herself from Wasserman Schultz’s claims on abortion and yet hasn’t. Should there be 22 stories about this by Friday in the New York Times? I mean, for fairness’ sake? And if that’s how many stories we get for candidates such as Romney and Ryan who disagreed with someone else’s radical abortion views, how many stories should there be for those who seem to agree with it? To not press this issue with pro-choice Democrats confirms the impression that the media keep Democrats out of fights where Democrats might get hurt. As Ace of Spades put it, “Democrats are always allowed No Answer.” ‘Pro-choice views aren’t news’ The problems with abortion coverage are all around us. Again, the Associated Press is one of the absolute worst at this. Recently Kansas passed legislation that bans abortions that dismember unborn children. It may not be pleasant to think about the ways in which we end the lives of unborn children but just as we want our media to tell us the details about police killings, an honest media tells us details about other important stories. But here’s how the AP put it: TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas became the first state Tuesday to ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure that critics describe as dismembering a fetus. I mean, it either does or doesn’t dismember a fetus (NB: ‘fetus’ is the dehumanizing euphemism and obfuscatory term preferred by abortion advocates and the media for babies who have not yet been born and who we have authorized violence against). The procedure calls for the use of a suctioning device and forceps to remove the unborn child from the uterus. Why does the AP think such devices are used? The Associated Press doesn’t think it necessary to describe how the abortion works, only to say that the bill says “Doctors cannot use forceps, clamps, scissors or similar instruments on a fetus to remove it from the womb in pieces.” So, in other words, dismemberment? A reporter I know was sent to Missouri to cover the Senate race there late in the 2012 campaign season. Really that meant covering Akin. Knowing I have family from there, he asked if I had any thoughts. I told him, “You should ask [Claire] McCaskill how long during a pregnancy she thinks abortion should be legal, whether Down syndrome is a good reason to kill an unborn baby and whether aborting for reasons of sex selection should be legal. I don’t understand why we only ask the tough questions of one side.” His response fascinated me. He said he would ask no such questions. The difference between McCaskill and Akin, he pre-ordained, was that she would answer well, that her support for killing children with Down syndrome “falls within the accepted spectrum of abortion views,” and that the issue is not that only one side gets tough questions but that one side is outside the mainstream. He flat out told me that McCaskill’s abortion views weren’t news. I told him, “One of the most radical positions you can take on abortion, and one that is not supported by public opinion at all, is no limits of any kind on abortion. And yet a sizable number of Democrats take that position and are never — never — called on it.” That was true in 2012, which was peak “War on Women” hysteria. It was true in 2013. It was true in 2014. It’s true in 2015. The half of the country that is pro-life, despite the lack of daylight between the media and abortion activists, is a bit sick of the double standards. (Seriously, if you can tell the difference between the Associated Press’ twitter account and Planned Parenthood’s, you’re amazing.) Yet comments from the reporters mentioned above make me worried that our media are not even capable of understanding the problem with their views, much less correcting the horrifically imbalanced way they cover this topic. The media have a long way to go to make up for the disparity in how they brutally interrogate pro-life views and put the worst construction on them while avoiding any tough coverage of pro-choice views. But there’s no time like the present for the media to stop carrying the abortion lobby’s water. Let’s get to it.

"32",32,"Why Pro-Abortion Men Are Anti-Woman","Morabito","Stella",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-08-25"," “Abortion really makes you hate men.” I’ve never forgotten that statement. An acquaintance in college who had just had an abortion confided it to me with great anguish. It makes sense that experiencing the indignity and violence of abortion would cause any sensitive woman to feel a very distinct kind of loathing towards men. After all, it was her body that was vulnerable, not his. In the vast majority of such cases the man has zero interest in a child, and – by sudden epiphany with news of the pregnancy – little interest in his pregnant sex partner as well. At that point she knows she was sold a bill of goods: it’s totally a man’s world with no room for her, and no room at all for her baby. Yet feminists prop up that scenario.  I recall my classmate explaining how hard she tried to find a way to make things work out – to keep the baby and still be able to study and travel with the fellowship she had just been awarded. But there’s no room for choices like that in our abortion culture. The Folly Of Enlisting Men To Promote Abortion Pro-abortion women cannot and will not help out women who hope for such a happy outcome. Yet they have no problem telling men that they need to support abortion if they want to keep having sex. This was the essence of Elizabeth Plank’s article in mic.com urging men to support Planned Parenthood because: “In a word, sex.” In the end, the only “choice” pro-aborts offer an unintentionally pregnant woman is this one: have an abortion or give up any dreams of career fulfillment. Likewise, Katha Pollitt recently argued in the New York Times that more men need to speak up for abortion out of their own self-interest: “Where are the men grateful not to be forced into fatherhood?” she asks. I can’t think of a more anti-woman stance.  It basically tells men to support abortion on demand because otherwise women would be less likely to have recreational sex with them. Worse, the man could end up in a (gasp!) relationship. It also clarifies that unrestricted abortion is largely about putting men in a better position to pressure their pregnant sex partners to “get rid of it.” Meanwhile, we’re all supposed to look at it as entirely the woman’s choice. This is manipulative garbage, and at some level, women know this and resent it. Feminists have put men into the role of becoming “champions” of women if they support abortion, a procedure that can’t help but cause a lot of women to develop a visceral loathing towards men. Go figure. To paraphrase Planned Parenthood’s slogan, this brand of feminism sounds like “Abuse. No matter what.” In the end, the only “choice” pro-aborts offer an unintentionally pregnant woman is this one: have an abortion or give up any dreams of career fulfillment. There is no other choice. That’s been their message loud and clear since Roe. President Obama even confirmed this message in his “punished with a baby” comment on the 2008 campaign trail. Pro-Abort “Feminists” Serve As Cheerleaders For Self-Absorbed F-ckboys My classmate’s lament also came to mind when reading Amanda Marcotte’s recent Salon article with its unequivocal defense of Planned Parenthood’s organ-harvesting scheme. What struck me most was not Marcotte’s talking points, but her convoluted bottom line. Of those who point out the barbarity of picking through the limbs and organs of young human beings, she said this:  “The real goal is to make it harder for women—especially low-income women — to have happy, healthy sex lives.” Marcotte’s words – like Plank’s and Pollitt’s — are actually running interference for just the sort of jerk they presume to be confronting. Wouldn’t it be interesting if the defenders of abortion…would direct a teensy bit of their wrath towards the men who use abortion to exploit women? Consider this recent Vanity Fair piece on today’s hard driven hook up culture in which “f-ckboys,” as the male participants are called, swipe at their Tinder apps and compete with one another for a higher number of scores. Meanwhile, the females comply even though they generally find the whole thing unsatisfying. In this context, abortion doesn’t “liberate” women. It only exists to maximize a woman’s f-ckability. So that she can serve the f-ckboys. Abortion also works out particularly well as protection for pedophiles who can and do bring minors into places like Planned Parenthood for abortions, compliments of feminist-supported laws against parental notification. The reality behind Marcotte’s choice of words is to make it harder for women – especially low-income women – to have happy, healthy love lives. This is obviously what women like my college friend really hope for when they have sex. It’s what most thoughtful people hope for. In a word, intimacy. And this is precisely what they don’t get when abortion is used as a battering ram to promote female participation in a hyper-driven hook-up culture. If you have followed the March for Life in Washington, you may have noticed that the ranks of post-abortive women supporting the March has been getting larger with each passing year. And they are getting louder and louder too in exposing the lies they were fed. Wouldn’t it be interesting if the defenders of abortion, particularly elitist women like Hillary Clinton, would direct a teensy bit of their wrath towards the men who use abortion to exploit women rather than towards men who actually take responsibility for the children they sire? Male Power Elites Use Feminist Enablers To Conduct A Real War On Women A male activist advocating for universal abortion on demand at a UN conference some 20 years ago best summed up the purpose behind abortion when he said: “Let’s stop fooling around here. What we’re talking about is our right to f-ck whoever we want, however we want, whenever we want.” Sexually “progressive” men have always been the main players dictating the sexual revolution. It’s really appalling how their feminist counterparts prop them up and protect them in the name of equality. “Let’s stop fooling around here. What we’re talking about is our right to f-ck whoever we want, however we want, whenever we want.” Examine some history on this and you’ll see the pattern. Nearly 100 years ago, a pioneer sexologist named Havelock Ellis had a huge influence on Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger. He swayed her to promote his philosophy of unlimited sexual liberation, as well as eugenics. Sanger’s writings follow Ellis’ lead. A few decades later, Hugh Hefner was happy to ally himself with feminists like Gloria Steinem whose promotion of abortion did more to support the Playboy mentality of exploiting women than it ever did to promote self-determination for women. People like Steinem can continue to spin it however they like. But the fact is that the abortion mindset has spawned more abuse of women by men, not less. Just look around: pornography is epidemic; sex trafficking is rampant; female college students can’t even figure out anymore what constitutes a rape. But most telling of all is the conclusion of demographer Judith Blake in her study, “Abortion and Public Opinion: The 1960-1970 Decade” in Science magazine in 1971. The results of the polling convinced her that success for a pro-abortion agenda would not come from the grassroots, but from privileged, male elites who were the greatest source of support for unrestricted abortion. She wrote: “Legalized abortion is supported most strongly by the non-Catholic, male, well-educated ‘establishment.'” Blake added: “Upper-class men have much to gain and very little to lose by an easing of legal restrictions against abortion.” She urged abortion proponents to look to them for legalization “in spite of conservative opinions among important subgroups such as the lower classes and women.” (No doubt women intuited even at the time that abortion was a bill of goods.) Nothing has changed here. Just as Plank suggested, men should get on board because “in a word, sex.” Such women sound more like brothel madams than serious feminists. The real war on women is being conducted by elitist establishment men who have pushed these agendas in legislatures and in the courts. The real war on women is being conducted by elitist establishment men who have pushed these agendas in legislatures and in the courts, and now hide behind the apron strings of their feminist enablers. One key to the success of this pact between men who want to exploit women and pro-abortion feminists who gladly accommodate them is their public degradation of women who resist this game, and their protection of women who abet and comply with it. In fact, their “war on women” meme is looking more and more like a specious little scheme to cover up for repulsive behavior towards women by men like Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton. Examples abound, but consider also how elite feminists were basically okay with Keith Olberman referring to Michelle Malkin as a “mashed up bag of meat with lipstick on it.” Despite Planned Parenthood’s elitist female shills who run cover for jerks, most ordinary women viscerally know that unrestrained sexual activity is an alienating trap. They know deep down that “abortion really makes you hate men.” What About Happy, Healthy Love Lives? It’s so sad that feminist elites cannot seem to conceive of the idea of being happy without a non-stop and non-committal sex life that basically equates men’s physical urges with women’s so that the default position is the model of the sexually incontinent male. Worse, this expectation is being imposed on everyone as some kind of social norm – from school age children to the geriatric set. The problem is that this model absolutely requires that women accept abortion as a stopgap for themselves if they are going to have the supposedly “happy healthy sex lives” envisioned by Marcotte and enjoyed primarily by f-ckboys. Where is the justice – social or otherwise – in that shabby bargain? Hooking up is an emotional trap. Women agree to having sex because they want intimacy or some sense of being wanted. But the abortion mentality can’t help but interfere with intimacy. Because any way you spin it, abortion is still an act of death. There’s no freedom there. Just a big fat effing lie. “An Ever Increasing Craving For An Ever Decreasing Pleasure” So what does a woman end up doing in the midst of using abortion to prop up a “happy healthy sex life?” She generally harden her heart — to her potential or unborn child in particular, and to men in general. Again, this is bound to make true intimacy — a love life — less attainable. Many post-abortive women report depression and a sense of being haunted by the ghost of their child. In the meantime, pop culture keeps churning out the message that all must comply with the default model of the sexually incontinent male. People keep buying into it and end up living the Rolling Stones’ song: “I Can’t Get No Satisfaction.” Of course, the “everyone-is-doing-it” meme creates the false illusion that her yearning for intimacy will be met if only she opens her legs as instructed by the media machine. She ends up paying an exorbitant and total rip-off price emotionally, mentally, spiritually and physically for the interaction that got her pregnant. Many post-abortive women report depression and a sense of being haunted by the ghost of their child. Those who insist “no regrets” have simply found a way to anesthetize themselves emotionally, which in the end is no gain. The hook-up routine is bound to get tiresome, even with a string of different partners since the abortion/hook-up culture requires those who live within it to all be of the same mind when it comes to sex. When there is no commitment, it’s bound to degenerate into a power game, as exhibited in this one line from that Vanity Fair piece: “It’s a contest to see who cares less, and guys win a lot at caring less.” At the same time the article reports an epidemic of erectile dysfunction among these young men. The proliferation of transgenderism no doubt also has something to do with an ever increasing craving for an ever decreasing pleasure. So for the thoughtful woman and the thoughtful man this regime adds up to what C.S. Lewis described in The Screwtape Letters as “an ever increasing craving for an ever decreasing pleasure.” We can apply this rule of Screwtape to just about any other of the sexual paraphilias and distortions du jour. We see the addiction pattern in the mainstreaming of BDSM practices as in the Fifty Shades of Grey hype. Last year in the Daily Beast, same-sex marriage was proclaimed a sexual liberation gateway drug leading to all manner of new sexual possibilities. The proliferation of transgenderism no doubt also has something to do with an ever increasing craving for an ever decreasing pleasure. The idea, according to Lewis, is to “get a man’s soul and give him nothing in return.” Which is exactly what the abortion culture does to those who drink from it.

"35",35,"Planned Parenthood’s CEO Is Right: We Need To Talk About Abortion","Bryan","Kate",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-05-28"," For the first time in my life, I agree with Cecile Richards. As a longtime, dedicated pro-life activist, I never thought I would be able to say I agree with one of the most prominent abortion advocates, but I guess we were bound to agree on something at some stage.
The headline of a recent Time article by Richards, CEO of the Planned Parenthood, reads: “We need to talk – really talk – about abortion. America has an urgent need for authentic public dialogue on abortion.” Richards went on to discuss various women’s abortion stories and used it as an opportunity to challenge the American people “to talk about abortion.”
I completely agree, but it needs to be an “authentic public dialogue” and all points of view need to be represented, especially the various perspectives of women. For years, “feminists” like Richards, Gloria Steinam, Hillary Clinton, and others completely avoided the word “abortion” and instead focused on euphemisms like “choice,” “women’s rights,” and “reproductive justice.” Richards’ piece mentions abortion a total of 18 times, which is a dramatic change from the usual rhetoric from Richards and her feminist cohorts.
It’s the Left’s avoidance of the “authentic” abortion dialogue that has brought us to where we are today and not the other way around. And even when the Left does talk about abortion, it’s always completely one-sided and always in favor.
There’s Not Just One View about Abortion
In Richards’ article, she points to examples in popular culture that she feels are honest representations of women’s abortion stories. But her examples are completely one-sided.
The only film and television portrayals of abortion Richards mentions are the ones that favor abortion and promote her billion-dollar abortion business, Planned Parenthood.
Jemima Kirke, best known for her role in the HBO series “Girls,” discussed the trials and tribulations of her abortion, and how she hoped her children wouldn’t know “the luggage of being a woman.” Richards also pointed to the few films and television shows that have portrayed women’s abortion stories: “For years there have been few honest portrayals about abortion in film and television.” It’s interesting that the only film and television portrayals of abortion that she mentions are the ones that favor abortion and those that promote Richards’ billion-dollar abortion business, Planned Parenthood.
Richards fails to mention films like “Knocked Up,” “Juno,” “Bella,” “Away We Go,” and most recently, “Gimme Shelter.” Each of these movies show real-life situations where women were pregnant in less-than-ideal circumstances, but rose above the challenges they faced and chose life for their children. In these films, abortion is not seen as empowering to women, but rather, the fullness of empowerment arrives when women give life to another.
Women are so powerful that they are able to actually bring life into existence. Talk about women’s empowerment.
Nobody Really Wants to Have an Abortion
Abortion advocates and organizations like Planned Parenthood try to normalize abortion. “Everybody’s doing it” and “it’s not a big deal.” “Safe, legal, and rare” are no longer in their vocabulary.
No matter what side of the political aisle you are on, we can all agree that abortion is a difficult decision that few actually want to go through.
They love movies like “Obvious Child,” the first-ever “abortion romantic comedy”, because it tries to turn abortion into something normal and funny, and just a part of life. But there’s nothing funny about abortion. This is disingenuous to women everywhere who have suffered lifelong consequences from their abortion decision.
No matter what side of the political aisle you are on, we can all agree that abortion is a difficult decision that few actually want to go through. “16 and Pregnant” stars Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra gave their daughter up for adoption and are now strong pro-life advocates, who promote life in all circumstances. Another “16 and pregnant” star, Jamie McKay, speaks openly about the abortion she chose “out of fear” and regrets.
Richards wrote in her article about singer Nicki Minaj’s abortion, but failed to mention that Minaj has been quoted as saying that the abortion “has haunted me all my life.” Then there’s singer Toni Braxton, who recently revealed in her memoir “Unbreak My Heart” that her abortion filled her with guilt and remorse. Or Sharon Osbourne, who recently opened up, saying that her abortion “was horrible.”
If we’re going to have a real discussion about abortion, these are the real stories of real women that need to be told. Many women who have had abortions talk about the regret and pain that they’ve struggled with ever since their abortion. Rachel’s Vineyard hosts thousands of women at their retreats each year who have had abortions and are trying to find healing for the pain and regret that they feel.
Yes, Richards, we need to talk about abortion. But if we’re going to talk about abortion, we need to have an “authentic public dialogue,” where both sides of the experience are represented.

"36",36,"Four Responses To Sympathetic Abortion Stories","Lu","Rachel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-09-29"," Who doesn’t love a good abortion story? Break out the popcorn, eh? Okay, so personally I prefer a good romance. But “abortion rights” advocates are working to promote abortion stories as part of their ever-more-aggressive campaign to persuade the public that abortion is normal and fine and not the least bit offensive. A month ago Janet Harris got people talking with her Washington Post piece claiming that abortion isn’t necessarily a difficult decision. Alex Ronan made waves a few weeks ago by detailing the life of an abortion doula.  And HuffPo recently got in on the party by celebrating the beat poetry of Leyla Josephine, a woman who got an abortion and declares she would die to protect her aborted daughter’s right to do the same. (Obviously, she will not have the opportunity to make good on that promise.)  Safe, legal, and rare is so 20 years ago. Now we’ve moved on to the in-your-face, “I wanted my baby dead and what do you have to say about it” phase. Now, I understand why pro-abortion activism has taken this aggressive turn. “Abortion rights” advocates are frustrated with the way the argument has developed. I mean, sure, pregnant women can obtain legal abortions under almost any imaginable circumstances, but it’s just not respectable. Abortion-seeking women are subject to shame and social pressure and nasty things like that. It’s just not fair. Pro-choice feminists understand that public opinion can have political implications. It’s harder to protect a legal “right” to something when the public regards its exercise (at least under most circumstances) as vicious and self-centered. Even that, though, is more of a secondary consideration. For most liberal feminists, it is simply unjust that a woman may bear a child she doesn’t want simply for the sake of preserving her respectability. Likewise, it’s unjust that she should be shamed for a legitimate exercise of individual autonomy. Understanding the Justice-Based Argument for Abortion Pro-lifers are sometimes confused by the enthusiasm with which liberals celebrate abortion. Even if you agree that abortion might sometimes be necessary, surely it’s still kind of a downer? Here on the pro-life side, the Planned Parenthood rallies and Roe v. Wade anniversary parties seem creepy and depraved. Hooray for voluntary barrenness! Death to fetuses!  We need to understand that abortion advocacy has never been focused on the real good of the individuals involved. It’s an issue of justice. Giving birth is painful and sometimes dangerous, and men don’t have to do these things, ever. How is that fair? For no good reason that liberal feminists can see, women have been “singled out” by nature to be saddled with this significant burden: liability to pregnancy. As Planned Parenthood titan Margaret Sanger observed, pregnancy can be very burdensome to women, limiting their other activities and goals. Giving birth is painful and sometimes dangerous, and men don’t have to do these things, ever. How is that fair? But the injustice goes beyond morning sickness and postpartum depression. Unjustly distributed procreative burdens have put women in a weaker negotiating position, socially speaking. They need security and support just to deal with the natural implications of their own biology. This may compel them to accept a social position that involves more drudgery and less freedom than a man can reasonably expect. Over the longer term, that reality can breed a sense of male entitlement, which itself further limits women’s opportunities. Brace yourselves, liberal feminists. I am a pro-life, non-contracepting, right-wing-associating, conservative Catholic. But I share these concerns. I think men do sometimes take advantage of women’s biological burdens to assert themselves unjustly. We should be assiduous about ensuring that women are respected and offered opportunities for personal fulfillment.  But abortion isn’t the answer. Here are four responses I would make to those who think it is. 1)     Have you actually read these abortion stories? They’re unbelievably sad. Actually the abortion story isn’t really so new. I remember coming across this site several years ago, and browsing for an hour or so. That’s about all I could take. It was too heartbreaking. Abusive boyfriends. Abusive parents. Torrents of bitterness and hurt and terror. Teenagers in court seeking approval to kill their unborn baby without having to tell their parents. Women addressing defensive speeches to a child they aborted ten years before, whose sex they never knew. An abortion just can’t be a happy or inspiring event. An abortion story has an intrinsic narrative problem. Here’s the thing: an abortion just can’t be a happy or inspiring event. The best you can shoot for is boring, portraying the abortion as an event no more noteworthy than a haircut or, at worst, an appendectomy. But if it’s emotionally significant at all, its importance is negative. If there were a convincing way to glamorize the killing of the unborn, Hollywood would have found it already. But most abortion stories are not exactly boring. They’re just extremely, extremely sad. You start to appreciate that some women have lives so bleak that they just can’t think in a serious way about the ethical implications of abortion. Some are trapped in empty sexual relationships, and have nobody who cares enough to help them raise a child. Liberal feminists, face the obvious. Your strategy to empower women isn’t working. 2)     Isn’t it possible the unborn do deserve some sort of protection? As a religious person with philosophical training, I occasionally get questions from self-styled “skeptics” who want me to confess doubts about God’s existence. “Is there at least a 1 percent chance that God doesn’t exist? Maybe 5 percent?” Let’s apply this question to abortion. Suppose you just aren’t sure when a developing human being assumes the status of a unique and precious person. Is it okay just to kill it and move on? How much risk is it acceptable to take here? Suppose you just aren’t sure when a developing human being assumes the status of a unique and precious person. Is it okay just to kill it and move on? Pro-abortion activists do sometimes bite the bullet and agree women should be entitled to kill their unborn children. This was the central point of Judith Jarvis Thompson’s influential 1971 paper, “A Defense of Abortion,” which articulates clearly an argument for why a woman’s “right to choose” should trump a child’s right to life. The short version is that, baby or not, it’s unjust for the woman to be conscripted into the child’s service against her will. Offering up her body as a gestational home is perhaps generous and sporting of her, but it would be going too far to suggest she is obligated. A full response to Thompson is more than I can offer here, but this much I can say: abortion supporters won’t improve their public image with this style of argument. Thompson contends, in effect, that women have a right to be selfish, to put their own concerns above their offspring’s, and to deny succor to helpless children who will die without it. Even if the argument is sound, it’s clearly nothing to celebrate. The object of the abortion story is (ostensibly) to move beyond this bare assertion of rights. Abortion supporters want us to accept that abortion can be a good, right, and reasonable choice, even for people who are not, for example, in the midst of life-threatening pregnancies. That sets the bar much higher, and requires us to delve into questions about the origins of life and personhood. At what moment did you become you?  It’s admittedly a bit mysterious, because it isn’t as though the lights of rational consciousness come on in a single blinding flash. A fetus or baby doesn’t just wake up one day and announce, “I think! I am!” The fact that nobody can really remember how it happened points to a gradual process, the early stages of which are presumably quite different from the experience of mature adult consciousness. Given the moral gravity of taking a human life, I think “abortion rights” advocates should put themselves into a skeptical frame of mind and ask: Is there a 1 percent chance that abortion is murder? Maybe 5 percent? How serious a motive would a person need to justify taking that risk? 3)     Let’s demand more for women. I care a great deal about opening opportunities for women. Mostly that’s because I myself have been blessed with so many, and have known other women who were less fortunate. I hate the kind of chauvinism that seeks to limit women’s goals and activities exclusively to the domestic sphere. This can be a real problem, certainly in the world, but also sometimes in the United States. I can even understand why abortion might seem like a fitting way of “leveling the playing field.” Chauvinism, in my experience, generally reflects a willingness to use women’s greater vulnerability as a kind of bargaining chip, enabling men to claim greater freedoms, opportunities, and privileges. Women are, literally, pregnable in a way that men are not. For that reason, they more obviously need the stability and permanence that marital fidelity provides.  The chauvinist tries to use this to his advantage by suggesting that men must be offered particular privileges to justify the higher opportunity cost that they pay when entering into marriage. Women, by contrast, should simply be grateful to have a secure home in which to raise their offspring. If it’s permissible to refuse natural obligations even to one’s own progeny, what sort of obligations are we likely to accept? In my time living in the Islamic world, I met many men who were willing to make this argument quite explicitly. Here people are generally subtler, but it would be rash to conclude on that basis that chauvinistic reasoning is dead. It is offensive for many reasons, but perhaps its greatest mistake is to view female fertility as a handicap and a weakness. Regrettably, defenders of “reproductive rights” reinforce this same error when they try to achieve parity with men by closing their own wombs. Why can’t we move the argument in the opposite direction? Let’s demand that childbearing be viewed as an honorable service, for which women should be respected and honored. Let’s strive to create opportunities for mothers to pursue excellence and personal fulfillment, both within the domestic sphere and without. Too many women nowadays feel they face a stark choice between maternity and personal fulfillment. Why should we settle for that? In a prosperous nation, with lifespans that would have amazed our ancestors, we should be able to make time for children without giving up on all other worthwhile pursuits. 4)     Isn’t it better to be open to love? This to me is the crux of the issue. Of course, hard cases do arise, in which we can all readily sympathize with a woman’s desire to end a pregnancy (even if we don’t finally agree this is the correct choice). But abortion stories rarely speak to the hard cases. They’re meant to move abortion into the mainstream, legitimizing it as a reasonable choice for ordinary women who prefer not to be pregnant for just about any personal reason. To the liberal feminist mind this seems liberating, because it promises to give women complete, unfettered control over their own bodies. There’s a cost to that kind of “liberation.” If we embrace abortion as a part of normal life, we necessarily accept that it is completely all right to slam the door on love, that there’s nothing wrong with shrugging off meaningful human relationships. That life-giving service really isn’t especially important to womanhood. Is there any chance this will actually make us happier? We live in a world replete with amazing opportunities, and pleasures of almost every imaginable kind. Of course, saying “no” to kids can increase the breadth and range of what we can do and experience. But can any memorable vacation, shiny possession, or ambitious professional goal really compensate for that incalculable loss of love and human connection? If it’s permissible to refuse natural obligations even to one’s own progeny, what sort of obligations are we likely to accept? I’m confident that an abortion-embracing society will be colder, lonelier, and far less happy than one in which love is embraced and life is celebrated. In their way, abortions stories are revealing. I’ve yet to read one, though, that moved me to think, “I’d like to be that woman.” Let’s try to show young Americans there are better options out there, for them and for their children.

"37",37,"Texas Court Case Exposes The Gruesome Reality Of Dismemberment Abortion","Daniel Davidson","John",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-11-09"," Editor’s Note: This article contains descriptions of human dismemberment caused by second-trimester abortions. A bizarre spectacle unfolded this week in a federal district courtroom in Austin, Texas, where a group of abortion providers argued they shouldn’t have to kill a fetus before dismembering it in its mother’s womb, and the state argued that they should.  At issue is a state law passed earlier this year, Senate Bill 8, that would ban live dismemberment abortions. A live dismemberment abortion is exactly what it sounds like: a doctor uses forceps to tear apart a live fetus, limb by limb, and remove it from the mother’s uterus. This is usually done in the second trimester, when the fetus is too large to be suctioned out. The law in question wouldn’t ban such a procedure, but it would require abortion doctors in Texas to ensure that a fetus is dead before they dismember it. The case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Paxton, hinges on the constitutionality of the Texas law and marks the first time the merits of such a statute have been considered at a trial. Other states have passed similar bans of live dismemberment abortion, and some of those laws have been challenged in court without proceeding to the trial phase. Arkansas and Alabama immediately appealed temporary restraining orders against their bans, forgoing trials at the district court level. Texas did not, opting instead for a five-day trial before federal district court Judge Lee Yeakel, which concluded Wednesday. No doubt Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wants to build a record in anticipation of an eventual hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court. Dozens of abortion providers from across the state claim the Texas law effectively bans second-trimester abortions. There is simply no way, they say, to ensure the death of a fetus prior to dismemberment in a “safe and effective” way, so the law creates a substantial burden to a woman’s constitutional right to abortion.  The state claims there are a number of safe and effective means of ensuring the humane death of a fetus prior to a dismemberment abortion, and that the law in question serves legitimate state interests in reducing fetal pain, treating the unborn in a humane and dignified way, and maintaining professional standards for Texas physicians who perform abortions. Hence the bizarre spectacle. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued this week that there’s nothing wrong with dismembering a live fetus, while attorneys for the State of Texas have been at pains to demonstrate just how “safe and effective” it is to kill a fetus before dismembering it in utero. You can inject a chemical called digoxin into the unborn child. You can inject potassium chloride directly into the child’s heart, which causes it to stop beating within minutes. Or you can simply sever the umbilical cord and allow the child to bleed to death. It’s all rather straightforward. No Wonder We Euphemize Abortion In a court case like this, everyone meticulously employs medical jargon and euphemism. A dismemberment abortion, for example, is called a “dilation and evacuation,” or simply D&E. (The idea is to refer to what’s being done to the woman’s cervix and uterus rather than what’s being done to the fetus.) Speaking of the fetus, the favored term for what happens when it’s killed is “fetal demise.” Expert witnesses and attorneys on both sides in this trial have discussed at length the question of fetal demise. How can fetal demise be accomplished safely and effectively? What complications might arise from causing fetal demise? How often does an injection of digoxin fail to bring about fetal demise? Is fetal demise medically necessary? The purpose of such language is to hide from ourselves the horrifying reality of we’re talking about. One expert witness for the plaintiffs, Dr. Mark Nichols of Portland, Ore., corrected a state’s attorney’s offhand use of the phrase, “unborn child.” “That’s not the term we use,” he said. “That’s not the medical term.” Sometimes, Nichols said, doctors will cause fetal demise prior to performing a second-trimester abortion to guard against “extra-mural delivery,” which is when a baby that’s supposed to be aborted is instead born alive—an event that can “cause distress” to the patient (the mother, not the unborn child). Later, he spoke of “removing parts of the pregnancy,” by which he meant ripping the limbs off a live human being. No wonder we speak of such things in euphemisms.  Although not everyone does. In the course of giving expert testimony for the state on Monday morning, Dr. Anthony Levatino dropped the pretense of medical jargon and euphemism—and he had his reasons. On the stand, Levatino explained that when he graduated from medical school in 1976 he was pro-choice and didn’t give much thought to the morality of abortion. From 1980 to 1985 he performed about 1,200 abortions, including approximately 120 dismemberment abortions. Levatino doesn’t do abortions anymore. He stopped performing them after his daughter, two months shy of her sixth birthday, was killed in a car accident in front of their home. She died in his arms on the way to the hospital. Within weeks of her death, he had to perform a previously scheduled dismemberment abortion. When he ripped out the first body part, he stopped short. “I didn’t want to continue,” he said. “But I had to because you can’t leave any body parts in the woman. We don’t pile up body parts on the table to be gruesome, we do it to keep inventory. If we don’t get all the parts out, the woman will get sick, get an infection, she could even die.” Dr. Levatino added that when he looked at the pile of body parts he’d removed from that woman, “I didn’t see the woman’s right to choose or the $800 cash I’d made in 15 minutes. I saw somebody’s son or daughter.” He went on to describe a 20-week-old fetus as being about the size of the palm of an adult hand, from fingertip to wrist, “not counting the legs.” A dismemberment abortion, he explained, involves reaching into a woman’s uterus with forceps and “grabbing whatever is there. Maybe you rip off a leg, which is about four-inches long,” then you pull out “an arm, the spine. The skull is the most difficult part. Sometimes there’s a little face staring up at you.” He understandably called it “an absolutely brutal procedure, in which a living human being is torn to pieces.” Abortion Is Based On A Monstrous Lie Proponents of abortion have always had to contend with the problem that it’s based on a monstrous lie: a fetus is not really a human being, and abortion amounts to nothing more than removing a tumor or a glob of unwanted tissue, not killing an unborn child. The lie was never all that convincing, and abortion advocates managed to triumph in Roe v. Wade despite the lie, not because of it. But in the 44 years since Roe, the grisly truth about abortion—that it’s the straightforward taking of a human life—has steadily eroded the lie. The longer abortion persists, the more it seems outrageous and barbaric. Our laws have gradually come to reflect this. Although the landmark 1992 Supreme Court case Casey v. Planned Parenthood reaffirmed the central holding in Roe—a woman’s right to privacy under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right to abortion—it opened the way for states to regulate abortions in the first trimester or at any stage before fetal viability, as long as they don’t impose an undue burden on a woman’s right to abortion. The crucial shift in the court’s ruling in Casey was twofold. It recognized that advances in medical technology had shown that a fetus could be considered viable at 22 or 23 weeks, as opposed to the 28 weeks set forth in Roe, and that the state had a legitimate interest in the “potentiality of human life,” which could include completely banning abortions after viability. In 2003, Congress banned partial-birth abortions, or “intact dilation and extraction,” a term that, like dilation and evacuation, obscures the grisly reality of the procedure. In a partial-birth abortion, a living fetus is delivered feet-first and its skull crushed before its chin clears the uterus, inches before the completion of live birth. In the later stages of pregnancy, a partial-birth abortion isn’t much different than simply killing a newborn infant as it emerges from the womb. Before the ban, such abortions were usually performed in the second trimester, after 15 weeks and up to the point of viability. At the time of passage, Congress rightly called it “a gruesome and inhumane procedure,” and noted that 27 states had already passed laws banning partial-birth abortions. In 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the ban, ruling in Gonzales v. Carhart that the federal law did not impose an undue burden on a woman’s right to abortion. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy noted that the law “expresses respect for the dignity of human life” and affirmed the government’s interest in protecting the integrity of the medical profession. “The government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman,” Kennedy wrote. In her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued, quite remarkably, that there is really no difference between partial-birth abortion and dismemberment abortion. “Nonintact D&E could equally be characterized as ‘brutal,’” she writes, “involving as it does ‘tear[ing] [a fetus] apart’ and ‘ripp[ing] off’ its limbs.” (But of course for Ginsburg, this is a reason not to ban dismemberment abortion but instead to preserve partial-birth abortion.) Like Casey, Gonzales was an important development in abortion jurisprudence because it acknowledged that the government has a legitimate interest in respecting the life of the unborn, that a fetus is not simply a tumor or a clump of cells to be cut out or removed however an abortionist sees fit. Implicit in Gonzales, much like federal and state fetal homicide laws that impose additional criminal penalties for violent crimes against pregnant women, is the recognition that a fetus is in fact a human life and that how you take that life matters. In fact, in his majority decision, Kennedy says outright that dismemberment abortion “is a procedure laden with the power to devalue human life.” Describing Dismemberment Abortion Exposes Its Horror That brings us to the current case in Texas. In his closing statement Wednesday, Darren McCarty, lead counsel for the attorney general’s office, said that Senate Bill 8 isn’t a ban on dismemberment abortion, but only regulates “the moment of death—the moment, and nothing more. Is the lethal act going to be dismemberment, or an injection, or the snip of the umbilical cord?” He added that banning live dismemberment, as the law does, is not a step backwards but “a sign of progress in society.” In a brief for the district court before the trial, Paxton argued that “We have reached a point in this particular technology where there is no possibility of denying an act of destruction. It is before one’s eyes. The sensations of dismemberment flow through the forceps like an electric current.” Janet Crepps, the lead attorney representing the plaintiffs, didn’t see it that way. Live dismemberment abortion is an “advancement” for women, she said, because the procedure doesn’t take as long as it would if the state required fetal demise beforehand. In fact, she argued, Senate Bill 8 offers no benefits whatsoever to women seeking an abortion, because causing fetal demise prior to dismemberment is not “medically necessary.” Therefore, any additional burden the law might impose should render it unconstitutional. The fetal demise requirement, she said, “is part of a larger scheme to restrict abortion by banning it one procedure at a time.” No doubt, plenty of lawmakers in Texas would like to do just that. But in the meantime, treating the unborn with dignity and humanity should be a bare minimum. After all, criminals on death row are not dismembered alive, nor are animals condemned to be euthanized. As McCarty noted in his closing, “it would be a great irony if the constitution that required the humane execution of criminals would ban the state from requiring the humane death of an unborn child.” In the meantime, the Texas Legislature is determined to shine a light on what really happens in abortion clinics across the country. The Texas lawmaker responsible for the parts of Senate Bill 8 being challenged in federal court is Rep. Stephanie Klick, a registered nurse and medical consultant from Fort Worth. She attended much of the trial this week, and at one point told me that when she laid out the bill on the floor of the Texas House some people found out for the first time about dismemberment abortion. She said one woman approached her and explained that she’d had an abortion at 17 weeks, and wanted to know if that’s what they’d done to her. “I said, ‘Do you want to know the truth or do you want to feel good about your decision?’ She said, ‘No, I want to know the truth,’ and I said it’s very likely that you had a dismemberment procedure done. She was horrified by that.” Klick also said that some Democrats voted for the bill who had never voted for anything pro-life in the past. “This procedure is so heinous that’s it’s changing hearts and minds when the public learns about how horrendous it is.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2017/11/09/court-case-texas-exposes-gruesome-reality-dismemberment-abortion/",0.9989,0.0011,"male",2012,2012
"38",38,"Planned Parenthood’s Abortion Theater","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013-11-18"," Marni Evans, 37, is a striking woman with dark and well-coiffed hair. Her ensemble suggests a comfortable living. She sits down for a videotaped interview, holding the hand of John Lockhart, her fiancé. John, 43, is bald and wears glasses. His fashionable western shirt is rolled up to his elbows. He’s a software engineer. Trained as an architect, she’s a self-employed sustainability consultant. They tell the story about how they discovered they were expecting. “I was late by a couple of days and so I had this suspicion that we were pregnant and then we went and got a home pregnancy test and verified that. And of course we were still in such shock that we went to Planned Parenthood and had an official pregnancy test done just to verify it. And found out — yes, yes, yes, it’s positive.”  They decided to end the life of the baby growing inside her. Or as we euphemistically like to put it, they decided to have an abortion. We know all this because the Texas Tribune produced a glowing 6:34 video of the couple talking about how awful a new Texas law is that improves standards of care for women seeking abortions. Advocates of abortion say these improved standards — such as requiring that doctors who perform abortions have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of the clinic — are unnecessary and infringe upon the right to end the lives of unborn children via abortion. That portion of the law went into effect on November 1. Her abortion clinic canceled the appointment because her doctor didn’t have admitting privileges at any of Austin’s hospitals. The Tribune video and accompanying story are a fascinating look at media coverage of abortion. As has become standard in such situations, no difficult questions are posed to the couple. Even though other abortionists in Austin meet the standards of Texas’ new law, for instance, her curious claim that she had to use frequent flyer miles to book a flight to Seattle, of all places, to abort the baby receives no apparent push back. (Later we’re told she did just book with a different doctor in the same town in which she lives — no flight necessary.)  Marni says she and her fiancé looked at the pros and cons of allowing the unborn child to continue living or aborting it. They looked at “the health of our relationship” (presumably good enough to be engaged and knocking boots without effective birth control other than abortion), “how long we’ve been together” (presumably long enough to be betrothed to each other), and “do we have enough built as a foundation to create a loving happy healthy family” (John is sitting right there when she lets this line just hang there, uncomfortably). Marni says they considered their self-employment and variable paychecks. For what it’s worth, even if they both only made the median income for males and females in Austin, which is doubtful considering their careers, that would put them in the wealthiest 3 percent of the global population, with an income 20 times the typical person. At the end of this magnificent and compelling case for the violent act of abortion, John says, “For all the reasons Marni described, this was absolutely not the right time for us to have a child.” Did I mention she’s 37 and he’s 43? Is this really the best case abortion proponents could put forward to tug at the heart-strings of abortion moderates? A financially well-off, educated, older couple who might be witnessing their last chance at conceiving a child?  Or as I put it on Twitter: I think @TexasTribune tried to make a big pro-choice video but accidentally made a big pro-life video. http://t.co/cXQ8UZbhKk
— Mollie (@MZHemingway) November 7, 2013 Abortion and Public Relations What’s really interesting about this story is how it came to be told. The Tribune’s video of the calm and composed couple was posted on November 3. Here’s what Marni was doing on the day of her canceled abortion. She sent this note to Rick Jervis, USA Today’s Austin correspondent: @MrRJervis my Austin abortion was cancelled today; flying to Seattle. Want to hear my story?
— Marni Jade Evans (@marnijade) November 1, 2013 It’s what we’d all do on the day of our abortion being canceled, right? And we wouldn’t just write Jervis. Here’s her note to Abby Ohlheiser, staff writer at The Atlantic Wire: @abbyohlheiser my Texas abortion was cancelled today and I am flying to Washington state. hear my story @marnijade
 — Marni Jade Evans (@marnijade) November 1, 2013 That was followed up by this note to Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza, naturally: @TheFix My Austin abortion scheduled for today was cancelled and I’m flying to Seattle. Hear my story. @marnijade
— Marni Jade Evans (@marnijade) November 1, 2013  We all tweet to the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza about our abortions, right? There are no tweets from Evans to the Texas Tribune, but somehow the savvy public relations campaign was brought to their attention. And a few other folks. Now, maybe Marni Evans just happened to deal with her abortion situation via a savvy public relations campaign. And maybe Marni Evans just happened to echo the sentiments and rhetoric of a big new abortion rights campaign built around efforts to destigmatize the legal practice of killing the babies growing within our wombs. That campaign, which was written about here, has enjoyed major success in the media. Here’s New York Mag’s participation in it: New York Magazine tackles abortion stigma http://t.co/tTxqD3VdKV pic.twitter.com/OKwqTVh5iQ
— ThinkProgress (@thinkprogress) November 12, 2013  It should be noted that the stories — about repeat abortions, callous attitudes and bullying boyfriends — may have done just as much to reinforce the stigma as anything else. But while there’s always been a separation between abortion rights mythmaking and reality, we’ve hit a moment unrivaled since the storytelling surrounding “Jane Roe” of Roe V. Wade. Komen vs. Planned Parenthood As detailed by former Susan G. Komen honcho Karen Handel in her expose “Planned Bullyhood,” the cancer-fighting charity’s funding decisions were sabotaged by the theatrical breaking of a “gentle-ladies agreement” Komen had with Planned Parenthood. Komen had been funding Planned Parenthood for years even though the abortion giant didn’t do any actual mammograms. The grants were “pass-through” grants, meaning that Planned Parenthood was basically the middle man between women and groups that offered mammograms. Komen, under heat from pro-lifers who wanted to fund the charity but not Planned Parenthood, made an agreement to quietly stop giving these grants. The two groups even worked on shared public relations statements. But someone leaked the news to the Associated Press at precisely the same time that Planned Parenthood was ready with a new campaign fighting the Komen Foundation’s change of direction. High-ranking elected officials, media figures and celebrities were lined up ready to support Planned Parenthood in one of the most stunning attacks on a charity in memory. The once-popular Komen couldn’t take the heat and backed down within three days. One of the interesting things revealed by Handel is that the public relations professionals hired by Komen to help with the transition away from funding Planned Parenthood were Hilary Rosen, a communications and media consultant at SKDKnickerbocker, and Brenday Daly, a PR consultant who had worked with Planned Parenthood’s Cecile Richards at Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s office. SKDKnickerbocker also employs former Obama White House Communications Director Anita Dunn, and represented none other than Sandra Fluke a few months after the Komen debacle kicked off the “War on Women.” A Not-So-Spontaneous Social Media Outpouring More recently, the media reported on what seemed like an organic outpouring of social media support for Texas Sen. Wendy Davis’s filibuster of the Texas bill protecting unborn children who had made it through five months’ gestation. She was feted on every Sunday morning talk show, magazine covers and most print outlets. What was almost not covered at all was the savvy public relations campaign that prepared the way for the filibuster, which you can read about in the Washington Post’s blog post headlined “Wendy Davis ‘tweetstorm’ was planned in advance“: That “tweetstorming” tactic was essentially what pushed Davis, by degrees, into the national spotlight. After five hours, the #standwithwendy hashtag was picked up by the national ACLU and Planned Parenthood, which have a combined 259,000 followers. Less than an hour later, at 5:53 CT, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted her own message of support — followed one hour later by a tweet from President Obama that was reshared nearly 17,000 times. Celebrities who providentially happened to help out at just the right time included the comedian Rob Delaney, with more than 870,000 followers, Mark Ruffalo, Lena Dunham and Sarah Silverman. Serendipitous, really. Abortion Kickstarters Let’s look at a few other stories coming from pro-choice activists. Jodi Jacobson is the editor-in-chief of RH RealityCheck, an abortion news site. An enthusiastic, if misguided, tweeter, she recently announced a kickstarter-style campaign for an abortion. She linked to the fundraiser, headlined “Help Save Florence’s Life,” which says: Florence is a young immigrant from Africa with very few contacts in the United States. She wanted to have her baby, but she has a life-threatening genetic disease which has complicated her pregnancy and made her very, very sick. She’s more than 20 weeks pregnant – she tried to raise the money for her procedure earlier but she just couldn’t make it. Now, because of clinic closures and the new ban on procedures after 20 weeks, Florence is unable to access an abortion in Texas. Knowledgeable readers will immediately identify problems. Foremost, while Texas law does protect children who have made it through five months’ gestation, there is an exemption for mothers who face life-threatening pregnancies. Assuming Florence is real and really does face a life-threatening pregnancy, Texas law permits her to procure an abortion. And better yet, if the baby has gestated in her mother’s womb for 23 weeks or so, that baby may be viable and able to be delivered, thereby preserving the life of the baby and mother. But apart from these issues, what about the ethics of fundraising off of “Florence”? Jodi Jacobson’s RH Reality Check raised $1.3 million last year. She herself took home $179,293 in pay. We’re told that “Florence” needs $1000 for an abortion out of state, so why didn’t Jacobson or her organization just cut a check? Would that not be theatrical enough? If Abortion Is Only 3% Of Planned Parenthood’s Business … Here are some headlines out of Texas in recent days: Clinics in Fort Worth, other cities stop providing abortions, prepare to shut downClinics Close As Texas Abortion Fight ContinuesAbortion Clinics Start Closing Across Texas From the last story: Planned Parenthood will close a dozen clinics on Friday after a federal appeals court reinstated most of the state’s controversial new abortion law. The ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals late Thursday means that many abortion clinics across the state of Texas are required to stop providing the procedure immediately. Planned Parenthood claimed in its request to the U.S. Supreme Court that more than one-third of the facilities in Texas were forced to stop providing care. They didn’t explain why some abortion doctors in Texas were able to get admitting privileges to local hospitals within three months of the new law’s passage and other abortion doctors weren’t. But let’s not even get into those issues. Planned Parenthood frequently tells the media — and the media totally lap it up — that 97 percent of its business has nothing whatsoever to do with abortion. Pro-lifers have been debunking the statistic or otherwise treating it skeptically for years, but the claim is made repeatedly. Here‘s the Washington Post’s Ezra Klein buying into it. Earlier this year Amanda Marcotte at Slate wrote: All together now: 97 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services are not abortion. Attacks on Planned Parenthood are, by definition, largely attacks on non-abortion services. Attacks on Planned Parenthood’s funding, regardless of claimed intent, are strictly attacks on contraception, STI testing/treatment, and cancer screenings. So the question is obvious. If 97% of Planned Parenthood’s services aren’t abortion, why in the world would an abortion regulation cause a dozen Planned Parenthood clinics to close? Closing clinics make for great headlines and more dramatic court briefs. But a media mildly more skeptical of savvy public relations campaigns and well-scripted legal wrangling might serve the public a bit more.

"39",39,"The United Kingdom Forced Northern Ireland To Legalize Abortion, And The Irish Are Fighting Back","Silberman","James",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-05-13"," The United States are unique among developed countries in that abortion is one of our defining political issues. Yet while the killing of unborn children is a political non-factor in most western countries, this is not the case in Northern Ireland. Before the Parliament of the United Kingdom overrode Northern Ireland’s abortion laws in 2019 in violation of the terms of the union, Northern Irish preborn children possessed equality under the law. Since the United Kingdom’s tyrannical imposition of child murder on Northern Ireland and subsequent pushback from the Northern Irish people, the nation has joined the United States among countries whose politics are defined largely by the abortion debate — one that’s rapidly heating up.  The British House of Commons and House of Lords voted in favor of the Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2021 Act last month. It grants Northern Ireland’s secretary of state unilateral authority to implement pro-abortion regulations. The new law follows the 2019 Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act, which forced legal abortion upon Northern Ireland for the first time. The Executive Formation Act also included more far-reaching mandates for inserting pro-abortion material into public education programs and criminalizing sidewalk counseling and preaching outside abortion clinics. Despite the passage of the Executive Formation Act, the Northern Irish Legislative Assembly and executive leaders have resisted the implementation of the pro-abortion regulations, resulting in many Northern Irish hospitals lacking the resources and training necessary to kill children in the womb and public education on abortion remaining largely the same. Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has expressed his desire to override the rest of the Northern Irish government on abortion if given the power to do so. This means the passage of the Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2021 Act is set to force the pro-abortion agenda of the United Kingdom upon the people of Northern Ireland against their will.  Making the United Kingdom’s Power-Grab Possible The relationship between the countries of the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom central government is similar to that between the American federal government and the separate states. The U.K. government possesses the authority to legislate certain issues, while other issues are “devolved” to the individual nations. Until 2019, Northern Ireland maintained control of its own abortion laws despite the passage of the 1967 Abortion Act by the U.K. Parliament. Sections 58 and 59 of Northern Ireland’s Offences Against the Person Act made abortion a felony punishable by up to life in prison (except those to save the life of the mother). In 2015 and 2016, Northern Ireland came under pressure from domestic pro-abortion groups to legalize abortion in certain cases. Two bills were put forward: one to legalize the murder of unborn children conceived in rape and incest, and a second to legalize the murder of unborn children with disabilities. They were voted down 64-30 and 59-40, respectively, and abortion remained illegal. The Northern Irish Legislative Assembly is unique in that it requires a power-sharing agreement between parties in order to do business. If one party refuses to govern, the government collapses. When a scandal rocked the Northern Irish government in 2016, Sinn Fein (a left-wing party that typically controls the second-most seats in the Northern Irish Legislative Assembly) refused to nominate a deputy first minister. As a result, the Northern Irish government collapsed in January 2017 and was out of operation for the next three years.  A year into the collapse, the pro-abortion United Nations took action against Northern Ireland. A 2018 United Nations report accused Northern Ireland of violating women’s rights, saying, “Denial of abortion and criminalization of abortion amounts to discrimination against women because it is a denial of a service that only women need.” With that, momentum grew in the United Kingdom for action to override Northern Ireland’s protection of preborn children. To provide for the continuation of various government services in Northern Ireland during the collapse, the United Kingdom Parliament stepped in. In a 2019 bill, pro-abortion MPs added language forcing abortion and homosexual marriage on Northern Ireland if their government was not operational by October 21 of that year. Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists were unable to come to an agreement until January 2020, so the protections for unborn children against murder were repealed, and legal abortion came to Northern Ireland. Reform vs. Repeal After the passage of the Executive Formation Act, two competing tactics emerged in Northern Ireland: reforming abortion laws within the new abortion regulations versus repealing Section 9 of the Executive Formation Act. Philip Lynn of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child Northern Ireland wrote that trying to reform legal abortion within the framework of the Executive Formation Act in an attempt to moderate the evil is a futile endeavor: Reform efforts are doomed to failure … a compromise or ‘reformist’ stance will merely result in weak policies, and supply the abortion industry with a degree of legitimacy it does not currently have in Northern Ireland. Reformist policies will allow abortion to become Northern Ireland’s ‘new normal.’ … However, the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children are unambiguous and clear: we are abortion abolitionists. The killing of any child, for any reason, can never be justified. We will not lend our support to reformist efforts to ‘improve’ regulations which are specifically designed to enable the killing of children in their mother’s womb. Rather than accepting and working within the new abortion regime, thereby strengthening it and making repeal efforts more difficult, Northern Ireland’s leading anti-abortion organizations are working to void the process by which legal abortion was forced on them. Reflecting the Values of Citizens On the Monday before the House of Commons committee vote, MP Paul Girvan delivered to Prime Minister Boris Johnson a letter authored by the Center for Bioethical Reform Northern Ireland and signed by more than 250 Irish ministers opposing the bill. Also delivered was a legal notice the group intends to take Northern Ireland’s Secretary of State to court on constitutional grounds if he attempts to unilaterally implement the pro-abortion laws in Northern Ireland. In a press release, Pastor Clive Johnson of the Center for Bioethical Reform Northern Ireland proclaimed: The United Kingdom Government’s actions since the summer of 2019 have effectively destroyed the concept of devolution and have set a dangerous precedent for the future. It creates a blueprint for Westminster to strip Stormont of all powers on areas where Northern Ireland differs from England. We are calling on the Secretary of State to withdraw The Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2021 and for the United Kingdom Government to repeal Section 9 of the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act 2019. The group’s open letter further explains the signees encourage all anti-abortion MPs to walk about of the legislative assembly and the executive, denying quorum and thus collapsing the government once again, “Stormont must fall and control of our laws must be negotiated back to our own soil before it returns. It is time to make the murder of pre-born children a red line that we cannot cross.” The U.K. government has made clear its intentions of forcing legalized abortion on Northern Ireland, but the Northern Irish are making just as clear their intentions of defying Westminster’s tyranny. “We are proud to be teaming up with the Northern Ireland office of SPUC to fight back against the Secretary of State’s power grab and take back control of our laws,” Center for Bioethical Reform Northern Ireland’s Mark Lambe said. “This case is about Northern Ireland’s ability to decide its own future and to create laws that reflect the values of the citizens who live there. The Secretary of State has killed the concept of devolution. It is time for it to be restored.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/13/the-united-kingdom-forced-northern-ireland-to-legalize-abortion-and-the-irish-are-fighting-back/",0.9977,0.0023,"male",2012,2012
"40",40,"In Show Of Pro-Abortion Brutality, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Just Slashed Care For Pregnant Women From Michigan’s Budget","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-25"," Last week, Michigan’s Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed funding for maternity homes, adoption tax credits, and other budget items that assist pregnant women. While post-Dobbs, Whitmer and her fellow Democrats seek to conceal the party’s pro-abortion agenda by pushing state courts to institute the extreme abortion regime they demand, in striking from the budget any spending that has a semblance of supporting the choice of life, Whitmer exposes her party’s abortion-first position. 



When the Supreme Court overturned Roe and Casey and held in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that there is no federal constitutional right to abortion, the high court stressed that it was returning the authority to regulate abortion to the people and their elected representatives. While Republican legislators took heed of the high court’s directive proposing, debating, and compromising on bills regulating abortion, Democrats instead flocked to state courts with the hope that activist judges would supplant the will of the people by using their raw judicial power to find a right to abortion in the state constitution—a tactic the pro-abortion left began decades ago in anticipation of the Supreme Court reversing Roe and Casey.



This approach provides Democrats cover to hide behind soundbites such as “health care” and “medical decisions” without staking a public position on specific abortion regulations. Kansas provides a veritable case study of how Democrat lawmakers seek refuge behind the battlement constructed by that state’s Supreme Court out of its 150-plus-year-old constitution.



In 2019, in Hodes and Nauser v. Schmidt, “in response to a lawsuit brought by two abortion providers challenging a state law that criminalized dismemberment abortions—in which live fetuses are killed by being ripped apart limb by limb—the Kansas Supreme Court declared for the first time that the state’s constitution provides a fundamental right to abortion.” While several Democrats voted in favor of the ban on second-trimester D&E, or dilation and evacuation, abortions that were at issue in Hodes, when the Kansas legislature voted to amend the state constitution to overturn Hodes and to put the Value Them Both constitutional amendment on the ballot for the citizens of the state to decide, not one Democrat voted in favor of the amendment. 



That Kansas’s supposedly pro-life Democrat lawmakers voted against returning the authority to make laws to regulate abortion to the legislative branch makes no sense, unless they faced demands from the national party to oppose the Value Them Both Amendment. After all, the passage of the Value Them Both Amendment does not institute any specific abortion regulation. All it does is allow the bicameral state legislature to pass such bills as the people’s elected representatives deem appropriate.



While opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment in Kansas by the handful of ostensibly pro-life Democrats is either illogical, hypocritical, or cowardly, the Democrat Party’s position makes eminent sense once one realizes abortion extremism is the party’s mainstream. And post-Dobbs, the only way to hide that reality from the public and enshrine in the law an abortion regime overwhelmingly opposed by the majority of Americans is to make state court justices do the dirty work. 



With a vote on Kansas’s Value Them Both Amendment scheduled for just over two weeks away, on Aug. 2, Democrats’ talking points confirm that strategy. “The constitutional amendment on the Kansas ballot will mandate government control over our private medical decisions and pave the way for a total ban on abortion — with no exception for rape, incest or to save the mother’s life,” PBS reported Ashley All, a spokeswoman for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, complaining. “I’m grieving for all the pregnant people who can’t access care,” Dr. Iman Alsaden, the medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, added in an interview with PBS.



The Kansas amendment, however, merely clarifies that there is no state constitutional right to abortion. And while the abortion lobby highlights the possibility that a future Kansas legislature may prohibit abortions, even in cases of rape, incest, or where a mother’s life is at risk, they ignore the reality that under Hodes’ interpretation of the state’s constitution, Kansas’s Supreme Court has dictated an extreme leftist regime of abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy, for any reason and with taxpayer funding, and with no waiting periods or parental notification. Democrats will have achieved that end without needing to publicly support or vote for such laws, and in turn, will avoid the backlash from voters who believe the state has gone too far. 



Conversely, should the constitutional amendment pass, to become law, abortion legislation in Kansas will need to obtain the support of a majority of members of both the House and the Senate, and possibly a super-majority in the event the Democrat governor vetoes the bill. The legislators will be forced to discuss and debate the bill and put their names and their political future behind the righteousness of the proposed abortion regulation. Every election, thereafter, the people’s representatives must face voters and answer for their positions, and if the populace disagrees with the law or finds it too “extreme,” the remedy lies in the ballot box. 



Democrats do not want the people to decide abortion policy, however, because they know the populace does not support their party’s extreme abortion-on-demand position, which is why in Kansas, abortion activists pretend a complete abortion ban is on the ballot. Likewise, in Michigan, rather than debate abortion policy and push for legislation to implement the public’s preferences, Whitmer has instead turned to the state Supreme Court to institute an extreme abortion regime through the Michigan constitution, while she and her fellow Democrats sidestep debates over limits on abortions. 



In fact, in announcing that she had asked the Michigan Supreme Court to expedite her lawsuit seeking a declaration of a state constitutional right to abortion, Whitmer used nearly identical language to that spoken from the abortion lobby in Kansas. “While politicians in other states rush to ban abortion, even in instances of rape or incest, Michigan must remain a place where a woman’s ability to make her own medical decisions with her trusted health care provider is respected,” Whitmer said in a press release.



What Whitmer won’t tell the public, though, and what she and her fellow Democrats don’t want Michiganders to know, is that they want an abortion regime that permits abortion on demand for any reason until the moment of birth, paid for by taxpayers. And that is precisely what will be installed on the populace if the Michigan Supreme Court finds a right to abortion in the state constitution. Further, by using the Michigan Supreme Court to achieve this end, rather than the legislative process, Democrats can avoid the extremist label.



But while Whitmer’s rhetoric and her use of the judicial system to achieve her ends may mask Democrats’ intent, her line-item vetoes in last week’s 2022-2023 budget make clear where the party stands on abortion, even if she prefers the courts provide the bottom line: It is not about choice or helping women; it is about abortion first.



Whitmer’s stark strike-out from the budget of funds designed to help women choose life or to aid women who have chosen life says it all. The budget items she struck went much beyond assistance to pregnancy resource centers, which since Dobbs have strangely been in Democrats’ crosshairs. Whitmer actually struck $4 million allocated for maternity homes that provide “safe housing and comprehensive support services without charge for pregnant women who are without a safe home and in need.”



Whitmer’s line-item vetoes likewise exposed the revolting truth that Democrats prefer abortion to adoption. Here, the Democrat governor struck $2 million in tax credits to adoptive parents and $10 million designed to provide factual information to pregnant women about adoption as an alternative to abortion, including the birth mother’s ability to establish a pre-birth plan.



No amount of political posturing can overcome the reality seen in the black lines Whitmer used to cross out care for women and their children. And hide as they might behind activist judges, that budget tells the world Whitmer and her fellow Democrats don’t value women, or choice, or health care. They value abortion.

"41",41,"How New York’s Radical Abortion Law Will Hurt Preemies And People With Down Syndrome","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-15"," Last week, a spokesperson for the Queens district attorney’s office announced that a New York man accused of stabbing his pregnant girlfriend to death repeatedly in the abdomen and neck would not be charged with second-degree abortion due to the repeal of that statute in the recently passed Reproductive Health Act (RHA), which expanded abortion access to the point of birth in the state. Not an ounce of the justice due to the unborn child of Jennifer Irigoyen will be sought, all because pro-death officials elected by New Yorkers have succeeded in their mission to define all pre-born human life in their state as disposable non-persons.  Pro-lifers often criticize pro-choice language as myopically, disingenuously focused on “a woman and her doctor.” We assert that a child is involved, too––a child who is being killed. We point out the value of pre-born life and “the mother-child bond,” but in our zeal for saving pre-born babies from abortion, we often unwittingly restrict our focus to what happens in the surgical room of abortion clinics and the doctors’ offices that prescribe abortifacients. This Culture Of Death Hurts Us All The truth, however, is that the culture of death pervades much, much more than abortion policy itself, abortion rates, or American attitudes on abortion. Without even bringing in the many parallel dangers of assisted suicide that pose another underestimated threat to the culture of life, consider how pro-abortion ideology results in more tragedy and injustice than just an aborted baby and abortion regret. New York’s RHA, signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo just weeks ago, is a prime example. As mentioned above, a baby who died as a result of his mother being stabbed in the abdomen is perhaps the first victim of the law not directly related to legal abortion. This is just the first of many injustices that will result, either directly or indirectly, from this law. So far, the media coverage of the new law has been almost exclusively focused on its removal of virtually all restrictions on abortion. That is evil enough, of course. But the bill passed two other equally heinous reforms: First, it redefined a victim of homicide as “a human being who has been born and is alive.”  In keeping with this definition, the RHA repealed seven statutes relating to criminal abortion, including self-abortion in the first and second degree (Class A and B misdemeanors, respectively), and abortion in the first and second degree (Class D and E felonies, respectively). This latter repeal is why the murderer of baby Irigoyen will not be punished for his heinously evil deed. Also among the repealed criminal laws: the abortion of a pre-born child, 24 weeks or older, if the cause of death of the pregnant woman, which was formerly considered first-degree manslaughter (Article 125.20 subdivision 3 of the penal law), and causing the death of a mother in an effort to abort a child at any point during pregnancy was considered second-degree manslaughter (Article 125.15 subdivision 2). The law’s second blatant piece of barbarism is the repeal of section 4164 of the public health law, which repeals all rights and protections for aborted children older than 20 weeks who are born alive. They need not receive any care at all. Their deaths don’t even have to be documented before they can be chucked into the medical waste bin. I will post this repealed provision here in its entirety so you don’t have to take my word for it:  When an abortion is to be performed after the twelfth week of pregnancy it shall be performed only in a hospital and only on an in-patient basis. When an abortion is to be performed after the twentieth week of pregnancy, a physician other than the physician performing the abortion shall be in attendance to take control of and to provide immediate medical care for any live birth that is the result of the abortion. The commissioner of health is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to insure the health and safety of the mother and the viable child, in such instances: Such child shall be accorded immediate legal protection under the laws of the state of New York, including but not limited to applicable provisions of the social services law, article five of the civil rights law and the penal law. The medical records of all life-sustaining efforts put forth for such a live aborted birth, their failure or success, shall be kept by attending physician.  All other vital statistics requirements in the public health law shall be complied with in regard to such aborted child. In the event of the subsequent death of the aborted child, the disposal of the dead body shall be in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. Disposal Of Babies As Medical Waste To sum it up, the RHA has doomed New York children born alive after an attempted late-term abortion to short lives of suffering and neglect, followed by their bodies’ disposal as medical waste, without so much as an official acknowledgment that they existed as unique human individuals. Perhaps a hospital would issue a birth or death certificate to the mother, but they are now released from the requirement to do so. Since the RHA also allows abortions after 12 weeks to be performed outside hospitals, a child who is born alive at an abortion clinic but then dies almost certainly isn’t going to be recognized in official documentation as a unique individual. Most of the language in the RHA is devoted to repealing protections and provisions for justice for pre-born babies and aborted babies who are born alive. The establishment of abortion as legal up to birth for protecting the “life or health” of the mother (which equates to elective abortion due to the absurd reasoning of Doe v. Bolton) is only one short paragraph. This law was not an eclectic assortment of various repeals and amendments only loosely related to one another. The entire bill was designed to dehumanize all pre-born babies and all victims of abortion, whether they come out of their mothers dead or alive. It is rigorously consistent in its assertion that these children have no value whatsoever, because that is what pro-abortion ideology requires to survive. For an abortion regime to endure in spite of overwhelming scientific evidence that pre-born life is as human as born life, for it to anchor itself firmly in our laws in spite of our Judeo-Christian heritage that sees humans as intrinsically valuable and endowed with the right to life, it must drive a stake into every other area of policy in which babies younger than approximately nine months post-conception are seen as more than mere “pregnancy tissue.” Abortion policies, especially those as radical as the RHA, cannot remain forever in the face of such blatant inconsistencies as fetal homicide laws and required care for infants born alive after abortion. Devaluing Young Human Life Harms Struggling Preemies Those policies have a ripple effect into prenatal care and care for premature infants who were not victims of abortion. Hospitals in Indiana and Ohio have refused to care for extremely premature infants due to their states’ subjective views of viability, despite desperate pleas from their mother. Women have been pressured to abort babies with abnormalities or difficult pregnancies to the point of others scheduling the abortion without their express consent and trying to scare them with all the potential problems their child may face. They face this pressure because abortion has become the first “solution” to the problem of a difficult pregnancy, simply because it is legal and ostensibly more convenient and less expensive than giving birth and trying to potentially raise a disabled child, or trying to balance cancer treatment with preserving the baby’s health. The tragedy doesn’t even end at the deaths of pre-born babies with abnormalities––the effect of killing off the vast majority of certain populations, as Denmark and the Netherlands have done with Down Syndrome, is a drastic decrease in quality of life for the few who are allowed to live due to scarce resources and an ever-increasing pressure for women to abort a baby with that diagnosis. If nearly every baby of a certain diagnosis is aborted, there is little incentive to develop treatments and therapy for those conditions, much less make them affordable. These are the consequences of legal abortion. Our ability to persuade doesn’t lie only in the fact that pre-born lives are separate and unique human individuals and therefore shouldn’t be killed. The fact that admitting abortion into our culture means admitting all its logical consequences––including a complete dehumanization of multiple classes of human beings––is a powerful message that is drastically under-delivered. When we consider the impact of abortion laws, we must think beyond just the abortion clinic. If we do not uproot legal abortion in its entirety, its poison will corrupt the culture of life completely.

"44",44,"Joe Biden’s Rabid Pro-Abortionism Is Far More Immoral Than Anything Trump Has Ever Done","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-09-11"," In 2016, many pro-lifers doubted Donald Trump’s commitment to our cause. He appeared to be an unlikely, and presumably unreliable, champion for human life in the womb. But the president has delivered for us. Not only have his policies, rhetoric, and judicial picks been resolutely pro-life, his populism has invigorated conservative interest in the economic, as well as social, preconditions for strong families. For most pro-lifers, Trump’s presidency is a cause for jubilation.  An Attempt to Make a Pro-Life Case for Biden His pro-life work is, however, a problem for diehard Never Trump figures who claim to be pro-life. They now have to justify sitting out the coming election or, in some cases, supporting the most pro-abortion Democratic ticket in history. It is not easy for those who claim to be pro-life to explain why they are voting for candidates who support taxpayer-funded abortion on demand until birth. Mona Charen has taken up the challenge, arguing that even if Trump’s policies on abortion are better than Biden’s, this need not be dispositive for pro-life voters. She says Trump is terrible in other ways, Biden isn’t that bad, and presidents don’t matter that much to the pro-life cause. Charen derives her argument that presidents are inconsequential for the pro-life movement from a column by David French, which was picked up by others, including a National Review piece by Cameron Hilditch. I am weary of writing about Never Trump in general, and French in particular, but their outsized media influence necessitates that they not be ignored. The heart of their “pro-life” case against Trump is that the annual number of abortions has been dropping for decades, regardless of who was in office. They conclude, therefore, that the pro-life movement can succeed despite lacking the political power of the presidency.  What Is Success? This might be true if the pro-life movement is willing to redefine success to mean only ameliorating the toll of abortion, rather than also seeking its abolition. But the pro-life movement has done both, working to reduce abortions now while fighting for the ultimate abolition of elective abortion. French and Charen are surrendering on the second part of the struggle. By their standard, it would be a success if, in another 20 or 30 years, there are “only” half a million abortions in the United States each year — all government-funded and protected by a fortress of rulings, regulations, laws, and judges. French, Charen, and other Never Trump pro-lifers might respond that they do not want surrender, just a strategic retreat to get rid of Trump, but they refuse to acknowledge the full cost of this retreat. As president, Biden would restore federal funding for overseas abortion promotion, and he has promised taxpayer funding for abortion on demand in the United States. He would choose judges who will read a maximalist abortion regime into the Constitution. He and congressional Democrats would preempt state and local restrictions on abortion and harass pro-life organizations, including religious groups, as part of an escalating culture war. A Biden presidency would reverse pro-life efforts toward abortion abolition. Charen nonetheless justifies her support for Biden on the grounds that, “Being pro-life is part of an overall approach to ethical questions. It’s wrong to take innocent life. But other things are immoral too. … Donald Trump is a daily, even hourly, assault on the very idea of morality.”  This hysteria is grotesque when set against the absolute immorality of abortion, which destroys the primordial basis of human life and relationships. Abortion responds to the dependence of a new human life with violence. It turns the interests of the mother, father, and child against each other. Instead of a self-giving love that nurtures life, abortion is selfishness culminating in death. Nothing Trump has done in office comes close to the moral atrocity of nearly 1 million abortions per year, which Biden promises to encourage and have us all pay for. Championing and funding that violence is far more corrupting to society than any oafishness, immorality, or incompetence of which Charen might accuse Trump. This corrupting effect is why the canard of making abortion unnecessary while keeping it legal is an illusion, and why decades of abortion on demand have not been the solution its advocates promised. Indeed, Americans are increasingly alone and childless, in large part because we have violently severed the elemental bonds of love that unite men and women with each other and their offspring. Biden’s Disqualifying Position This is the America of Biden and the Democratic Party’s radically pro-abortion regime. Biden has other personal and political sins, but his pro-abortion stance alone is disqualifying. In contrast to Charen, French does not overtly support the former vice president. Instead, he has reiterated that neither candidate has earned his vote, while adumbrating more reasons presidents don’t have much effect on abortion. French’s arguments are self-defeating, however. As he notes, most legislation against abortion is taking place in the states, rather than at the national level. These local efforts still undermine his case against Trump, for state-level regulations and restrictions on abortion are subject to review by the federal courts. Judges, and the president who picks them, are essential to state-led efforts against abortion. Trump’s judges have changed the legal battlefield. Despite the perfidy of the George W. Bush-appointed John Roberts, many abortion restrictions are being upheld throughout the courts. Some restrictions are going unchallenged because Planned Parenthood and its allies are litigating scared. For example, they have been reluctant to challenge many state bans on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. One of Trump’s judges even upheld closing all abortion facilities during the initial stage of the pandemic. The result is that pro-life laws are going into effect and abortion clinics are closing. These pro-life victories would not be happening if Hillary Clinton had been filling the courts with pro-abortion judges, as even French half-admits. The Results of Trump Derangement Thus, to maintain his anti-Trump position, French must minimize state-level efforts to reduce abortion, even though he had just praised them. He dismissively writes that even if Roe v. Wade were overturned, the permissive abortion regimes many states would retain means that “for the nation as a whole, the abortion rate would likely shrink by only 12.8 percent.” That would “only” save about 100,000 lives per year, and we might not even need to overturn Roe to achieve this; there is, for instance, only one embattled abortion clinic left in Missouri. Pushing abortion out of pro-life states would lower the overall abortion rate, despite the efforts of pro-abortion states to encourage “abortion tourism.” Furthermore, states eliminating elective abortion would invigorate the pro-life cause. French is correct that most Americans don’t really want abortion. He does not draw the obvious conclusion, which is that a coalition of states showing that abortion is neither inevitable nor necessary would have great persuasive power for the cause of life. These state efforts would also prepare the way for the federal action that will be needed for national abolition. The struggle to protect the unborn has been prolonged, our victories have been hard-won, and there is much still to do. But we have had victories, and there are more on the way, thanks to Republican legislatures, Trump judges, and the valiant work of grassroots pro-lifers. Throwing that away by handing political power back to those who want federally funded abortion on demand would be a suicidal, self-inflicted wound. It would literally be a deadly setback to our goals of abortion reduction and eventual abolition. President Trump is an unlikely pro-life hero, but we should rejoice in unexpected blessings, not reject them.

"45",45,"What We Talk About When We Talk About Abortion","Mena","Addie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013-11-06"," If you’ve ever taken a class in comparative literature, you learned why stories play such a critical role in cultures around the globe: stories are important not only for what truths they tell but also what they say about the culture from which they come. The tales we craft are essential for forming and shaping the society around us. That’s why we all should pay attention to a new storytelling campaign launched by abortion supporters, and consider what these stories say about all the rest of us. If pro-life advocates wish to explain their understanding of human life to our society, they must first understand what tales the other half is weaving before they can know what to say in response to the society that has learned to tolerate and even welcome abortion.  On October 28 in a Washington, D.C. coffeehouse, abortion activists gathered to share their personal experiences with abortion. “Stories are incredibly important,” explained Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America to a crowd of young urbanites, “because they allow the person dealing with the abstraction to sympathize with the character. Put yourself in her shoes.” Over the past few generations, Hogue continued, the narrative of women’s advancements have contained abortion as a major plot point, but abortion was presented as a tragic conflict. The conundrum facing abortion supporters is that they “want people to have this choice, but there are no happy endings” to stories containing abortion. Abortion Pride The event was part of the “1 in 3” campaign, which refers to one in three women having abortions during their lifetime. As the “1 in 3” site explains:  The 1 in 3 Campaign is a grassroots movement to start a new conversation about abortion—telling our stories, on our own terms. Together, we can end the stigma and shame women are made to feel about abortion. As we share our stories we begin to build a culture of compassion, empathy, and support for access to basic health care…
By encouraging women who have had abortions to end their silence, share their stories, and start a new and more personal conversation about abortion in our society, the 1 in 3 Campaign will help create a more enabling cultural environment for the policy and legal work of the abortion rights movement. Hogue told the crowd in D.C. that “people have got to believe that change is possible” when talking about the narratives surrounding abortion in the country, and that the stories they tell must have a different perspective if such change is going to happen. Abortion is only an unhappy ending for a woman, Hogue argued, “if you believe the woman’s story ends the moment she has an abortion.” “Just as our lives don’t start the moment we conceive, they don’t end the moment we decide to terminate a pregnancy,” she proclaimed. Hogue also emphasized to the young professionals and students present what it was they were fighting against. “Every good story that mobilizes needs a villain,” she said, and for those in favor of protecting abortion, that villain is the “silence and stigma” surrounding abortion, Hogue said.  Deb Hauser, president of Advocates for Youth and chief architect of the national “1 in 3” campaign, prefaced Hogue’s talk with a tale of her own. “This is a campaign across the country to break through the silence and the stigma,” she said, emphasizing that “these are complex stories and people can’t walk in our shoes.” Just as family legends are passed on from elder to child, “abortion is something that women share across the generations” Hauser said. By sharing tales of abortion in over 130 events in over 30 states and 100 college campuses, this project will place “women and their families at the center,” and women will “feel less isolated” by their abortion experience. Abortion “is what it is. It’s an 8-letter word that we should never be afraid to say,” cried the poet. This introduction served as a backdrop for the retelling of tales collected by Advocates for Youth from women across the country and women in the back room of that coffeeshop. They told of loneliness, relief, and the importance of ownership over their lives and ownership of their bodies. There were lamentations for the situations they found themselves in, praises for laws that allowed them to end their pregnancy and speculation as to why contraception failed when it was needed most. Speakers spoke to the shame and “catastrophe” of dealing with abortion and its aftermath, insisted that “no, it’s not murder”. They further revealed that when they think of abortion, they “think to the feelings of unwantedness” from growing up with an abusive and distant family. Hauser spoke first, telling her own story of how husband left her and her young son right before she discovered she was pregnant with a second child. Choosing to have an abortion “was the best choice given my circumstances”, she said. Another woman read a story of a couple who discovered their unborn child had disabling and deadly genetic defects. Aborting the child before it was born “was better than the pain” the child and the parents would face if they continued the pregnancy and gave birth to the child, she read. After the collected stories were read, some women shared their personal experiences with those in the room. They painted pictures of nuns in blue habits, clutching rosaries, and disapproving of their choice; and of parents who made their decision to abort a child knowledge within their families.They lamented the disapproval from family, friends and society and cited this disapproval as reasons for why they must push for acceptance of and pride in abortions. “I think first of the future future children whose parents did not want them,” said one commentator, who had been abused as a child. Abortion “is what it is. It’s an 8-letter word that we should never be afraid to say,” cried a poet. Telling Stories When we hear a story, we can only know what the storyteller tells us. We cannot know what details are omitted, what elements are exaggerated for emphasis and what is purely fictional. Still, when we encounter this narrow and crafted perspective, we often connect our own experiences and knowledge of reality to the experiences and vision portrayed in the tale. We weigh this new information, these new perspectives, against the knowledge we have previously gathered. By allowing these things we vicariously experience to interplay with our own, each new story has the opportunity to slightly alter our perception, to change our point of view. This is where Hogue and the others involved in the “1 in 3” campaign are correct: stories are incredibly important. And this is why pro-life advocates must both understand these stories and understand what they say about society if we wish to to change society’s narrative about abortion, the dignity of women, and the value of all persons — including the unborn. We must first try to understand them at face value: These are the stories of the women involved in the “1 in 3” campaign, and we cannot rewrite their tales for them. While many of the women expressed dismay and regret that they found themselves in difficult situations, the stories selected to be part of this campaign are clear in saying that they are grateful for their experience. Also constant among the stories chosen for this campaign is the assertion that others shamed and judged them because of their choices. We hear of stigma and suffering surrounding abortion, but not of the discrimination surrounding women who carried a pregnancy to term to the detriment of her career. We can also note what is missing from this group of tales — stories of regret for one’s abortion, stories of persons who were offered up for adoption, stories of individuals who survived an abortion attempt. We hear of stigma and suffering surrounding abortion, but not of the discrimination surrounding women who carried a pregnancy to term to the detriment of her career, of the girl who gave birth out of wedlock, or of the couple who faced judgment and hardship because they decided to give birth to a child with developmental or physical disabilities rather than kill it. What these stories say, and what they don’t, offers us a window into the trends that define our whole society—a society of which both the pro-life and pro-choice movements are a part. Choice Over Everything The society described by these stories is first and foremost a society in which people are defined by their choices. People in this view of society are judged and defined by what they have done, and value is a characteristic conferred by the reception of one’s choices, rather than innately present. The imperialism of choice in this world is merciless. One misstep will define you, and it will follow you, and determine who you are. This means that affirmation of choice is critical for one’s value as a person, and the ability to have complete control over one’s life, circumstances and choices is necessary to ensure one’s own dignity. It is your body, and you must do with it what you want, lest you surrender your worth as a person. The imperialism of choice in this world is merciless. One misstep will define you, and it will follow you, and determine who you are. There is no room for forgiveness, only acceptance; there is no path for mercy, only a judgment that is in your favor, rather than against. For this reason, a nun praying outside of a clinic for an end to abortion cannot be merciful, because there is only judgment of a person as a sum of their choices, rather than a love of a person in spite of mistakes. Because choice comes with such a high cost, individuals are “pathologically terrified of risk.” In the society imagined in these pieces, where one wrong step will define you for lifeand this reality is coupled with circumstances outside of one’s control, thechoices you make will define you for life. Then any unknown, especially one as large as a child, is too much of a burden to bear without the proper planning and sculpting of the child’s life to fit the vision of yourself that you wish to create. In this case, an “unwanted” or “imperfect” child poses a threat not only to what a person does, but who that person fundamentally is and their value within society. In such a world, demanding to have complete autonomy over all aspects of abortion—from its availability, to the procedures, to how society judges it—becomes an understandable, if unfortunate, response to the perceived threat the unknown and uncontrollable place on human dignity. This is a vision of the world that we who are against abortion are part of—knowingly or not—and a perspective to which we must be able to respond if we are to be able to speak to the “1 in 3” women who have had an abortion, or to anyone who can see and sympathize with their point of view. If we want to change the dialogue on abortion we must listen carefully to the “1 in 3” campaign. We must place ourselves in their shoes and we must tell our own stories- and help those stories shape the reality we live in. We must show a world in which dignity is inherent and persists in spite of any mistake and outside of the just consequences of them. We must be able to speak to a society in which people’s dignity is determined by their choices, where disapproval for the wrong choice tolls the death knell for one’s own worth: instead we must show a world in which dignity is inherent and persists in spite of any mistake and outside of the just consequences of them. We must place the story of “women and their families at the center” of our society, and show mercy and respect to those who are less-than-ideal because of circumstance, choice, or both. We must take the risk of opening ourselves to stories from all walks of life—even stories that excuse the abominable—because they offer all of us valuable insight into world in which we live, and the chance to love and understand the person with that perspective is a greater gift than liability. We who wish to protect the dignity of all persons born and unborn, mother, father and child, “have got to believe that change is possible,” and we should act accordingly. We have got to show and tell others that we can have “happy endings” in spite of mistakes and tragedy. And yes, the wrongs that we commit and the evil committed against us are not the end—because our life’s worth is more than the mere sum of actions or of their ramifications.

"46",46,"How To Win The Debate On Abortion In 12 Clear Counterpoints","Bartow","Eleanor",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-06-24"," The Supreme Court has overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling and now the issue of abortion will be part of our national debate as much as ever. Here are some of the many reasons the usual arguments in favor of abortion are wrong.



Pro-Abortion Claim: The government should stay out of people’s private lives. This is a woman’s choice, not anyone else’s, and a women’s rights issue.



Why It’s Wrong: Laws often restrict an individual’s rights, including the right to hurt another person or infringe upon another’s rights. In taking the life of an unborn child, a woman is taking away the most basic of all rights.



An unborn child is not part of a woman’s body, but a separate, individual human being with his or her own rights. A child is not the mother’s property, just as parents are legal guardians of children but not the children’s owners and are not allowed to abuse their children.



Pro-Abortion Claim: When most abortions take place, in early pregnancy, a fertilized egg is just a mass of cells, not a human being. It doesn’t feel pain.



Why It’s Wrong: A new life begins at conception and should not be destroyed by human interference.



First, one-third of abortions take place after nine weeks of pregnancy. Yet from the moment of conception, the zygote has its own unique DNA structure, is alive and growing, and is equipped to become a mature human being.



Six weeks after conception, the unborn child’s heartbeat is detectable — but began beating before then. At week three, neural development begins. At week four, the eye, ear, and respiratory systems begin to form. At week six, the mouth and lips are present. At week seven, the embryo looks like a baby.



The beginning of life could be defined by many different points of development — fertilization (the fusion of the nuclei of the sperm and egg cell), implantation, the first movement, heartbeat, or brain waves, consciousness, or birth. Any point you choose could be just a day’s difference between life and death for an unborn child. 



Drawing the line at the point of viability is also problematic — that point will continue to get earlier in the pregnancy as medical advances create better means of keeping the unborn alive outside the womb; indeed, viability is now weeks earlier than it was when Roe was decided. 



Yet the unborn child did not become a person because he could survive due to modern science. Newborns are not technically viable either, as they cannot survive on their own. By this logic, we should consider it acceptable to kill newborns.



Nor does the absence of pain at early stages make it moral to kill the unborn child, just as it would not with an adult. Abortion can involve sucking a baby out of the uterus (or as Planned Parenthood puts it, “the suction machine is turned on and the uterus is gently emptied”), causing a stillbirth by injecting a salt solution into the uterus, and other horrors.



Pro-Abortion Claim: Abortion can’t be a crime against nature if fertilized eggs are spontaneously miscarried in nature.



Why It’s Wrong: The occurrence of an event in nature does not justify deliberately mimicking that event. The elderly die of natural causes, but that doesn’t make it right to kill them. And many miscarriages are associated with extra or missing chromosomes.



Pro-Abortion Claim: Birth control isn’t 100 percent effective. When it fails, women have been responsible and need abortion as another method to avoid having a child.



Why It’s Wrong: Seven percent of women report having sex without using some form of birth prevention in the past three months, not including 8 percent who have such sex but are seeking pregnancy or already pregnant. Many people who use birth control do not do so effectively. 



The pregnancy prevention rate of birth-control pills used consistently and correctly is 99 percent. For that small portion who correctly used birth control but it did not prevent conception, they have to accept the risks of sexual activity, which include a child. Contraception is free with most health insurance plans and easily available.



Pro-Abortion Claim: In the case of rape or incest, when a woman was an innocent victim of an involuntary act, she should not be forced to carry a child. She would be forced to suffer even more.



Why It’s Wrong: One percent of women say they want an abortion because they were raped, and less than 0.5 percent say they are pregnant as a result of incest. Even in such very rare cases, an unborn child should not be killed because of another person’s evil deed. The pregnant woman needs love and support, not more trauma.



An estimated 800,000 abortions take place in the United States each year. Common reasons given for seeking an abortion are that a child would disrupt the mother’s education (38 percent), interfere with job or career (38 percent), or be unaffordable (73 percent). About half of respondents said they didn’t want to be a single mom or were having relationship problems.



About a third said they didn’t want any more kids; 25 percent said they didn’t want people to know they had sex or got pregnant; 32 percent said they weren’t ready for a child; and 22 percent didn’t feel mature enough to raise children. More than half of those seeking abortion have had at least one previous birth.



Pro-Abortion Claim: Minors are too young for the responsibilities of parenthood.



Why It’s Wrong: About 3 percent of females who get abortions are younger than 18, and 8 percent are 18 to 19 years old. Parents of minors should teach their children about the consequences of sex, the benefits of abstinence, and the limitations of contraception, among other things: Sex can lead to pregnancy and if it does the unborn child should not be killed. 



Accepting truths that you don’t like is part of maturity, and sex should be reserved for mature people ready to care for a child.



Pro-Abortion Claim: If abortion were made legal only in cases of rape or incest, women would lie.



Why It’s Wrong: The court system could settle the truth of their claims and more reporting of rape and incest would help bring perpetrators to justice.



Pro-Abortion Claim: Abortion is safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.



Why It’s Wrong: Even if abortion is safer than pregnancy, that doesn’t make it right. But with modern medicine, the death risks for both abortion and pregnancy are very low.



Pro-Abortion Claim: It would be better for abnormal fetuses to be aborted than to live with poor health or a disability.



Why It’s Wrong: In the case of the small minority of fetuses with a potentially life-threatening abnormality, a natural death may result, but, if not, the child should be given the benefit of the doubt, not be killed. It’s wrong to kill disabled people for their disabilities.



Pro-Abortion Claim: If abortion were outlawed, women would just get riskier, dangerous abortions.



Why It’s Wrong: People break other laws with repercussions too, but we don’t avoid that outcome by not making those laws. Outlawing abortion would save millions of unborn babies’ lives.



It is difficult to know the number of abortions resulting in death before abortion was legalized, because many illegal abortions went unreported. Education is the best alternative, so women know the risks of trying to get an abortion illegally, how to effectively use birth control, and how they can receive assistance as mothers.



Pro-Abortion Claim: The right to an abortion has led to a more prosperous society as women have continued in their careers and low-income couples have not been burdened with an additional expense. Abortion has reduced the child abuse and crime that arise from unwanted children.



Why It’s Wrong: Abortion has been bad for our society, as it devalues human life and the fulfillment that only family and children, not a job, can provide. If women want to put careers first or can’t afford children, they should practice abstinence or correctly use birth control and make plans for accepting the consequences if that fails.



If women are poor and do have children, the government provides assistance. Adoption is also a better option than killing an unborn child. Many loving, screened, financially stable parents are waiting to adopt babies.



As for whether studies prove that abortion has reduced crime or abuse, this is a dangerous line of argument. Should we abort babies of certain groups more likely to be criminals?



Pro-Abortion Claim: A woman has a right to privacy, as recognized by the Supreme Court, and to make her own decisions about her life and happiness.



Why It’s Wrong: Roe v. Wade was so strongly resisted because it was a deeply flawed decision.



The legal arguments are lengthy, but the short answer is that the constitutional right to liberty simply does not grant the right to kill another person, and an unborn child is a person. 



Abortion is a deeply divisive issue, and about half of Americans consider themselves pro-life and half call themselves pro-choice. Overturning Roe will not end abortion rights but return the issue to the states, allowing for a more democratic process — the debate will continue, but the truth remains the same.

"47",47,"Why Abortion Never Works Onscreen Even Though Hollywood Desperately Wants It To","Bufkin","Ellie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-04-22"," Abortion has recently become a tremendously popular topic in movies and television. Movies like “Gosnell” and “Unplanned” attempt to show the ugly reality of the abortion industry, highlighting the dangers to the mothers, the unscrupulous practices of the clinics, and—most importantly—exposing the reality that an abortion extinguishes a human life. These movies absolutely have an axe to grind, and their impact is undeniable. Meanwhile, much of Hollywood keeps trying to use abortion as something light and funny.  Outside of films that are specifically exposing the abortion industry, however, abortion has also found its way into the narratives of movies and shows that use it as entertainment and even fodder for jokes. Sitcoms like “Shrill,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and “GLOW” all featured characters choosing to get an abortion in the wake of an unplanned pregnancy. In these instances, the shows’ mission is quite clear: to advance the idea that ending the life of an unborn child is a casual medical procedure. Why shouldn’t we joke about it? Abortion Portrayed as No Big Deal According to the shows’ narratives, the women who choose to abort are modern, strong feminists. Their babies are disposable because—to them—they are just inconvenient clumps of cells that can so easily be flushed away in the name of empowerment. Although previously considered taboo, abortion did appear as a dark plot point in many films and shows over the years. Famously, in “Dirty Dancing,” a character has an illegal abortion at a dirty clinic and becomes infected. The whole affair is ugly, deeply emotional, and certainly no means to add levity or romance to the situation.  In “High Fidelity,” a character chooses to have an abortion in an act of desperation after the failure of her relationship. Later in the movie, she bursts into tears when she is casually asked by her ex-boyfriend if she ever wanted to have children. There was nothing casual about these storylines. It’s the recent call to celebrate abortion as a woke rite of passage from movements like #ShoutYourAbortion that has changed the entertainment landscape. Abortion on film used to be quite uncomfortable; it was meant to be. It was a way to make the audience feel intense loss with the characters. It set a tone of tragedy and peril. However, in last week’s episode of the HBO comedy “Veep,” a character chooses to have an abortion after deciding the baby’s father was too immature to date. Taking a cue from other recent comedy arcs, the show treated the entire arc like one big punch line. The character, Amy, even refers to her unborn child as a “baby” before she ultimately chooses to end his or her life. “Veep” is known for its quick-witted, sharp-tongued writing and has consistently claimed that no subject is off limits for jokes. Staying true to their word, the trip to the abortion clinic included a confrontation with pro-life protestors, jokes about not wanting to see an ultrasound, and telling someone on the phone that her schedule was just “scraped clean.”  In reality, most fans of Amy and her unborn child’s father, Dan, were hoping for a baby. Progressive filmmakers, showrunners, and writers may have set their sights on pushing casual abortion as a fan-favored plot choice, but they may be in store for a cold reality. Most fans want a happy ending; they want to see the baby. Hollywood’s New Favorite Plot Twist Being pro-abortion is not new for Hollywood. Replacing a bouncing happy baby with a joke-filled trip to the abortion clinic is. Even in a 2017 episode of the HBO show “Girls,” created by noted abortion enthusiast Lena Dunham, the main character becomes unexpectedly pregnant and ultimately decides against an abortion. Perhaps this creative choice was meant to show how her character developed and matured over the series run, but more likely, it was written this way because who wants to see a baby die on TV? “Girls” had a smaller story in an earlier season when a lesser character has a very casual abortion, barely mentioning it to her boyfriend after she returns from the procedure. The boyfriend has an emotional outburst in a state of complete disbelief, and is never able to look at her the same way. They break up soon after. This isn’t the epilogue to abortion that abortion-is-power feminists would have you believe. Pro-abortion people want everyone to think abortion is nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing to feel sad about. The fact is that abortion is an awful, ugly tragedy in any situation, no matter if you believe it should be legal or not. “Awful, ugly, and tragic” aren’t exactly the adjectives that match a happy conclusion. There is also no adorable, crying baby to bring all the characters together at the end of the story. There are many examples of otherwise very liberal shows and movies choosing the pro-life plot, simply because killing babies does not make a good story. In “Sex and the City,” Miranda becomes pregnant with no intention of keeping her baby, and viewers were led to believe that she has gone through with the abortion until the very end of the episode. In a classic tear-jerking moment, we find out that she is keeping the baby. Another character goes through the episode reliving her long-ago abortion, wondering what life would be like with her child, reflecting on a choice she cannot unmake. For a show that was all about glamorizing carefree sex, they had a decidedly unglamorous take on abortion, handled with nuance. In “Juno,” a charming teen becomes pregnant while still attending high school, and even plans to have an abortion. However, she finds the abortion clinic so offputting, and is partially persuaded by a protester outside, that she decides to continue her pregnancy and explore adoption. Similarly, “Knocked Up” finds the humor in an unplanned pregnancy, even showing how the developing baby starts to change and soften the parents before she is even born. The fact is that the reality of abortion simply does not match the pro-abortion belief that it is easy and casual. Creating a story where a fictional character has no feelings about her abortion does not reflect reality. Writing snarky jokes does nothing to conceal the image of a character in stirrups at an abortion clinic having a tiny life sucked out of her. No matter how much fans believe that abortion should be legal, they’ll never root for a character to not have the baby.

"48",48,"Abortion Is Murder, But That Doesn’t Mean We Must Execute Women","Payton","Bre",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-04-20"," In the most recent episode of the podcast “The Fifth Column,” the co-hosts and guests engaged each other on whether pro-lifers believe women who’ve had an abortion should face criminal punishment. Earlier this month, longtime National Review writer Kevin Williamson was briefly hired and then quickly fired by The Atlantic after backlash for his controversial views on abortion. Williamson, who was born as an unplanned pregnancy prior to Roe vs. Wade and subsequently adopted, is vehemently pro-life.  In a few tweets and a podcast interview, Williamson, said he was “absolutely willing to see abortion treated like regular homicide under the criminal code.” He separately contended that capital punishment for such an offense should include hanging — while reiterating his opposition to capital punishment generally. ‘Baby Murderers Sound Like the worst!’ Williamson’s remarks prompted prominent feminists to lose their minds, and spurred some to insist that a majority of pro-lifers really do want to criminally punish women who decide to abort their children. This discussion was reiterated in the Fifth Column podcast episode, and I’ve transcribed some highlights of the conversation below. All of the participants described themselves as pro-choice. “If you really think that your mothers are murdering your own children, then you would say ‘Yeah that person deserves to be hung,'” said Kat Timpf, of National Review. “I bet you that a lot of people agree with him, but just don’t want to say so. If you really believe that that’s murder, then why wouldn’t you agree with that?” Matt Welch, editor-at-large at Reason magazine, brought up that Donald Trump had called for women who’ve had abortions to be punished in early 2016, prompting many pro-lifers to publicly distance themselves from the then-candidate’s comments.  “The natural logical point of this, if you do treat them [unborn babies] as humans, is to charge them [the mothers] with capital murder,” said Ben Dreyfuss, of Mother Jones. “So Kevin Williamson, in that scenario, is being more honest,” Welch said. “Which is why pro-lifers are wrong,” Dreyfuss quipped. “And so stupid! It highlights how stupid they are!” “Abortion is yucky!” Welch said.  “The first time I went in and I looked at this gummy bear blob inside of my wife who didn’t have all of its appendages yet, but I heard that heartbeat,” said Kmele Foster, a partner at Freethink, whose wife recently had a baby. “It f***ed me up a little bit.” “I think it’s very easy for a man to be pro-life, you can just Tristan Thompson the s**t outta that,” Timpf said, in reference to Khloe Kardashian, who recently had a baby with a man who reportedly cheated on her while she was pregnant. “If you are someone who is pro-life, and you really do believe that these women are committing murder, which I don’t, and if you really do believe that — they’re literally murdering babies, why wouldn’t you hang ’em?” she said. “Baby murderers sound like the worst!” “I think what this proves, though, is that conservatives say that abortion is murder, but this proved that they don’t actually really see it as murder,” she continued. “Because if they did see it as murder, they would have been behind Kevin Williamson 100 percent.” “It’s entirely possible for someone to have like a perspective that is somewhat nuanced about an issue like this,” Foster said. “We are not having a conversation about abortion in America, just in the same way that we are not, generally speaking, having a conversation about gun rights in America,” Welch said. “One side emotes, the other side emotes. They know the middle has been actually decided by the Supreme Court.” Yes, Abortion Is Murder By definition, a successful abortion results in the end of an unborn child’s life. A woman goes into an abortion clinic pregnant, undergoes the procedure, and emerges without the baby. The baby’s body is disposed of. When a pregnancy is further along, an abortion is a brutal procedure that requires a doctor to literally rip apart a baby in the womb with teethed clamps. That is no exaggeration. You can watch a video with an animated diagram illustrating the procedure in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester here. “Killing a baby at any stage of pregnancy, for any reason at all, is wrong,” former abortionist Anthony Levatino says in the video outlining a first-trimester abortion. Science shows unequivocally that life begins at conception. At the moment an egg is fertilized, it becomes genetically unique. It is no longer part of the mother or part of the father, but a third entity, right at that moment. Thus terminating a fertilized egg is by definition ending a life. It is not stopping a potential life from forming, it is killing a person whose life has already begun. It is wrong. But mothers who have done this should not face the death penalty. The central goal of the pro-life movement is not to add to the death count, but to try to save as many lives as possible. To say that hanging women who’ve had abortions is necessarily the logical end of the pro-life movement is false and illogical. Pro-Life Is A Movement Of Compassion and Redemption If you’ve ever been to the annual March for Life, chances are you’ve seen women holding signs saying they regret their abortions. Or you’ve met former abortionists and abortion clinic workers who now march for every child’s right to life. Pro-lifers embrace people like these who have participated in murdering children because these people have repented and changed. And that is ultimately the whole goal. The pro-life movement is a movement of forgiveness and redemption. The goal is to empower women and welcome all, regardless of what they’ve done in the past. The whole point is redemption for tough situations. Pro-lifers celebrate, accept, and work to heal post-abortive women. It’s a hallmark of the movement. Many prominent pro-life leaders are post-abortive women or former abortion workers who’ve repented from the evil things they’ve done and seek to save the lives of others. Abby Johnson, a former abortion worker at Planned Parenthood, left the industry in 2009 to start And Then There Were None, an organization that seeks to help abortion workers get out of the industry. Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United For Life, had an abortion at 19 years old. Four abortion clinic workers held her down and she was forced to undergo the procedure after she changed her mind and no longer wanted to go through with it. “I said, ‘I can’t do this,” she told CBN. “This is wrong and I feel really bad about this. Just let me go. You can keep the money.’ And they shouted for more people and I had four people holding me down. One – a nurse – and a staff member on each arm. The doctor aborted my child. I’m screaming. That’s not choice.” “It was not pro-woman, it was not pro-me,” she continued. “They didn’t care about me, they didn’t respect my opinion. They were just in-‘n-out. They wanted me gone and they wanted my baby gone.” This traumatizing experience and the sadness she later felt prompted Foster to fight for the unborn. The organization she helms fights to pass laws that restrict the practice of abortion in states across the country. These women ought not to be shamed for their past deeds nor should they face capital punishment. Their stories are now a part of a movement that aims to stop the barbaric and evil practice of abortion — a movement that seeks to inform and educate women through organizations like ATTWN and the Human Coalition, which empower women and provide them resources to chose options outside of abortion and the abortion industry. Women Are Victims Too Yes, abortion is murder. No, women who have aborted their children should not be punished. Women who’ve undergone an abortion procedure are victims of abortion too. They’re victims of the abortion industry and the “pro-choice” movement, which purposefully tells women lies about the lives they hold in their wombs. Thus many women who abort their children do not know what they are doing. They are victims of sexual assaulters seeking to get rid of evidence, and they are victims of abortion doctors — some of whom keep filthy clinics and have killed women on the table and infected them with STDs. Post-abortive women are victims of a society that demeans a woman’s decision to carry her child to term and either mother the child or choose adoption. Post-abortive women are victims of all of the societal ills that have contributed to their journey to the abortion clinic — poverty, a failing public school system, and an abortion-industrial complex that routinely lies to women about what the procedure is and its risks. About 76 percent of abortive women are either poor or low income, and about 40 – 75 percent of women undergo an abortion due to economic reasons. Bottom line: women who get abortions usually are not doing so because they want to (of course, there are exceptions). By and large, women seeking an abortion are doing so out of desperation. Abortion is not an act of empowerment, it’s a decision a woman makes when she feels backed into a corner. This is underscored by the often dismal conditions at abortion clinics.  Many women are manipulated or outright forced into abortions, which reduces their culpability. In Alabama, a clinic failed to comply with state laws that require clinics to report to authorities whenever an underage girl seeks an abortion. A 13-year-old girl who did not speak English came to the clinic seeking an abortion. The age of consent in Alabama is 16, which makes this girl a victim of statutory rape. Her story was not documented, neither did the clinic ask for the baby’s father’s name, another state requirement. The truth was only revealed after a health inspection two years later. This story isn’t at all unique. Planned Parenthood clinics in six states were willing to cover up sexual abuse, according to a Live Action investigation. Women deserve better than the abortion industrial complex. Women who have aborted their child do not deserve to be punished, as they are victims too.

"49",49,"Flyover Democrats Show Their Allegiance Is To Abortion Radicalism Over Constituents","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-08"," State Democrat leaders appear to care more about abortion than they do the Constitution or their local citizens. This became clear after the Supreme Court overturned Roe and Casey last month in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, stressing that the court was returning the authority to regulate abortion to the people and their elected representatives, where it rightly belongs.



“The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations, upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting,” the Dobbs court explained, adding “that is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand.”



The Lawsuits



The abortion lobby, however, has no intent of allowing citizens to have a say and proved that point by promptly filing lawsuits in four states, Utah, Kentucky, Idaho, and Mississippi, arguing that a right to abortion exists in those states’ constitutions. Prior to the Dobbs decision dropping last month — a decision that ruled solely that there was no federal constitutional right to abortion — abortion apologists had likewise filed lawsuits in Florida and Michigan in anticipation of the Supreme Court overturning Roe and Casey, arguing those states’ respective constitutions contained a right to abortion.



Just as five justices in Roe commandeered from the people the authority to regulate abortion through the “exercise of raw judicial power,” the abortion lobby demands the justices of the states’ highest courts do the same. While Dobbs accelerated the left’s litigation efforts, abortion apologists have been turning to activist state court judges for decades, seeking declarations by those individual high courts that their state constitutions compel an abortion-on-demand regime.



To date, this strategy has succeeded in least nine states, with the highest courts have declared that a state constitutional right to abortion exists — and a “right” that far surpasses the framework that previously controlled in Roe and Casey. 



For instance, in Alaska, based on a supposed state constitutional right to abortion, courts have struck down legislation requiring parental consent and parental notification, Furthermore, under the Alaska constitution, according to the state courts, there is a right to taxpayer-funded abortion. California did almost the exact same thing. Florida courts had similarly declared parental-consent and parental-notice laws unconstitutional under its the state constitution. 



In Iowa, the state’s constitution was held to invalidate a 72-hour waiting period, while the courts in Montana, declared unconstitutional the state’s law requiring only physicians to perform abortions. “Tennessee struck down informed consent and waiting period” provisions, while Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New Jersey courts have held that their respective constitutions require taxpayer funding of abortions. Massachusetts also struck a parental-consent statute and New Jersey a parental-notice law. “All of those statutes and regulations would have been upheld under Casey, but were struck down under independent state constitutional analyses.”



A Meeting with Washington



The abortion lobby’s success in installing an abortion-on-demand regime through litigation and activist justices is not limited to blue states, however. In 2019, two abortion providers prevailed using that same strategy in conservative Kansas, when in Hodes and Nauser v. Schmidt, they argued the state’s ban on dismemberment abortions — those in which live human beings are killed by being ripped apart limb by limb — violated the state constitution. The Kansas Supreme Court, which included four justices appointed by Democrat Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a supporter of legal abortion, agreed and held that the state constitution provided a right to abortion.



Kansans, “who have consistently elected one of the most pro-life and pro-active state legislatures in this country,” immediately moved to counter the judicial activism that led to the discovery of a right to abortion buried in the state’s 150-plus-year-old constitution by seeking to amend it. And on August 2, 2022, citizens of the midwestern state will vote on the Value Them Both Amendment, which, if passed, will amend the Kansas constitution to clarify that there is no state right to abortion and that the people of Kansas, through their elected state legislators, retain the right to pass laws to regulate abortion.



Passage of the Value Them Both Amendment would not dictate abortion policy but would return to the Kansas Legislature the authority to regulate abortion that the state Supreme Court had wrested away from it in Hodes. In turn, Kansans, through their exercise of the franchise and the election of lawmakers to represent them, could decide the permissibility of abortion and any limitations on it.



Unsurprisingly, the abortion lobby opposes the Value Them Both Amendment because it knows Kansans would never vote for the extreme abortion regime forced upon the state by a handful of state Supreme Court justices. Laws establishing waiting period or parental-notification requirements — laws declared unconstitutional under other state constitutions — are solidly mainstream. Likewise, voters overwhelmingly oppose using tax dollars to pay for abortions, but again, under the reasoning of Hodes, the state must pay for abortions.



While the abortion lobby opposes passage of the Value Them Both Amendment, logically Kansan legislators should strongly support its passage because it would return the authority to make the laws to the legislative branch. Top Kansan Democrat legislators oppose the Value Them Both Amendment, however, demonstrating that they put abortion above the proper functioning of their representative democracy.



Top Kansan Democrat legislators also value abortion more than state’s rights and federalism, as demonstrated by the virtual gathering eight leading Democrat lawmakers made to D.C. last month to coordinate with White House officials on their opposition to the Value Them Both Amendment. Kansas Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, House Minority Whip Stephanie Clayton, Senate Minority Whip Pat Pettey, House Minority Caucus Chair Barbara Ballard, Senate Agenda Chair Marci Francisco, and Reps. Sydney Carlin, Gail Finney, and Christina Haswood all joined a meeting with the Biden administration’s Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein and Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Chavez Rodriguez.



While few details were released about the meeting, a readout of the event made clear the focus concerned the upcoming vote on the proposed amendment to Kansas’s constitution. But what business is that of the White House? State legislators properly focused on their role as representatives of Kansans should disdain federal encroachment in matters of state law. That the top Democrat state legislators seek the Biden administration’s involvement tells their constituents everything they need to know about where the priorities of those lawmakers lie: with ensuring Kansas’s extreme abortion regime remains unchecked.



It is not merely their recent virtual brainstorming session with D.C. insiders that exposed the skewed priorities of these lawmakers. Rather, Kansas Democrats serving in the state House and Senate revealed they put the national party over their local constituents. 



“Not one Democrat, including those who hold themselves out as pro-life, voted in favor of the Value Them Both Amendment,” Elizabeth Kirk, a researcher and lecturer at Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America and director of the Center for Law and the Human Person, told The Federalist.



Kirk, who testified before the Kansas Legislature during hearings on the proposed constitutional amendment, stressed the irony of the situation. “Many of the same legislators who voted in favor of the dismemberment abortion ban voted against placing the Value Them Both Amendment on the ballot, when all the amendment does is return the power to the legislative branch to regulate abortion.” Kirk added that for Kansas’s supposedly pro-life Democrats to abandon their principles shows just how strong the allegiance to abortion is to the party.



On August 2, 2022, ordinary Kansans will show whether they share that allegiance when they decide the fate of the Value Them Both Amendment. And while they may not realize it, they will likely also be forecasting the future of federalism and representative democracy when it comes to abortion. For where Kansas goes, so too likely will the country.



This article has been revised to note that the meeting about how to kill babies was held virtually, not in person.

"50",50,"5 Lies Abortion Supporters Spread About Overturning Roe And How To Counter Them","Marshall","Robert","G.",NA,NA,NA,"2022-05-16"," The pro-abortion machine has been working overtime to churn out lies about preborn babies and laws designed to protect them. Just Wednesday, after a bipartisan majority in the U.S. Senate defeated the legislature’s most radical abortion bill in history, pro-aborts on Capitol Hill and in the corporate media were declaring that “Republicans” (in fact a bipartisan majority that included Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin) had used the “filibuster” (rather than a simple 51-49 vote) to defeat the bill.



The lying started more than 50 years ago with Norma McCorvey of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. McCorvey later admitted “she had fabricated her account of being raped by three men and a woman in 1969 because she had hoped to circumvent a 100-year-old Texas law that banned abortions except when the woman’s life was in danger,” as The New York Times reported.



Here are five of many more Roe lies to be aware of, along with ways to counter them.



1. Reversing Roe Will Put Women in Jail for Abortions



Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut claimed last Sunday that the leaked Supreme Court decision means “women and doctors are going to be sent to jail immediately when this opinion becomes a reality.” 



But Murphy, an attorney, failed to explain that prior to Roe, when abortion was illegal in nearly every state, women weren’t being rounded up in jails for having abortions. Who would even lobby for such laws? Abortionists might get jail time, as “legal” abortionist Kermit Gosnell did in Pennsylvania, but women were not prosecuted or sent to jail even for self-abortion. 



As Villanova University law professor Joseph Dellapenna noted, in the 19th and 20th centuries, “Courts rationalized their view of women as victims of abortion … by declaring that a woman ‘was not deemed able to assent to an unlawful act against herself.’ This attitude was reinforced by the reality that generally no conviction of the abortionist could be obtained without the testimony of the woman who underwent the abortion.” 



Dellapenna also pointed out that states like New York “enacted immunity statutes … to protect women from prosecution if they would testify against their abortionists.”  



2. Women Will be Prosecuted for Self-Abortion if Roe Is Reversed



Attorney Paul Linton performed exhaustive case review background work on the actual practice of prosecuting abortionists in the United States. He could not find even “one reported case from any State, prior to Roe, in which a woman was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced for inducing her own abortion, or for consenting to an abortion performed upon her by a third party.” 



There were only two reported abortion cases, he found, “in which a woman was even charged for having had an abortion.” In Pennsylvania, a woman took a drug to produce abortion, but the trial judge refused to enter the jury’s guilty finding because “the statute was not intended to apply to the woman.” 



The order was affirmed on appeal. A Texas case from 1922 notes that a woman was indicted, but there was no record that the woman was ever tried or convicted and sentenced.



3. Women Will be Prosecuted for Miscarriage  



Abortion advocates also claim that women who miscarry could be criminally prosecuted. Pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation can result from non-controlled diabetes, infections, hormone conditions, uterine or cervix problems, or thyroid disease. These have nothing to do with intentional, induced abortion. Miscarriage occurs in 26 percent of all pregnancies “and up to 10% of clinically recognized pregnancies.”



Paul Wohlers noted in The Washington Post in 1981 that the term “miscarriage” in some older state statutes referred to induced abortion. But after a thorough search of state abortion prosecutions from the mid-1800s, he concluded that “In no case was a spontaneous miscarriage made the object of criminal investigation or prosecution.”     



Further, a prosecutor would have great difficulty convincing a judge or jury that a particular early miscarriage (before 20 weeks) resulted from an intentional action of the woman. It would be nearly impossible for a criminal prosecutor to procure the body (corpus delicti) of a miscarried child to initiate a criminal trial, to prove a defendant intentionally caused a miscarriage. 



One pro-abortion group claimed “There’s no medical way to tell the difference between a miscarriage and a medication abortion,” in an attempt to argue that victims of miscarriage could be prosecuted. But that very fact means no prosecutor could thus prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the child’s death was due to abortion.



4. Reversing Roe Will Criminalize Pill and IUD Use



Forbes Magazine last week suggested that reversing Roe will lead to birth control pills being outlawed because “defining the life of an ‘unborn child’ as starting at fertilization or conception … would affect common birth control methods.” But users of IUDs or the Pill were never prosecuted under the criminal abortion laws that were in place prior to Roe, so why would they be prosecuted if Roe is reversed? Most of the abortion laws prior to Roe defined the unborn child’s life as beginning at fertilization or conception. 



Harriet Pilpel, Planned Parenthood’s lawyer, filed an amicus brief in 1971 noting that state criminal abortion laws had not “made any effort to outlaw the use of the intrauterine device which may in fact function to prevent implantation after fertilization has occurred.” 



Pilpel’s testimony before Congress in 1976 explained one practical reason why women had not been prosecuted for using drugs or devices that prevented pregnancy after fertilization: “Since it is not possible scientifically … to determine either when fertilization or implantation occurs … it would be impossible in cases of early pregnancies to know when and whether it was being violated.” 



Further, as eminently principled pro-life advocate and late Notre Dame law professor Charles Rice wrote, “Early abortifacients are beyond the effective reach of the law. It will usually be impossible to prove that life was terminated in an early abortion; prosecution for abortion therefore would be practically impossible.”



“Since ‘contraceptive’ drugs are licensed for legitimate uses, it is practically impossible to prevent their use for abortion,” he continued. “The legal obliteration of the distinction between contraception and abortion has put chemical abortion beyond the practical reach of the law.” 



5. ‘The Unborn Have Never Been Recognized in the Law as Persons’ 



This lie comes from Justice Henry Blackmun in the Roe decision itself. But in footnote 34 of Roe, Justice Harry Blackmun cited Eugene Quay’s article, “Justifiable Abortion — Medical and Legal Foundations,” which excerpted laws from 19 states and Washington, D.C., all of which classified abortion as manslaughter or second-degree murder, or had similar penalties for such. Quay also included excerpts from 24 state laws prohibiting abortion, all of which used the words “child” or “children,” which can only mean a living human being, a person.   



Justice Alito cited Eugene Quay’s same article on page 23 of his working brief.  



At the time Roe was decided in 1973, all states had either restricted or prohibited abortion. Forty-three states and the District of Columbia banned abortion because the child was fully human. Even radically pro-abortion President Joe Biden couldn’t help admitting that the subject of an abortion is indeed a “child.”



More than 63 million children have had their lives legally taken by abortion since 1973 under Roe. Isn’t it past time that the Supreme Court, which has reversed itself at least 232 times since 1808, according to the Library of Congress, at least let citizens have a say in whether this dreadful practice deserves to stand?

"51",51,"What If We Could Reduce Abortions Without Changing Public Opinion?","Humphrey","Christopher",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-03-14"," Michael New and I are engaged in a discussion (here and here) on what has brought down abortion rates from their heights in the early 1980s to 18.8 per hundred live births in 2015, a figure lower than that of 1973, the year Roe v. Wade was passed. Despite his claims, I am not “downplaying” the role of education and legislative reform in this: my intention is to kindle interest in what I think is driving down those rates––the proliferation of pregnancy help centers––and to encourage their support. Education and legislative reform have their place, and are no doubt making a contribution where they are found, but we have no strong evidence that either are driving this decline. When we advertise pregnancy help, as we have done in Pittsburgh, we see the ratios fall farther, which inclines one to think that the key role of these centers has been overlooked in our focus on changing the laws.  We Can Handle the Facts (And the Lack of Them) We need to be honest and realistic in assessing what is happening with abortion numbers. The decline of abortion ratios cited in my first Federalist article is relatively gradual and continuous––the slight peaks and troughs are the “noise” of what looks like a steady “signal.” Is there a key factor, or a few key factors, that are continuous in operation from the beginning? In my first article I suggested that we may be seeing an ongoing social-psychological shift in the minds of generations of young, pregnant women regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and abortion. This might be a shift we cannot gauge, but whose effect is that fewer and fewer of them are seeking abortions. One factor in this shift might be personal knowledge of post-abortive women, a knowledge that disinclines a pregnant woman from following the path of someone she knows or hears about. This might have been a factor from the early 1970s on, so it can’t be discounted as not present throughout the period of this decline. Would it have increasing effects on abortion ratios, relative to their decline, however? That seems unlikely, but we simply don’t know. And so it goes with much of our speculation. Public Opinion Has Not Seriously Shifted in Our Favor Inasmuch as we do know about public opinion, we cannot say the same about it. New claims that “Gallup data clearly indicates that since the mid-1990s, there has been both a long-term and durable increase in the percentage of Americans who identify as ‘pro-life.’” One of those new converts to the cause, of course, would be the president of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Leana Wen, who recently said that “being pro-choice is…being pro-family…being pro-life.”  It is somewhat encouraging to know that more people like to think of themselves as pro-life, but most of this can be dismissed as shallow self-regard: see the relatively level lines in the graph of the Gallup poll responses to the question, “Do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances?” There is simply no real trend here. This criticism applies to New’s confidence in the educational impact of abortion regulations as well: where is the evidence of an effect on public opinion? It is true that the laws have a measurable impact on abortion ratios. So in Pennsylvania, the abortion ratio dropped an outsized 12.3 percent the year after the Abortion Control Act was finally implemented in 1993. The law, however, does not explain the continuing drop in abortion ratios, or the fact that abortion ratios had already fallen by over 27 percent from 1981 to 1993. What of New’s claim that the General Social Survey (GSS) found “long-term gains in pro-life sentiment”? The opposite claim could be made, as one analyst found that “more people” in the 2014 GSS survey “support legal abortion for any reason, no matter why a woman wants it. About 35 percent held that view in the 1970s – but the number has risen to 45 percent in 2014.” What of his claim that young adults were the demographic most sympathetic toward legal abortion until 2000, when they became the most opposed? A close examination of these figures from the GSS show that the change is very slight, and can’t be compared to the 48 percent reduction in abortions per 100 live births (1984–2015).  In a Quinnipiac poll of 2017, the 18 to 35 age group was more in favor of abortion as “legal in all cases” than any other demographic group, by 3 percent, and “legal in most cases,” by 4 percent. It is becoming common to observe that we really don’t have a solid grasp of what Americans think about abortion, nor of any trends. Pro-life education is important––how many of us would be pro-life without it?––but not because we can see that it’s changing public opinion as a whole. A local pregnancy medical center director told me that they still commonly hear women say, as they look at their unborn children on the ultrasound screen, “I had no idea.” Can We Change Things Without Changing Public Opinion? So why does public opinion matter, and why do we want to change it? It may be that we can’t help ourselves: if we were silent, we feel, “the very stones would cry out.” Perhaps we think that, if only the majority of those we know could see the moral horror that is abortion, they would not have abortions, and we could change the laws and end abortion? This is what we really want, but we need to come back to earth here: we won’t end abortion, or abolish abortion as such, any more than we could end bank robbery, drunk driving, or spousal abuse simply with laws. Similarly, instead of talking about “a culture of life,” it’s time that we ask, where have people actually created this “culture”? Perhaps we can contribute to it. What if we can reduce abortion numbers without changing the public mind on abortion? What if we can so reduce abortion numbers, or the demand for abortion, that it becomes politically much easier to criminalize the work of abortionists and protect unborn children? (This, we can assume, would have a big impact on dwindling abortion numbers, although our success, again, would lack the eschatological finality of the slogans.) A shift of attention to making pregnancy help better known would be a strategic move, not a denial of the importance of laws. Public Ambivalence Gives Us An In Do the polls give us a clue as to why pregnancy help might be the reason for those dropping ratios? The American Enterprise Institute survey I cited in the earlier article points out that, over the years, “substantial numbers of people tell the pollsters that abortion is an act of murder. They also say that the decision to have an abortion should be a personal choice.” Similarly, people (and not just politicians) will say that they are personally pro-life, but that they can’t “impose their morality” on others. Ramesh Ponnuru observed somewhere that whoever is perceived as imposing on the other side in the struggle over abortion loses. We saw this in Pennsylvania with former governor Tom Corbett, whose proposed bill requiring that a woman be offered the opportunity to see her unborn child on the ultrasound screen before her abortion was widely criticized for imposing on the woman, and withdrawn. We have seen it recently on the other side, as the courts have rejected laws that would have required pregnancy help centers to advertise abortion services as well. Pregnancy help involves no such imposition: it is assumed that women at all times have a choice, and that many will choose life when they have the right information and support. (Heartbeat International addresses claims that centers are “fake clinics.”) Americans like pregnancy help. A 2014 national poll commissioned by the Charlotte Lozier Institute found that 92 percent of women (many of whom would be “pro-choice”) said that pregnancy help centers were “very necessary” (70 percent) or “fairly necessary” (22 percent) in their communities. This positive view of pregnancy help was confirmed for us by a young actress who helps us with advertising local pregnancy medical centers in Pittsburgh. S. is “pro-choice”: personally “pro-life,” but not willing to judge anyone else, she tells us. Nonetheless, she now knows that these centers are “the way to go” for abortion-vulnerable women. If we’re looking for that actualized “culture of life” we hear about, we find it in these centers. In 2003, the new, national pregnancy helpline, OptionLine, took 35,000 calls from women in need. Like the number of pregnancy help centers themselves over the years, the calls have increased: in 2018, Heartbeat reports, that number was over 400,000. More than one million visited OptionLine’s website last year. Advertising the Centers Vision for Life – Pittsburgh, the nonprofit of which I am the executive director, began advertising to abortion-minded area women in late 2010. In the next few years, abortion ratios for residents of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, fell sharply, and stood at roughly the same level before dipping again in 2017, the last year for which we have statistics, to 24.1 per 100 live births (or 241 per 1,000 live births, according to another convention). From 2010 to 2017, abortion ratios declined 23.7 percent. A separate organization from Vision for Life – Pittsburgh has begun modest advertising for AlphaCare, a pregnancy medical center in Philadelphia County, where 40 percent of Pennsylvania’s abortions are performed. Needless to say, support for that effort would be greatly appreciated. We don’t know for certain that the increase in pregnancy help centers lies behind the drop in abortion ratios, but if advertising local centers can have this kind of effect, it seems likely. New observes that this is a “rich area for future academic and policy research.” I would welcome the Charlotte Lozier Institute’s work on it. If they were to decline, however, perhaps others, or even a lone sociologist or statistician, would take up the task. I have the data on the increase in the number of centers, but I lack the competence with statistics for a proper assessment. We continue to need public education, academic debate, legal engagement, lobbying, and even protest, whether these demonstrably affect abortion numbers or not. If it can be shown, however, that pregnancy help is driving abortion ratios lower, then we should direct greater resources to  increasing the number of centers, and to making all of the centers better known in their communities through advertising. Statistics and broad trends are dry matters, but with them and God’s help, we may be able to deliver many more mothers and babies from the scourge of abortion.

"52",52,"Pennsylvania Proves SCOTUS Should Uphold Texas Abortion Safety Standards","Bartkowiak","Dan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-03-02"," What did Planned Parenthood affiliates call “a public health crisis” that would “ultimately put a majority of abortion care facilities out of business in Pennsylvania”? It was the same action at the heart of the Texas law now before the U.S. Supreme Court—making surgical abortion businesses follow the same inspection and safety regulations as every other surgical facility in the state. Pennsylvania’s Act 122 went into effect in June 2012, classifying any clinic performing abortion surgery as an ambulatory surgical facility. This brought abortion facilities up to the same health and safety requirements as every other freestanding outpatient surgical center. These common-sense requirements include hallways big enough for a gurney, proper sterilization procedures, and unannounced inspections. Basic medical safety standards like these are an example of government actually keeping people safe.  As a direct result, that year five of the 24 Pennsylvania abortion facilities shut down. In the nearly four years since, there are four main impacts the law has made on Pennsylvania. 1. Inspections that Prevent a Kermit Gosnell Repeat Inspection of abortion facilities happens regularly and will continue, preventing another Kermit Gosnell. The Philadelphia grand jury that indicted Gosnell found that top state officials decided decades ago to stop inspecting abortion facilities for political reasons. This failure allowed Gosnell to operate a horrific late-term abortion facility in West Philadelphia where tens of thousands of abortions occurred, and where at least two women were killed. Inspectors found the remains of aborted babies simply thrown into bags and stored in an open closet. Gosnell is sadly not the only reason inspections are necessary. Just last August, the two largest abortion locations for Planned Parenthood in Pennsylvania failed inspection. Inspectors found the remains of aborted babies simply thrown into bags and stored in an open closet. Surgical instruments were not properly sterilized, and syringes and needles were being stored outside of packaging. Only after inspection have those safety issues been addressed. Because abortion facilities are now included in ambulatory surgical standards, no governor or other state official can simply decree an end to inspections.  2. Treating Women Like All Humans in Surgery The abortion business is now held to the standard of care given to all surgical procedures, which stops someone like Steven Brigham. As a direct result of the new abortion facilities law, five surgical abortion locations closed. Three closed voluntarily, but the other two were closed by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. An OB-GYN from the hospital near Brigham’s Allentown clinic would see major injuries to women as a result of their procedures: ‘I was scared for the patients.’ The two forced to close were Allentown Medical Services and American Women’s Services, both connected to the infamous late-term abortionist Steven Brigham, whose medical license has been suspended or revoked in at least five states, including Pennsylvania. After losing his medical license, Brigham continued to own several Pennsylvania clinics. An OB-GYN from the hospital near Brigham’s Allentown clinic would see major injuries to women as a result of their procedures: “I was scared for the patients.” Former employees describe how women were in agony during their abortions, “screaming and writhing….it sounded like people being tortured.” In one raid of a Brigham clinic in New York, officials found 17 aborted babies in a freezer. Another raid in Maryland found 35 late-term aborted babies stored in a freezer. One was suspected to have been aborted at 36 weeks.  In December 2011, ironically at same time Pennsylvania’s abortion clinic legislation passed, a Maryland grand jury investigating Brigham charged him with 11 counts of murder. Brigham was starting late-term abortion procedures on women in New Jersey, then transporting them to Maryland to finish the job. The charges were only dropped because the prosecution could not establish the facts determining the aborted babies were post-viability—similar to the defense Gosnell unsuccessfully attempted to mount in Pennsylvania. Former employees describe how women were in agony during their abortions, ‘screaming and writhing….it sounded like people being tortured.’ Although the Pennsylvania Department of Health banned Brigham in 2009 from being directly or indirectly involved with medical facilities, he kept his Pennsylvania business interests in the family, transferring ownership of his Pittsburgh and Allentown clinics to his mother. Only in 2012 did the state force both of these facilities to close. Brigham reportedly spoke glowingly of these facilities after their closure. The PA Department of Health had a different view, sending a letter to Brigham saying they had “witnessed a chronic inability by Allentown Women Services to comply with the most fundamental statutory and regulatory requirements.” Yet it was only after the law was passed for ambulatory surgical standards on abortion clinics that Brigham’s clinics were shut down. If Pennsylvania did not pass this law, both of these facilities connected with Brigham would still be butchering women. Many have pointed to Kermit Gosnell as the reason for abortion facility improvements. While that is enough reason, Gosnell is in jail now. People like Steven Brigham are still out there operating clinics—but no longer in Pennsylvania, thanks to the improved regulation. 3. Standardized Emergency Plans for Abortion Complications A standardized emergency plan is now in place for when complications arise from an abortion. In 2014, physicians submitted 162 reports of complications from abortion in Pennsylvania. These consisted of “retained products of conception,” bleeding, and infection. When there is an emergency, the same protocol for any freestanding surgical facility now applies to abortion locations. Karnamaya Mongar died in a hospital as a result of a botched abortion in Gosnell’s clinic. It took paramedics over 20 minutes just to get Mongar out of the facility because the hallways were too narrow for a stretcher and the emergency door was padlocked. Ambulatory surgical facility standards and unannounced inspections are the best way to safeguard the health and safety of women in Pennsylvania and across the country. 4. This Doesn’t Reduce Abortion Access Access to abortion has not been hindered due to the improved standards. Planned Parenthood affiliates in Pennsylvania continue to denounce the need for ambulatory surgical standards for abortion facilities, calling it “onerous,” “burdensome,” and “unnecessary” while claiming it would shut down the majority of abortion facilities. In 2010, 22 non-hospital facilities performed abortions. That same year included abortions from Gosnell’s facility and the two clinics linked with Steven Brigham. Take away those, and you have 19 non-hospital facilities. In 2014, the number of non-hospital facilities performing abortions was 19. Total state abortions have not dropped dramatically, either. There were 36,778 abortions in Pennsylvania for 2010. Four years later, abortions were down just 13 percent. According to the Centers for Disease Control, from 2010 to 2012, the abortion rate nationally has dropped by 9 percent. Is this the “public health crisis” that Planned Parenthood warned would shut down abortion? Women Deserve the Best Health Standards Texas is on the verge of becoming what Pennsylvania was to the nation back in the 1990s—monumental in shaping state regulation of abortion. In the state passage of the Abortion Control Act and the resulting U.S. Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Pennsylvania helped pave the way for improvements in state abortion laws, such as 24-hour waiting periods, informed consent, and parental permission requirements for minors seeking an abortion. In their Casey decision, the Supreme Court wrote, “the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman.” There is absolutely a legitimate interest in making abortion clinics fulfill the same health and safety requirements of any outpatient surgical facility. And Pennsylvania women are now safer because of it. ","https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/02/pennsylvania-proves-scotus-should-uphold-texas-abortion-safety-standards/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"54",54,"With Many Democrats Worried About Abortion, Why Is Joe Biden Becoming More Radical?","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-04-03"," Now that Joe Biden is widely expected to formally announce his campaign this month, his record on abortion is under intense scrutiny by members of the Democratic Party and left-leaning media outlets. On Friday, The New York Times’ Lisa Lerer outlined Biden’s evolution on abortion. The article frames Biden’s history as falling short of the current Democratic standard. What is that standard? Abortion on demand, up to birth, for any reason.  “Some of Mr. Biden’s more moderate-to-conservative stances in his legislative record are raising questions in the party about whether he could win over an ascendant liberal wing eager to impose purity tests around issues of race and gender in 2020,” writes Lerer. NARAL’s president Ilyse Hogue told the Times that, “anxiety is super high among women across the country,” and that “Joe Biden … is going to have to really get with the times and understand that standing with abortion rights is the middle, moderate position.” Never mind the fact that abortion to the point of — possibly even after — birth is the most extreme position on abortion so, by definition, it cannot be the “middle, moderate position.” There is no more extreme stance on abortion than what the abortion lobby has turned into the standard Democratic position. Biden Coming under Fire Biden is under scrutiny for, among other things, having once voted to let states overturn Roe V. Wade, although he later voted against that. Biden’s spokesman, Bill Russo, defended Biden’s record on Roe by saying the senator had mounted “fierce opposition to the nomination of conservative judge, Robert H. Bork,” for the Supreme Court over 30 years ago, a move he claims was key to preserving the Roe precedent.  Although Biden has struggled to reconcile his Roman Catholic beliefs with his policy positions, he told the magazine America: the Jesuit Review in 2015, “I’m prepared to accept that at the moment of conception there’s human life and being, but I’m not prepared to say that to other God-fearing, non-God-fearing people that have a different view.” Biden, Al Gore, and many other Democrats used to oppose government funding of abortion. “It’s not the government’s business,” Biden explained more than three decades ago. He voted repeatedly for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal dollars from directly funding abortions. Yet he was more pro-life than the hands-off position. The New York Times reports Biden’s stance in 1997 on a bill to ban partial-birth abortions: “‘It did not, as I would have liked, ban all post-viability abortions,’ he said, backing a proposal by Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic majority leader, that would include an exception if the mother’s health was at risk. ‘I was and still am concerned that in banning on partial-birth abortions, we do not go far enough.’” Not supporting abortion on demand after viability would be an immediate disqualifier for any federally elected Democrat just two decades later, yet if a governor implies children born alive after attempted abortion don’t have the right to live, it’s just another controversy to weather until the news cycle runs its course.  Biden now says “government doesn’t have ‘a right to tell other people that women, they can’t control their body.’” The former vice president’s personal evolution on abortion is a microcosm of a greater shift in the national politics of both parties. Democrats’ radicalism has dragged Republicans down. With a Republican-controlled Congress and Republican president in 2017-2018, they should have been able to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, but due to the moral cowardice of two Republicans—Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins—they could not. Just three Democratic senators braved the wrath of their party to vote in favor of the bill. A Shift in Rhetoric and Beliefs Scientists know more about life in the womb now than ever before, yet Democratic politicians are more radically pro-abortion than ever before, relying on nonsensical philosophical arguments instead of science. Republicans have accommodated the shift, in voting records if not in campaign rhetoric—bringing anything more restrictive than a 2o-week ban to Congress’s floor for a vote would be unthinkable. Indeed, when do facts ever get in the way of progress? This is a heart matter, first and foremost, but the lure of campaign funding and sheer bully tactics have pressured Democrats to toe the line. The brutal tyrants of the culture of death have beaten the donkey into submission. Instead of pushing for state nullification of Roe like the slavery abolitionists, the elephant is lumbering along behind that donkey like another mindless pack animal. If science can’t convince people who have access on demand to every expert in the country, as federally elected officials do, would pressure from voters make a difference? Late-term abortions are deeply unpopular with the public, with just more than a third of Democrats saying they support abortion through the whole pregnancy (22 percent) or for the first six months (13 percent), according to the latest Marist poll. So, two out of three Democrats don’t support the position of the vast majority of their 2020 presidential contenders, or the positions of the majority of Democratic senators and representatives, 81 percent of whom had a 100 percent rating from NARAL in 2017. Democrat-leaning voters have already shown it’s not important for their representatives to have a moderate stance on abortion, so the pressure toward moderation is virtually non-existent. As long as Democrats can successfully divert attention to more popular policy positions, they won’t have a problem rounding up blue voters who don’t agree with the dominant abortion-on-demand, up-to-birth position. Claims that Republicans are heartless and want to keep children in cages and “take away your health care” are apparently enough to justify voting for an abortion extremist, if indeed Democrat voters bother to frame it as a justification at all. If abortion is acceptable on some level, then it is not hard to stretch a tacit blessing over all forms of abortion to protect popular entitlement programs, increase federal education spending, combat climate change, or whatever other policy positions are more important to the voter. For “moderate” pro-choicers, it’s not an all or nothing moral issue; it’s some, or some more. Catholics lean Democrat 44 to 37 percent and, like Biden, are in favor of abortion in all or most cases, 51 to 42 percent. If most of these generally pro-choice Catholics are in the Democratic Party, as common sense dictates they would be, why would they be more staunchly opposed to abortion absolutism in 2019 than Biden himself? Despite his reservations, wouldn’t Biden vote for whomever the Democratic nominee turns out to be, no matter how radical his or her abortion stance? He also appears to be shying away from defending the less radical parts of his record as he prepares to launch his campaign, not turning it into an appeal to religious Democrats. It’s no wonder. Not many voters who are truly opposed to abortion in all its forms, or even with the traditional exceptions for rape and the mother’s life, exist in the Democratic Party. Only 21 percent say it should be illegal in “all/most cases,” according to Pew Research Center, and that umbrella covers much more moderate views than the aforementioned pro-life orthodoxy. Given these realities, abortion absolutism almost certainly will not make a difference in deciding the Democratic nominee. Will it come into play in the general election, though? Sixty percent of independents take the general pro-choice position of “legal in all/most cases,”  and six in 10 Americans support at least first-trimester abortion. Party Leadership Won’t Become More Moderate It may seem shocking to non-Democrats (and even some Democrats) that the party’s leadership has camped out on the far end of the pro-abortion spectrum. Although Democratic leadership is out of step with the public’s opinion and majority opinion within the party on abortion, it doesn’t really matter in itself, because abortion moderation isn’t a litmus test for moderately pro-choice voters. They are more likely to vote for someone who will “protect a woman’s right to choose” than someone they perceive as wanting to restrict abortion rights, which means Biden is at a disadvantage despite his past views being more closely aligned to those of the Democrat majority. Instead, the probability of the extreme stance of the Democratic nominee being a bridge too far for any significant number of independents is going to depend on how persuasively Republicans frame the issue. Voting against protections for infants born alive after attempted abortion is a pretty egregious act. If the GOP can capitalize on this evil to show how heartless Democrats are regarding the most vulnerable citizens, they may successfully leverage the issue to keep Donald Trump in office. Once again, however, we come back to the fact that Republicans in Congress haven’t made protecting the unborn a priority, and there is only so much Trump can do in the executive branch. If federal abortion policy is to move decisively in a pro-life direction, a great deal of effort must be poured into primarying lukewarm Republicans in the House and the Senate with true pro-life candidates, in addition to challenging Democrat incumbents. Pro-life Democrats, of course, should push back hard against the abortion lobby or else leave the party. America will face a reckoning one day for the evil she has permitted and supported in abortion, just as with slavery. Both parties would do well to keep that in mind.

"55",55,"Contrary To Media Reports, New Abortion Pill Study Finds It Endangers Women And Reversal Works","Sander Lee","Tara",NA,"Valley, Michael",NA,NA,"2020-01-10"," If you have read the headlines about a recent abortion pill study led by Dr. Mitchell Creinin, you would think the attempted reversal of abortion was to blame for some horrific outcomes. The truth is the opposite. Blaming women’s injuries on the reversal process, rather than on the abortion pills themselves, is how pro-abortion researchers are spinning the results. In a predictably biased attempt to play the American public — especially women — pro-abortion researchers peddled their side of the story and found a willing audience in many media outlets. Take the following examples:  “Researchers Tried to Test ‘Abortion Reversal.’ 3 Women Wound Up in the Hospital” from The Cut.
“The First Study on ‘Abortion Reversal’ Landed Three Women in the ER” from Vice.
“Safety Problems Lead to Early End for Study of ‘Abortion Pill Reversal’” from NPR. If this sounds like “fake news,” that’s because it is. The abortion pill regimen — also called “chemical abortion — causes death in an unborn child. It consists of a two-drug sequence that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved for use by women who are no more than 10 weeks pregnant. First, women take mifepristone, which essentially starves the baby of nutrients. After a brief period, women then take misoprostol, which induces contractions to expel the dead or dying child. Abortion pill reversal is attempted after the first drug, by returning normal nutrition to the baby through the use of the hormone progesterone. The researchers conducting the “double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial” intended to enroll 40 women between 44 and 63 days gestation who were planning to undergo surgical abortion. Each woman would ingest the abortifacient Mifeprex (mifepristone) followed 24 hours later by either the reversal drug progesterone or a placebo, which they would continue to take daily until their scheduled surgical abortions 14-16 days after beginning the trial. The research team enrolled women from February to July 2019 but halted the study due to safety concerns after enrolling only 12 participants. To clarify: The study was ended not because of attempted abortion pill (Mifeprex) reversal landing women in the hospital, but because of severe hemorrhaging in the women who did not take progesterone, the reversal medication. In fact, two out of five, or 40 percent, of women who took Mifeprex alone, and did not take progesterone, required emergency surgery, and one required a transfusion.  The other woman who bled had taken progesterone after taking the Mifeprex. But her bleeding stopped by itself, and she did not need surgery. There is no evidence the woman needed to be seen in the ER. Clearly, the women who did not take progesterone fared much worse than the women who did take it. The researchers, who were forced to end the trial due to safety concerns, failed to admit those concerns were not in the patients who took progesterone, only the patients who did not, resulting in misleading media reports and scientific deceit. Findings Of the Abortion Pill Reversal Study Let’s look at the actual reported results. In the five women who took Mifeprex with no progesterone, two had massive hemorrhages requiring emergency surgery, and one needed a blood transfusion. Of the remaining three, two had a baby with a heartbeat at the two-week check-up visit. That’s a 40 percent survival rate at two weeks with Mifeprex alone.  In the five women who took Mifeprex with progesterone — in other words, attempted an abortion pill reversal — one lost her baby and experienced heavy bleeding, which stopped by itself. She went to the ER but had no need for surgery or other treatment. But the most remarkable finding is that four of the five women who took progesterone had living babies at their two-week follow-up. That’s an 80 percent success rate! The authors use hyperbole, reporting that even with progesterone treatment, “severe hemorrhage” can occur. Yet the one woman who took progesterone and had bleeding did not require treatment. By spinning their results and not reporting that the safety concerns were only in the Mifeprex-alone group, the authors completely misrepresent the safety of administering progesterone. The Study’s Authors Misrepresent Their Findings Long before this study was published, it was known that Mifeprex can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections, excessive bleeding, and incomplete abortion requiring emergency surgery. In fact, these complications happen even after the second abortifacient drug, misoprostol, is taken. Most of the women who have needed transfusions after taking Mifeprex have also taken misoprostol. This study further illustrates these serious, life-threatening risks when taking the abortion pill. Rather than focusing on the fact that the abortion pill has serious risks, the study authors and those reporting on the study attempt to mislead the public into believing that any attempt to reverse the abortion pill’s effect could be potentially more dangerous to the mother. In reality, the study showed that a fetal heartbeat was detected two weeks after taking the abortion pill in 80 percent of women who attempted to reverse the abortion pill by taking progesterone. Indeed, these results were consistent with a 2018 study (George Delgado et al.) that had a 68 percent live birth rate after treatment with the same oral progesterone protocol used by Creinin et al. Both women who hemorrhaged while on the placebo instead of progesterone required emergency surgical abortion, but remarkably, the woman on progesterone did not require any additional intervention. With this study, the authors continue promulgating misleading information about the real risks of the abortion pill regimen, instead of emphasizing the safety of using progesterone to try to reverse Mifeprex’s effects. This is not surprising. Women Should Know Truth About Abortion Pill Reversal Take a recent USA Today op-ed by a well-known abortion doctor and researcher, Daniel Grossman. He makes the abortion pill process sound so painless, so easy, and no more painful than a woman’s monthly menstrual cycle, describing it as “simple” and with effects limited to “cramping, bleeding, and expulsion of the pregnancy.” In reality, taking the abortion pill is not so simple and comes with many risks, as Creinin et al. demonstrated. Our federal government’s top doctors, scientists, and policymakers at the Food and Drug Administration have deemed the abortion pill so risky that the pill’s regimen is part of the FDA’s Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which the FDA describes as a program required “for certain medications with serious safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks.” But researchers like Creinin — and Grossman, who in his op-ed advocates for selling the abortion pill over the counter — along with others working in the abortion industry, don’t want the abortion pill on REMS. Instead, they want Mifeprex removed from the REMS list and made widely available. This would increase risks to women and does not reflect what the scientific community knows about the risks of attempting medical abortion. Women deserve the truth about the potentially serious side effects of the abortion pill — from doctors, scientists, and the media.

"57",57,"The AP Is Wrong: Abortion Bans Do Not Harm Minority Women, Abortions Do","Enriquez","Lauren",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-02-08"," On February 1, the Associated Press (AP) published a widely disseminated article claiming that minority women “bear the brunt” of pro-life laws restricting abortion. Here’s a fact-check of this article’s many false and misleading claims.



The thesis of the AP’s argument is: “if the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to further restrict or even ban abortions, minority women will bear the brunt of it.” The article notes that the black abortion rate is extremely disproportionate compared to the white abortion rate in the South, but absurdly correlates the high black abortion rate with pro-life laws. 



The truth? Minority women have the highest abortion rate nationwide, and the abortion industry’s targeting of low-income and minority communities is plain to see. To borrow a line from the AP, “The numbers are unambiguous” — but the AP was looking at the wrong numbers. According to the most recent analyses available, nearly 80 percent of Planned Parenthood’s abortion businesses are located in minority neighborhoods and nearly 90 percent of its “mega facilities” are within walking distance of non-white neighborhoods. 



In another failed attempt to paint abortion access as the solution to a problem, the AP reporters highlight the high infant mortality rate in Mississippi. There, black infants are nearly four times as likely as white infants to be killed in abortion violence. Also, according to the AP, “Black infants were about twice as likely as white infants to die during the first year of life.” 



With no explanation as to how abortion access improves this dire situation, one is left to deduce that the AP authors think infant mortality is best cured by prophylactically killing the child in utero before he or she has a chance to die outside the womb. 



The truth? An analysis of more than 100 peer-reviewed studies shows that each abortion a woman undergoes increases the risk of preterm birth for her subsequent children (and preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality). The AP also forgot to mention that Mississippi, with its astronomical black abortion rate, also has the highest rate of preterm birth in the nation. 



According to that finding, “In Mississippi, the preterm birth rate among Black women is 44% higher than the rate among all other women.” If the AP had taken off the abortion blinders, it could have seen that, by referencing the black infant mortality rate, it was highlighting one of the many reasons abortion needs to be abolished — not expanded.



At every turn, the AP fails to explain how increased abortion access can meaningfully improve any of the struggles non-white women face. In fact, reliance on “abortion access” may be exacerbating the very situations in question.



The reality is that 76 percent of abortion-seeking women admit they would not be seeking an abortion if their circumstances were different. That statistic comes from Human Coalition, where 77 percent of abortion-seeking clients are minority women. Even the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute reports that “qualitative data from in-depth interviews portrayed women who had had an abortion as typically feeling that they had no other choice, given their limited resources and existing responsibilities to others.” 



The AP fear-mongers about the impending fate of abortion-on-demand via the Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court ruling, saying: “If abortions are outlawed, those same [minority] women — often poor — will likely have the hardest time traveling to distant parts of the country to terminate pregnancies or raising children they might struggle to afford.”  



Considering the fact that most women don’t want abortion access but want their circumstances to be different, why do the AP’s (both white) reporters and all those who claim to support abortion on behalf of women ignore the facts and instead choose to cry “abortion access!” more loudly?



Corporate abortion doesn’t just refuse to invest time, money, and strategy into improving the circumstances of the low-income minority women it claims to care about. It rallies against efforts to support these women with tangible resources and financial investments.



Minority women ask for support, and abortion peddlers — bolstered by their mainstream media allies — respond, No, you need abortion. One is hard-pressed to find a better example of modern racism than that. The “soft bigotry of low expectations” doesn’t feel very soft to the black child as he’s violently evacuated from his impoverished mother’s womb.



The abortion industry and its allies may view minority families as undeserving of support, but the pro-life movement is already standing alongside these communities and ramping up its support in preparation for Roe v. Wade to return to the ash heap of history, where it belongs. 



Through Students For Life of America’s Campaign for Abortion-Free Cities, advocates deploy each month to knock on doors and have conversations in the very neighborhoods Planned Parenthood has infested for generations. These activists provide information about free, local, nonviolent resources — often within walking distance to the communities that need abortion alternatives the most.



Online, SFLA’s Standing With You initiative is doing the same thing — connecting those most targeted by the abortion industry with the resources that change their circumstances so they can reject abortion and embrace life, both for themselves and for their children.

"58",58,"Abortion Providers Argue For Back Alley Abortions","Smith","Mailee",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-02-03"," When the Supreme Court reviews the Texas abortion case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (formerly Cole), abortion providers’ deadly game will have prompted a discussion about what is more important: “access” to the current back alley of abortion now offered by an industry that puts profits over people, or commonsense health and safety standards the Court has historically supported. The stakes are high—life and death—and encompass more than whether the Texas provisions in House Bill (HB) 2 are constitutional. To be sure, the law Texas passed in 2013—requiring abortion clinics to meet commonsense health and safety standards and requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital—is front and center. However, the abortion providers challenging HB 2 are actually arguing for a complete upheaval of the Supreme Court’s abortion precedents.  Defending state leaders working to protect women, this week Americans United for Life’s legal team filed an amicus curie (friend of the court) brief on behalf of more than 450 bipartisan and bicameral legislators and lieutenant governors from states that the Court’s decision in the case will affect. The brief demonstrates that the plaintiff abortion providers are blatantly ignoring the Supreme Court’s previous decisions because those decisions devastate their case. Women’s Safety Should Be Paramount For example, the Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that states have an interest in protecting maternal health from the outset of pregnancy. In fact, in Roe v. Wade the Court explained that states could regulate abortion to ensure “maximum safety” of women, including regulations involving the performing physician and his staff, the facilities involved, the availability of after-care, and the adequate provision for any complication or emergency that may arise. States have an interest in protecting maternal health from the outset of pregnancy. In other words, Roe itself supports the very provisions the abortion providers are challenging in Hellerstedt. Strike one against the abortion providers. Moreover, the Court has repeatedly given state and federal lawmakers “wide discretion” to enact abortion regulations when the medical community disagrees about the safety of an abortion procedure or the effect of a regulation. In fact, the Court terms this the “traditional rule” and holds that such medical disagreement is “sufficient basis” to preclude the abortion providers’ claims entirely.  Here, expert medical testimony presented to the legislature before HB 2 was enacted, along with evidence presented in the trial court, demonstrate the need for comprehensive safety regulations in the abortion clinic setting. The abortion providers disagree and offer their own experts to counter the state’s data, but Supreme Court precedent demands that such disagreement be resolved in favor of the state. Strike two against the abortion providers. Strike Three Against Women In addition to ignoring the Supreme Court’s prior abortion decisions, the abortion providers ignore the clear health risks women face in unregulated, substandard clinics. Over the last six years, more than 175 abortion providers in at least 30 states and DC have faced investigations, criminal charges, administrative complaints, and civil lawsuits related to the provision of abortions. Enacting medically appropriate and comprehensive health and safety standards for abortion providers is a critical and sensible solution to the problem of unsafe abortions in America. Abortion providers ignore the clear health risks women face in unregulated, substandard clinics. In her floor statement supporting HB 2, Texas Sen. Donna Campbell, an emergency room physician, explained the reasonableness of such standards. For example, back-up generators are necessary in case a procedure is in progress when electricity goes out. Wider hallways are necessary to bring in a gurney in the case of a medical complication. Requirements as simple as lockers and janitors’ closets are necessary to keep contaminants out of the operating room. Unfortunately, abortion providers value “access” to the squalor of clinics like that of Kermit Gosnell over protecting women through commonsense health and safety regulations. Strike three.  Upset Abortion Jurisprudence to Protect Substandard Care? Of course, the Supreme Court’s prior precedents, which clearly support the provisions in HB 2 and the state’s interest in protecting women from substandard clinic conditions, are not convenient for the abortion providers. What to do when the law is not on your side? Their answer appears to be ignore it and argue something else. What to do when the law is not on your side? Their answer appears to be ignore it. In short, the abortion providers are urging the Court to ignore the states’ interest in protecting women’s health and the deference that must be afforded to the state legislature, and instead adopt a new standard which requires states to prove the effectiveness of a law in protecting women’s health before such a law is in effect. In legal terms, they are arguing for a “strict scrutiny” standard—the highest level of review the Court uses in evaluating constitutional claims, and a standard the Court has explicitly rejected in the context of abortion. Should the abortion providers prevail in toppling four decades of abortion jurisprudence, current and potential future regulations would be directly impacted. At least 10 states maintain measures similar to those at issue in HB 2, and some of those laws are currently in litigation. As the Guttmacher Institute reported in January, states have enacted 231 abortion regulations in the last four years alone. Each of those laws would be in the abortion industry’s crosshairs should the Court cave to the abortion providers’ demands in Hellerstedt. Indeed, it is time for the Supreme Court to unequivocally affirm that it meant what it said as far back as Roe: states may regulate abortion to protect maternal health. The health and safety of women depends upon it. ","https://thefederalist.com/2016/02/03/abortion-providers-argue-for-back-alley-abortions/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"59",59,"‘Unplanned’ Is The Courageous Abortion Film We’ve Been Waiting For","Schilling","Terry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-03-27"," We often think about the issue of abortion through the lens of politics. Should taxpayers fund Planned Parenthood? Should abortion be legal in the third trimester? Obviously these are fairly easy questions to answer. But the debate over abortion tends to play itself out in a more personal way, somewhat removed from the realm of politics. An 18-year-old college student gets pregnant and the guy isn’t involved—what should she do? She’s not thinking about politics. She’s worrying about what her mom would say. She’s talking to her friends. She’s observing abortion commentaries in the culture and asking herself, is this the right thing to do?  It’s one thing to win over public opinion on abortion as a political issue—and yes, that’s a critically important thing—but winning hearts and minds outside of politics? Building a culture where women feel emboldened to choose life? That’s everything, which is why I’m so excited about the new movie “Unplanned” coming out this week about former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson and her journey from abortion advocate to pro-life activist. A quick warning: “Unplanned” received a controversial R rating from the MPAA, and a number of conservatives have criticized that rating due to the film’s lack of profanity or violence. Many have correctly pointed out how absurd it is that a child can legally get an abortion at an age they are not yet allowed to go see a movie about abortion. But ultimately, the MPAA made the right choice. This is a film that children should absolutely see…with their parents. The movie depicts the cold, heartless reality of abortion accurately, and yes, that makes it tough to watch. Spoilers ahead. The First Eight Minutes “Unplanned” draws you in almost immediately. The actress portraying Abby Johnson (Ashley Bratcher) warns us in the opening voiceover that her story isn’t going to be easy to hear, and after a disarming series of corny family moments and a driving-to-work montage, concluding with Abby pulling into a Planned Parenthood parking lot and parking in her “clinic director” parking spot, the movie suddenly takes a darker turn.  Abby is called into a back room to assist the surgical team as they perform an abortion procedure. As she explains in a voiceover, she had never been asked to do that before, but as the clinic director, she felt obligated to help. She arrives in the room with an abortion doctor, a nurse, and a young girl weeping softly on the table. The abortion doctor explains that he needs to perform an “ultrasound-guided procedure” and wants Abby to “hold probe” on the ultrasound. While he makes preparations for the abortion, Abby sets up the ultrasound and suddenly we hear a heartbeat and see a 13-week-old baby on the monitor. The girl receiving the abortion begins to panic, as the abortion doctor yells at her to “hold still!” The nurse holds her down, coldly lecturing her, “You want it done, don’t you?” At this point, the abortion doctor begins to place a catheter in the girl’s cervix to perform a suction D&C abortion. As we can clearly see on the monitor, the baby reacts viscerally to what is taking place: “It just moved away from the catheter,” Abby says, stunned. “They always move. That’s why I do it this way!” the doctor snaps back.  Eventually, the catheter is successfully placed, and the doctor begins suction. We see blood start flowing through tubes. The baby kicks and fights, desperately clinging to its life, but it’s all for naught. The baby is sucked further and further down the catheter, first the legs, then the torso, then the arms, and then—we hear a pop. Gone. The suction machine is shut off. All movement ceases. An empty cavity on the monitor where a living human being had been kicking about moments earlier. Nothing. Abby is reduced to tears, along with the entire audience. And that’s just at the eight minute mark. The rest of the film covers Abby’s story from start to finish—her family background, her two abortions, her time as a Planned Parenthood volunteer, then counselor, then clinic director, her discomfort with Planned Parenthood’s business model of using abortion as a profit center, her realization that abortion is wrong, her decision to resign from her job, her defense against a frivolous lawsuit by Planned Parenthood, and ultimately, her choice to become a pro-life activist. How to Make the Case for Life The film also takes great care to explore the complicated dynamics within the pro-life movement between sidewalk counselors who offer hope and options to women, and sidewalk protestors who take a more controversial, aggressive approach. One scene shows a man yelling terrible things at a woman entering the clinic—“All this because you couldn’t keep your legs closed!” he shouts, as he thumps his Bible. Other scenes reference a “grim reaper” who furiously paces out front of the clinic, while other protestors hold gruesome signs displaying bloodied babies. In her first conversation with Marilisa Carney, one of the Coalition for Life sidewalk counselors, Abby angrily asks how these antics help women: “Do you people ever stop? In what world would a woman run to someone dressed as the grim reaper for help with her crisis pregnancy?” Marilisa responds, “I am with the Coalition for Life, and they’re not. So we can ask them to stop, and we do, but we can’t force them to do anything. … I think you’re right Abby, it doesn’t help.” This exchange hinted at the very real difference of opinion over tactics within the pro-life movement, which we see on display at the March for Life every year. One side argues we need to stop playing nice and start explicitly showing the reality of abortion, including bloodied babies, detached body parts, blood, gore, and all, and shock the pro-abortion side into seeing what abortion actually is. The other side—the side “Unplanned” clearly takes—argues that in order to persuade, we must be warm and positive, emphasizing the goodness of life, rather than focusing solely on the horror of death, especially when talking with vulnerable women who are in the midst of making an incredibly difficult decision. It’s All About the Money, Honey Abortion proponents have done a masterful job over the years at euphemizing language surrounding abortion, claiming it’s a celebration of women’s empowerment rather than the deliberate taking of innocent life. “Unplanned” breaks through the poll-tested gobbledygook and shows exactly what motivates the abortion industry—profit above all else. In what would be the beginning of the end of her career with Planned Parenthood, Abby questions a directive from corporate to double her clinic’s annual abortion output: Abortion has never been my main priority. Just look at our Mission Statement. … ‘To provide a comprehensive range of reproductive health care and sexual health information through patient services, education, and advocacy.’ That’s what I’m committed to doing. So if our stated goal is to decrease the number of abortions by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, then why are we being asked to double our abortion count? In the next scene, Abby’s superior claps back at her with a revealing explanation: Let me explain something to you. Fast food outlets look to break even on the hamburgers they sell. That’s all they do is break even. Do you know how they make their money? On the french fries and the soda, the low-cost high margin items. Abortion is our fries and soda. But somehow you’ve just decided that it’s no longer your priority. Abortion is what pays your salary. … Corporate policy is simple: we are an abortion provider. Sounds like abortion is more than 3 percent of what Planned Parenthood does? All in all, “Unplanned” is a very persuasive movie. It’s not enjoyable in the traditional sense—it’s an emotional rollercoaster that will upset you repeatedly—but it is an incredibly powerful film that deliberately seeks a dialogue with people outside of the pro-life movement. This is what makes it so valuable and so important. Go see it this weekend, but don’t just go by yourself. Take your family. Take your friends. Heck, take your accountant. No more euphemisms. No more ignoring the issue. It’s time for us all to see what abortion really is. ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/03/27/unplanned-courageous-abortion-film-weve-waiting/",0.963,0.037,"male",2012,2012
"60",60,"Today’s Election Will Determine The Future Of Late-Term Abortions In Virginia","Bateman","Ashley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-11-05"," Virginia’s elections Tuesday will determine the near-term future of laws protecting the unborn, as all seats are up for re-election in the Commonwealth. Last legislative session, Democrats favored a radical late-term abortion law, mirroring New York’s Reproductive Health Act, which would remove the requirement for a licensed physician to conduct an abortion and permit abortion until birth.  Introduced by Del. Kathy Tran (D- Springfield), House Bill 2491 sought to remove basic safety and consent measures from the abortion process in Virginia and would have allowed abortions until a baby’s birth. “The science is clear,” says John Seeds, an MD and retired dean of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University. “Once the sperm has united with the egg you have a new, unique, clearly human life. Human ‘intellectual’ redefinition of the value of that life to justify destroying it are self-deceptions, not science. To place human civil or legal ‘rights’ above the natural right to life is on its face a spiritual error with destructive cultural consequences evident everywhere.” Abortion Is Never Medically Necessary The majority of Virginians polled favor abortion if the mother’s life is at stake. Yet medical experts say there is never a medical necessity to perform abortion. Other, better measures are available to address serious pregnancy complications. Emberli Little is a registered nurse in Newport News who specializes in maternal and newborn care. “I listened very closely when the bill in New York was on the table,” Little said. “There is a huge, huge muddling of the definition of ‘after viability.’ I cannot come up with a time when abortion would be medically necessary. Induction, yes. Abortion, no. I think those in favor of the bill were trying to word it in a way that made it sound like abortion was medically necessary for maternal health.”  Similar language was present in the Virginia bill. “We save mothers’ lives all the time by inducing delivery and coming out with a then healthy child,” Little said. “I can’t come up with any reason or any time where I’ve seen where an actual abortion or terminating the life weeks after viability would be necessary to save the life of the mother.” Unsafe and Irresponsible Proposals Virginia Democrats’ favored abortion bill would also remove basic safety parameters for abortions conducted in the state, according to several prenatal care professionals. Language in the bill would eliminate “the requirement that an abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy and prior to the third trimester be performed in a hospital.” Abortion is an inherently high-risk procedure, and one most OB-GYNs do not perform, said Elizabeth Lunsford, an OB-GYN at Riverside Partners in Women’s Health in Gloucester.  “I see no medical reason why an abortion would be safer than just a delivery in any situation,” Lunsford said. “Infection, intrauterine adhesions affecting future fertility, and the need for transfusion after abortion, are things that potentially can happen” if mothers are given abortion instead of delivery during a crisis. A C-section is both safer and faster than a partial-birth abortion for a mother if the mother’s life is at risk in the third trimester, Lunsford said. In fact, the farther along an unborn child is, the greater the threat to the mother if an abortion is performed, said Seeds, whose special medical focus was ultrasound and prenatal diagnosis, with a subspecialty in maternal-fetal medicine. “Hemorrhage or damage to the uterus or retention of parts of the pregnancy are more likely with a larger fetus,” Seeds said. “Hemorrhage that requires blood banking services to provide transfusion, or damage to the uterus that might require surgical intervention in an operating room. The time required to assess the complication and move the patient to a hospital can result in a threat to life.” This is why Virginia’s current laws require abortions performed after the unborn child’s first trimester to be done in hospitals, Seeds said. “This requirement seems obvious,” he said, since the state has a strong interest in the health and lives of its citizens. Why Ultrasounds Are Good for Women’s Health House Bill 2491 would also eliminate, “all the procedures and processes, including the performance of an ultrasound, required to effect a woman’s informed written consent to the performance of an abortion; however, the bill does not change the requirement that a woman’s informed written consent be first obtained.” Doing an ultrasound before an abortion is “a fundamental safety requirement,” Seeds said, because it gives an accurate age and size of the baby, the number present, and confirms the child is alive. This is crucial for the mother’s safety because “there are examples in the Board of Medicine records of gross error in the gestational age at abortion resulting in life-threatening complications.” Viewing an ultrasound is a current Virginia requirement because it also furthers the goal of informed consent, Seeds said. “Seeing her baby might change [a potentially abortive mother’s] viewpoint and cause her to reconsider her decision,” he said. “This is the fundamental right under informed consent that the abortion lobby wants to hide.” Laws that push abortions also violate the conscience rights and best professional judgment of medical personnel who believe abortions are not the best option for either mother or baby. If asked to do an abortion on the job, “I would have to leave because I wouldn’t agree to do [an abortion] and it would be negligent if I accepted the patient and refused to do the procedure. I can’t see any of the providers I work with participating,” Little said. Allowing Conflicts of Interest for Abortionists Language in HB 2491 would eliminate “the requirement that two other physicians certify that a third trimester abortion is necessary to prevent the woman’s death or impairment of her mental or physical health, as well as the need to find that any such impairment to the woman’s health would be substantial and irremediable.” This is an important restriction because it helps mitigate an abortionist’s conflict of interest between the patient’s true needs and the reality that the abortionist profits from the procedure, Seeds noted. So, requiring two independent doctors to confirm the recommendation of abortion protects the patient. Tran’s proposed abortion legislation also “removes language classifying facilities that perform five or more first-trimester abortions per month as hospitals for the purpose of complying with regulations establishing minimum standards for hospitals.” “This would gut the Virginia Abortion Clinic Safety Regulations,” Seeds said. “These fundamental safety regulations and inspection requirements subject abortion clinics to basic standards of cleanliness, drug safety, complication management, and record keeping. Eliminating these safety standards significantly increases the risk to the patient.” Worse Care Allowed for the Sake of Money The push for allowing non-physicians to perform abortions is at least partially a response to the fact that abortions are declining, and so are the number of doctors willing to perform abortions, Seeds said. Yet this places patients at further risk, Little said, because “Seeing someone without any medical degree or education, you are more likely to end up with severe infection or severe damage [affecting your ability] to conceive or carry a pregnancy again.” Fewer doctors performing abortions hasn’t halted big abortion providers, and states that allow non-physician abortions are thinking more about money than women, Seeds said: “Many state legislatures more than willing to allow non-physicians to perform abortions when Planned Parenthood funnels millions of dollars to their campaign funds. It’s not an elegant or noble process.” In opposition to abortion legislation, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is supported by every one of Virginia’s Republican delegates. “Voters need to take a hard look at what it is they are supporting,” said Michelle Stroud Johnson, a registered nurse in the Commonwealth with a background in postpartum mother and newborn care. “If abortion laws continue on the current trajectory and late-term abortions become the norm, I would rather leave the health-care profession than ever participate in taking innocent lives. Many nurses I know feel the same way. We are nurses because we have hearts of compassion. We know from caring for newborn babies that they have an innate will to live and deserve the chance to do just that.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/05/todays-election-will-determine-the-future-of-late-term-abortions-in-virginia/",0.0032,0.9968,"female",2012,2012
"61",61,"OB-GYN Dispels The Most Common Lies About Abortion, Miscarriage, And Saving The ‘Life Of A Mother’","Centofante","Alison",NA,"Francis, Christina",NA,NA,"2022-08-23"," Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, misinformation on its consequences has run rampant online. Many women, including those who consider themselves pro-life, have read about scenarios that raise questions about what medical care will be available in a post-Roe world. 



Pro-life physicians may also feel unsure of how best to respond to these concerns. I sat down with Dr. Christina Francis, CEO-elect of the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), to get some answers:



1 in 4 women has miscarried, and 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. is ectopic. We are seeing many say that overturning Roe v. Wade affects a physician’s ability to care for women with these conditions. That would rightfully concern any woman. Is this true?



The short answer is, simply, no. There is a difference, legally and medically, between an abortion and treatment for miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Even Planned Parenthood recognized this difference, stating on its website that removing an ectopic pregnancy is not the same as an abortion (though they recently removed this statement in order to continue to spread false information). An elective abortion is any procedure performed or medication given with the intent to end a pregnancy specifically by ending the life of the preborn child. This is not our intent when we treat a woman for an ectopic pregnancy or for a miscarriage.



In the case of an ectopic pregnancy, which is life-threatening due to the risk of severe hemorrhage, we are intervening to save the mother’s life, but we do not intend the death of the embryo. In fact, the procedures typically used to treat an ectopic pregnancy are different than those used for elective abortions.



Some people confuse miscarriage with abortion for two reasons. The medical term for any pregnancy that ends prior to 20 weeks is “abortion.” However, in medicine, we use a modifier to indicate how that pregnancy ended. So, a miscarriage is a “spontaneous abortion,” meaning the preborn baby passed away on her own, without anyone causing her death. The term “induced abortion” is how we code procedures where someone (like an abortion provider) has caused the death of the preborn child through medication or procedure. This is what is being referred to when the general public discusses abortion, and this is what legislators are discussing when they discuss restricting abortion.



The second thing that I think confuses some people is that the surgical procedures that are used to perform first-trimester (D&C) and second-trimester (D&E) abortions are the same procedures that can be used to remove a preborn child who has already passed away in the case of a miscarriage. However, laws that restrict abortions do not ban procedures, they ban how those procedures are used.



Any doctor or physician that claims they cannot treat a woman experiencing a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy or hesitates to do so is committing medical malpractice. They are putting women in extreme danger and should be held accountable for doing so.



How do you respond to claims about the need to have access to abortion to save the life of the mother? Have you ever needed to perform an abortion to save the life of a mother?



In 14 years of clinical practice, I have never needed to intentionally end the life of a preborn child in order to save the life of his or her mother. There are rare situations in which we need to prematurely deliver a baby due to life-threatening complications of pregnancy. If this occurs after the point at which the baby can survive apart from the mother (viability), we simply deliver the child and take care of both mom and baby.



Not only is this the ethical thing to do, and a fulfillment of our oath to do no harm, but it is also much faster than abortion and improves outcomes for the mother. Babies have survived as young as 21 and 22 weeks, as the age of viability continually changes thanks to medical science advances. If early delivery is needed prior to the point of viability, my duty as a physician is to save the life or lives that I can save without intentionally harming anyone else. This can be done in a way that respects the dignity of the preborn child and delivers him/her intact so Mom and Dad can hold their baby.



Not only is this what most patients desire, but it is also important because scientific evidence now indicates preborn children can feel pain as early as 12 weeks, meaning that babies whose lives are ended through dismemberment abortion experience excruciating pain during that process. There is comfort for parents to know they gave their child a chance at life and comfort for physicians to know they are always seeking to save them both, if possible.



What’s the best treatment for fatal fetal diagnosis? Meaning a child is diagnosed in the womb with a condition that will likely result in their death soon after they are born.



Tragically, every year, thousands of preborn children are diagnosed with medical conditions that will drastically limit their lifespan; many will die before or shortly after birth. When those diagnoses are made, many people, including physicians, assume that termination of the pregnancy through elective abortion is a compassionate option.



However, this line of thinking ignores both the humanity of that preborn child and the need for families to not only honor the life of their child but also have the opportunity to process their grief and feel supported through it. If that child were already born — if they were 12 years old, or 2 years old, or 2 months old — no physician would consider “terminating” them due to a diagnosis of a terminal illness. Instead, they would work against the odds to save that child, and, if death seems truly imminent, make them as comfortable as possible in the final stages of their life.



The most compassionate option for these children is perinatal palliative care, a type of hospice care, that offers support to the family throughout the pregnancy, delivery, and beyond. One study showed that 80 percent of patients offered the option of perinatal palliative care prefer it to termination and that parents who utilized this option had a smoother grieving process and better mental health outcomes in dealing with the death of their child.



Can you speak to the regulation of certain medications like misoprostol, which is used for both miscarriage management and in the abortion pill regimen?



Misoprostol is a drug that causes the pregnant uterus to contract and softens the cervix. It is the second drug in the two-drug medication abortion regimen (the first being mifepristone, a drug that’s intended to end the life of the child by blocking the action of progesterone, a crucial hormone in early pregnancy) — but it’s also used to help women complete miscarriages (where their baby has already passed), to induce labor at term in normal pregnancies, and also as a preventive agent for gastric ulcers.



State laws don’t outlaw the use of misoprostol, nor should they, even though the drug could be used in elective abortion, for the same reason that they don’t outlaw scalpels even though scalpels could be used to murder a patient. States do, however, have a vested interest in preventing this and other medications from being used to intentionally end the lives of preborn human beings.



We recently heard a tragic story of a young girl becoming pregnant as a result of rape. What is the pro-life medical treatment in this situation?



Being sexually violated is one of the most traumatic things a person can experience. Women and girls who have been through this tragic experience deserve the best health care, both physical and mental, that we can possibly provide. They deserve to be treated with methods that have been proven to actually improve their outcomes.



Many people assume that by getting rid of the preborn child, a potential reminder of the rape, the mother will be able to move past that trauma faster and easier. However, abortion is not and has never been a mental health treatment for rape. Mental health clinicians don’t do abortions. Mental health treatment for the trauma of rape depends on the level of clinical symptoms the survivor experiences and includes evidence-based treatments like trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy or psychodynamic therapy.



Ending the life of a preborn human being, regardless of how she was conceived, does not address the crime of her father and does not improve the primary victim’s mental health outcomes. One survey showed that 50-80 percent of women who conceived from rape chose to carry their child to term and that 80 percent of women who terminated their pregnancies regretted it. 



The appropriate response to a traumatic pregnancy resulting from rape is compassion, active listening, motivational interviewing, and evidence-based therapeutic modalities. There is no evidence of a mental health benefit to abortion under any circumstance. Even the studies based on the Turnaway cohort, which are often quoted by abortion advocates to claim harm to women from being denied an abortion, show that by five years later, 96 percent of women were glad they did not have an abortion.



With Roe v. Wade overturned, states will now determine their own abortion law. How do you think states can or should best protect their citizens from the harms of abortion?



The beauty of Roe and Casey being overturned is that real discussions can now be had at a state level about what women and preborn children need. We now have the chance for our laws to reflect current medical science — not the science of 50 years ago. Since the Roe decision, huge advances have been made in perinatal medicine, allowing us to save premature babies a full six weeks earlier than we were able to in 1973, and to tackle a host of medical conditions that used to prove fatal to pregnant mothers and their children.



Abortion is a medical attempt to fix a social problem. It merely puts a band-aid on the problems that drive most women to choose abortion. Women deserve better than just a band-aid. They deserve real solutions and real support. I believe individual state and local governments are far better equipped to do this than the federal government.



Pro-life states should want to protect both pregnant women and preborn children. This means offering protections to preborn children by outlawing elective abortion — only allowing treatment of ectopic pregnancies or premature deliveries when the mother’s life is in danger. In addition, women should not be prosecuted for obtaining abortions — the vast majority of women report receiving minimal to no counseling on other options prior to their abortion, and nearly two-thirds felt pressured or coerced into their abortion decisions.



How can pro-life individuals and/or physicians help legislators right now? 



Your representatives are meant to serve you by crafting policies that work best for you and their other constituents. Let them know what these policies should look like by making your voice heard. Let your representatives know the tragic pitfalls of abortion — from ending precious preborn lives to endangering women in a host of different ways, often leaving them with lifelong wounds.



If you are a pro-life physician, your perspective is invaluable. Not only do you have the training to offer a science-based defense of the pro-life position, but you also have the expertise to advise your representatives on what sound pro-life policies would look like. If your representatives are concerned about women’s ability to receive life-saving treatments for pregnancy complications with abortion restrictions, reassure them that the majority of OB-GYNs (76–93 percent) offer comprehensive pregnancy care.



If your legislators are confused about the role of a life-of-mother exception to abortion bans, explain why they are important for you to be able to offer women and children the care they deserve.

"62",62,"These Vulnerable Dems Won’t Say If They Support Unpopular Unfettered Abortion — But They’ve Backed It Before","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-08-18"," Polling shows that half of Democrats — and 71 percent of Americans — would limit abortion to the first trimester, if not sooner. But Democrats running for Senate seats this year support elective abortion for any reason until the moment of birth.



Corporate media claim that pro-lifers face an uphill political battle when it comes to protecting life in the womb, but what they’re not being honest about is the fact that Democrats are peddling radical and unpopular abortion measures far outside the mainstream.



Expanding permission for abortion well into the third trimester far exceeds what the majority of American voters support when it comes to ending unborn life, yet large swaths of Democrat politicians, including those in congressional leadership and those up for election this year, have embraced rhetoric and a legislative agenda that promote abortion during all nine months of pregnancy. 



Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Patty Murray of Washington are all at risk of losing their seats in just a few short months. Yet, they all seem willing to ignore polls recording Americans’ uneasiness with abortion for all without restrictions to stick with their party’s radical platform. 



These six incumbent Democrat senators along with three Democrat Senate candidates John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Val Demings of Florida, and current U.S. House Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, all of whom are facing tough challengers in November, refused to answer questions from The Federalist about whether they specifically back any restrictions on abortions up until the moment of birth. 



Cortez Masto’s office was the only one even to respond to an inquiry. In her reply, a spokeswoman claimed, “The AP, Politifact, and the Reno Gazette Journal have all reported on this misleading question, with Reno Gazette Journal recently noting: ‘Abortion up to the moment of live birth is not a thing, according to obstetricians.’”



Despite their best efforts to pretend they don’t support legislation that threatens the lives of babies developing as late as the third trimester, something acknowledged in even the fake fact checks Cortez Masto’s office referenced, it isn’t hard to decipher from Democrats’ recent statements and legislative track records that none of them have shied away from the radical abortion standards demanded by the left. 



Kelly was one of the 46 Democrats who promoted and voted for the ill-named Women’s Health Protection Act, which, if passed, would have guaranteed unlimited, on-demand abortion in every state. Politifact tried to cover for Kelly with a sham fact-check rating rival candidate Blake Masters’ comments that the incumbent “voted to legalize abortion up until the moment of birth” “mostly false,” but not even their scamming can cover up Kelly’s nonchalance about abortions occurring well into the last stage of gestation. 



Similarly, Bennet, who for years claimed Roe v. Wade was “settled law,” voted with his Democrat colleagues to attempt to codify unlimited abortion. He previously voted against limiting abortion to before 20 weeks gestation, even though constituents like his have shown widespread support for it.



Despite being repeatedly reprimanded by other black pastors for his views, Warnock has already become a top purveyor of the abortion-on-demand agenda. 



Warnock may have tried to dodge answering whether he supports any limits on abortion by simply claiming, “I support a woman’s right to choose,” but it’s apparent the freshman legislator will do anything to expand that beyond the legal limits most Americans desire. That’s why he demanded the Biden administration “use the full force of the federal government to protect abortion access in the United States.” It’s also why he refuses to say whether he would support conscience protections for pro-life doctors with religious objections to abortion.

Cortez Masto claims to “fully support Nevada’s protections that allow women to access abortion care up until 24 weeks and in cases of life or health endangerment thereafter,” but her pro-abortion activism goes far beyond that. She is not only a strong proponent of abortion tourism, the practice of traveling outside of a state where abortion is banned to get one elsewhere, but she is also one of the many Democrats who voted to advance legislation to legalize taxpayer-funded late-term abortions.

Parroting abortion for all and lies about what the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling actually does to abortion in Nevada has become such a key part of her platform that even the Associated Press noticed, writing, “Nevada senator focuses on abortion in critical November race.”



Cortez Masto is not alone. Her Senate colleague Hassan has pledged to “tirelessly defend a women’s right to access abortion.” That doesn’t sound like someone who thinks life should be protected beyond a certain point in pregnancy.

Murray also voted to advance a vote on a bill designed to codify abortion up until birth because, according to her Twitter, abortion “should be available no matter where you live.”

Democrat candidates such as Demings have also promised their commitment to the leftist agenda on abortion. 



Fetterman, in his position as lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, demanded that Senate Democrats “immediately scrap the filibuster and pass the Women’s Health Protection Act.” It wasn’t too long after that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., publicly declared that Fetterman, if elected, could be one of the two votes Democrats need to codify unlimited abortion in the U.S. 



Ryan is even more open about his position. In May, he told Fox News’s Bret Baier that he doesn’t believe in imposing any limits when it comes to abortion.

Democrats seem to believe that “any increase in turnout and enthusiasm in a midterm election” thanks to the overturning of Roe v. Wade “will be vital to their political survival,” but their radical abortion agenda doesn’t sit well with voters. Many Americans support restrictions on abortion up to a certain point, but the Democrats most at risk of losing their elections are campaigning on getting rid of that very thing. 



For years pro-life candidates were framed as desperately trying to overstep their voters’ desires on abortion legislation. But clearly, it’s Democrat lawmakers who are ignoring their constituencies and plowing ahead with an abortion agenda that is supported by hardly anyone but themselves.

"63",63,"‘Don’t Ever Forget To Love,’ And Other Lessons From 30 Years Of Praying At Abortion Facilities","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-12-08"," I have been going to abortion facilities to pray for 30 years. I have watched as “safe and rare” has turned into “abortion at any time for any reason.” I have witnessed the hardening of hearts, which I believe can often be attributed to the silent suffering of those who have experienced abortion. We are told abortion is “women’s health,” that life will go back to “normal” with the termination of an “unwanted pregnancy,” that abortion is common, and even that it “saves lives.” Despite tons of evidence to the contrary, the adverse impact of abortion on millions of women is still denied, leaving them to feel crazy and alone if they in fact don’t find peace with their abortions.  As the abortion debate again fills headlines and minds while the Supreme Court deliberates on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case that could see a reversal of Roe v. Wade, I’ve been feeling that we do not speak clearly enough to the heart of the mother going in for an abortion. Love Them Both The abortion side focuses on the woman and her supposed rights. The pro-life side tends to focus on the baby, in a justified attempt to stop the slaughter of the innocent unborn. I believe we must speak to both the mother and the baby, who have been joined together by a gift from God. With this in mind, I have tried to think of a few slogans to put on my signs that will touch the mother seeking the abortion. The one I currently am using says, “I had an Abortion. Life does NOT go back to normal. Save your baby and yourself. For help call: 800 723 8331.” The number is for Good Counsel Homes, a place mothers can get the help they need to have their babies, including a place to stay, training in life skills, and support throughout their pregnancy and after.  Opponents Target Our Message Because It Works Here in New York, we are often met at the abortion facilities by an extreme pro-abortion group named “New York City for Abortion Rights.” Although they claim we are the ones harassing women by our prayerful presence, they attempt to block our walk to the building from a church where we begin the morning with Mass and adoration, shouting their slogans like “God loves abortion,” “This church harasses Women,” “Abortion is freedom,” and a retinue of others as they bang on their drums to drown out our prayer. Sadly, they honestly believe what they are shouting. Having worked in a ministry of healing from abortion for over 25 years, I recognize the desperate need to keep justifying abortion. I have seen it many times and as someone who had a coerced abortion at 17 years old, I can identify with the emotions they are experiencing. To look at the truth without the light of God’s love would be next to impossible, so they need to stand strong in their rhetoric for the sake of survival. Once at the abortion facility, the participants of NYC for Abortion Rights continue to shout, bang their drums, and block us from any woman who may be coming for an abortion. My sign is a thorn in their side. On more than one occasion they have frantically tried to keep it hidden from the view of the women coming for an abortion. This past Saturday, one of the abortion rights participants continually obstructed the view of the sign telling me she did not want the women “to see that sh-t.” Her own sign spoke to ending “forced birth.”  There’s A Reason Both Sides Care So Strongly As they proclaimed the normality of abortion, it struck me how we actually have much in common. None of our lives have gone back to normal. Abortion has altered us forever. It is not “normal” to spend your Saturday mornings at an abortionist’s office either shouting abortion’s praises or praying for its destruction. Since the passage of Roe v. Wade, abortion has touched millions of women in our country. Most are not in front of abortion facilities. Some never share their experiences, for fear of judgment or because they are oppressed by guilt and shame. Many often keep it to themselves for years, not even telling husbands or others they are close to, living in the fear of being found out. With Dobbs v. Jackson before the Supreme Court, emotions are high. I cannot help but wonder how those living in silent suffering are coping. It must be exceedingly difficult for them as they hear both sides arguing their points with neither somehow speaking to their hearts. I am certain many feel stuck in the middle of a debate that sometimes does not seem to get it. We often speak about these babies in abstracts, but they are not abstract; they are each someone’s child, often the silent suffering. ‘Don’t Ever Forget to Love’ A couple of months ago I dropped my sign at a “Witness for Life” event in Brooklyn. One of the women from NYC for Abortion Rights grabbed it and wrote across the back, “God loves Abortion.” A police officer saw and made her give the sign back to me. To cover up her writing, I placed a picture of Saint Maximillian Kolbe on the back with a quote of his that simply says, “Don’t ever forget to love.” Rev. Fidelis Moscinski, who leads our vigils, often reminds us, before we take to the streets to pray, that we are not to confront the opposition but to remain in prayer. That they are “not our enemies.” Little did I know how significant the back of my sign would become as I continue to pray and be confronted by the angry shouts and actions of the other side. Abortion is the ultimate failure of love. Saint Maximillian Kolbe now reminds me as we are on the streets, “Don’t ever forget to love.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/08/dont-ever-forget-to-love-and-other-lessons-from-30-years-of-praying-at-abortion-facilities/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"64",64,"How Abortion Activists Hijacked The Women’s Movement","Ellen Browder","Sue",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-01-27"," As feminists descend by the hundreds of thousands upon Washington this week—one crowd for the Women’s March last Saturday to protest President Trump’s election and another for the March for Life on Friday to protest the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision—Americans need to step back from the fray and ask three serious questions. Why can’t the elite media see that the fierce abortion debate dividing our nation represents not a war against women but a war between women? When, where, how and why did this catfight between feminists begin? And is there any hope for unity and peace?  As an investigative reporter and author of the book “Subverted: How I Helped the Sexual Revolution Hijack the Women’s Movement,” I spent more than four years seeking answers to these questions. A former Cosmopolitan writer who long defended abortion as a woman’s “right,” I am now so fervently anti-abortion that I was a keynote speaker at last year’s March for Life. Why did I switch sides? For two reasons. First, I had an abortion and as a result suffered from nameless anxiety alternating with depression for decades. Second, I learned how the abortion “right” was inserted into the feminist movement, and I didn’t like what I saw. Feminism Versus the Sexual Revolution While working at Cosmopolitan magazine in 1971, I witnessed what seemed to me then to be a small, insignificant fact but which in hindsight has assumed monumental importance. In those days, the feminist movement and the sexual revolution were two distinctly separate cultural phenomena. Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Helen Gurley Brown would have loved for her sex-revolution magazine to be part of the feminist movement, but Betty Friedan, who had launched the modern feminist movement with her 1963 book “The Feminine Mystique,” called Cosmo “quite obscene and quite horrible.”  Feminists were fighting to achieve equal opportunity for women in education and the workplace. As mother of the women’s movement, Friedan declared that any view of sexual “liberation” that turns a woman into a sex object (as we were doing at Cosmo) is a false freedom that denies a woman’s personhood. Personhood was what Betty said the women’s movement was all about. So how did the sexual revolution’s intensely polarizing demand for abortion get inserted into the feminist movement? Let’s relive the moment together. Visit the Chinese Room of the Mayflower It was November 18, 1967, in the Chinese Room of the Mayflower Hotel. Proclaimed by Harry Truman to be Washington DC’s “second best address” (after the White House), the Mayflower when it opened in 1925 was said to have “more gold leaf than any other U.S. building except the Library of Congress.” In this opulent setting, 105 persons gathered for the National Organization for Women’s second national conference. By midnight that night, this small group of the “intelligent few” had voted on and adopted a “Bill of Rights” that set the political agenda of NOW and the mainstream women’s movement for decades to come.  The two powerful women seated side by side at the head table as the meeting was called to order at 9 a.m. were both founding members of NOW, but they could not be more different. Known for her flamboyant, combative style and domineering bursts of energy, 46-year-old NOW President Betty Friedan was a force to be reckoned with. One journalist described her eyes as “deep, dark, charged, and violent as her language.” Another wrote, “It is, perhaps, a reflection of her mercurial personality that she never looks the same twice. At a lectern she is sometimes earth mother, sometimes bitch, sometimes child. People who admire her find her attractive. To her enemies, she is all the witches from Macbeth.” In dramatic contrast, the tall, dignified, lavender-blue-eyed retired IRS attorney seated next to Betty had a deep aversion to hostility and confrontation. At age 72, Marguerite Rawalt was a veteran Washington insider, a personal friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and suffragist Alice Paul , and one of the few independent activists President John F. Kennedy had appointed in 1961 to his Commission on the Status of Women. Betty grew up as a precocious, lonely Jewish girl in Peoria, Illinois. Marguerite crossed the plains in a covered wagon as a child, grew up on a Texas farm, and never forgot the lessons she learned from her dependable dad. When she went duck hunting at age 70 with her brother, Marguerite shot six ducks, bringing down two with one shot. So how did these two disparate souls wind up sitting side by side, jointly presiding over such a historic meeting? Their differences brought them together. Betty couldn’t run an orderly meeting if her celebrity depended on it. Marguerite was an expert on parliamentary procedure and volunteered to act as Betty’s parliamentarian. NOW’s ‘Bill of Rights’ Eight rights were up for vote at the meeting. Six were adopted unanimously. Everyone in the Chinese Room agreed that it’s a woman’s “right” not to be fired when she gets pregnant and to have paid maternity leave. (In 1969, I was fired from my newspaper job for being pregnant; that was a common business practice in those days.) Another “right” called for working parents to be able to deduct home and child-care expenses on their tax returns. Still another called for a woman’s “right” to be educated to her full potential. Law and medical schools were often still closed to women then, and in some states women weren’t even allowed to serve on a jury. Only two “rights” on the table in the Chinese Room stirred controversy. The first was a demand for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. Congress passed ERA in 1972 but it fell three states short of the 38 needed for ratification by a June 30, 1982 deadline, so that intensely debated “right” is now history. The second “right” that created an absolute uproar among the feminists in the Chinese Room was a demand to repeal all abortion laws. Friedan saved the vote on the abortion “right” for last. Suddenly, without warning, she shocked many delegates, including Marguerite, by belligerently pressing for full repeal of all abortion laws. Marguerite was furious. She deeply opposed the “radical and irresponsible” turn the meeting took, and feared abortion would upstage the genuine legal battles for equality women were fighting. Why was she not told ahead of time that abortion would be on the table? Who’s calling the shots? The angry debate over the abortion “right” waged for hours. One feminist claimed the stand on abortion “is not especially controversial.” Another feminist declared “I’m against murder.” The battle went on and on. When the dust finally settled, the vote was 57-14 in favor of a resolution calling to repeal all abortion laws. Yes, you read that correctly. The abortion “right” that has created so much turmoil in our nation was inserted into the feminist movement’s list of political demands by a mere 57 people. At that very hour, shortly before midnight on November 18, 1967, the once-united women’s movement split into two warring factions: feminists who favored legal abortion on demand versus feminists who opposed it. Love and truth unite. And what does evil do? Evil divides. That divisive plank number eight is the only “right” in NOW’s 1967 political platform that Americans are still angrily fighting over today. Pro-Life Feminists Walk Out Calling a new life “a sacred trust,” Cleveland attorney Betty Boyer was heartsick over the abortion vote. She later resigned from NOW after what she described as “a shouting match” and went back to Ohio, where she founded the Women’s Equity Action League (WEAL). Boyer’s legal team (which included Marguerite) fought successfully to abolish “help wanted (female)” and “help wanted (male)” classified ads in newspapers, opened academia to women, fought for a married woman’s right to get credit in her own name, and worked for the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, which made it illegal to fire a woman just because she was pregnant. One-third of the feminists at that meeting were so angry they walked out and later resigned from NOW over the abortion vote. Another ardent feminist who resigned from NOW over the abortion vote was television broadcaster Paige Palmer. In a scathing resignation letter to Friedan, Palmer said she had looked forward to the conference and set aside other plans to attend, but departed “wishing I had never heard of N.O.W.” Palmer and Boyer both believed the Chinese Room meeting had been intentionally stacked with radicals to ram through the abortion vote. Noting that “there was a group who came [to the meeting] only to see to it that the abortion question was discussed and passed,” Palmer added, “This is known as railroading.” One-third of the feminists at that meeting were so angry they walked out and later resigned from NOW over the abortion vote. Feeding the Press a Packaged Storyline At a press conference the following Monday morning, the hullabaloo in the Chinese Room was completely glossed over. Friedan stood before reporters and announced via a press release that through its new Bill of Rights, NOW was speaking for the New Woman power bloc, a massive force alleged to include “28 million American working women, the millions of women emerging from our colleges each year who are intent on full participation in the mainstream of our society, and mothers who are emerging from their homes to go back to school or work.” As reporters repeatedly hammered home the message that abortion was a “right” every liberated woman wanted and needed, the public began to polarize around the issue. Basically, Betty claimed to be speaking for every working woman in America when, in fact, at least as far as the abortion vote was concerned, she was speaking only for herself and 57 people in the Chinese Room. And that’s how propaganda works, my friends. On Tuesday, Marguerite Rawalt’s worst fears were realized: the Washington Post headlined the abortion vote and reported: “NOW supports the furthering of the sexual revolution of our century by pressing for widespread sex education and provision of birth control information and contraceptives, and by urging that all laws penalizing abortion be repealed.” The press had been hoodwinked, and the sexual revolution and the women’s movement—once radically separate movements—were on the road to becoming united in the eyes of the world. Over time, as reporters repeatedly hammered home the message that abortion was a “right” every liberated woman wanted and needed, the public began to polarize around the issue. The abortion “right,” which attacks all human rights at their very root, launched a hostile culture war. Women Need to Think Outside Today’s Feminism Even Friedan wrote in 2001: “Ideologically, I was never for abortion. Motherhood is a value to me, and even today abortion is not…I believed passionately in 1967, as I do today, that women should have the right of chosen motherhood. For me, the matter of choice has never been primarily the choice of abortion, but that you can choose to be a mother. That is as important as any right written into the Constitution.” We saw angry sex idols like Madonna stand up and imply that they, and only they, speak for all feminists everywhere. As you’ll recall, Betty said a view of sexual “liberation” that turns a woman into a sex object is a false freedom that denies a woman’s personhood. Yet last Saturday, we saw angry sex idols like Madonna stand up and imply that they, and only they, speak for all feminists everywhere. To see today’s March for Life as a legitimate branch of feminism will require many people (journalists included) to open their minds. But that’s exactly what Americans need to be willing to do if we’re to stop vilifying each other, end the polarizing abortion wars, and heal our abortion-wounded nation.

"65",65,"Texas May Once Again Change Abortion Law For The Entire Country","Burke","Denise",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-01-23"," Texas is again at the forefront of the continuing national debate over abortion. In January 1973, the Supreme Court struck down Texas’ prohibition on abortion in Roe v. Wade, unleashing an extreme abortion-on-demand agenda that has claimed more than 50 million children and left millions of American women at the mercy of an under-scrutinized, inadequately regulated, and profit-driven abortion industry. However, another Texas abortion law may soon offer the Court a chance at judicial redemption.
Abortion advocates have recently filed two lawsuits against a 2013 Texas law mandating that abortion clinics meet the same basic health and safety standards as facilities performing other outpatient surgeries, requiring that abortion providers maintain hospital admitting privileges, and prohibiting “webcam abortions” and the unapproved use of the dangerous abortion drug RU-486.
The Fifth Circuit in New Orleans has already upheld Texas’ admitting privileges mandate and its regulations on the use of RU-486, noting that these requirements secure “desirable protection of abortion patients’ health.” Abortion advocates must soon decide whether or not to ask the Supreme Court to review this decision.
Unregulated Abortion Facilities: Clearly Not Safe for Women
The Fifth Circuit heard arguments on January 7 for and against requirements that abortion facilities be licensed and regularly inspected by state health officials, maintain safe and sanitary conditions, employ appropriately trained personnel, and comply with accepted standards for surgical care, including the proper management of post-surgical complications. A decision will likely come later this spring and, regardless of the outcome, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is anticipated.
In fact, the Supreme Court itself is already anticipating the opportunity to review the Texas law. In November 2013, when the Court rejected a request to enjoin the admitting privileges requirement while appeals continued, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, “[T]he underlying legal question—whether the new Texas statute is constitutional—is a difficult question. It is a question, I believe, that at least four Members of this Court will wish to consider irrespective of the Fifth Circuit’s ultimate decision.”
Supreme Court review is granted upon the votes of only four justices. It appears, therefore, that the Court will again review a Texas abortion law. The results of that review are certain to have far-reaching ramifications for the future of abortion in America. 
Abortion Facilities Should Obviously Follow Health and Safety Standards
Despite granting women a constitutional right to abortion, the Roe Court did not, despite self-serving abortion industry claims to the contrary, equate that right with the abortion industry’s right to be free from appropriate regulation and oversight. Instead, Roe specifically found that a state legislature’s legitimate interest in regulating abortion to protect maternal health “obviously extends at least to [regulating] the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that may arise.”
After more than four decades of the abortion industry’s recalcitrant opposition to meaningful oversight, the Supreme Court must unequivocally affirm that it meant what it said in Roe: states may regulate abortion to protect maternal health. It must also rein in lower federal courts that frequently rubberstamp Big Abortion’s profit-maximizing tactics of providing mere access to abortion while refusing to comply with medically justified health and safety standards.
It is important to remember that Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell provided “mere access” to abortion in a clinic where a woman died because a stretcher could not fit through the hallways, where unsterilized instruments spread infections, and where parts of unborn babies were stored in jars like macabre trophies.
The Supreme Court’s Chance to Fix Its Mistake
That the Supreme Court would be unable to escape the abortion debate is the predictable consequence of the Court’s own actions. As New York Times columnist David Brooks acknowledged in 2005, “When [Justice] Blackmun wrote the Roe decision, it took the abortion issue out of the legislatures and put it into the courts … [he] and his concurring colleagues invented a right to abortion, and imposed a solution more extreme than the policies of just about any other comparable nation … The fact is the entire country is trapped.”
The Supreme Court’s decisions in Roe and subsequent abortion cases have “trapped” women in a cycle of victimization at the hands of America’s abortion industry, impeded legislators and state officials seeking to address these abuses, and coarsened and truncated the much-needed public debate over abortion and its implications for women, their families, and society.
When the Texas law reaches the Supreme Court later this year, will the Court redeem itself by prioritizing the states’ responsibility and authority to act in defense of women’s welfare or will it instead permit the abortion industry to continue trumping the will of the people and escaping meaningful oversight? We will soon find out.

"66",66,"Kavanaugh Doesn’t Think Birth Control Is Abortion. In Fact, He Thinks Government Has An Interest In Providing It","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-09-10"," Following a week of theater billed as confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, desperate Democrats turned to the media for help peddling yet another unwarranted attack on the Supreme Court nominee: that Kavanaugh believes birth control is abortion. The charge followed an exchange during Thursday’s hearing when Sen. Ted Cruz asked Kavanaugh, who has served on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006, to explain his dissent in the Priests for Life case. That case, as Kavanaugh noted, involved a Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) challenge to Obamacare’s mandate that insurance pay for birth control.  Kavanaugh laid out for the senators the legal standards governing RFRA claims, explaining the first question was whether the mandate imposed “a substantial burden on the religious exercise.” “And it seemed to me quite clearly it was,” Kavanaugh explained, before adding: “It was a technical matter of filling out a form in that case. They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they, as a religious matter, objected to.” Completely ignoring the legal issues at play and the context of Kavanaugh’s comments, the abortion activist organization NARAL pounced, tweeting (and pinning) the flatly false claim that “Kavanaugh just referred to birth control as ‘abortion-inducing drugs,’ which is not only an anti-science lie, it’s an anti-choice extremist phrase that shows that our right to access both abortion and contraception would be in SERIOUS danger if he is confirmed.”  If You Can Summarize an Idea, You Obviously Agree With It The usual suspects, such as The Huffington Post, quickly joined in to push this false narrative, writing, “On the third day of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he referred to contraception as ‘abortion-inducing drugs.’” By Friday, the mainstream media was actively aiding abortion activists’ misrepresentation, with CNN proclaiming “Brett Kavanaugh’s views on birth control drew scrutiny after he referred to contraceptives as ‘abortion-inducing drugs.’”  New York socialist candidate for U.S. House Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez added her voice, declaring “Brett Kavanaugh doesn’t even know what birth control IS. He doesn’t deserve to pass a 7th grade health class, let alone a Supreme Court confirmation.”   While Ocasio-Cortez’s ignorance of the legal niceties is understandable, the same cannot be said for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who claimed Kavanaugh is “going after birth control.” Harris previously served as California’s attorney general and knew full well that Kavanaugh’s “abortion-inducing drugs” testimony reflected, not his own opinion, but the views of Priests for Life and the other plaintiffs involved in the RFRA lawsuit.  Lest there be any doubt of Kavanaugh’s meaning, one need only look to his actual statement: “They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of abortion-inducing drugs that they, as a religious matter, object to.” Sen. Orrin Hatch’s office called out the distortion, providing a quick fact check for the uninitiated: “The truth: [Kavanaugh] was summarizing another’s argument, using the exact phrase from an opinion.”  For good measure, Hatch’s office screen-grabbed and highlighted the plaintiffs’ “abortion-inducing” argument from the case.   Desperation does tell. Even when called on their deception, Democrats and abortion activists are doubling down. Abortion giant Planned Parenthood’s response proves representative. Following Kavanaugh’s discussion of the Priests for Life case, the nation’s top abortion provider issued a press release leaving out “the words ‘they said,’ making it appear as if Kavanaugh was speaking for himself,” in discussing the litigant’s abortion-inducing drugs argument. When questioned about their misrepresentation of Kavanaugh’s testimony, “a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, acknowledged the error,” yet claimed that because Priests for Life objected to all birth control, Kavanaugh was characterizing “all types of birth control as ‘abortion inducing drugs.’” Nonsense. It is true that in Priests for Life the plaintiffs morally opposed paying for employee health insurance that paid for all forms of birth control. But the plaintiffs themselves distinguished between birth control and abortion-inducing drugs, as seen in their petition for Supreme Court review: “Petitioners object to being forced by the federal government to purchase a healthcare plan that provides access to contraceptives, sterilization, and abortifacients, all of which are prohibited by Petitioners’ religious convictions.” Kavanaugh did not mention the Priests for Life’s opposition to providing coverage for sterlization procedures, which also shows that his reference to abortion-inducing drugs was not intended to cover the totality of the plaintiffs’ objections and thus, in no way, equated birth control to abortion. Kavanaugh Expressed Support for Subsidized Birth Control Since the Democrats will likely continue this charade for the foreseeable future, let’s add one final proof of their fraud. In his dissent, Kavanaugh expressly stated “that the Government has a compelling interest in facilitating women’s access to contraception.” Then, in explaining why this interest is compelling, Kavanaugh posited that “facilitating women’s access to contraception” would reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, which in turn would reduce the number of abortions. If Kavanaugh actually believed that birth control induces abortions, then, contrary to his own analysis in this case, increased access to contraception would increase the number of abortions. In fact, Kavanaugh’s own views aside, increased access to birth control does not necessarily decrease abortions and may increase them. But this was not his argument. The Left’s false flag about Kavanaugh is but half the problem. In casting Kavanaugh as the Grinch who stole birth control, Democrats simultaneously ridicule pro-life claims that some forms of birth control are “abortion-inducing.” Dr. Eugene Gu, whose Twitter thread Ocasio-Cortez retweeted as evidence that Kavanaugh deserved an “F” in middle-school science, took that tack. Gu, who made news last year when he sued President Trump for blocking him on Twitter, called it “horrifying to hear” a Supreme Court nominee refer to birth control as abortion-inducing drugs.   Gu is not the most objective of sources for abortion information. His company, Ganogen, used fetal organs from aborted babies for medical research. In 2014, Gu implanted “the heart and kidney of a human fetus into a rat” and “the organs actually grew inside the rat and sustained its life.” Gu’s source for the fetal organs? StemExpress—the company captured in undercover videos buying aborted baby body parts from Planned Parenthood. Yes, Birth Control Can Kill an Embryo So what does Gu have to say about the claimed abortion-inducing drugs, such as Plan B? That does not cause an abortion, according to the good doctor. But the Food and Drug Administration’s prescribing information clearly states that, in addition to preventing ovulation or fertilization, Plan B “may inhibit implantation (by altering the endometrium).” As such, one mechanism of action of Plan B is abortion-inducing.  Gu also insisted that, although intrauterine devices (IUDs) can prevent the implantation of an embryo, “[t]his is still NOT abortion.” But how so, if Gu also readily admits IUDs prevent an embryo from implanting? By relying on the Orwellian redefinition of pregnancy the pro-abortion medical community pushed in the 1960s. Prior to that, even Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger recognized that destroying a fertilized ovum or embryo constituted an abortion. Here’s Sanger in a 1932 article promoting birth control: “Some ill-informed persons have the notion that when we speak of birth control we include abortion as a method. We certainly do not. Abortion destroys the already fertilized ovum or the embryo; contraception, as I have carefully explained, prevents the fertilizing of the ovum by keeping the male cells away. Thus it prevents the beginning of life.” While the science didn’t change, the times did, and 1959 saw Dr. Bent Boving, a featured speaker at a Planned Parenthood symposium, arguing for changing the definition of conception from when fertilization occurs to when implantation occurs. Boving explained that “the social advantage of [birth control] being considered to prevent conception rather than to destroy an established pregnancy could depend upon something so simple as a prudent habit of speech.” Then in 1965, the pro-abortion American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology followed Boving’s lead and redefined “conception” as from fertilization to implantation, thus labeling women pregnant only following implantation. Viola: no pregnancy, no abortion. So, contrary to the pro-abortion Left’s claimes, pro-lifers aren’t anti-science—we are just anti-redefining-science. Where Kavanaugh stands on the issue, though, isn’t known because he wasn’t offering his views, but those of Priests for Life. Anyone listening to, or reading about, the exchange in good faith would know that. In other words, everyone except the mainstream media and Democrats.

"67",67,"The Left Won’t Tell Women That Abortion Can Cost Them Their Future Family","Hawkins","Kristan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-01"," Spoiler Alert: For fans of Amazon Prime, trending now is season one of a show called “Utopia,” in which John Cusack plays a billionaire madman who wants to “solve” overpopulation by tricking the world into believing in a global pandemic so he can sell a vaccine that actually sterilizes people. For most of humanity, a medical event ends a person’s ability to have a family. With abortion, the parallels between fact and this fiction are uncomfortably close.  Why women have abortions is a topic much discussed by those who argue that ending a life in the womb is sometimes necessary. The Guttmacher Institute, the abortion industry think tank established by Planned Parenthood, published a survey examining 32 studies in 27 countries and found that “[w]orldwide, the most commonly reported reason women cite for having an abortion is to postpone or stop childbearing.” What wasn’t reported, however, was how one thing might lead to a woman’s inability to have children at all. Fully informed consent to any abortion, whether surgical or chemical, should include the long-term implications for women’s fertility, as some women will later find they’ve lost the ability ever to have a child. The abortion industry’s failures to educate women on what might happen to their own bodies following an abortion should be considered malpractice. Some abortion advocates try to downplay the potential loss. Some argue that telling women about their own bodies is somehow a violation of abortion vendors’ First Amendment rights, but informed consent is not a violation of our rights but a precondition for fulfilling them. Abortion ends lives, hurting women and preborn children. Maybe people shouldn’t be surprised that a predatory abortion business profiting from such deaths isn’t doing enough to make sure women’s future fertility survives a visit to an abortionist, fighting common-sense laws for informed consent. Protecting infants is the opposite of their business model, but women deserve to know how choosing abortion might mean they never have a child.  Abortionists Are Looking out for Themselves, Not Women Before any abortion, women must be screened for their blood types. When a woman has an Rh-negative blood type, which affects 15 percent of the population, and her partner is Rh-positive, antibodies can build up in a woman’s body that may leave a first child alone but will attack future pregnancies, which can result in miscarriage. There is a solution: a shot of Rh immunoglobulin that will neutralize the antibodies if given in time. If not, those antibodies will remain in the mother, ready to attack the blood of a future child. The abortion lobby, however, has started to argue that they should not have to screen for Rh-negative status, especially for chemical abortions, because it’s “not a requirement” and because so many who are handing out chemical abortion pills haven’t set up medical practices that stock shots of Rh immunoglobulin to protect women. Writing in the journal Contraception, a who’s who of abortion-industry thought leaders concluded: “Early abortion continues to expand outside of traditional clinics, through telemedicine, self-managed medication abortion, or in smaller offices that do not specialize in obstetrical care. Consequently, requiring Rh testing and anti-D immunoglobulin as part of abortion care is becoming a barrier.”  The barrier, however, is not for women but for those who want to sell abortion pills without health and safety standards. Abortion Can Cause Preterm Birth Another complication for post-abortive women is the risk of preterm birth, noted by more than 130 studies. In the journal Human Reproduction, an abortion-friendly publication, researchers note the issues for future pregnancies, writing, “Although legal induced abortion is considered safe, its potential impact on subsequent fertility, ectopic pregnancy and the length of gestation is a public health concern. …  Previous studies have identified a significant relationship between history of induced abortion and spontaneous preterm birth.” Damage to a woman’s body from abortion can come from complications “including pelvic infection, fever, tissue retention, bleeding and cervical trauma,” which can contribute to early births. One study found that 31.5 percent of preterm births could be traced to abortion. Preterm birth (occurring before 37 weeks) is a serious event and the leading cause of the deaths of children under five worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, the preterm delivery of a baby is the leading cause of infant death. Another study looking at worldwide data noted that the risk of preterm birth increased with the number of abortions. The World Health Organization also reported that around the world, in countries with reliable data, “preterm birth rates are increasing,” but they disproportionately affect some people. Consider that although black women make up only 13 percent of the population, in 2016, they had 38 percent of all abortions tracked. That community also experiences a higher pre-term birthrate than women of other races. Abortions Can Severely Hurt or Kill the Mother Abortions can also increase the chance of a pregnancy implanting in the wrong location, risking the lives of both mother and child. A study published in the National Library of Medicine notes that abortions can increase a woman’s chance of an ectopic pregnancy, a condition in which rather than implanting in the womb, a fertilized egg implants in a woman’s fallopian tube, where it will not be able to survive and a woman can experience life-threatening bleeding. That risk of ectopic pregnancy does not include women who lost a child through miscarriage. The study followed up on one from about 20 years ago that determined there was a 10-fold risk of ectopic pregnancies for those who had an abortion. Most severe of all is the fact that removing a woman’s uterus by a hysterectomy sometimes takes place after abortion, ending her ability to carry her own child. The shoddy conditions and gruesome practices of abortion vendors have been well documented. The patient’s needs and safety are sacrificed in such conditions. Both chemical and surgical abortion can impose severe short- and long-term complications for women who were told the life-ending event is a quick and easy fix. Some women don’t know that agreeing to an abortion means more than just that child will be lost to them forever. One in five cases of abortion can result in “a major complication that requires an overnight hospital stay, a blood transfusion or surgery.” That’s just the beginning. Infertility is on the rise in America, as today almost 12 percent of women are having difficulty getting pregnant. To head off that kind of heartbreak, fully informed consent, Rh-negative treatment, and follow-up care after all abortions must be required of the abortion industry so it does not quietly and negligently shut down a family’s future.

"68",68,"Judge’s Abortion Pill Opinion Tells The Truth About ‘Unborn Humans,’ And The Left Can’t Stand It","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-04-10"," “Unborn humans.” “Eugenics.” “Head, hands, and legs, with defined fingers and toes.” “Shame, regret, anxiety, depression, drug abuse, and suicidal thoughts.”



Federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s Friday decision freezing the FDA’s approval of the abortion-pill combination, mifepristone and misoprostol, included these phrases and more. And while the left is already attacking Kacsmaryk’s 67-page straight-talking opinion in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA by framing it as filled with anti-abortion rhetoric, the Trump appointee stuck to the facts — something Americans desperately need to hear after decades of euphemistic discussions about abortion.



After a brief introduction in which Kacsmaryk highlighted the FDA’s two decades of stonewalling that delayed a legal challenge to the 2000 approval of the abortion drugs, the court opened with the basic facts. The plaintiffs — doctors and medical associations that provide health care to pregnant and post-abortive women and girls — sued the FDA, challenging several administrative actions related to the approval of the chemical abortion drugs. 



‘Unborn Humans’



The court then explained the drugs and their functioning: “Mifepristone — also known as RU-486 or Mifeprex — is a synthetic steroid that blocks the hormone progesterone, halts nutrition, and ultimately starves the unborn human until death.” But “because mifepristone alone will not always complete the abortion,” the court continued, “the FDA mandates a two-step drug regimen: mifepristone to kill the unborn human, followed by misoprostol to induce cramping and contractions to expel the unborn human from the mother’s womb.”



Calling an unborn human an “unborn human” immediately triggered abortion activists, but as Kacsmaryk explained in a footnote, such terminology is scientifically correct, whereas the lawyers and courts “often use the word ‘fetus’ to inaccurately identify unborn humans in unscientific ways.” 



“The word ‘fetus,’” Kacsmaryk explained, “refers to a specific gestational stage of development, as opposed to the zygote, blastocyst, or embryo stages.” And because the FDA’s approval of the abortion drugs applies at multiple “gestational stages,” the word “fetus” would be inaccurate.



It is understandable that abortion activists want to hide the humanity of unborn humans, but that doesn’t make the science less real: It just means girls and women who have bought the “clump of cells” narrative will suffer when faced with the truth, which chemical “at home abortions” force. 



“The mother seeing the aborted human ‘appears to be a difficult aspect of the medical termination process which can be distressing, bring home the reality of the event and may influence later emotional adaptation,’” the court wrote, based on the record evidence. “For example, one woman was surprised and saddened to see that her aborted baby ‘had a head, hands, and legs’ with ‘[d]efined fingers and toes.’” 



Another woman alleged that “she did not receive an ultrasound or any other physical examination before receiving chemical abortion drugs from Planned Parenthood.” According to the record, “The abortionist misdated the baby’s gestational age as six weeks, resulting in the at-home delivery of a ‘lifeless, fully formed baby in the toilet,’ later determined to be around 30-36 weeks old.” 



Harm to Women



Beyond exposing the reality that abortion kills an unborn human, Kacsmaryk’s opinion also refuted the “popular belief and talking points” that using the abortion pill is “as easy as taking Advil.” Here, the federal judge detailed the factual evidence. Among other things, “bleeding from a chemical abortion, unlike surgical abortion, can last up to several weeks,” and by being done at home, “without physician oversight,” it can lead “to undetected ectopic pregnancies, failure of rH factor incompatibility detection, and misdiagnosis of gestational age — all leading to severe or even fatal consequences.” 



The opinion also countered the claim that side effects are rare by highlighting evidence that “over sixty percent of women and girls’ emergency room visits after chemical abortions are miscoded as ‘miscarriages’ rather than adverse effects to mifepristone.” 



The evidence also shows emotional and psychological injury, Kacsmaryk stressed, with 77 percent of women who underwent a chemical abortion reporting “a negative change” after the at-home abortion, and 38 percent of women reporting issues “with anxiety, depression, drug abuse, and suicidal thoughts because of the chemical abortion.” 



While the abortion industry prefers to cite its own evidence, as Kacsmaryk noted, those studies are flawed both because of the miscoding of chemical abortions as miscarriages and because the FDA stopped requiring the reporting of non-fatal adverse reactions.



Eugenic Roots



The left also didn’t like Kacsmaryk exposing the eugenic beliefs of the Population Council, which had sought FDA approval for the abortion drugs. John D. Rockefeller founded the Population Council in 1952, “after he convened a conference with ‘population activists’ such as Planned Parenthood’s director and several well-known eugenicists,” the court wrote. Attendees of that conference discussed “the problem of ‘quality,’” and concluded that “[m]odern civilization had reduced the operation of natural selection by saving more ‘weak’ lives and enabling them to reproduce,” thereby resulting in “a downward trend in … genetic quality.”



Many Americans remain oblivious to the historical backdrop eugenics played to the abortion movement, and activist groups prefer they remain in the dark. The sunlight Kacsmaryk shined upon that truth infuriates them.



Political Pressure



Judge Kacsmaryk also exposed the political pressure placed on the FDA to approve the abortion drug — something Americans are likely to appreciate more today in the aftermath of the FDA’s hasty approval of the Covid mRNA shots. 



In the case of the abortion pill, the FDA took the unprecedented step of arranging a meeting between the French pharmaceutical company that owned the patent rights and the eventual drug sponsor, the Population Council. “The purpose of the FDA-organized meeting was ‘to facilitate an agreement between those parties to work together to test [mifepristone] and file a new drug application.’” 



Evidence further shows the Department of Health and Human Services “initiated” another meeting to determine how the Clinton administration “might facilitate successful completion of the negotiations” between the French firm and the Population Council to ensure the group secure patent rights and eventual FDA approval.” In fact, Clinton’s HHS secretary “believed American pressure on the French firm was necessary.”



Then after the Population Council submitted a new drug application, the FDA proposed detailed restrictions to address safety concerns, including that the drug be administered by doctors “trained and authorized by law” to perform surgical abortions; trained in administering mifepristone and treating adverse events; and able to provide treatment at a medical facility that had the equipment necessary to perform surgical abortions, resuscitation procedures, and blood transfusion, within one hour’s drive. The FDA’s restrictions were leaked to the press, prompting a political firestorm. 



So Much for Safety



The FDA later abandoned the above safety mandates and approved the drug for use to kill unborn humans aged seven-weeks gestation or younger. The FDA further required three “in-person office visits: the first to administer mifepristone, the second to administer misoprostol, and the third to assess any complications and ensure there were no fetal remains in the womb.” All adverse events were also required to be reported. 



In 2002, the FDA removed even more of the safety restrictions, increasing the maximum gestational age from seven-weeks gestation to 10-weeks gestation, reducing the number of office visits from three to one, increasing the drug dosage, allowing non-doctors to prescribe and administer chemical abortions, and eliminating the requirement for non-fatal adverse reactions to be reported. Then in 2019, the FDA approved a generic version of the abortion pills, and on April 12, 2021, the FDA announced it would allow abortion pills to be dispensed through the mail. 



“Whether FDA abandoned its proposed restrictions because of political pressure or not,” the court wrote, “one thing is clear: the lack of restrictions resulted in many deaths and many more severe or threatening adverse reactions.” But “due to FDA’s lax reporting requirements, the exact number is not ascertainable,” Kacsmaryk stressed. 



Straight Facts



But it was not on politics that Kacsmaryk based his decision to freeze the FDA’s approval of the abortion pill. Rather, in his methodical opinion, the federal judge explained that the FDA lacked the authority to accelerate approval of the drug under what is called “Subpart H” of the FDA. That subpart only allows for accelerated approval of drugs that treat “serious or life-threatening illnesses” — something pregnancy is not. 



Kacsmaryk also concluded the evidence the FDA supposedly relied upon to approve the abortion drugs failed to support the conclusion that they were “safe and effective under particular conditions of use.” And finally, Kacsmaryk held the FDA’s approval of mail distribution violated the 1873 Comstock Act, which makes it illegal to use the mail to deliver any “article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” 



The Biden administration has already filed a notice of appeal with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and in issuing his opinion in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, Kacsmaryk entered a temporary stay, which he or the court of appeals will likely make permanent pending resolution of the case. Thus, abortion pills will remain available for now. 



How the Fifth Circuit and eventually the Supreme Court will rule remains to be seen, but what is clear now is the abortion-loving left is desperate to keep the truth about abortion from the public and is furious that Kacsmaryk dared to expose the reality: Abortion kills unborn humans.

"69",69,"With ‘Abortion Provider Appreciation Day,’ Democrats Openly Celebrate Executioners","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-03-15"," Hangmen used to be shunned. For most of human history, it was presumed that executions were sometimes right, just, and necessary for upholding the law and maintaining order, but those who dealt out death in cold blood were nonetheless considered unsavory. And it is still shocking to our sensibilities that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has declared an Executioner Appreciation Day.



Wait, my mistake. That was Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker declaring an Abortion Provider Appreciation Day. Pritzker was fulsome in his praise for abortionists’ “courage, compassion, and dedication to their work.” He expounded upon how essential abortion is, and how excellent it is that Illinois is an abortion tourism destination.



So much for safe, legal, and rare.



That famous formulation from the charismatic half of the Clintons was mendacious (Bill Clinton supported even the most gruesome of late-term abortions) but politically effective. It appealed to voters who regarded elective abortion with the sort of attitude their ancestors held toward the man in the black hood and his work — as an undesirable but sometimes necessary evil. They might have wanted to permit abortion, but they still believed it was bad and wished for it to be infrequent and out of sight. They were not particularly consistent or principled, but they were genuinely discomfited by abortion, and they recoiled at the suggestion that they were pro-abortion.



But those who are celebrating abortionists are indisputably pro-abortion. These unabashed cheerleaders for abortion now include the leaders of the Democrat Party, as well as its activist base. Bill Clinton’s (rhetorical) moderation on the subject is long gone, and his successors tout abortion as a positive good and abortionists as heroes.



Of course, the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision overturning Roe v. Wade has pushed Democrat politicians to emphasize their support for abortion, but their evolution from “safe, legal, and rare” to rejoicing over abortionists and their work has been evident for many years.



An obvious reason for this change is that the years since Roe was decided have seen the major political parties become much more internally ideologically unified. Pro-life Democratic politicians (Joe Biden began his career as one) are almost extinct. And while moderate Democratic voters may find the thought of celebrating abortion to be gross, they are not yet disgusted enough to do anything about it.



Establishing Equality



This increased political polarization highlights how the issue of elective abortion implicates an entire worldview and way of life. As Erika Bachiochi explains, abortion is seen as a fix for the asymmetry of human sexual reproduction and the particular risks and burdens it places on women. Abortion offers a technological solution to nature’s injustice. Without abortion as a backstop, women will take on far more risk in sex, with a multitude of possible physical, social, and economic consequences. This is why abortion advocates believe that without abortion, women cannot be sexually and economically — and therefore socially and politically — equal to men.



But this perceived remedy to the injustice and inequality of nature is itself unjust and unequal. In this age of ultrasound, we can no longer effectively lie to ourselves about the lives violently ended by abortion. We have all seen the pulsing heartbeats and the tiny fingers. There is no justice in ending these developing human lives.



Nor does killing the unborn establish equality. Rather, it reinforces the presumption that women are defective men who must be made to conform to a male model of sexuality and reproduction. Abortion gives women “equality” through the violent repression of their natural and healthy fertility, and it demands they do so in order to fit into market and public squares that take maleness as normative. Abortion provides a violent supposed solution that perpetuates the problems that make abortion seem necessary.



No Repentance



Thus, challenges to abortion put into question everything from our sexual culture to our economic order. And it will often feel personal — because it is personal. It is hard for individuals and societies to admit that their way of life is premised on something bad, even wicked. For many people, acknowledging abortion is wrong means admitting great personal guilt.



Repentance is difficult, but refusing to repent produces further evil as we seek to justify our wrongdoing. This is why we so often look for ways to accuse those we have wronged, or to excuse the evil we have done as necessary, even good. Thus, those facing the enormity of complicity in abortion are tempted to double down rather than repent. They would rather celebrate abortion than admit to any wrongdoing.



This is why abortion activists want abortion to be the only choice for women with an unexpected pregnancy. This is why Democrats have done nothing about the surge of violent attacks against pro-lifers who are helping mothers and their children. Pro-lifers donate to buy diapers and car seats for babies in need; abortion activists donate to abortion funds while harassing and firebombing the pregnancy resource centers that give away those diapers and car seats.



The day after his abortion celebration, Pritzker declared it “an honor to attend mass at Old St. Pat’s this morning for this time-honored tradition.” For him, there was no meaning in the church beyond another photo op in service of his ambitions. But though the governor is a very rich and powerful man, he would be wise to remember that a day is coming when neither his wealth nor his political machine will avail him. He will die and stand before God as powerless as those tiny innocents whose deaths he encourages and applauds.

"70",70,"Big Abortion Strikes Out In Street Protests Against Pregnancy Help Centers","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-09-05"," For all the bluster about “choice,” “access,” and “reproductive health,” the abortion industry and its assorted fans in Hollywood, politics, and the media have a remarkable tendency to swing for the fences and come up empty. That fact is becoming clearer to see every day. Take, for instance, the recently failed “Expose Fake Clinics” campaign, starring Comedy Central and leftist icon Lizz Winstead and her abortion-extremist group, “Lady Parts Justice League.” Seeking to “expose” pregnancy centers that offer women the help they need to make an informed choice during an unexpected pregnancy, all Lady Parts Justice League exposed was its own ignorance of the facts.  That and the Left’s steely opposition to anything that could possibly dent abortion’s cultural and financial stronghold. Cash flow and cultural currency—not “choice,” “access” or “reproductive health”—are at stake, and abortion profiteers know it. The Left’s Science Deniers Perhaps that’s why, in addition to organizing a spate of protests at life-affirming pregnancy centers this summer, abortion absolutists have upped the ante (or is it “anti”?) in their fight against “Abortion Pill Reversal (APR),” a medical intervention that can halt a chemical abortion after a woman has taken the first of two pills involved in the RU-486 regimen. Even though the APR network now includes more than 350 physicians who credit it with having saved the lives of 300 babies in the past 10 years, pro-abortion outlets like Rewire.com and DAME magazine, as well as mainstream outlets like The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, continue to refer to it as “junk science.” While the research on APR is still in its initial stages—APR researchers expect to release a major paper in the coming months—the abortion lobby’s knee-jerk resistance to the process says plenty about where “reproductive health” and “choice” rank on their hierarchy of values. Actually, the abortion industry’s decision to couch its lethal agenda as “reproductive health” breaks down far more easily than that: “Abortion is neither ‘reproductive’ nor ‘healthy.’” Discuss.  Where Abortion and Access Collide Meanwhile, when they’re not busy smearing the pro-life movement as closet racists or rapists, abortion-mongers like those at NARAL Pro-Choice America—an ironic name if ever there was one—are doing everything in their power to keep women headed for abortuaries from even interacting with a pro-lifer on the street. In Chicago, pro-life advocates are continuing to fight for the right to speak with women outside of abortion mills, a fight that has gone on since 2009. Under a current city ordinance known as a “bubble zone,” no pro-life citizen can come within eight feet of any woman heading to an abortion clinic once she comes within 50 feet of the front door. The ordinance, introduced under the “pro-choice” guise, effectively strips a woman of choice by trampling on her right to make the most informed decision possible about her own pregnancy. This strikes at the very heart of the “choice” and “access” abortion devotees claim to hold so dear. In an August 21 donor appeal, NARAL president Ilyse Hogue bemoaned the fact that Kentucky’s last remaining abortion mill, EMW Women’s Surgical Center in Louisville, may be on its way out of business. Painting a rather drastic picture of a “mob of dozens of anti-choice fanatics trying to block the entrance” to the abortion business, Hogue later bewailed the fact that women could access a pro-life pregnancy center right next door instead of ending their children’s lives through abortion at EMW Women’s Surgical Center.  In the fantasy world Hogue portrays, where peaceful protests and sidewalk counseling are depicted as a bread riot in the Soviet Union, reality holds no value. Neither do “choice” or “access”—to anything other than abortion, that is. Pro-Choice? Not So Much Because they couldn’t find anything productive to do with 10 days out of their summer, Winstead and Co. scoured the country to dig up as much dirt as they could on life-affirming pregnancy centers, which serve women with free ultrasounds, pregnancy tests, post-abortive counseling, peer counseling, parenting classes, and material aid like diapers and car seats. What we might call the “anti-anti-choice” crusade targeted locally funded pregnancy help centers and ultrasound-equipped medical clinics across the country with online and on-site demonstrations, all focused on demonizing anyone with the gumption to offer an alternative to abortion. Although the campaign—which one Cincinnati pregnancy center director called “underwhelming” after a handful of abortion fans picketed her center—identified more than 4,000 centers on their hit list, only 40 locations were actually subjected to any sort of pro-abortion presence as part of the effort. The crusade was doomed from the start. At its initial rally, a man and his toddler walked up on Lady Parts Justice League’s protest outside the very place where his son’s life had been rescued from abortion. Confronting Winstead’s un-funny fiction, the man insisted that pro-abortion protesters look at his toddler and reckon with the fact that he was standing there because of the center’s work. He wasn’t the only former pregnancy center client to speak up on behalf of the ministries under fire from “Expose Fake Clinics.” One mother, who chose life with the help of a Minnesota pregnancy center, actually thought the whole campaign was a joke before realizing that Winstead and her troupe actually meant business. Running on Fumes Another telling moment came as the campaign made a stop in Columbus, Ohio, at a pregnancy help clinic serving women just across a side street from a Planned Parenthood that aborts babies in a minority-heavy, low-income area. When one pro-lifer, a pastor in Columbus, approached protesters and calmly asked why they were there and what they were hoping to accomplish, he met the same deluge of accusations against pregnancy centers that have poured forth from pro-abortion groups like NARAL for the past decade. Rather than argue point-for-point, his response cut right to the heart of the issue. Far better to be accused of dishonesty than to be unashamedly committed to monetized killing. “On one hand, you have someone supposedly lying and one hand you have someone killing,” he said. “If I had to [pick between] the two, I’d go with the lying.” Winstead’s campaign was followed by another planned protest at a pregnancy center, this time in Atlanta, where 150 abortion absolutists showed up August 12 to register their disdain for Cura Women’s Health Clinic, an ultrasound-equipped medical clinic that has saved 180 babies from abortion thus far in 2017. Although 150 protesters may sound like quite the crowd, it’s really not all that impressive when you realize its organizers—including Lady Parts Justice League, Reproaction, and SisterSong—were pulling from a Google and Facebook-backed “Netroots Nation” conference that gathered 3,000 leftists at a downtown hotel less than a mile away from the pregnancy center. Coming just minutes after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged the same crowd to stand unapologetically for abortion, the paltry Atlanta protest may be the best indicator yet of just how much ground abortion fanatics like Warren are losing even among their own constituency. The old euphemisms just aren’t holding up, and there’s no candid way to defend an idea as ugly as abortion.

"71",71,"To Find Out Whether Outlawing Abortion Hurts Mothers, Look At Data From Chile","Schmoll","Zachary","D.",NA,NA,NA,"2017-02-02"," Chile has some of the strongest abortion laws in the world, so according to many pro-choice activists, maternal mortality must be incredibly high and abortion rates ought to be relatively consistent with countries where abortion is legal. The situation is purportedly so bleak that a law legalizing abortion is one vote away from passing in the Chilean senate, according to Fox News. This law would decriminalize abortion before 12 weeks gestation if the life of the mother is at stake, the fetus is not expected to survive, or the conception was caused by rape. For mothers younger than 14 years old, abortion would be decriminalized up until 18 weeks of pregnancy.  This stance supposes that unplanned pregnancies will still force women to choose abortion even if it is illegal, because the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy are so horrible that women will do anything to avoid them. Without a regulated and legal way to do that, they will go to black-market abortion doctors who do not adhere to the same safety standards as regulated clinics are supposed to. This makes the procedure more dangerous for these mothers and consequently more lethal. Why Ban It If It Won’t Help Anything By following this logic, prohibiting abortion would do nothing to reduce abortion rates, while causing higher maternal mortality rates. Writers such as Nathalie Baptiste of The American Prospect and Joyce Arthur of the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada have presented the argument for maternal mortality rate increases when abortion was restricted, and it seems to be a general pro-choice assumption. The Guttmacher Institute also emphasizes that abortion rates are not lower in countries that have highly restrictive abortion laws, but then proceeds to say this is not necessarily because of the prohibition but because women have less access to contraception in these often poorer countries. Comparing those numbers to North America or Western Europe, where abortion laws are very liberal, is difficult to do because of this difference in contraception access. Even though abortion rates are higher in these countries, the socioeconomic differences are a confounding variable that makes it impossible to truly evaluate if these strong abortion laws actually lower the number of abortions that would have happened if those laws had not been in place. So let’s see if the data actually support this supposition in Chile. That is more important than emotional appeals or false comparisons.  Let’s Start with a Study Elard Koch, the director of research at the Center for Experimental Embryonic Medicine and Maternal Health in Chile, conducted a study entitled, “The Epidemiology of Abortion and Its Prevention in Chile.” Based on his research, even though it is not possible to exactly measure the number of abortions in Chile every year since they are obviously not reported to government entities, there are an estimated 13,553 and 18,071 abortions in that country every year between 2001 and 2008. He developed these estimates by looking at the discharge records of mothers who were hospitalized for certain conditions that are consistent with poorly performed abortions or abortion-inducing drugs. Since not every woman hospitalized for bleeding, for example, necessarily had an abortion, these estimates could be a bit high. These numbers are then modified by what Koch refers to as a failure rate. In other words, a failure is when an abortion causes complications. Obviously, not every abortion done by illegal means has complications, so those would be entirely unreported and not included in the hospital data. Koch adjusts for that to make sure that he is not missing these. Now Let’s Do Some Calculations During that same time period, the average number of children born per year in Chile was 239,263. Therefore, to create an interval, Chile is looking at abortion ratio of approximately 5.3 percent to 7.0 percent by dividing the number of estimated abortions by the sum of the number of estimated abortions and live births. In other words, it is the ratio between the number of children aborted out of the total number of children who could have potentially been born.  For the sake of comparison, in 2013 in the United States, the ratio is approximately 200 abortions per 1,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control. To apply the same metric, the United States has a ratio of 16.67 percent, or 200 abortions per 1,200 potential live births. The difference is striking. Even at the upper bound of Koch’s estimate, the abortion rate in Chile is still remarkably lower than the rate in the United States. That seems to indicate that prohibition does indeed lower the number of abortions overall. While it does not eliminate the problem, it seems that reduction contradicts the narrative that abortion rates will be essentially the same despite whether abortion is legal. Turning to maternal mortality rates, then, Koch reports that Chile’s maternal mortality rate is 0.4 deaths per 100,000 live births. In comparison, the National Institutes of Health in the United States reports a maternal mortality rate of 0.6 deaths per 100,000 live births. Chile is obviously slightly lower, but the results are roughly comparable. So, at the very least, this justification for legalizing abortion doesn’t seem to hold up either. According to the pro-choice narrative, maternal mortality rates should be remarkably higher in Chile, but the evidence doesn’t seem to support that. The narrative ultimately crumbles. The data appears to contradict the idea that either abortion rates remain constant or maternal mortality rises when legal abortions are prohibited. This article is not a suggestion that Chile has everything figured out or is somehow beyond improvement. However, it is a call for pro-lifers to realize that we don’t need to buy into the pro-choice narrative. When we consider the data, it is not the case that protecting unborn children by making abortion illegal would either increase or even maintain the number of abortions performed or increase maternal mortality.

"73",73,"Wrong, Hillary: No Medical Evidence Finds Abortion Can Save A Mother’s Life","Reardon","David","C.",NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-26"," In the most recent presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed late-term abortions are sometimes necessary to save women’s lives. That’s great rhetoric, but it is not supported by even a single medical study. Before examining the “abortion to save women’s lives” question, it is first important to note that only about 1.2 percent of abortions (about 15,000 per year) take place after 20 weeks of gestation. Of these, a good portion are due to partner abandonment or parental pressure.  Another chunk are due to an adverse diagnosis of fetal development or simply fear of a fetal defect after exposure to some drug, for example. So only a small percentage of late-term abortions are done with the sole intent of saving the mother from a dying from complications with pregnancy. But even that small number of “lifesaving” abortions is questionable, because the best medical evidence reveals that of the few women who die of disease while pregnant it appears there’s not even one cause of death abortion can prevent (see “Therapeutic Abortion: The Medical Argument,” in the Irish Medical Journal). Abortion Is Never a Lifesaving Procedure Here’s a quick example. Abortion is often recommended for pregnant women who are diagnosed with cancer. But there is zero evidence that those who have abortions are more likely to beat cancer or survive compared to those who refuse abortion. Similarly, the researchers found, there was not a single death among the women who died that an induced abortion could have predicted or prevented. Now, skeptics may rightly wonder if they should trust my reliance on a single study. In response, I’ll note this study has been around for more than 20 years and no one advocating an abortion has published a study to dispute these findings—despite the abortion industry’s access to hundreds of millions of abortion records worldwide. If they had data to support the myth that abortion saves lives, they would have published it. Absent any evidence, they simply ignore contrary evidence and continue to appeal to the “common sense” myth that abortion is necessary, at least in some hard cases, to save women’s lives.  The lack of medical evidence for any benefit from abortion (in saving women’s lives) is further magnified by the fact that record linkage studies have proven that abortion is associated with a decline in overall health and increase in short- and longer-term mortality rates among women exposed to abortion. There is even a dose effect, with the negative effects on longevity multiplied with each exposure to abortion. So not only does abortion fail to reduce mortality rates among women, it actually contributes to higher mortality rates (most notably in a three-fold increased risk of suicide compared to women not pregnant and a six-fold increased risk compared to those who carry to term), but also due to other negative impacts on women’s health. Doctors Want Abortion to Save Themselves Trouble The real reason doctors recommend abortion for pregnant women facing a disease is that abortion makes it easier for the doctor to focus on just her disease. Abortion instantly reduces the number of patients doctors have to worry about by half. After an abortion, doctors no longer have to avoid treatments that may hurt the baby. Plus, they no longer have to worry about lawsuits in the unlikely event the baby will be born with any birth defects, which may or may not be associated with the doctors’ treatment decisions. In short, many, if not most, “therapeutic” abortions are of more benefit to the doctor’s interests than the woman’s interests.  It is also very clear in the medical literature that women who undergo a “therapeutic” abortion experience the highest rates of depression, grief, guilt, divorces, and other psychological problems. The negative psychological effects of late-term pregnancy are undisputed, even by pro-abortion experts. It’s doubtful parents considering a late-term abortion are informed of this, however, especially when there is any indication of fetal anomaly. In these cases, those advising abortion are often operating from a eugenic mindset. They are ideologically biased to encourage abortion of the “unfit” and to exaggerate the negatives of carrying to term while underestimating the psychological, physical, familial, and spiritual costs of inducing an abortion. As can be easily imagined, the psychological costs for women (and their families) who originally intended to carry to term are magnified by the fact that they were originally excited about having a child, have been bonding with their babies for many months, and only after this bonding have felt “obligated” to abort for therapeutic reasons. Here’s the bottom line: even if a doctor is convinced abortion is necessary to save a woman’s life, he or she should disclose to the patient and her family that a “therapeutic” abortion poses its own risks to her future physical and mental health. The doctor should also admit that the recommendation to abort can only be justified by appeals to the “art of medicine,” not any actual statistically validated studies.

"74",74,"These Pro-Life Republican Victories Show Abortion Radicalism Isn’t The Winner Democrats Want It To Be","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-11-09"," Democrats wanted to make the 2022 midterms about the death of Roe v. Wade but several key Republican wins prove the left’s abortion obsession isn’t always a winning issue. 



Vulnerable Democrats in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and other key states pushed abortion to the top of their campaign priorities heading into the midterms. 



Democrats so desperately wanted Americans to believe that “the stakes of these midterm elections” rested on abortion that they poured hundreds of millions of dollars into advertising for pro-baby-killing candidates who voted to codify unlimited abortion — even at the cost of annihilating the filibuster. 



They were also more than willing to lie to voters about Republicans’ attempts to pass the type of abortion restrictions most Americans want. 




Let's be clear about the stakes of these midterm elections: A national ban on abortion is on the ballot. Please share this video with anyone on the fence about voting for Democrats. pic.twitter.com/yP9tAVUlzN— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 3, 2022
Democrats and their allies in the propaganda press were so confident that abortion was their ticket to win, despite two years of wreaking havoc on the country, that they prematurely attributed any present and future Democrat victories to the party’s hyper-fixation on abortion radicalism.



Even former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki admitted roughly a week before Election Day that Democrats believe personalizing their extreme abortion agenda is how they will get voters, specifically women, “to the polls moving forward.”



Despite the left-wing party’s best attempts to take their deceptive operations in Kansas national, Democrats failed to make gains on abortion in several key races. 



Senate candidates like Florida’s Val Demings and North Carolina’s Cheri Beasley, who spent months on the campaign trail touting unfettered access to abortion, fell short in voters’ eyes. And a whole host of GOP governors with a solid track record on protecting unborn life were rewarded with largely double-digit wins on Tuesday.



By Wednesday afternoon, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed protections for unborn children with detectable heartbeats into law in 2019, accrued 25.6 percent more of his state’s votes than his pro-abortion opponent. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, similarly, won his state by a whopping 19.4 percent mere months after he signed legislation outlawing abortions starting at 15 weeks gestation.



Just a year and a half after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed his state’s heartbeat abortion ban into law, he won reelection by 11 percent. With a 7.6 percent lead, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who rubber-stamped a heartbeat law since his last election, kept his seat from preborn heartbeat denier Stacey Abrams. 



Pro-life Govs. Kevin Stitt, Kim Reynolds, Kay Ivey, Kristi Noem, Henry McMaster, Bill Lee, Brad Little, and Mark Gordon also won their races.



These governors and their states faced competitive races, legal challenges from the Biden administration, political backlash, and smears from the corrupt corporate media for taking bold steps when it came to abortion. But they didn’t waver. 



Instead, Republican candidates used their pro-life success as an asset, not a downfall, during the midterms. They exposed their opponents’ abortion extremism, such as advocating for taxpayer-funded abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy. 



When the Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade, pro-life governors were affirmed in their decision to see through legislation and policies designed to save unborn babies. Even when Democrats tried to exploit the Dobbs ruling to motivate their base, strong Republican pro-life candidates didn’t back down.



GOP candidates who didn’t communicate their solid support for the pro-life agenda, on the other hand, paid the price for their silence. 



There are many reasons that could explain why Mehmet Oz underperformed in Pennsylvania. His shaky abortion track record and inability to voice the advantages of pro-life policies are some of them. Oz failed to go on the offense and expose John Fetterman’s radical desire to do whatever it takes to legalize abortion with no limits. 



Oz’s complacency allowed Fetterman and all of his allies in the media to control the abortion narrative. That was clearly a mistake. 



Voters overwhelmingly reject the free-for-all abortion frenzy Democrats pledge they will enact in all 50 states. Only 17 percent of Americans say they support the type of unlimited, taxpayer-funded abortion through all nine months that blue politicians overwhelmingly want to legalize.



Even the corporate media, who are guilty of twisting abortion polling to fit their agenda, are sometimes forced to acknowledge that a majority of Americans reject abortion until birth and want restrictions similar to what every other civilized country already has. 



But you wouldn’t know that from Fetterman or any other Democrat candidate’s extremist abortion campaigning. 



When Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams repeatedly spewed disinformation about unborn babies’ heartbeats and the science of conception to advance the left’s abortion agenda, Democrats and their abortion allies scrambled to back her. 



When Democrat Sen. Mazie Hirono called for literal violence against pro-lifers from the Senate floor to advance the left’s abortion agenda, her colleagues, who spent the last year and a half virtue-signaling about the dangers of political violence, didn’t bat an eye. 



When the Biden-Harris White House partnered with radical abortion groups to weaponize executive agencies against pro-life states and spread pro-abortion propaganda to advance its abortion agenda, Democrats cheered. 



The Biden administration, Planned Parenthood, woke corporations, Big Tech, and the corrupt corporate media all banded together to try and convince Americans that their lives depended on “reproductive rights,” but Democrats’ obsession with ending preborn lives didn’t sway voters who knew the truth about blue candidates’ abortion extremism.



Abortion will always be an issue when it comes to elections. If Republicans want to win, they need to work overtime to expose Democrats’ unpopular baby-killing extremism and give voters the strong pro-life policies they desire.

"75",75,"10 Ways The Pro-Abortion Left Proves It Isn’t Pro-Choice Or Pro-Women","Whitehead","Beth",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-19"," The left is feeding a false narrative to women: While they boast of championing a right to choose, what they really do to women is hide facts, promote dangerous procedures, and divorce them from the best resources — all in the name of abortion. 



The left crucifies pro-life pregnancy centers for hoodwinking women into keeping their babies and tells them they are making an informed choice if they abort their children. But is consent really informed if the information is based on lies?



Not so much. The left sweeps informed consent under the carpet, diverting women’s attention away from the brutal realities of abortion and hiding from them the risks abortion poses to their own bodies. Nail it down with a few well-placed jabs at conservatives for trying to take away female autonomy,  and boom — the case for abortion seems to be airtight. 



Not so fast. Here are 10 proofs that the left is not pro-choice, just pro-abortion. 



1. The Left Wants Government to Shut Down Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers 



The radical left, typified by the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is so eager to promote a woman’s so-called choice that they want to bar her from all other options — to the point of wanting the government to shut down pregnancy centers. The left doesn’t want to give women the choice even to go to a crisis pregnancy center, because when most Americans have all the facts in front of them, they no longer buy into the abortion agenda.



“We need to shut them down all around the country,” Warren said. “You should not be able to torture a pregnant person like that.” 



Torture? It’s a bold term considering 99 percent of women who visit pro-life pregnancy centers report they had a good experience upon leaving. 



2. The Left Frames Support for Women as an Anti-Choice Campaign



When the Catholic Diocese of Belleville in Illinois recently decided to sell the historic home that has housed its bishops for years to donate the proceeds to a maternity fund, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch framed the sale as pro-lifers opposing women’s rights, saying right in its headline that the diocese would “use cash for anti-abortion battle.”



It was the reversal of Roe v. Wade, the Dispatch reported, “that pushed the diocese to devote the money to its anti-abortion pregnancy crisis centers.” 



Because the left frames abortion as a “women’s right,” deploying terms like “anti-abortion” is the media’s way of framing the fight against abortion as anti-women. It isn’t until several more paragraphs down that the article admits, “the proceeds will be used to help pregnant women.”



Not to mention, the Illinois bishop’s press release said nothing about the money going to a crisis pregnancy center. It said the cash would go to a maternity fund and to Catholic education and youth programs. 



3. The Left Ignores Violent Crimes Against Women’s Centers  



While its own services are tailored mainly to abortion, the left condones torching and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy centers that attract women with their counseling, baby clothes, parenting classes, and sexual risk awareness programs rather than abortions. If the government won’t target crisis pregnancy centers, then leftist radicals will — all under the cover of a corporate media that won’t report on the criminals. 



4. The Left Pushes Wrong-Sex Hormones 



Planned Parenthood, the mother of abortion facilities, also pushes wrong-sex hormones for people who identify as transgender. That makes two services the so-called “pro-woman” and “pro-choice” left embrace that have nothing to do with health care and everything to do with brainwashing people into damaging their own bodies — or another one inside of them. 



5. The Left Calls Losing a Baby an Abortion



The left is wrongly calling the treatment of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages abortions. According to certified OB-GYNs, treating ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages has nothing to do with performing abortions. Abortion is an elective choice to kill an unborn child. Treatment for ectopic pregnancy and miscarriages do not constitute abortion because the intent is to save lives, not take them. Misleading women by wrongly labeling pro-life medical care “abortion” isn’t promoting “choice.” It’s just nakedly pro-abortion.



6. The Left Exploits Rape Victims 



For weeks, the story of a 10-year-old girl who allegedly traveled across state lines to get an abortion entranced the corporate media. President Joe Biden even repeated the story. 



However, what no one on the left seemed to care about was that in order for a 10-year-old to have become pregnant, she had to have been raped. But forget that. Forget real health care such as trauma counseling or protection against further assault. And forget even basic journalistic instincts such as wondering why no police report could be found, or human instincts such as pushing for finding and arresting the perpetrator. All the media and left-wing activists seemed to care about was the abortion tidbit they could exploit.



7. The Left Lies About Chemical Abortion Dangers



With some states making obtaining abortions more difficult, the left is pushing for them at home. They’re busy advertising the chemical abortion pill as a safe, easy alternative. The problem? The chemical abortion pill is responsible for raising abortion-related emergency room visits 500 percent in a 13-year period. 



8. The Left Claims Abortion Saves Lives



The left is propagating the idea that women with life-threatening pregnancy complications will die unless they get an abortion, but the facts say otherwise. As pro-life OB-GYNs have attested, it is never necessary to perform an abortion to save a mother’s life. Ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages are not abortions. By reducing the issue to a life-or-death decision for mothers, the left automatically divorces women from the other options to save both themselves and their babies. 



9. The Left Is Pro-Politics Above All



In the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to discuss post-Roe America, UC Berkeley law professor Khiara Bridges said that assuming only women can be pregnant is “transphobic.” By flipping the subject on its head, Bridges showed the left is less concerned about women and more concerned about using abortion as a vehicle to promote transgenderism. 



10. The Left Lies that Abortion Is Harmless



The left treats abortion like it has no consequences. What they leave out is that studies show the rate of suicide for women who have abortions is about double compared to those who gave birth, and that women who have abortions are associated with higher risks of mental illness than women who don’t. Women who have abortions also appear to be more at risk for breast cancer than those who do not. This is to say nothing of the grief, guilt, and trauma many women feel after losing their child by their own hand. 



None of this matters though when the goal isn’t pro-choice or pro-women, but pro-abortion.

"76",76,"Democrats’ Abortion Views Are Far Too Radical To Benefit From The Post-Roe Political Reality","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-06-28"," As soon as the Supreme Court issued its ruling finally overturning the Roe v. Wade abortion decision that had so roiled the nation for nearly 50 years, Democrats and their allies who control corporate media began asserting it would be a political boon for their party. 



“Democrats see abortion as a big base motivator and a potential winning issue with independents,” claimed Politico.



Democrats could certainly use some help. The party controls all of Washington, D.C. Voters have indicated they’re prepared to deliver large Republican gains in November in response to a series of Democrat policy failures leading to a looming recession, labor problems, supply chain disruptions, high gas prices, rising crime, another foreign war without a strategy for victory, and a completely out of control border. 



But there are several problems for Democrats hoping to stem the losses, including that the general Democrat position of abortion on demand until the moment of birth is far too radical to gain politically in most areas of the country. Even CBS polling found that only 17 percent of Americans agree with such an extreme stance.



The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, despite the media disinformation, simply returns abortion law to the states, enabling citizens and their elected representatives to debate and set abortion laws and policies. Roe had falsely decreed that a right to abortion was in the Constitution, and therefore beyond public debate, a view the court flatly and finally rejected last week. 



Abortion is a hotly debated topic, and neither those who oppose or support it are likely to be fully happy about public opinion. Most Americans strongly oppose abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy, but most Americans also support some allowances for abortion at earlier stages in pregnancy. In May, a Gallup poll found that 63 percent of Americans support making abortion illegal or legal only in certain circumstances.



Mixed Bag Politically



While the decision may help Democrats hold onto a few suburban seats Republicans had hoped to wrestle back from the party in power, it is unlikely to help them in battleground states and districts where Republicans are experiencing dramatic gains. California and New York may be ready to pass even more radical abortion legislation, but not every state is as leftist as those are. And Democrats and the media are in for a rude awakening if they think everyone is as extreme as they are in their bubbles.



For example, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced his plans to pass protections for babies who have reached 15 weeks of age in the womb. That’s the type of popular protection that will pass in a swing state, but would be viewed as anathema for New York newsrooms. A recent Fox poll found that a majority oppose abortion after 15 weeks. Similarly, the Wall Street Journal found more support than opposition for 15-week abortion bans like those now permitted in America.



So take a state like Nevada. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the incumbent Democrat running for re-election, voted in May for a bill that would legalize abortion to the moment of birth, forbid states from enacting protections for unborn life, and expand taxpayer funding. Her opponent Adam Laxalt is endorsed by pro-life groups and supports at least some protections for unborn children. 



As attorney general of Nevada, he signed onto a legal brief assisting the Little Sisters of the Poor, who were facing crippling fines from the Obama administration for not funding abortifacients. Is Cortez Masto’s radical stance really going to help her in a state where one out of every four residents is Hispanic, many of them Roman Catholic or evangelical? Is she really going to get major traction on her stance that it’s okay for children to have their lives violently ended in the womb for no other reason than they’re the wrong sex?



Pennsylvania also has a Senate race, and the Democrat nominee John Fetterman already publicly announced his support for the “ruthless” abortion-until-birth legislation Cortez Masto voted for. The legislation — which had bipartisan opposition but still had 48 senators and 218 congressmen voting for it — explicitly states the right to abortion on demand “shall not be limited or otherwise infringed.” 



Fetterman is running against Mehmet Oz, who has stated he’s pro-life but would support popular exceptions to abortion bans. Is Fetterman’s extreme stance going to help or hurt him in November? Ditto New Hampshire’s Maggie Hassan.



In North Carolina, Democrat nominee Cheri Beasley has made abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy the central argument of her campaign. She wants federal legislation to codify this view. By contrast, her opponent Ted Budd says he thinks states should handle abortion law and he has focused his campaign on how to improve the economy. 



Polls show that voters are dramatically more worried about the economy than focused on abortion. Traditionally, those who care the most about abortion tend to vote for Republicans. Even if Budd had an extreme pro-life position, and he doesn’t, the issue would probably break 50-50 in the southern state, rather than be a huge boon for Beasley.



At a time Democrats desperately need to seem normal, they are saddled with one of the least defensible policy positions in American life: that ending human life in the womb should be legal for any reason up until the moment the baby is being born. 



The signature legislation nearly all of them voted for weeks ago would have forbidden state-level protections for babies with Down syndrome or other disabilities, overturned informed consent laws that have been upheld by the Supreme Court, prohibited state restrictions blocking abortion when the unborn child can feel pain, and completely removed conscientious protections for health-care employees who oppose abortion. This is an extremely radical set of positions. For instance, 75 percent of Americans support protecting the conscience rights of health-care employees. And seven out of ten Americans oppose aborting children because they have Down syndrome.



It’s also not just that Democrats have to affirmatively support that view but that they will also be saddled with the policy position that any restriction, no matter how minor and no matter how popular, such as a 15-week abortion ban, is untenable.



Democrats and their media allies are trying to spread conspiracy theories about banning contraception or same-sex marriage to make Republicans seem less moderate, but those efforts will suffer from the lack of evidence to support them. The pro-life movement has been vibrant and active for 50 solid years, marching each January in the nation’s capital, and working diligently to pass laws protecting human lives. There is no movement for the conspiracy theories being spread by corporate media.



Few people realize how radical the American abortion position was prior to Dobbs. This week, Noah Smith tweeted a picture of how restrictive European abortion laws are relative to the Roe era in the United States, adding, “Wow. Today I learned that Europe has more restrictive abortion laws than most of the U.S. did up until this week.”



While pro-lifers have known that for decades, the media — run by people with extremely liberal views on abortion — have hidden those facts from their readers and viewers. But Americans are learning these facts about the Democrat position and how radical it is.



Narratives In A Head-On Collision



Another problem for Democrats is that prior to Dobbs, the main campaign strategy was to gin up hysteria about the January 6 riot. Since the leak of the draft decision, abortion supporters have engaged in campaigns of violence against churches and maternal care centers. 



Last week, prominent Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and President Joe Biden began calling on their base voters to protest in the streets. Leading leftists also claimed the Supreme Court was now “illegitimate,” because it had ruled on the law in a way that differed from their preferred policies. Media figures began spreading disinformation about abortion being banned in America. 



It will be exceedingly difficult to continue the January 6 show trial while this widespread and orchestrated campaign of violence is happening nationwide.



Exceedingly few Americans support Democrats’ policies in favor of abortion until the moment of birth. DC-based media and Democrat strategists exist in a bubble that isolates them from public opinion. 



But elections happen in places where views have to be explicitly stated and contend with public opinion. Outside of a small handful of House districts in suburban areas dominated by wealthy and college-educated white women, the more GOP candidates speak confidently and unapologetically about their views, they will have the political edge.

"77",77,"OB-GYNs Shatter Nine Of The Most Common Abortion Myths The Left Peddles To Spook Women","Corso","Sophia",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-09-01"," Since the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson and the consequential overturning of Roe v. Wade, the corporate media has spewed misinformation about abortion and what a post-Roe world means for Americans, creating panic and chaos throughout the country. To combat this, pro-life OB-GYNs have launched a campaign to debunk those lies and voice the truth about abortion and women’s health.



The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG) has released “Myth vs. Fact: Correcting Misinformation on Maternal Medical Care,” which busts pro-abortion myths and provides clarity after Dobbs. Here’s what you need to know.



Myth #1: Abortion Is Health Care



Despite this misinformation being pushed by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and NPR, AAPLOG explains why it’s not true. The ACOG has an extreme view on abortion in comparison to “the vast majority of OB/GYNs in the country” and has “actively opposed doctors who do not agree with the group’s radical positions.”  



In fact, ACOG does not support giving patients ultrasounds, “which are critical for providing informed consent to a patient” prior to abortions. It also does not favor restrictions on partial-birth abortions and rarely asks its members how they view abortion overall.



Myth #2: Abortion Restrictions Interfere with the Doctor-Patient Relationship



Despite this common pro-abortion talking point, which is perpetuated by the American Medical Association, the AAPLOG points out that prior to the lethal procedure, there is often no relationship between mothers and abortionists, who “tend to leave the medical care afterwards to other physicians who either have a prior relationship with the patient or who work in her local emergency room.”   



“It is not an intrusion on the doctor/patient relationship to protect the lives of BOTH of our patients,” the pro-life group added.



Myth #3: Abortion Is Sometimes Necessary to Save the Mother’s Life



Despite this narrative rearing its head in the media — with NPR, Reuters, and other outlets claiming that in order for women to live, they must be allowed to kill their unborn children — the OB-GYNs explain why this just isn’t true.



While unborn lives are sometimes tragically lost due to life-threatening medical complications, the unintentional death of an unborn baby in the course of saving a mother’s life is not abortion, since abortion is the intentional killing of a child. In fact, as AAPLOG notes, “93% of practicing OB/GYNs do not perform elective abortions but have always been able to offer life-saving treatment to women and will continue to be able to do so regardless of state laws on abortion” and “OB/GYNs are trained to discern when they need to intervene to save a mother’s life.”



“Elective abortion is not lifesaving medical care,” AAPLOG said. “OB/GYNs will still be able to offer lifesaving medical care to pregnant women. No laws on elective abortion will impact that.”  



Myth #4: Women with Ectopic Pregnancies or Miscarriages Won’t Get Proper Care



As AAPLOG notes, elective abortions are completely different from miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. In the case of a miscarriage, “the baby has already died and therefore any treatment of a miscarriage would not be an abortion.”  



Treating ectopic pregnancy involves removing an embryo that has implanted outside the uterus and thus cannot survive. “This life-saving treatment is not prevented by any current law restricting or banning abortion,” AAPLOG explains. 



Myth #5: Maternal Mortality Rates Will Increase Post–Dobbs



Although NBC News, The Guardian, and ACOG have all spread this misinformation to elevate their pro-abortion talking points, it becomes clear when examining data that abortion restrictions do not lead to increased maternal mortality. The AAPLOG highlights that the United States has one of the highest maternal mortality rates despite having Roe in place for almost 50 years.  



As AAPLOG says, “studies from a diverse range of countries suggest that abortion is actually associated with higher maternal mortality rates and restrictions may lead to improved maternal health.”  The pro-life group of OB-GYNS also cites data showing that “abortion is associated with 49.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 women compared to a rate of only 8.1 per 100,000 for all external causes of death after delivery.”



Myth #6: Abortion Restrictions Will Hurt Women’s Care



To combat this myth that The Texas Tribune and Bloomberg have peddled, AAPLOG explains that pro-life provisions such as “ultrasound requirements, hospital privileges, and waiting periods” actually help keep women safe and ensure they receive the best care.



“For example, ultrasounds help verify the gestational age, which is critical to accurately assessing the risks associated with an abortion,” AAPLOG explains. “The further along in the pregnancy a woman is, the greater risk she faces from an abortion. There is no way to provide accurate informed consent for a woman if the gestational age of her pregnancy is not certain.” 



Myth #7: Abortion Does Not Affect the Mother’s Long-Term Reproductive Health



AAPLOG successfully debunks this misinformation spread by The New York Times and Planned Parenthood by pointing out that “the Institute of Medicine lists surgical abortion as an immutable risk factor for preterm birth.” Additionally, mothers who deliver their babies preterm “are at a higher risk of medical complications later in life including cardiovascular disease and stroke.”



“Women face a 35% increased risk of preterm birth in a future pregnancy after one surgical abortion and an almost 90% increase in preterm birth risk after two abortions,” AAPLOG writes.



Myth #8: Chemical Abortions Are Safe for Women



Because in-person visits with doctors are not required to have a chemical abortion, doctors are unable “to determine how far along the pregnancy is or rule out a dangerous ectopic pregnancy.”  Additionally, symptoms of chemical abortion are similar to a “rupturing ectopic pregnancy.” As AAPLOG notes, “if this causes a delay in diagnosis of even a few hours, it can be catastrophic.”



Myth #9: Abortion Restrictions Will Harm Women’s Mental Health



Despite this myth being pushed by USA Today, AAPLOG has pointed to facts illustrating that the opposite is true. 



“From 1993 to 2018, there were at least 75 studies examining the link between abortion and mental health,” AAPLOG stated. “Two-thirds of those studies showed a correlation between abortion and adverse mental health outcomes.” Furthermore, the suicide rate for post-abortive mothers is up to seven times higher than those who were still pregnant or had given birth, according to a study from Finland.

"78",78,"Many Women Are Already Serving Life Because Of Abortion, And Overturning Roe Won’t Change That","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-07-12"," The past week has seen panicked warnings after news broke that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy will retire, allowing President Trump to nominate a second Supreme Court justice in less than two years. They’ve said the pick should be delayed and even screaming we should worry about jail time for those of us who had abortions while they remain silent about the very real issues women should be concerned with. Those real possibilities include infection, perforated uterus, cervical damage, the risk of sterility, depression, guilt, remorse, suicidal ideation, sleep disorders, poor relationships, and even death, all from supposedly “safe, rare and legal” abortion. While such people claim they promote abortion in the interests of women, they block legislation that would warn women about the mental and physical complications of the procedure and continue to deny the negative impact of abortion on millions of women.  NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue recently claimed Trump “is going to put someone on the court who will be the fifth vote to criminalize abortion, punish women and throw them in jail.” This same fear tactic was successful in legalizing Roe v. Wade, which was itself based on lies. Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator who styles herself as a defender of women’s rights, hasn’t wasted any time using Kennedy’s retirement to fuel her agenda: “Get to the polls this November, women. We’re owning our future,” Gillibrand wrote to her followers on Twitter, as if the right to kill your unborn child supersedes anything else that makes the value of a woman’s future worthwhile. I am a post-abortive woman, and I’m tired of Democrats telling me what I should feel and using fear to push their political agenda. Even people in line with the Democratic Party are struggling. A woman I know who is receiving counseling for post-abortion trauma notes, “As a Democrat, who likes much of the platform of social justice, Medicare for all, free college and trade schools, this is an agonizing time for me. I do not approve of many of the actions of this president and the Republican Congress, yet on abortion, I am more in sync with their views than those of the Democratic Party.”  Abortion Has Already Imprisoned Us In Sadness Abortion may not (and I believe, never will) carry with it a jail term for women. But make no mistake about it, many of us who have experienced abortion already do life. Countless women live in the prison of anxiety, panic, depression, and even suicidal ideation because of abortion. Many are unable to conceive other children and must live with the fact that the unborn child they aborted will be their only one. Instead of showing concern for those who suffer, Democrats spend countless time and effort to deny claims that abortion hurts women. Instead they spend their time promoting the lies and denying the real consequences for millions of women, saying there is no such thing as post-abortion stress. Even if they have not experienced abortion themselves, many Americans have personally seen this suffering in sisters, wives, friends, and daughters who have had abortions. They have encountered first-hand the devastation abortion has caused in lives once happy and relationships once healthy, now imprisoned by despair, anger, bitterness, and grief. Try as the pro-abortion side might to discredit these voices, people know the truth because they see the changes in those they love. So groups like NARAL are appealing to these friends and relatives by telling them those they love will be thrown in jail.  Of course, no one wants her loved one in jail.  Jail Time Is Not Realistic. Health Dangers Are The chances of jail time for women who abort are slim and just another fear tactic of those who support unrestricted abortion. Even overturning Roe would only send the abortion issue back to states, and even the most Republican states are helmed by leaders who have openly rejected the idea of criminal penalties for women who abort their children. What is reality, however, is that women are injured and have died from “safe, legal” abortion. In May, New York doctor Dr. Robert Rho pled guilty in the bleeding death of 30-year-old Jaime Lee Morales after a botched abortion, and is awaiting sentencing. The now-infamous abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, the subject of a new film, was convicted of murder in 2013 for administering a fatal overdose of sedatives during an abortion and for snipping the spines of infants born alive during the procedure. In 2012, Tonya Reaves, 24, died from a hemorrhage following an abortion at a Planned Parenthood in Chicago. Then there is abortionist LeRoy Carhart, who is responsible for the deaths of Christin Gilbert, 19, and Jennifer Morbelli, 29, both of whom died from abortion complications. In 2011 a study was published in the British Journal of Psychology which combines data on 877,181 participants, showing that abortion increases the chances of depression, anxiety, alcoholism, drug use, and suicide. Sadly, these same people speaking about jail time are silent about the dangers of abortion and the devastation not only to these women, but the “sentence” for all those who loved them. If it happens, overturning Roe v. Wade will not end abortion. Even if a conservative-stacked Supreme Court overturns the infamous court case, abortion won’t disappear. The decision of legality will revert to individual states. Our culture is such that it is utterly ludicrous to think of lawmakers anywhere penalizing women with jail time for abortions, despite the reality of what abortion does to an unborn child. States likes New York, Connecticut, California, Maine, New Jersey, and Oregon already have laws on the books to protect abortion, while others may restrict it in certain cases. No one really knows for sure what will happen with the Supreme Court and Roe, but I hope Americans examine the truths of this decision as we honestly look at the destruction it has caused in our society.

"79",79,"Midwest Pro-Life March Is A Window To The Post-Dobbs Abortion Battle Embroiling States","Bateman","Ashley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-05-02"," Hundreds gathered under St. Louis’ trademark Gateway Arch this weekend for a pro-life march.



A “battleground” bordering Illinois, one of the country’s most permissive abortion states, Missouri effectively shut down its abortion industry in 2022, banning abortion just hours after the Supreme Court’s June ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Now pro-lifers look to the east and south while continuing to lobby at home, fighting the passage of several referendums that could permit more abortions.



Speakers called for justice for pregnant women and their unborn, highlighting the deadly effects of chemical abortions on women and their children as abortion drugs are federally endorsed and become increasingly available.



“Our voice is especially important as we combat the abortion industry’s new frontier, chemical abortion,” said speaker Reagan Barklage, Students for Life national field director. “Chemical abortion not only ends the lives of preborn children but it is extremely harmful to women. While all abortions are dangerous, chemical abortion is especially, as it is four times more dangerous than surgical abortion.”



Fifty percent of America’s abortions are chemical; 670 of the unborn die daily by such methods.



“That number will only continue to increase, as that is the direction the abortion industry wants to head,” Barklage said. “This is alarming, and should be the motivation we all need to remember the battle is not yet won.”



Illinois’ Pro-Abortion Policies



Just across the state line, Illinois supports the big business of abortion, providing a permissive and lenient atmosphere for abortion facilities and serving as a “destination location” for those looking to end the life of the unborn in neighboring states that have restricted or outlawed abortion. Adhering to the Reproductive Health Act, state law in Illinois requires private insurers to cover abortions, allows nonphysicians to administer chemical abortion drugs to women and minors, allows monetary “kickbacks” for abortions, removes the parental notice requirement for minors previously in law, and does not hold most abortion facilities to licensing and inspection regulations.



“Illinois is radically pro-abortion … and there are zero standards,” said Scott Davis, marcher and life advocate in Carbondale, Illinois. There are “no inspections, and legislators specifically passed a bill that would allow doctors who have lost their licenses in other states to come and do abortions here. Women’s health? No. This is not health care. It’s the abortion industry.”



Abortion Industry Expands After Dobbs



The small town of Carbondale fast-tracked funding the business of abortion following the Dobbs v. Jackson’s Women’s Health Organization ruling. A year ago, no abortion facilities existed within city limits. Now there are two, with a third, large facility under construction. The town of around 22,000 now provides abortions daily. It’s been featured on the hit ABC show “Grey’s Anatomy” as an abortion “safe haven.”



Locals also contend with a radically pro-abortion city council. In January, the city council voted unanimously in favor of “bubble zone” legislation, making it illegal for pro-life sidewalk counselors to go within 100 feet of those entering health care facilities. On the books in Illinois, abortion is still “health care,” and those offering women life choices are interfering.



“They posted it on the website on a Friday and passed it on a Tuesday and modified it on the fly,” said Brian Westbrook, executive director of Coalition Life. “The entire room was packed with local pro-lifers, not in favor.”



One Group Saving Lives



But the business of abortion in Carbondale has a serious opponent. Coalition Life has served, counseled, and cared for abortion-minded women in southern Illinois for years. Their model has been widely successful, saving the lives of more than 3,000 children. In 2011, counselors were turning away mothers from the last active abortion facilities in Missouri, and the group now runs one of the state’s 75 pregnancy resource centers. They have turned their focus to Carbondale, with a professionally trained staff and methodology that continuously improves.



 “We take statistics of every conversation we have,” Westbrook said. “We work with counselors not doing as well in reaching women. We study the stop rate, literature handout rate, and turnaround rate. Every single shift is recorded from start to finish for legal protection and training, ongoing, constant training.”



“The abortion industry pumps billions of dollars into staffing abortion facilities to take the lives of unborn children, they are bringing on professional individuals with the sole purpose of killing innocent human beings, so why would we not react in a very professional, strategic way to save those lives and continue to raise the bar?”



Westbrook said even women driving from several hours away for an abortion in Carbondale are responding to Coalition Life’s counselors, and turning around.

"81",81,"Minnesota Poised To Legalize Infanticide, Nuke Protections For Women And Babies In Radical Abortion Bill","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-01-19"," Minnesota Democrats are poised to ignore the at least 69 percent of Americans who say they want significant limits on abortion to pass the state’s most radical abortion bill, which would legalize taxpayer-funded on-demand abortion for all. 



The Protect Reproductive Options Act (PROA), the first bill Democrats introduced in both the state House and Senate this session, would repeal dozens of the state’s protections for women and babies and expand legal immunity for abortions up until the moment of birth and beyond. 



The bill is eagerly supported by Planned Parenthood and its allies in the press and the Biden administration, but legal experts say it goes “far beyond any interpretation of the Minnesota Supreme Court case Doe v. Gomez,” the state’s version of Roe v. Wade.



“Cattle and reptiles will have more legal protections in Minnesota than Minnesota’s vulnerable preborn children. Legal penalties for animal cruelty in Minnesota range from misdemeanor up to a felony while there is no criminal penalty for leaving a preborn child to die on a cold metal table,” Renee Carlson, general counsel at True North Legal, said in remarks to the Senate ahead of the vote.





That doesn’t matter to state legislators, who could vote on the bill in the Minnesota House as soon as Thursday. If passed by both chambers, the legislation will head to Democrat Gov. Tim Walz’s desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.



Ends Protections for Babies Born Alive



Minnesota law recognizes babies who are born alive following a botched abortion as “a human person under the law.” The Born Alive Infants Protection Act reconfirmed these babies deserve and receive life-saving medical care. 



The PROA, however, terminates the protections outlined for a baby who “breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of a natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.”



Lifts Prohibitions on Taxpayer-Funded Abortions



Current statute bars Minnesota from funneling taxpayer dollars to any nonprofit that offers abortions. It also prohibits grants for “family planning services” targeted at “any unemancipated minor in any elementary or secondary school building.”



The PROA explicitly abolishes provisions that shield taxpayers from funding abortion for all through all nine months of pregnancy. 



Nullifies Parental Notification 



If a minor requests an abortion, Minnesota law requires that parents or guardians be notified before she goes through with it. Females who do not want to notify their parents of their intent to abort may request a bypass from a judge who can deem the pregnant girl as “mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion.” 



This legislation nullifies those requirements, however, which opens the door for minors to get abortions whenever they want without permission.



Cancels Protections for ‘Viable’ Preborn Babies



“Viable” as defined in Minnesota law means “able to live outside the womb even though artificial aid may be required,” which could be as early as “the second half of [the] gestation period.” The PROA doesn’t just rid the state of that definition in an attempt to expand abortion for all through birth. It also quashes provisions that abortions performed beyond the first trimester must be done in hospitals and only executed if a mother’s life is at risk.



Reverses Ban on Abortions for Unconscious Women



Any woman receiving abortions in Minnesota, the law currently states, must be conscious and given a “full explanation of the procedure and effect of the abortion” beforehand. Under the PROA, neither of those conditions must be met to move forward with an abortion. 



Halts Reporting If Women Die from Abortions



Abortions are not a safe procedure for the mother or baby, which is why Minnesota law requires abortionists to report if a woman dies due to abortion. Before the PROA, abortionists who failed to report the death of a woman “from any cause within 30 days of the abortion or from any cause potentially related to the abortion within 90 days of the abortion,” faced criminal charges and fines. Under the new legislation, abortionists will not be penalized for refusing to report abortion-related deaths. 



Stops Reporting Abortion Stats Altogether



Not only will abortionists no longer be required to report deaths under the PROA, but they won’t have to disclose any of the legally mandated information about the number of abortions they performed, what methods they used, the gestational ages of the unborn babies who were dismembered, why the woman sought an abortion, or any other key information.



The state commissioner, also, is released by the PROA from publishing a public report with the state’s abortion data including how many out-of-state abortions were granted each year. 



Repeals Felony Charges for Sale of Abortion Pill, Other Abortion-Inducing Devices



The PROA seeks to repeal the threat of criminal charges for anyone who manufactures, sells, or advertises abortion-inducing devices or drugs. 



Allows the Unregulated Disposal of Baby Bodies



The PROA would rescind a statute that requires the remains of an aborted or miscarried baby in a medical facility to be properly and carefully handled and disposed of within the state. That means hospitals and abortion facilities would no longer be required to cremate or bury deceased infants as directed by the commissioner of health.



The bill also voids a portion of the statute that previously ordered “complete laboratory tests necessary for the health of the woman or her future offspring or for purposes of a criminal investigation or determination of parentage prior to disposing of the remains.”



Ends Informed Consent for Women



Minnesota statute 145.4242, also known as the “Woman’s Right to Know Act,” says women must be told the “particular medical risks associated with the particular abortion procedure,” the gestational age of the child, and, in the case of a late-term abortion, whether painkillers will be given to the unborn child during the abortion, and “what medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care.” Women seeking abortions must also be provided “printed materials” and a website explaining the “services available to assist through pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood,” “fetal development,” and “fetal responsiveness to adverse stimuli.”



Before the PROA, this information had to be relayed by the abortionist at least 24 hours before a woman’s appointment. If the PROA passes, abortionists do not have to explain any abortion risks to the woman. 



Expands Who Can Give Abortions 



According to Minnesota statute 145.412, only licensed physicians may perform abortions in a designated facility such as a hospital or abortion facility using rules from the state commissioner of health as a guideline. 



Before the PROA, violations of these regulations resulted in a felony. If the new legislation passes, violations of these statutes, including letting unlicensed abortionists perform the dangerous and fatal procedure, will no longer be considered criminal.



Childbirth No Longer State Policy



Minnesota’s state policy is that childbirth, as opposed to abortion, “is to be given preference, encouragement and support by law and by state action, it being in the best interests of the well-being and common good of Minnesota citizens.” 



Passage of the PROA will change the state’s policy from pro-life to pro-abortion.

"82",82,"Abortion Is A Celebration Now. That’s Insanely Wrong","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-09-15"," Since Roe v. Wade, abortion has worn many faces: We’ve seen abortion as a political movement—a woman’s right to choose trumps a baby’s right to life. We’ve seen the even more progressive left declare a war on women’s wombs—a la “reproductive justice.” This week, the Ohio Supreme Court heard one of the most important abortion cases of its time. But the pro-choice movement has gone so far, abortion has surpassed being personally expedient or politically progressive—it’s now straight-up celebrated at events nationwide.  In June, actress Martha Plimpton (of “The Goonies” fame) spoke at a “Shout your abortion” event in Seattle. The footage was recently released, and her remarks are a bit surprising—if not disgusting—even for an event created just to brag about abortions. “I also had my first abortion here at the Seattle Planned Parenthood!” she exclaims, followed by a long, loud, “Yaaayyyyyyyy.” The crowd and host erupted in raucous applause. Plimpton continues: “Notice I said first. And I don’t want you guys to feel insecure. It was my best one. Heads and tails above the rest. If I could ‘Yelp’ review it I totally would.” Plimpton goes on to thank the doctor who performed the abortion, as if she had received a gift from a total stranger. Treating Abortion Like Stand-Up Comedy Granted, this particular event likely garnered an unusually abortion-friendly or even abortion-fanatic audience. But Plimpton’s light, airy, celebratory tone—as if she had bought a new home or published a best-selling novel—seems extreme, even in context. What’s even more alarming is the crowd’s reaction: it sounds as if they had gotten the keys to a new car from Oprah herself. Imagine a serial killer on a talk show announcing that he’d murdered someone years ago, and hearing the crowd exclaim, Wahoooooo! Because that’s basically what happened.  Yet acting like abortion should be celebrated or joked about isn’t uncommon. In April, comedian Louis C.K. thought abortion would be a funny enough topic for a stand-up routine. “Abortion is exactly like taking a s—. Or it isn’t.” To this, the crowd laughed. “Or it’s killing a baby. It’s only one of those two things.” C.K. says with a smirk. He continues. “I don’t think it’s like killing a baby. Well, I think it’s a little like killing a baby.” The crowd laughs again. “Ok fine. It’s 100 percent killing a baby.” Now of course, some could say the comedian is using satire to comment on an important, controversial issue in society. But given Louis C.K.’s reputation, it’s unlikely this particular comedian intended for the monologue to be a teaching moment. Instead, whether he thinks abortion is murder or similar to defecating, he thought the topic appropriately hilarious—and apparently his audience agreed. In both these instances, it’s hard to tell what’s more disgusting: The person making the joke about abortion (because everyone knows how funny it is to kill a living, often-viable-outside-the-womb baby), or the audience cracking up as if they’re listening to someone funnier than Jim Gaffigan. If anyone has seen an abortion live, the after-effects of abortion in photos, or spoken to a woman who’s had an abortion, I can assure you, there’s little humor.  Planned Parenthood Receives Scientific Award? The act of aborting a baby and the women getting abortions aren’t the only things folks are celebrating these days. Now, we’re celebrating the people who perform abortion too. The Lasker Awards, which grants some of the country’s most acclaimed prizes in medicine, announced this year that one of their three awards would go to Planned Parenthood. The Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which honors scientific achievement, comes with $250,000. Honoring Planned Parenthood represents an incredible departure from previous winners, and a sad leap toward political discourse for the Lasker Foundation. Past winners include the developers of the modern cochlear implant, and breakthroughs in brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. Nearly 90 past winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. But the Lasker Foundation is awarding Planned Parenthood because they’ve provided “essential health services and reproductive care to millions of women for more than a century.” It’s unclear how Planned Parenthood, which aborts 300,000 babies per year, has bettered the medical community, let alone provided any scientific breakthroughs. Reports show while Planned Parenthood does provide some “essential health services” like “free” birth control, some clinics hardly provide any medical help at all and mostly focus on abortion. Lasker is an esteemed, reputable organization honoring top scientists. Other winners this year are the developers of the HPV vaccines. The fact that Lasker would foray into the realm of political correctness and essentially celebrate Planned Parenthood—which would rather abort babies than even admit science shows life begins at conception—is either misguided or vile. Or both. Murder Shouldn’t Be Celebrated—Viability Should Be What’s so sickening about the way abortion is now celebrated is that there are significant scientific advancements in the opposite direction, ones that should be celebrated more. Now babies are being born at an age when they would often have been aborted: scientific advancements have allowed babies to survive and thrive outside their mother’s wombs. Over the course of this last year, a baby born in Israel at 22 weeks has survived; after seven months in a Texas hospital, a baby born at 22 weeks finally went home. In England, Austin Douglas weighed as much as “a half a bag of sugar” when he was born. He is now thriving. The irony of this particular birth is that most abortions in England occur before the 24-week mark. While many abortions occur in America during the first trimester, before viability, a good 10 to 20 percent occur during the second trimester when they could be saved with medical intervention. A study from the Journal of American Medical Association showed last year that 62 percent of babies born at 22 to 23 weeks are viable outside the womb with significant medical aid. For anyone who loves our esteemed Mary Katharine Ham’s gestational fruit comparisons, that’s a baby the size of a spaghetti squash, or a pint of Ben & Jerry’s. A woman who decides she should get an abortion at 22 weeks, because it wouldn’t really “be a baby anyway,” couldn’t be more wrong. Not only is it a baby—said human could likely survive and thrive, even if he or she were born right then. Applauding Abortion Cannot Hide Its Atrocity If people are going to clap when a Hollywood actress has an abortion, shouldn’t they clap when a teenager bravely gives birth, then gives her baby up for adoption because she feels too young to raise him? If people are going to laugh at a comedian inciting abortion for fun, why not smile when Jim Gaffigan jokes about having a big family? If awards are going to be granted about medical breakthroughs, shouldn’t they be granted to the scientists who, in 2013, invented a 3-D-printed windpipe that helps infants breathe? It was bad enough when abortion was a political talking point or a personal triumph. Now that it’s a celebratory event, it’s even more disgusting. We keep celebrating all the wrong things, letting others decide which events are worthy of celebration. Like Caesar’s Rome, when the city would broadcast the torture and murder of Christians in the colosseum, people today love—nay, laugh about—this murderous crime. To the Hollywood elite hoping we’ll applaud their abortions, the comedians ghoulish enough to twist murder into a stand-up routine, and the science organization which allowed political correctness to trump scientific achievement: Abortion cannot be your campaign, your celebration, or your cause. Because no lens, no hashtag, no filter, no award can mask the atrocity it will always be. Abortion is not a bumper sticker, hashtag humblebrag, joke, or gold star for scientific achievement. Whether one hour or five decades after Roe v. Wade’s drastic decision, abortion will never just be a talking point, political strategy, comedic routine, or moving film scene. It will always be just what it is: the homicide of a living human being, made in God’s image.

"85",85,"All Babies Slated For Late-Term Abortion Should Instead Be Delivered Alive","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-11"," Since New York celebrated passage of its euphemistically christened Reproductive Health Act late last month, the debate over abortion laws has reignited. The focus on abortion likely would have blipped through the news cycle had Virginia not followed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s suggestion that the New York law “shine a bright light forward for the rest of the nation to follow.” When Virginia considered a similar amendment to its abortion law—one that legalized abortion until the moment of birth based on an unbounded concept of woman’s health—the plan backfired in sub-committee. Virginia House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, a Republican, quizzed the bill’s sponsor on the breadth of the law.  “How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?” Gilbert asked Virginia Del. Kathy Tran, a Democrat. After Tran acknowledged the bill permitted abortions up to 40 weeks of pregnancy, Gilbert pushed farther, questioning Tran about the scenario of a woman in active labor. “Where it’s obvious a woman is about to give birth—she has physical signs that she is about to give birth, would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified?” Gilbert queried. “She’s dilating.” “My bill would allow that, yes,” Tran acknowledged. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, followed up with another shocker. When asked about the active-labor scenario during a radio interview, Northam told listeners that “If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” Republican U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse attempted to ensure that no baby born alive following a failed abortion attempt could be left to die based on the mother’s desire. The Nebraska senator introduced the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, which would require a doctor to provide the care ordinarily provided to newborns to babies born alive after a failed abortion. Sasse’s efforts failed, though, because he sought passage through a fast-track process that requires unanimous consent, and Democrat Sen. Patty Murray objected to the bill. House Republicans are also pushing for passage of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, but Democrats kept the measure from coming to the floor. But America doesn’t need the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act: Any baby who survives an abortion and would qualify for care under the proposed Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should be beyond the reach of the abortionist’s scalpel and forceps.  What our country needs is the Deliver-Alive Human Being Protection Act: A law that unequivocally protects fetuses once they reach the gestational age at which they are potentially viable, currently 22 weeks. At that point, should the pregnancy put the mother’s life at risk, the pre-term delivery of the live baby is indicated—not the killing of the fetus, followed by delivery of a dead baby. In many states that is not the law. Instead, healthy, viable fetuses may be aborted. Just last week, Teen Vogue—yes, that’s right, TEEN Vogue—exposed this reality in an article by Beth Vial telling “her abortion story.” Vial opened by noting that “New York and Virginia have made headlines for their efforts to cut the medically unnecessary regulations on later abortion,” before proclaiming “Anti-abortion advocates have been intentionally misleading the public about the policies and misrepresenting what later abortion is and why people have them. I know because I had an abortion at 28 weeks.” Vial then spent the next ten paragraphs explaining that she has polycystic ovary syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome, and that she simply didn’t want to continue the pregnancy because “I was too sick, not ready, and I simply couldn’t afford it.” She eventually travelled to New Mexico to obtain an abortion when her baby was 28 weeks old. If Vial’s medical condition truly made continuing her pregnancy unsafe, a pre-term delivery would be indicated, not an abortion! But New Mexico law allowed Vial to kill her healthy and viable unborn baby.  If abortion activists have their way, the extreme abortion regimes of New Mexico and New York will be making their way to a statehouse near you. Already we’re seeing expansive bills proposed in other liberal states. In Rhode Island, two competing bills seek to remove current restrictions on abortions, including a full repeal of the ban on partial-birth abortions. If passed, the Rhode Island law would also permit abortions up to birth to “preserve the health” of the woman. Like Virginia’s proposed law, this language is broad enough to allow an abortion to proceed even as the woman is in active labor, but the Rhode Island version would not even require a doctor’s certification of the purported “health” condition. Vermont’s proposed House Bill 57 goes even farther: That bill provides that “A fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus shall not have independent rights under Vermont law,” and declares that “No State or local law enforcement shall prosecute any individual for inducing, performing, or attempting to induce or perform the individual’s own abortion.” There are no limits on gestational age, viability, or methods of abortion. In other words, this bill provides for abortion on demand, for any reason, at any time, without even requiring the woman to present a health pretense. While the East Coast sisterhood of states pushes these extreme abortion bills, Congress seems fixated on the few babies who survive the slaughter. But there is a better way: protect viable fetuses by passing a federal Deliver-Alive Human Being Protection Act. President Trump and House and Senate Republicans have already announced support for just such a law, although not framed that way. That is a mistake, because the intense backlash to Tran and Northam’s comments demonstrates that the American public view the abortion of viable fetuses—babies, if they can survive the trip through the birth canal—as barbaric. The legislation that would protect viable fetuses is currently being sold as the Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act. This bill would prohibit abortions after a gestational age of 22 weeks, the age at which a fetus may be viable outside his mother’s womb. While this legislation would allow abortions after 22 weeks in the case of rape or to save the life of the mother, the statute makes clear that the physician terminating the pregnancy under those exceptions must do so in a manner that “provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive.” In other words, the termination of the pregnancy occurs when the baby is delivered alive. Congress needs to repackage these provisions as the federal Deliver-Alive Human Being Protection Act. It is unfortunate that marketing has any role in the abortion debate, but after 40-plus years of Planned Parenthood and NARAL selling euphemisms and falsehoods, much of the public remains blind to the reality of abortion. Now that Tran and Northam have unwittingly exposed the festering facts, Congress must seize the moment.

"86",86,"Friends Don’t Let Friends Take Glamour’s Horrific Advice On DIY Abortions","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-05-26"," Last week, Glamour published two articles promoting DIY home abortions. Individually, the articles provide dangerous advice. Together, the guidance is toxic. The first, “A New On-Line Service Aims to Help Women Self-Manage Abortions,” introduced Glamour readers to Women Help Women: “In April the organization launched the first-ever digital information service for medication abortion pills—Self-Managed Abortion: Safe and Supported, or SASS for short—that provides information and resources specifically about obtaining and using mifepristone and misoprostol, which the law usually requires are prescribed by a licensed health care professional.”  According to author Steph Herold, after women answer a series of questions, Women Help Women can refer them to nearby clinics for an abortion or to organizations for assistance with the cost. Women Help Women “can also provide instructions on how to self-manage an abortion if she has the abortion pills.” “Self-manage” is the latest euphemism from pro-“choice” folks. Translation: A pregnant woman procures the abortion pill Mifeprex, then ingests it at home to abort her unborn baby. To Get the Pills, Try the Black Market? Glamour, however, leaves unanswered how women can acquire the abortion pill. Herold cagily hints at the answer—that they are obtained illegally—by noting that “self-managed abortions are legally risky in the United States. At least 17 women have been arrested for self-managing their own abortions in the last few years alone.” Women Help Women has no such restraint. It provides readers multiple suggestions for illegally obtaining the abortion pill, including Internet veterinary supply stores and over the counter in Mexico. A similar organization, Women on Waves, which “helps women get access to a safe [sic] medical abortion,” provides even more direct advice, suggesting the mom-to-be visit a smaller pharmacy and “say that your grandmother has rheumatoid arthritis so severely that she is visiting and she forgot her medicines and is in pain, and that you do not have money to pay for a doctor to get the prescriptions for the tablets.” If unsuccessful “try another pharmacy, or send a male friend.” Women on Waves also shares that Mifeprex “can also be bought on the black market (places where you can also buy Marijuana).”  That’s right, America: Abortion-rights advocates have gone from warning of back-alley abortions to promoting black-market ones! Eating Death Pills Is So Totally Safe, Girls Beyond advocating criminal conduct and giving a verbal nod in the direction of Women Help Women’s web address, the Glamour article then dangerously portrays the abortion pill as unequivocally safe, first stating “having an abortion with pills is medically very safe.” The article reiterates this point two more times, first by quoting Women Help Women’s Amsterdam-based executive director Kinga Jelinska, who told Glamour “I wish people knew how safe and effective abortion pills are.” The article ends by noting “that recent data suggest that medication abortion pills are perfectly safe to provide over the counter.” The only risk the article mentions? The legal risk!  Two days later, Glamour led its “health” section with “Research Confirms You Can Safely Induce Your Own Abortion.” This article highlights a just-published study of “the self-reported outcomes of 1,000 women in Ireland and Northern Ireland after they induced their own abortions with medication from the organization Women on Web (WoW).” In summarizing the study, Jennifer Gerson Uffalussy writes:  What they found was that 95 percent of these self-sourced and self-managed medical abortions were successful, meaning they didn’t require any surgical intervention afterward. Of the 1,000 women, 93 experienced a symptom that might have been indicative of a serious complication. The vast majority of these, 95 percent, sought care (the five who didn’t seek care also didn’t report experiencing any adverse outcome) — so, yes, women are smart, sentient beings who can follow directions, take medication as prescribed, and seek care when needed. She then concludes: “Medical abortion has been shown before to be incredibly safe. According to Planned Parenthood, serious complications of the procedure are rare, and research indicates that it leads to serious side effects in fewer than one percent of cases.” What’s an especially younger reader of Glamour to conclude after spying these two articles? That it’s completely safe to illegally purchase the abortion pill and terminate a pregnancy at home without seeking any medical evaluation or care. After all, according to Glamour, recent data suggests it’s “perfectly safe to provide over the counter.” Doctor-Administered Mifeprex Includes Careful Guardrails While it is true that serious side effects of Mifeprex (to the mother) are rare, they are so serious the manufacturer must provide the FDA’s strongest warning—a Black Box Warning. And the reason the number of (maternal) fatalities remains low is because the Food and Drug Administration approved Mifeprex for distribution through a restricted program called Mifeprex REMS, or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. According to the FDA, REMS seeks “to mitigate the risk of serious complications association with Mifeprex by requiring healthcare providers who prescribe Mifeprex to be certified in the Mifeprex REMS Program.” The program also requires health-care providers to only dispense Mifeprex in specific settings and to inform patients about the risks of serious complications. To ensure that patients understand the risk of serious complications, the FDA mandates that doctors require patients to sign a “patient agreement form.” Among other things, in signing the form the patient confirms that her “healthcare provider has talked with me about the risks including heavy bleeding, infection, and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy outside the womb).” The patient also verifies that she has the medication guide and will take it with her if she needs care at an emergency room “so that they will understand that I am having a medical abortion with Mifeprex.” The FDA also informs emergency room physicians of the protocol for treating women suffering from complications after taking Mifeprex. Women who follow Glamour’s lead and obtain Mifeprex illegally won’t have the benefit of these precautions, a medical consultation, or examination, or a doctor walking them through the risks and warning signs of serious complications. Women Help Women does provide warnings on its webpage about complications, but the FDA believed that to properly mitigate the risk of serious injury or death, a medical professional needed to verbally review the risk factors with the patient. While the FDA directs women to provide emergency room personnel with the Mifeprex medication guide, Women Help Women tells women to lie to their ER doctor and claim they are having a miscarriage. So much for Glamour’s claim that “women are smart, sentient beings who can follow directions [and] take medication as prescribed.”  The Data Only Relates to Abortions Under Medical Care What about those studies Glamour highlighted? Well, Glamour misinterpreted, misrepresented, or blindly ignored several significant facts. For instance, the study the fashion magazine claims “suggest[s] that medication abortion pills are perfectly safe to provide over the counter,” if read in full, concludes several “evidence gaps” necessitate additional research before over-the-counter sale would be appropriate. That same article also raised several red flags on the “extremely safe” narrative. For instance, the study stressed that “[c]omplications will also be more common if medical termination regimens are used (off-label) at gestational ages beyond 10 weeks.” The study also reported that many women self-assessing the gestational age of their unborn babies are at least that far along. In one study, 33 percent of the women followed up on believed they were candidates to use the abortion pill, including 10 percent who were 13 weeks or further along in their pregnancies. Another study showed that when women used the “eligibility checklist” from Women on Web, nearly 30 percent wrongly concluded that it was safe for them to use Mifeprex. When women used the ‘eligibility checklist’ from Women on Web, nearly 30 percent wrongly concluded that it was safe for them to use Mifeprex. Glamour also dangerously cribs from the study it relies upon in “Research Confirms You Can Safely Induce Your Own Abortion.” Contrary to Glamour’s portrayal, the patients included in the study did not “self-source” or “self-manage” their abortions. The women did not purchase Mifeprex online, from a veterinarian, or on the black market. Instead they received the abortion pill from Women on Web following a consultation with a doctor. Further, nearly 60 percent of the women in that study had an ultrasound before proceeding with the chemical abortion. Not only does the ultrasound confirm the baby’s gestational age, it will reveal if the woman has an ectopic pregnancy—one where the embryo attaches outside the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies present serious risks to the mother and, because the signs of an abortion with Mifeprex mirror complications from an ectopic pregnancy, using Mifeprex in that situation is extremely dangerous. Women obtaining Mifeprex at abortion clinics in the United States typically receive an ultrasound to determine both the baby’s gestational age and to ensure the pregnancy is not ectopic. Similarly, the majority of the women included in the studies Glamour touted likewise underwent ultrasounds before ingesting Mifeprex. The clinical trials submitted to the FDA in support of the Mifeprex application for approval also included only women who had undergone an ultrasound. Glamour mentions none of this, and Women Help Women merely directs women not to use Mifeprex if, among other things, they are having an ectopic pregnancy. But there is no way to know this without an ultrasound—until it is too late. The Implications Are Horrendous Glamour has done its readers a grave and dangerous disservice. They have encouraged pregnant women (or worse yet, disgruntled fathers–to-be) to illegally procure a dangerous drug while implying medical oversight is not needed. This is even more disconcerting given that in recent years Glamour has shifted its target to younger women, specifically the college set. Women who abort a 12-week-old fetus might not be prepared to view the human remains of their child. Further, even 20 years ago, more than 20 percent of 12- to 15-year-old girls said they read Glamour regularly. These young girls will be even more lacking in the ability to “self-manage” an abortion, withstand any pressure placed on them to abort, and later navigate the emotional and psychological ramifications of an abortion. In fact, American Family Physicians highlighted that “[s]ocial or psychological contraindications to medical abortion are more common than medical contraindications.” Even ardent supporters of chemical abortion recognized the importance of properly assessing the gestational age because of “social” risks: “Termination later in pregnancy also carries increasing medical risks and, potentially, legal and social risks, depending on the setting.” Abortion Translator Activated: Women who have miscalculated their unborn child’s gestational age and proceed to abort a 12-week-old fetus might not be prepared to view the human remains of their child. Glamour bills itself as “one of the biggest fashion and beauty magazine brands, reaching an all-time high of one out of eight American women, with 10 million print readers and 15 million unique users online.” While the magazine might be a great source for beauty and fashion tips, women (and girls) should not rely on Glamour for pointers about “reproductive health.” As for abortion-rights advocates: “Safe, legal and rare” is so ‘90s. Today’s tagline: Unsafe, illegal, DIY. ","https://thefederalist.com/2017/05/26/friends-dont-let-friends-take-glamours-horrific-advice-diy-abortions/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"87",87,"Democrats’ Inexorable Abortion Logic Has Finally Caught Up With Them","Daniel Davidson","John",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-01"," This week, Democrats finally succumbed to the inescapable logic of abortion. They have admitted, perhaps against their better judgement, that there really is no difference between abortion and infanticide. Between New York’s expansive new abortion legislation, a bill now before the Virginia General Assembly, and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s infamous comments about making a just-born infant “comfortable” while the mother and a physician discuss whether to snuff its life out, there can be no doubt that Democrats have acceded to the demands of their own ruthless logic on abortion.  What that logic demands is nothing less than unrestricted abortion up to the moment of birth and after. There is almost nothing in these bills to limit late-term abortion. Indeed, they constitute a strenuous effort to free late-term abortion of any kind of medical justification. The Virginia bill, for example, would change state law to allow third-trimester abortions if the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to “impair the mental or physical health of the woman”—removing the qualifiers “substantially and irremediably.” In other words, almost any impairment—anxiety, depression, physical discomfort—is enough to justify abortion up to the point of delivery. As my colleague David Harsanyi pointed out on Twitter, is there a difference between aborting a fetus in the third trimester because it’s causing the mother emotional distress, and killing a premature infant in the NICU for the same reason? If there is a difference, what is it? Will any Democrat say?  I wish someone could explain the moral difference between going to a NICU unit and injecting poison into a premature baby that is causing the mother emotional stress & injecting poison into another baby – same age; same reason– that's in the womb?
— David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) January 31, 2019  They will not, because there is no difference, and they know it. These bills demonstrate that the debate over abortion was never about when life begins. All that hemming and hawing about a fetus just being a “clump of cells” was disingenuous from the start.  In fact, there has never been any doubt about when human life begins (it begins at conception). The debate was always about whether we would by law make the life of the unborn—or the just-born—subject to the convenience and desire of the mother. Democrats have decided that we should. Abortion Is a Triumph of Will over Rights Until recently, abortion advocates refused to acknowledge this. But now they are coming around, in part because the Democratic Party’s leftist base has demanded it. They don’t want any more talk about abortion being “safe, legal, and rare,” they want to proclaim it as a positive good. But to do that, abortion mustn’t hinge on a question of biology or gestation or fetus viability, but on the sheer will of the mother. It’s now possible to find abortion advocates who will come right out and say this, and even talk about it at length. In an August 2017 episode of Philosophy Time, a YouTube series in which actor James Franco and philosophy professor Eliot Michaelson have conversations with academics about various topics, the interviewee was professor Elizabeth Harman, who teaches philosophy at Princeton University. Harman attempted to explain why aborted fetuses don’t have “moral status” the way that non-aborted fetuses do. She said that everyone alive has moral status, and that we all had moral status when we were in utero, “in virtue of our futures… We were [the] beginning stages of persons. But some early fetuses will die in early pregnancy due to abortion or miscarriage. And in my view that is a very different kind of entity. That’s something that doesn’t have a future as a person and it doesn’t have moral status.”   The key moment in the interview is when Franco and Michaelson press Harman to clarify what she means. Michaelson asks, “Why would we think that what’s actually going to happen to a fetus in the future is going to make this big difference between having some moral status and not?” A bit later, Franco asks, “If a woman decides to have an abortion with an early fetus, just that act or that intention negates the ‘moral status’ of that early fetus just because if she goes out and has an abortion, it’s pretty certain that it’s not going to become a person?” Harman’s response is worth quoting at length, because she articulates what has always been the necessary logical position of abortion supporters, although even she struggles to come out and state it plainly: Right, so it might look like, on my view, abortion is permissible because you had the abortion but that abortion wouldn’t have been permissible if you didn’t have the abortion. That’s not quite the view, for I think two different reasons. So one reason is that, um, even if you have moral status—and in my view back when you were an early fetus you had moral status—but it’s not that aborting you would have been wrong, because if your mother had chosen to abort her pregnancy then it wouldn’t have been the case that you would have had moral status because you would have died as an early fetus, so she would have been aborting something that didn’t have moral status.
So it’s not—my view isn’t that if you do abort, abortion is OK but if you don’t abort, abortion would have been wrong. But what it turns out is that it’s a contingent matter that you have moral status. You actually have moral status but you might not have counted morally at all if you had been aborted. You would have existed but you just would have had this really very short existence in which you wouldn’t have mattered morally. That’s a tortured way of saying that if a woman desires to bring her fetus to term, she imputes personhood to her child and it gains moral status. That is, nothing but the woman’s will confers moral status on the unborn child. In Harman’s view, there is nothing inherent about a fetus that gives it moral status. The right to life, to personhood, is entirely contingent. In the actual interview, Harman might sound a bit befuddled, but she’s no fool (she has a PhD in philosophy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a bachelor’s from Harvard, and teaches at Princeton). Harman knows exactly what she’s saying—and why. At least she’s honest. Unlike most abortion advocates, Harman is willing to accept that whether a baby is born or not is an irrelevant milestone, a meaningless observation. What really matters is whether the mother desires it to be born. Tiny Step From Third-Trimester Abortion to Infanticide Whether he intended to or not, Northam has now done the same. He has admitted that what really matters—even when an infant has been born alive during a botched third-trimester abortion—is what the woman wants. In his interview with a Virginia radio station earlier this week, he said, “If the mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen: the infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if this is what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother.” We used to hear abortion defenders talk about a woman’s body—“my body, my choice”—and how male legislators shouldn’t be telling a woman what to do with her body, as though the fetus were an appendage or an organ. To some extent we still hear that sort of language. But with the Democratic Party’s sharp leftward lurch, and the legislation Democrats are now advancing in blue states, the emphasis has unmistakably shifted from a woman’s body to her will. At the very least, this is a moment of clarity. Now we can dispense with the Roe v. Wade fiction that we must balance society’s interest in the potentiality for life against a woman’s right to privacy. Abortion advocates obviously never cared about the potentiality of life or the viability of a fetus. The only difference today is that they feel free to say so. We will likely hear no more talk from them about  how life begins at some particular point, but rather about how it doesn’t matter when life begins because the desire and convenience of the mother trumps the life of the child—born or unborn. Now at last the pretense has lifted and we can talk about what we should have been talking about for the past 46 years: whether parents have the right to commit infanticide against their unwanted children.

"89",89,"Major U.S. Health Association Invites Abortion Profiteer To Keynote Its Convention","Studnicki","James",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-27"," Nearly 50 years ago, as a new doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University, I had my first meeting with my faculty adviser: Dr. Ernest Lyman Stebbins, dean of the school and a luminary in international public health. The school wing where we met was already named after him! “Stebbie” turned out to be approachable and supportive. This great and wise man, even at our initial meeting, treated me as a colleague. He also offered advice that has guided my career: “The passion of advocacy can be an important influence on social change. But science must always lead. Advocacy which denies or distorts science is a fraudulent exercise which undermines both the society and the conduct of science.” I could never have imagined how relevant his remarks would prove a half-century later.  This weekend in Denver, science and advocacy will joust over one of the most contentious issues: induced abortion. The keynote speaker at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association (APHA) will be Cecile Richards, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood. Her selection demonstrates the strong advocacy position organized public health takes regarding legal abortion. What Cecile Richards Won’t Talk About Richards will likely discuss “access to health services,” “reproductive freedom,” and a “woman’s right to choose,” or the importance of “safe abortions.” She may mention the political divide over legal abortion, and exhort APHA attendees to vigorously support pro-abortion legislative initiatives. But she will not talk about the actual abortion procedure—that there is no “safe” abortion for the developing child. She will not mention the potential negative consequences of abortion for mothers and their future children. She certainly will not use the word “death” in referring to abortion. But what is the science? No credible scientific group disputes that a new, genetically distinct organism begins with fertilization, the union of the male sperm and the female egg that forms the zygote (embryo). Simply stated, human life begins at conception.  Nor is there any doubt that, barring miscarriage or induced abortion, conception usually results in a live birth. Therefore, no matter the gestational period at which it occurs, abortion ends an individual human life. Abortion is a cause of death. Even staunch advocates concede that abortion is death, that denying this scientific fact is self-delusional, and that their goal is to morally justify that death. Abortion: The Leading Cause of Death in the United States Causes and patterns of mortality are key metrics of public health science. Health promotion activities focus upon populations where morbidity and mortality rates are extreme, or where large racial, ethnic, gender, socioeconomic, or geospatial differences exist among subpopulations. Along with migration and fertility, mortality is a principal determinant of the size and demographic composition of society, and cause-specific mortality patterns crucially influence where lawmakers and agencies spend public money. As a proximate cause of death, induced abortion is stunningly consequential. The incidence (number of deaths) dwarfs other causes, with immense racial and ethnic disparities. In the United States in 2009, integrating official government reports on pregnancy outcomes (including abortions) and all causes of death, induced abortions were the leading cause of death for the total society, representing 32.1 percent of all deaths. By contrast, all diseases of the heart represented 16.7 percent, and malignant neoplasms 15.8 percent, of all deaths. Induced abortions were only 16.4 percent of all deaths for non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), but 61.1 percent and 64.0 percent of all deaths for non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and Hispanics, respectively. For Hispanics and NHBs, deaths from abortions were 79.3 and 57.5 times, respectively, the number of homicides. For NHWs, deaths from abortion were 12.4 times the number of suicides.  Yet, despite conclusive science to the contrary, high incidence, and huge racial and ethnic disparities, induced abortion is not reported as a cause of death in U.S. vital statistics. This enables abortion to be scrubbed from the nation’s research agenda, discouraging comprehensive reporting and limiting funding to serious abortion researchers. Good Science Drives Out Bad Ideology Three states (California, Maryland, and New Hampshire) do not report abortions to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and reporting is uneven among states that do report. The pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute has stressed the need for complete, valid data in addressing abortion as a public health issue and informing research on unintended pregnancies and contraceptive method effectiveness. Guttmacher endorses a coordinated federal and state effort to build a robust abortion reporting system that is “similar to the existing systems for other vital statistics such as births and deaths.” However, given the current exclusion as a cause of death and the paucity of valid abortion data despite its huge mortality burden compared to other causes of death, abortion research is essentially unfunded. In the absence or denial of available science, public dialogue will be driven by ideology. We see, in Stebbins’ words, this “fraudulent exercise” when euphemisms such as “access to health services” are used in an attempt to deny the objective reality of fetal deaths. This ideologically driven denial also has a corrosive effect on conducting science. The editor of a well-known public health journal, declining to use a manuscript on this subject, explained (direct quote), “In the tradition of [journal name withheld], the reviewers were all staunch advocates of ‘choice’ and were unhappy with your point of view.” This blatant bias chillingly affirms Stebbins’ warning. An induced abortion is the death of a human being, determined and carried out by other human beings in a conscious, deliberate process. In this respect abortion is similar to capital punishment and subject to the same clash of religious, political, and ideological values. The appropriate role of science is to inform the societal dialogue with objective information. One hopes that partisans on either side of the abortion legality debate would prefer to avoid taking a life. Thus, the general consensus that abortion should be “rare.” Public health science has a special contribution to make, since an abortion is a preventable death. However, refusing to acknowledge abortion as a death undermines the role of science and the transparency so fundamental to a free society.  James Studnicki

"90",90,"20,000 Problems Facing Abortion Advocates At The Supreme Court","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-03-01"," On March 2 the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, a challenge to a Texas law requiring abortionists to adhere to the same basic, common-sense health and safety standards as similar surgical centers. Justice Antonin Scalia’s death means the eight remaining justices will decide whether the Constitution affords a “right” to a less “safe” abortion. What the Court won’t be asked to decide, however, may be even more noteworthy—and should raise questions about the abortion industry and its arguments both in Whole Women’s Health and for any nominee who would replace Justice Scalia.  Almost three years ago the Texas legislature enacted HB2, the principle components of which are (1) restricting abortions after 20 weeks, when we know the unborn child can feel pain; (2) requiring abortionists to comply with the Food and Drug Administration’s approved protocol on chemical abortions; and (3) ensuring that abortionists would have to comply with basic health and safety standards. The uproar made national headlines, with pro-abortion protesters chanting “Hail Satan” at praying pro-lifers, screaming inside the state Senate chamber to try to disrupt it, and even bringing jars of excrement—thankfully confiscated—into the chamber. The controversy launched stardom for Wendy Davis, the state senator national abortion activists celebrated as the face of the opposition before Greg Abbott trounced her in the governor’s race. Davis’s opposition to the bill largely focused on its restriction of abortion on pain-capable unborn children after 20 weeks, claiming such a limitation on later-term abortions would endanger women who need these abortions for “health” reasons. Abortion Supporters Don’t Challenge 20-Week Bans in Court Yet, almost three years later, this prohibition on abortions after 20 weeks remains unchallenged. It has been Texas law since October 2013. The Court will not consider that part of the law because the abortion industry, despite its claims about harm to women and Wendy Davis’s rhetoric, has chosen not to challenge it. It’s not an oversight. MSNBC reported there is …a strategic reason to avoid challenging that [20-week] ban…. [A] Texas challenge would go to the conservative Fifth Circuit. Not only would that court potentially uphold the law…, the combination of decisions would create a split in the circuits that would make the Supreme Court likelier to hear it. Texas isn’t the only state where abortion activists have talked tough but declined to challenge these laws. Fifteen states have enacted similar laws. The abortion industry has chosen only to challenge them in the Ninth Circuit and a Georgia state court. In none of those 12 states where the laws are in effect is there a known example of any harm to any woman.  For decades the abortion industry challenged laws by assertion—having their own abortionists use their medical credentials to forecast imminent harms to women. But in recent years courts have refused to take abortionists at their word, freeing legislatures to make those factual judgments instead. Abortionists can choose to avoid court, but they can’t also pretend that their rhetoric about these laws harming women’s health is based in reality if they challenge these laws years hence after their claims have been tested and disproven daily. Calling the Abortion Industry’s ‘Health’ Bluff Likewise, when the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2006, abortionists argued that approximately 2,200 partial-birth abortions per year were necessary for health reasons. This was important because the law lacked any health exception (except to save the mother’s life). When the Supreme Court issued its 5-4 opinion in Gonzales v. Carhart almost nine years ago in April 2007, it held that the law was facially constitutional. Abortionists argued that approximately 2,200 partial-birth abortions per year were necessary for health reasons. But it also called the abortion industry’s bluff. The Court invited any abortionist or woman to file a new challenge showing why a partial-birth abortion was necessary in one of those 2,200-per-year (six per day) instances. Planned Parenthood warned of consequences for women’s health from the decision. Justice Ginsburg wrote in a dissent: “One may anticipate that such a pre-enforcement challenge will be mounted swiftly, to ward off serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women whose health would be endangered by the intact D&E prohibition.” Yes, one would “anticipate.” Unless none of it was true.  Nearly nine years later, no such complaint has been filed nor is there any evidence any woman was harmed by not being able to have a partial-birth abortion procedure in that time. There are four possible reasons: (1) by incredible fortune, the threats to women’s health making partial-birth abortion necessary ceased on April 18, 2007; (2) Women are harmed daily, but Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry lack the resources to file the Supreme Court’s invited lawsuits; (3) the claim that partial-birth abortion was necessary to protect women’s health was a lie; or (4) the abortion industry routinely violates the law. March 2 will be the 3,241st day since the Court upheld the PBA Ban Act. Using the abortion industry’s own figures of roughly six partial birth abortions per day, that decision will have prevented 19,446 partial-birth abortions—without a single one resulting in an as-applied challenge or even a public disclosure of harm to a woman. When the Supreme Court addresses the Texas law March 2 and assesses the veracity of the abortion industry’s new claims about threats to women’s health, it will now have the benefit of years of real-world tests, showing the abortion industry cannot be trusted. Beware Obama and Clinton Supreme Court Appointees Should President Obama nominate a replacement for Justice Scalia, there is no reason for the Senate to even hold a hearing. It should not, given Obama’s admission that his nominee will be no moderate. But even if the Senate unwisely holds such a hearing, the nominee should be asked not only about partial-birth abortion and similar practices in theory, but also about the near decade of factual evidence that the abortion industry was lying. Hillary Clinton would presumably nominate a justice to allow partial-birth abortions again. Hillary Clinton has already signaled  she opposes the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act and would presumably nominate a justice to reverse the decade-old precedent and allow them again. In Justice Kagan’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings she was questioned about the revelation that as White House policy advisor she actually changed the position statement of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to bolster opposition to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. We now know the claim about the necessity of partial-birth abortion for women’s health was factually false. Every day adds to the nearly 20,000 pieces of evidence that the abortion industry and its defenders were simply wrong. As the Supreme Court evaluates the Texas law and President Obama asks Congress to confirm a replacement for Justice Scalia, abortion activists and their defenders are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.

"91",91,"Everything You Need To Know About The Case Freezing The FDA’s Abortion Pill Approval","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-04-11"," In a 67-page opinion in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, a federal judge on Friday “stayed” the FDA’s Sept. 28, 2000, approval of the abortion pill and the agency’s follow-up decisions from 2016, 2019, and 2021. 



The detailed opinion by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, addresses an array of complex legal issues. Here’s what you need to know to understand the litigation.



Facts First



In 1996, the Population Council filed an application with the FDA seeking approval of the abortion pill, which is really two pills: mifepristone, also known as RU-486, and misoprostol. Mifepristone blocks the production of progesterone causing the death of the unborn human, who is nurtured by progesterone in utero. Misoprostol then induces “cramping and contractions to expel the unborn human from the mother’s womb.”



The FDA told the Population Council in February of 2000 that it did not believe the evidence submitted adequately demonstrated that the drug, if distributed as proposed, was safe and effective for use. Accordingly, the FDA concluded, the “restrictions on distribution will need to be amended.” Yet a few months later, the FDA approved the abortion drug under its Subpart H “accelerated approval” process. 



The FDA’s approval was for use of the drug up to seven-weeks gestation and required three in-person office visits, first to administer mifepristone, second to administer misoprostol, and third to assess any complications and ensure the abortion had been complete. Additionally, prescribers were required to be properly trained and to report any adverse events. 



In 2002, the plaintiffs filed a “citizen petition” with the FDA, objecting to the agency’s approval of the abortion drug. It was not until nearly 14 years later, however, on March 29, 2016, that the FDA rejected the plaintiffs’ 2002 petition. The same day the FDA rejected the petition challenging the initial approval of the abortion drug, the FDA removed several of the restrictions on its distribution. 



Specifically, in 2016, the FDA increased the maximum gestational age from seven weeks to 10 weeks. The FDA also reduced the number of office visits from three to one, allowed non-doctors to prescribe and administer the drug, changed the dosage, and eliminated the requirement that adverse events be reported, unless they proved fatal.



Plaintiffs filed a second citizen petition with the FDA in 2019, challenging the FDA’s 2016 removal of the various safety restrictions. On Dec. 16, 2021, the FDA denied the 2019 petition. In the interim, in 2019, the FDA approved the distribution of a generic version of the abortion pill. On April 12, 2021, the FDA announced it would allow mifepristone to be dispensed through the mail, ostensibly due to Covid, but the FDA has since made mail distribution a permanent option. 



In November of 2022, the plaintiffs, who consist of doctors and national medical associations that provide health care for pregnant and post-abortive women and girls, sued the FDA, challenging the initial 2000 approval of the abortion drug, the removal of the safety precautions in 2016, the approval of the generic chemical-abortion drugs in 2019, and the 2021 decision to permit the distribution of the drug via the mail. Soon after, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking a court order directing the defendants to withdraw or suspend the various FDA decisions.



Do the Plaintiffs Have Standing?



Before addressing the merits of the case, the court analyzed the initial question of “standing,” or whether the plaintiffs have the right to sue. To have standing, plaintiffs must generally show they suffered a concrete injury, caused by the defendant, that can be “redressed” by the court. 



The court held the plaintiffs had standing to sue as an association whose members had standing. Those members, who are doctors, have standing, the court held, because they alleged that the approval of the dangerous abortion drugs injures them by overwhelming the medical system and placing “enormous pressure and stress” on the doctors during emergencies and complications. 



Friday’s opinion further concluded the medical association members had standing to challenge the FDA’s decision on behalf of their patients. Here, the court noted the Supreme Court has allowed abortion doctors to represent the interests of women seeking abortions, notwithstanding the conflict of interest between the two — with the abortionists often seeking to scrap laws designed to protect their patients. In this case, the court reasoned, the doctors’ relationship with patients is at least as close, if not closer, further justifying standing.



A third basis for standing exists, the court added, based on the harm to the association itself because the FDA’s approval of the abortion drug forces the plaintiffs to redirect their resources from other activities to educate the public on the dangers of the abortion pill. 



Did the Plaintiffs Wait Too Long to Sue?



A second preliminary question the court addressed concerns the timeliness of the lawsuit. The FDA argued the plaintiffs’ challenge to the 2000 approval of the abortion pill was time-barred because it had rejected the citizen petition in 2016 and the statute of limitations is six years. The court rejected that argument, holding that by undertaking a full review of the safety provisions in 2019, the FDA had restarted the limitation period. 



Alternatively, the court concluded the plaintiffs’ challenge to the 2000 approval is not time-barred based on the principle of equitable tolling. “It took FDA 13 years, 7 months, and 9 days to respond to the 2002 Petition,” the court stressed. Then in responding, the FDA “moved the goalposts by substantially changing the regulatory scheme on the same day it issued its Response.” 



Another delay soon followed, with the FDA taking almost three years to respond to the 2019 petition. “Thus, in the 20 years between the 2002 Petition and the filing of this suit, Plaintiffs were waiting on FDA for over 16 of those years,” the court noted, saying fairness favored the plaintiffs under these circumstances.



Must the Plaintiffs Wait Years More Before Suing?



The Biden administration presented one more preliminary challenge to the lawsuit, arguing the plaintiffs could not challenge the FDA’s 2019 approval of a generic version of the abortion drug or the FDA’s 2021 decision to allow the distribution of the drugs via the mail because they did not “exhaust” their administrative remedies, meaning they did not present these complaints to the FDA first.



The court rejected this argument as well, finding exhaustion was not required for a variety of reasons — explained in detail in the opinion — including that seeking review by the FDA would be “futile.” 



“Any attempt by Plaintiffs to challenge Defendants’ actions would likely be futile,” the court reasoned, because “even if Plaintiffs did not endure sixteen years of delay, dawdle, and dithering, their efforts would surely ‘be futile because the administrative agency will clearly reject the claim.’” Here, the court pointed to President Biden’s emphasis post-Dobbs on “the need to protect access to mifepristone.” 



Next, the Merits



Of the legal challenges, the narrowest one concerns the FDA’s decision to allow the distribution of the abortion pill via the mail. Kacsmaryk held that that decision violates the 1873 Comstock Act, which makes it illegal to send by mail: “[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion,” and “[e]very article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or thing which is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply it for producing abortion.”



Notwithstanding this plain language, the Biden administration argued the Comstock Act only prohibits the mailing of abortion drugs if the sender intends them to be used “unlawfully.” But that is not what the Comstock Act says, and Kacsmaryk held that when the language of a statute is clear, the court must enforce it as written.



Could FDA Approve the Drugs under Subpart H?



As noted above, the FDA approved the abortion pill in 2000 under the auspices of its Subpart H, titled, “Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses.” Approval under Subpart H requires drugs to satisfy two requirements. First, drug studies must establish its “safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses.” Second, the drug must “provide [a] meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments.” 



The court held the FDA’s approval of the abortion pill in 2000 violated Subpart H first because it did not “treat” a “serious or life-threatening illness,” and second because it did not provide a therapeutic benefit” over surgical abortions. In reaching these conclusions, the court stressed that pregnancy is not a sickness, much less a “life-threatening” one, and that the FDA lacked any evidence showing the abortion pill provided a benefit over surgical abortion.



Did FDA Act Arbitrarily and Capriciously?



The final question before the court concerned the legality of the FDA’s approval of the abortion pill and its generic offspring. By statute, the FDA must deny approval of a new drug application if the agency has insufficient information to determine if the drug is safe for use as intended. 



In seeking approval of the abortion pill, the applicant, the Population Council, relied on U.S. trials that required: 




(1) each woman receive an ultrasound to confirm gestational age and exclude an ectopic pregnancy; (2) physicians have experience in performing surgical abortions and admitting privileges at medical facilities that provide emergency care; (3) all patients be within one hour of emergency facilities or the facilities of the principal investigator; and (4) women be monitored for four hours to check for adverse events after taking misoprostol.




Yet the original 2000 approval and then the later modifications lacked these basic safety precautions. These omissions, the court stressed, and especially the FDA’s failure to require an ultrasound to identify ectopic pregnancies, increased the danger of the abortion pill. The court also noted the FDA “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem” by omitting any evaluation of the psychological or long-term medical consequences of the drug. 



What the court found most significant, however, was the FDA’s initial conclusion that it lacked adequate information “to demonstrate that the drug, when marketed in accordance with the terms of distribution proposed, is safe and effective for use as recommended.” Notwithstanding that finding, the FDA, after political pressure, altered course and approved the abortion pill. 



The court concluded that, under these circumstances, the FDA had acted arbitrarily and capriciously by acquiescing “on its legitimate safety concerns — in violation of its statutory duty.” And because the generic approval relied on the flawed 2000 approval, that decision likewise was arbitrary and capricious, the court held.



The FDA has already filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On appeal, the Biden administration will reassert these various arguments. Whether the Fifth Circuit will agree with the FDA remains to be seen. But Kacsmaryk’s thorough analysis of the record will make it difficult for the appellate court to hide behind the FDA’s discretion because his opinion exposes the lack of scientific support for the FDA’s approval of the abortion pill. 



Time will tell, though — and maybe, too, the Supreme Court.

"92",92,"New Report Wildly Inflates Global Abortion Numbers","Grossu","Arina","O.","Jacobson, Thomas",NA,NA,"2016-05-26"," There’s an old saying that that if you torture the numbers long enough, they will confess to anything. Recently, the Guttmacher Institute, which has strong ties to Planned Parenthood, published yet another dubious, politically driven report that fudges the numbers on worldwide abortion incidence. Predictably, it is funded by abortion-friendly groups like the Packard Foundation, United Nations Population Fund, World Health Organization, and others. The main problem with the new Guttmacher report is that it does not include actual verifiable data for all countries. If the “government agencies” cited refer to ministries of health and other government offices that collect service reports and data from hospitals and abortion centers, then this data is most likely reliable.  However, data compiled from so-called “national representative studies,” whether published or unpublished, are highly suspicious, and this raises important questions. How did these studies obtain their abortion data from the 60 countries where abortion is illegal? Who is reporting those abortions? How is data collected in countries where abortion is underreported? What about countries that do not have strict reporting requirements and have trouble tracking things such as basic vital statistics, let alone abortion data? It is possible to track 12.4 million actually reported abortions annually worldwide, including in the top three countries of China, the United States, and Russia. But Guttmacher’s assertion that 56.3 million abortions occur worldwide annually is highly improbable and unprovable, not to mention that their total is four and a half times more than the actual documented data available. (Actual abortion data are available here for over 100 nations and territories, including year-by-year for many of them). Perhaps this is why the report even admits on all of its charts that is has a “90% uncertainty interval.” Who publishes a report with information that is 90 percent uncertain? A report worthy of being trusted should have a 90 percent or more certainty level. The Real Game Is Government Spending The better question is, why is Guttmacher advancing this report? The answer is clear. This report is a tool to push for more contraception and abortion, especially in developing countries such as many in Africa and Latin America. The report asserts, again with 90 percent uncertainty, that abortion rates are just as high where abortion is illegal as where it is legal.  Of course we know this to be purely speculative bias. The facts counter it. In actual recordable abortion data we see that whenever abortion is legalized, its incidence typically increases exponentially. These country charts with actual abortion data tell this story quite clearly. Take, for example, abortion numbers in America. Prior to 1969, the recorded number of annual abortions was nearly non-existent. By 1972 when 20 states had legalized abortion, the number of abortions jumped to a little over half a million annually. When abortion was nationally legalized in 1973, it initially doubled to about a million abortions annually, then peaked at 1.5 million between 1979 to 1992, and now has settled back to around 1 million annually. We also know that pro-life laws reduce abortions. First, as Michael New, a visiting associate professor at Ave Maria University and an associate scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, has explained, a 2004 study analyzed how changes in abortion policies in post-Communist Eastern Europe affected abortion rates. The authors concluded that modest restrictions on abortion reduced abortion by about 25 percent. Second, a 2009 Guttmacher literature review identified 18 studies that analyzed Medicaid funding for abortion here in the United States. In 15 of the 18 studies, abortion rates went down when Medicaid funding for abortions was cut off: “18-37 percent of pregnancies that would have ended in Medicaid-funded abortions were carried to term when [Medicaid] funding was no longer available.” We know that pro-life laws keep abortion numbers down, contrary to what this new study claims.  The Women of the World Don’t Want More Contraceptives The purpose of the new report is to create an imaginary increased “need” for more contraceptives and to manipulate developing nations with strict abortion laws to authorize abortion on demand. Ironically, the same author found in a 2014 study that when married women in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean were asked why they do not use modern contraceptives, only 4 to 8 percent of them cited “lack of access.” Many more women reported opposition to contraception, concern about the side effects and health risks, current breastfeeding, and infrequency of sex as reasons for non-use of contraceptives. Further, self-reported “lack of access” to contraceptives by all married women is less than 2 percent in Africa, less than 1 percent in Asia, and half of a percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. Women and families in developing countries do not “need” any more contraceptives. They are saturated with them. Children in South Africa use condoms to make soccer balls. What they need are basic health care, food, and clean water. Let’s focus our attention on providing those, and not more contraceptives or abortion. The study is ideology-driven, not data-driven. It’s a conclusion in search of numbers, not numbers in search of a conclusion. What it does affirm, though, is that abortion is the greatest genocide in history.

"95",95,"Oregon’s New Abortion Law Proves The Left Doesn’t Care About Consent","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-07-14"," The radical pro-abortion agenda has met little resistance in Oregon. The west coast is governed by some of the most radical leftists in the country, but in the case of abortion regulations, Oregon has historically outdone California and Washington. It seeks to lengthen its lead in the race toward the ultimate culture of death with its latest bill, HB3391, which passed the state Senate and is heading for the desk of Governor Kate Brown. Brown’s staff-managed Twitter account certainly conveyed enthusiasm for the bill.  Yes! Yes! Yes! ""Oregon Legislature Approves Reproductive Services Bill Covering Abortions, Contraceptives"" https://t.co/8ifkUIHHXo
— Kate Brown (@KateBrownForOR) July 6, 2017  And seeing that Brown is a former abortion lobbyist, this bill will pass.  The Act, titled “Relating to reproductive health care; and declaring an emergency,” will force insurers to cover 100 percent of the cost of an abortion, regardless of medical necessity. Elective abortion in Oregon is now totally free. It’s either covered by one’s insurer, or else covered directly by the state through the Oregon Health Authority. The last line of the bill reads, “This 2017 Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, an emergency is declared to exist, and this 2017 Act takes effect on its passage.” The audacity of the radicals who wrote this bill is breathtaking. Elected Democrats don’t just want to force all Oregonians to finance abortions (for literally any reason—Oregon has the most unregulated abortion industry in the nation), but they’re calling it an emergency. It doesn’t even have a catchy Orwellian acronym to market it to the public, like “life,” or “freedom,” or “save.” Nor do they care that a good portion of their constituents don’t want to pay for a procedure they find morally repugnant (roughly one third of Oregonians believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases according to Pew polling). It’s an emergency though, so maybe they just didn’t have time for marketing. This Forces U.S. Taxpayers To Fund Elective Abortion HB3391, which will take effect January 1, 2018 if ratified by Gov. Brown, tasks the Oregon Health Authority with designing a program for “statewide access to abortion coverage.” It appropriates $10.2 billion from the General Fund for this purpose, but the state expressly directs the Health Authority to seek federal funding for the program. Section 5 of the bill reads:  The authority, in collaboration with the Department of Consumer and Business Services if necessary, shall explore any and all opportunities to obtain federal financial participation in the costs of implementing this section, including but not limited to waivers or demonstration projects under Title X of the Public Health Service Act or Title XIX or XXI of the Social Security Act. However, the implementation of this section is not contingent upon the authority’s receipt of a waiver or authorization to operate a demonstration project. The Hyde Amendment currently prohibits the Federal government from funding abortions, but Oregon still receives federal dollars for its numerous programs. The Health Authority received $11.5 billion from the federal government for the 2015-2016 Biennium, drawing only $2.1 billion from the General Fund and $6 billion from “Other Funds,” as well as $11 million from the Lottery Fund. The General Fund’s contribution to the Health Authority will effective quintuple through this act, but funding is just a game of allocation. Because the state receives federal dollars for its other programs to the tune of $21.58 billion, it can allocate more of the state’s general tax money toward programs like this one. Indeed, it may even be able to receive federal money for the parts of this bill that don’t directly pertain to abortion. The bottom line is that so long as Oregon receives federal funding, citizens across the country are forced into indirectly helping facilitate the ending of human lives—for whatever reason the mother may give. Oregon Has Embraced Abortion Without Limits Oregon is racing toward a dystopian culture of death. Assisted suicide (at least that bill had the courtesy of a euphemistic title, “Death With Dignity”) has been legal in Oregon for 20 years. As the first state to legalize restricted abortion 1969, Oregon now has next to zero restrictions on the procedure—no waiting periods, no informed consent for patients, not even parental consent for minors. (Ironically, physicians are required to give informed consent for the procedure of sterilization.) Oregon’s codes are pro-death from womb to tomb, so this bill, however appalling, is not surprising.  Notice, too, how the old mantras of pro-abortion rhetoric have fallen away. Who proclaims abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare” anymore? Do Oregon Democrats care if abortion is rare, considering they want to make it free? It’s even doubtful they care much about its safety, if one considers the lack of hospital admitting privilege requirements, informed consent, tracking abortion-related maternal deaths (something every state should be doing), or even a definition of an illegal abortion, which is extremely hazardous to a woman’s health, much less a penalty for it. Oregon residents aren’t even permitted the luxury of saying, “That’s between a woman and her doctor,” however they may personally feel about abortion. Subsidized abortion is a matter for the woman, her doctor, and the taxpayer, so in a sense, every tax-paying resident is forced into the abortion consultation. They are stuck with the bill. The radical left doesn’t want abortion to be a “private decision.” They want everyone to conform to their ideal society, where human lives are exterminated on a whim and the cost is covered by the collective. Ironically, the same radicals who support explicit consent for the act that creates life don’t think they need your consent to have you pay for its destruction. Is There A Way To Stop This Bill? There is a way to halt the enforcement of this bill, though, even after it is signed into law: If the Department of Consumer and Business Services concludes that enforcement of this section [Section 2] may adversely affect the allocation of federal funds to this state, the department may grant an exemption to the requirements but only to the minimum extent necessary to ensure the continued receipt of federal funds. Section 2 reads: “A health benefit plan offered in this state must provide coverage for all of the following services, drugs, devices, products and procedures” and lists abortion as one of the procedures. Subhead (3) states that insurers may not impose a copay. In other words, if Congress passed a rule saying that states may not force insurers to cover abortions, or even to cover more than 50 percent of the cost of an abortion, the power of this law could be considerably restrained, though such a rule wouldn’t stop Oregon from funding abortions directly. The Hyde Amendment prevents abortions from being covered under Medicaid and for “direct” funding of abortion, but it doesn’t prevent direct funding of abortion organizations like Planned Parenthood, much less funding states that subsidize abortion. It is imperative that Congress bar funding to any state that subsidizes abortion or requires insurers to cover it. This is an opportunity to use the power of the purse for good, and the GOP is morally obliged to take it.

"96",96,"5 Democrat Abortion Policies More Extreme Than Killing 7-Pound Babies","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-04-20"," Last week, due to Sen. Rand Paul’s prompting, national media asked Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman-Shultz whether she believed aborting full-term, seven-pound babies should be legal. Her response—that an abortion on a full-term child was the mother’s constitutional right—is clearly extreme and deserves the revulsion it has met. Quite obviously, the Democratic Party is no longer about abortion being “safe, legal, and rare,” as the Clinton-era party platform claimed. The party is now unabashed in its support for abortion through all nine months of pregnancy.  But as extreme as this position is, it is by no means the party’s most extreme with regard to abortion. Here are five positions of the party and many of its leaders (even if not necessarily all those who continue to vote for Democrats) that are arguably even more extreme. 1. Democrats Support Aborting Babies for Race, Sex, and Down Syndrome Democrats have strongly opposed state and federal bills prohibiting abortions sought because of the unborn child’s race or sex. When the U.S. House of Representatives considered the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act in 2012, which would have prohibited abortions because of the father’s race or the unborn child’s sex, Democrats opposed the bill by a vote of 161-20. A party that describes itself as a champion of women and minorities is willing to sacrifice those principles for abortion. Likewise, when a similar bill became law in Arizona, it did so with only two Democratic votes (22 against) in the entire Arizona legislature. The law now faces an ongoing lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union. Similarly, a North Dakota bill prohibiting abortion because of Down Syndrome passed against Democratic objection. Democrats do not just support aborting seven-pound babies. They apparently support aborting seven-pound babies even when they are targeted because they are girls, their father was black, or they might have a disability.  2. Democrats Oppose Offering Women Other Alternatives Everyone should be able to agree that women should be aware of their options before having an abortion. Unfortunately, Democrats all too often don’t seem to share that view. Clinton administration regulations require government-funded counselors at Planned Parenthood to tell women about abortion, but adoption counseling is optional. In recent years, Democrats, at the behest of abortion advocacy groups, have gone on the offensive against nonprofit organizations that provide women with information about abortion alternatives and offer them practical support (diapers, parenting classes, help enrolling in public-assistance programs, etc.) so they can choose to keep their baby. Most recently, in California, Democrats have proposed an unconstitutional bill to force these pro-life pregnancy centers to refer women for abortions.The Clinton administration regulations on Title X (pregnancy “options counseling”) require government-funded counselors at Planned Parenthood to tell women about abortion, but adoption counseling is optional. Taxpayer-paid “options” counselors at Planned Parenthood can satisfy their obligation to fully inform a woman in a crisis pregnancy about her options by telling her about abortion and keeping the baby without saying a word about adoption. In effect, the Clinton administration regulations, coupled with using abortionists as Title X providers, have created an adoption gag rule. Perhaps this is why Planned Parenthood can claim only a handful of adoption referrals every year while performing roughly 330,000 abortions at almost $500 each every year. Maybe that revenue stream for one of the biggest electoral boosters of the Democratic Party is why the Clinton Title X regulations don’t require them to talk to women about adoption. As former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson has explained, adoption referrals are disfavored because they aren’t “revenue generating.”  Democrats don’t just support aborting seven-pound babies. They regularly oppose those who seek to offer women alternatives to abortion and deny women the opportunity to know about other choices. 3. Democrats Want to Make Pro-Life Doctors and Nurses Perform Abortions In the wake of Roe v. Wade, Democrats like Ted Kennedy spoke on the floor of the Senate to defend the right of pro-life medical professionals and hospitals not to perform abortions against their conscience. The conscience law he spoke in favor of, the Church Amendment, passed with only a single vote against it in each house. But the Democratic Party has changed. Democrats are now ardent opponents of conscience rights, opposing laws that prevent forcing nurses like Cathy Cenzon-DeCarlo to participate in a late-term dismemberment abortion. Democrats nearly uniformly oppose the Abortion Nondiscrimination Act, the Health Care Conscience Rights Act, and similar proposals to simply protect the right of medical professionals to not participate in abortions. Democrats don’t just support aborting seven-pound babies, they want to force pro-life doctors to perform them. 4. Democrats Want to Make You—and Your Church—Pay for Abortions Not content to simply make abortion legal through all nine months, Democrats also want you to foot the bill. The federal Hyde Amendment, which provides some protection against taxpayer funding for abortion, passed over Democratic objection and continues to be in Democrats’ crosshairs. As it stands, with Hyde in place, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars go to abortionists. Without Hyde, it would be hundreds of millions more, as taxpayer funds could be used to directly pay for abortions themselves. Democrats even oppose bills fighting female sex trafficking over their passion for forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for abortion. Democrats even oppose bills fighting female sex trafficking over their passion for forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for abortion. But it doesn’t end there. Democrats don’t just want to force you to pay for abortion through your taxes, some of them want to force you to pay for abortion in the  church offering plate. In California, a Democratic administration has illegally forced every health plan in the state—including those churches provide for their pastors—to cover all legal abortions. That would include abortions of seven-pound, full-term babies. If your California church has an insurance plan, then it’s paying for others’ abortions. Because this order directly violates federal law, Alliance Defending Freedom has filed a complaint on behalf of seven California churches with the Obama administration’s Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights. After eight months, the administration still has not acted to stop California from violating the federal Weldon Amendment by forcing churches to pay for abortions. Democrats don’t just want abortions of seven-pound babies, many of them also want you and your church to pay for them. 5. Democrats Want to Permit the Most Barbaric and Dehumanizing Abortion Methods Democrats are big on abortion euphemisms. When they say, as Wasserman-Shultz did, that abortion should be a woman’s “choice” through all nine months, they want you to focus on something other than the reality of what abortion is. Simply put, there is no clean and humane way to kill a seven-pound, full-term baby. But Democrats have defended any abortion method, no matter how brutal. They fought to retain partial-birth abortion. Recently, when an Oklahoma bill prohibiting dismemberment abortions (ripping unborn children apart) became law, Democrats were the only votes against it—and the Democrats who didn’t vote against it left the chamber rather than vote for the law. Democrats do not merely support aborting seven-pound, full-term babies, they continue to support the most barbaric possible ways of doing so. The new attention to Democrats’ abortion extremism is welcome. But as horrific as abortions on seven-pound, full-term babies are, it is sad, but true, to say that the Democratic Party’s abortion views are much more extreme than that.

"98",98,"In Illinois, Tanning Salons Now Get More Oversight Than Abortion Facilities","Gehrke","Amy",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-08-25"," As MSNBC’s Dean Obeidallah compares pro-life advocates’ treatment of women to that of the Taliban, Illinois is endangering women by permitting abortion facilities to operate virtually unchecked and with no regard for safety, thanks to the “Reproductive Health Act” (RHA) signed into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Illinois wasn’t always a haven of abortion extremism. In 2017, former Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a bill expanding taxpayer funding of abortion by permitting Medicaid funds to be used for elective abortions. The bill also repealed the state’s “trigger law,” a decades-old precedent that would have automatically outlawed abortion in Illinois once the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.  Soon after, in 2019, Pritzker signed the RHA into law. Not only did this strip away all protections for preborn children, declaring a “fetus does not have independent rights under the laws of this State,” the RHA removed health and safety protections for women by removing state oversight and allowing abortion providers to police themselves. Abortion centers now fall outside the realm of standard Illinois health facility regulations, allowed to conduct their deadly business as they please. Does this sound like an industry that cares for women’s health? This disregard for women is par for the course throughout the abortion industry and is protected by politicians beholden to the millions in donations they receive from the industry and its supporters. If abortion advocates have their way, egregious laws like those in Illinois could become the law of the land across America. We know abortion can cause severe psychological trauma in women, not to mention the risk of physical injury or death. At every turn, the abortion industry casts women’s health and safety aside in order to prevent reasonable protective measures from interfering with their gargantuan profits.  Additionally, of course, every abortion takes the life of a preborn child. The vast majority of biologists, 96 percent, affirm that a unique human life is created at the moment of conception. When the “Reproductive Health Act” (RHA) was moving through the Illinois legislature, abortion advocates simply said its purpose was to codify the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision forcing all states to legalize abortion. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The RHA eradicated almost all protections for women undergoing abortions. It enshrined abortion on demand, for any reason up to the point of fetal viability (and for vaguely-defined reasons of maternal “health” thereafter), into Illinois law. The RHA actually prevents local municipalities from licensing, regulating, or inspecting abortion centers in their communities. The RHA specifically removed a clause about abortion facilities from Illinois’s “Ambulatory Surgical Treatment Center Act,” which used to require an abortion facility to have a licensed physician on its board in order for the facility to obtain a license. In Illinois, tanning salons and barbershops face stricter scrutiny than abortion facilities.  Because of the RHA, if a woman dies in an abortion facility, it’s possible there could never be an investigation. Because the RHA simply requires abortion facilities to self-report, they can more easily destroy evidence, covering up any negligence or criminal activity taking place at an abortion facility. Illinois is not the only state with radical abortion laws. New York and New Mexico passed similar bills, and the Vermont Senate passed a similar amendment in April that will likely go to a popular referendum next year. Extremist abortion advocates in the U.S. Congress introduced a bill in June that would do on the national level what the RHA did in Illinois. Abortion is a human rights issue, but not in the way most abortion advocates say it is. Right-to-life advocates, many of whom are women, are simply working to protect women and their children from the radical abortion industry. Unlike the abortion industry, pro-life advocates tell women they are strong enough to face their pregnancies and still achieve all of their goals and dreams. They provide women the emotional and practical resources they need to choose life over death. It only took a few short years for Illinois to become the abortion mecca of the Midwest with little regard for women’s health. The same could happen across America.

"99",99,"March For Life Antagonists Reveal The Reason Abortion Will Continue To Divide America","Skurk","Krystina",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-01-27"," While tens of thousands came to D.C. on Friday to protest abortion in the 47th March for Life, several hundred showed up to support the practice. Counterprotestors at the March for Life are comparatively so few that using flashy methods to get attention is understandable. These young men and women should be given some credit for their courage in coming to an event where they know they are bound to be outnumbered. Yet the obscene crudity they resorted to this year is merely a symptom of a much more malicious disease. Before the march, one group of pro-life advocates, CEC for Life, gathered in front of the Supreme Court for an annual vigil. The group was made up of about 20 young people, who laid on the ground in a fetal position with a long red ribbon draped over them. Sarah Howell, one of the group’s leaders, said the demonstration shows how these young people are standing in solidarity with the unborn while the ribbon represents the bloodshed of abortion.    As the young people laid still with their eyes closed, one of their leaders prayed for the ending of abortion. The mood was solemn amongst the group, yet just six feet away the atmosphere was one of Bacchic revelry as counterprotestors sneered at the demonstration. The contrast between the two groups could not be more stark. While one group mourned the 60 million babies who have been aborted, the other sang and danced. One young woman holding a sign that called pro-life advocates hypocrites, bounced up and down, spun in a circle, and wore an enthusiastic smile while chanting, “Without this basic right, women can’t be free.” An older woman handed out red-stained white pants to her fellow protestors, while another walked around with a Trojan box strapped to her head, urging young men to take condoms—because, after all, abortions are their fault, she claimed.  Later in the march, the group’s lead protestor (handler of the megaphone) berated the protestors as they walked past. He said the same mantra over and over, “Pro-life, it’s a lie—you don’t care if women die.” He also chanted, “A baby’s not a baby ‘til it comes out, that’s what a birthday’s all about.” When he wasn’t chanting, he was cursing at the crowd and claiming that this was actually a march for female enslavement.  More disturbing than the pro-choice protestors’ words and actions is their defense of abortion as a good. In the 1990s President Clinton said he hoped abortion would be “safe, legal, and rare.” Abortion used to be seen as a necessary evil, much as slavery was seen during the time of the American Founding.  Many of the Founding Fathers realized that practically they could not end slavery immediately, but they laid the foundation for its eventual abolishment where they could. Yet in 1861 views on slavery shifted. In his famous “Cornerstone Speech,” Alexander Stephens declared that slavery was a positive good. It was Stephens’ new ideology of innate inequality among the races that gave the South the ability to claim the moral high-ground. Today the same thing is happening in regards to abortion. As Dr. Matthew Spalding, dean of Hillsdale College’s Van Andel Graduate School of Government, said in a recent article on abortion, “We have now come to the point where both positions in this debate, anti-abortion and pro-abortion, claim the moral high ground of America’s first principles as the standard of their cause.” Abortion advocates no longer see abortion as a “necessary evil” because they don’t see it as evil at all. Destiny Lopez, co-director of a nonprofit that works to expand abortion access, told Vox that claiming abortion should be rare “completely negates all the work that we’ve done.” In Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign she was still saying abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” but by 2016 she said abortion should only be “safe and legal.” The most common pro-abortion sign at the march read, “Abortion on demand and without apology,” while a trove of young women in pink held signs that read, “Keep abortion safe and legal.”  This shift in thinking has created a culture war nastier than we’ve seen in a generation, and things are only going to get worse. When abortion was seen by the left as an unfortunate circumstance instead of something to be celebrated, there was room for compromise and negotiation. However, once abortion moved from being a question about public policy to being a question about fundamental rights, both sides left the negotiating table.  Recently the pro-life movement has been emboldened by support from President Trump and the pro-abortion movement has been emboldened by new abortion laws in states like New York and Virginia. Neither side is backing down. If President Trump gets another Supreme Court pick, the question of abortion’s legality could go back to the states. This will not settle the matter. Although the geographical divides are not as clear as they were in the Civil War—there will be no North and South—the moral divide is just as bitter. Abraham Lincoln once said the South would not be content until the North admitted that slavery was a positive good. Today, neither side will rest until the other concedes the morality of their cause. The pro-lifers will continue to argue for the “sanctity of human life,” while the pro-choicers will argue for a woman’s ultimate autonomy over her own body. The two sides cannot be reconciled. There isn’t a heartbeat, a fingerprint, proof of an unborn baby’s pain or cognitive awareness that will convince the most hardened leftists that abortion is evil, nor are there any feminist philosophic suppositions about womb slavery that will convince a pro-lifer that abortion is a right instead of a crime. This all means the question of abortion’s morality cannot be settled by talking about abortion. If common ground is to be had, the conversation will need to go deeper. Unless there is agreement on the fundamentals, there won’t be agreement on anything that follows. The country must once again come to an agreement on the definition of justice. This must be our starting place. ","https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/27/march-for-life-antagonists-reveal-the-reason-abortion-will-continue-to-divide-america/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"100",100,"Fetus-Collecting Abortionist Connected To Unlicensed Abortion Facility In Buttigieg’s Town","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-09-17"," Last week news broke that family members of the late South Bend, Indiana abortionist Ulrich George Klopfer had unearthed at his home in northern Illinois preserved remains of more than 2,000 unborn babies. This discovery came just months after a federal court injunction allowed the Texas-based abortion chain Whole Women’s Health to open a new center without the required state license in this Midwestern town where presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg serves as mayor. These developments raise myriad questions about Buttigieg’s support for Whole Women’s Health, which has a history of violating state laws regarding the disposal of fetal remains and had named a former Klopfer colleague as the clinic director in its South Bend, Indiana licensing application.  Klopfer, who died on September, 3, 2019, has not performed abortions since at least 2016—as far as we know, that is—when the Indiana State Department of Health revoked his medical license indefinitely, finding he violated state law nine times, including by not reporting “an abortion on two girls under the age of 14,” as required by the state. That ended the career of “likely Indiana’s most prolific abortion doctor in history with numbers going into the tens of thousands of procedures in multiple counties over several decades,” reported the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette, an Indiana newspaper, in 2016. It is unclear how Klopfer preserved the dead babies or whether any of the unborn babies were of a gestational age of 20 weeks or later. Indiana law bans such late abortions, except in cases where “necessary” to prevent a “substantial permanent impairment of the life or physical health” of the mother. Klopfer’s Supporters Open New Abortion Facility Abortion apologists are already distancing themselves from the now-deceased Klopfer, as they did with Kermit Gosnell, another abortionist with an eerie penchant for collecting body parts from his victims. Yet when the Indiana State Department of Health revoked Klopfer’s license in 2016, abortion supporters told a different story. When the Indiana State Department of Health pulled Klopfer’s license three years ago, the South Bend abortion clinic that he ran since 1978, The Women’s Pavilion, closed its doors. At the time, activists such as Pro-Choice South Bend Director Liam Morley expressed gratitude “for the abortions that Dr. Klopfer provided to the community for over 30 years.” Klopfer, a doctor of osteopathy, also performed abortions in Gary and Fort Wayne, Indiana.  At the time, Morley, who had worked at Klopfer’s South Bend facility, also suggested that a series of law branded “TRAP laws,” or “Targeted Regulations Against Abortion Providers,” by abortion advocates, may have led to the revocation of Klopfer’s license. “Those laws impose staffing requirements or facility modifications that clinics can’t afford.” “We can see some of those replicated in Indiana,” Morley told WSBT in South Bend, adding “Laws like the waiting laws, 18 hours in Indiana. Those cause problems.” Pro-Choice South Bend later proved instrumental to opening the Whole Women’s Health abortion facility in South Bend. After Klopfer’s abortion facility closed, “abortion advocates working under the name Pro Choice South Bend” reached out to the founder and CEO of Whole Women’s Health, Amy Hagstrom Miller, “to see if she’d be interested in opening a clinic there.” According to Rewire, the outgoing director of Pro Choice South Bend, Jamie Morgan, confirmed the group’s decision to approach Whole Woman’s Health. But later, Morley, who identified herself to the South Bend Tribune as “director of the Pro Choice South Bend group,” maintained that her organization “was not directly involved in efforts to launch another clinic.” Nonetheless, “volunteers with Pro Choice South Bend have been working behind the scenes to rally local support.” Morley, however, did more than that: When the Texas-based chain first applied for a license, the state rejected the application because it failed to name a clinic administrator, so Morley lent her name. The revised application named Morley as the clinic administrator and she signed that application swearing that the “owner(s) and operator(s) are of reputable and reasonable character, are able to comply with . . . and operate and maintain the clinic in accordance with’ Indiana’s governing abortion clinic statutes.”  Morley appears to have no connection to the now-opened clinic, though, with a recent Chicago Tribune article identifying Brenda Morgan as the acting clinic manager. Neither Morley nor Pro Choice South Bend responded to multiple requests for comment. Jessica Shein, the director of communications for Whole Woman’s Health, told The Federalist they were forced to let Morley go in February 2018, because the grant that funded her position ran out before the South Bend clinic opened. Shein, however, did not respond to The Federalist’s question concerning whether Whole Woman’s Health knew of Morley’s history with Klopfer’s clinic.   The Indiana State Health Department denied Whole Women’s Health’s application for an abortion facility license, finding it had failed to meet state’s requirement of having a “reputable and responsible character,” and because it had failed to provide requested information related to other Whole Women’s Health clinics. Eventually, the abortion provider decided to circumvent the state regulators and sued in federal court, challenging Indiana’s regulations and its denial of a license to operate as an abortion clinic. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a temporary injunction, allowing Whole Women’s Health to open without a license. State officials called it “deeply troubling” for the federal judiciary to authorize an abortion clinic to open without complying with state licensing requirements. A spokesperson for Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill reacted to the ruling by noting that “Indiana will stand strong to protect women and unborn children by ensuring that its duly-enacted abortion regulations are properly enforced and defended.” Buttigieg Supports Unlicensed Abortion Facilities Conversely, Mayor Buttigieg, who recently suggested abortions were biblically permissible until a baby has breathed his first breath, praised the decision. Buttigieg’s national press secretary Chris Meagher told the Chicago Tribune that “the mayor is deeply concerned by what he views as a new and extreme assault on Roe v. Wade” and he applauded the South Bend clinic as providing abortion “care” where there was an unmet need. Buttigieg’s support of the Whole Woman’s Health abortion facility, however, is but half of the story. The other half concerns Buttigieg’s outrageous decision to veto a rezoning decision made by the South Bend Common Council that, absent his veto, would have allowed the Women’s Care Center—a national pregnancy and family resource center—to open a planned center next door to the abortion facility. The Women’s Care Center had previously operated a center mere feet from Klopfer’s South Bend facility. In justifying his veto, Buttigieg expressly cited the lobbying by Whole Woman’s Health, which had “written to express the view that they would be harmed by such a re-zoning.” According to Buttigieg, “they cite research indicating that clinics in close proximity to crisis pregnancy center(sic) experience significantly higher rates of violence, threats, and harassment (21.7%) than those not near such a center (6.8%).” Those statistics are not only fake, they are unrelated to the Women’s Care Center, which has never seen an act of violence connected to any of its national collection of pregnancy and family resource centers. The veto also backfired, as the Women’s Care Center succeeded in opening a new location across the street from Whole Women’s Health, in a location already properly zoned. That locale provides a quiet and peaceful place for women facing crisis pregnancies to obtain support, while protestors target the abortion facility across the street. Whole Woman’s Health to Ensure the Body Count Rises Indiana continues to litigate its denial of a license for Whole Women’s Health, even while the chain has started providing abortions at its South Bend location. The recent discovery of the preserved bodies of the dead aborted babies at Klopfer’s home should give courts pause to substitute their judgment for that of the State Departments of Health. That’s especially true in light of the more than $40,000 in fines Texas imposed on the Whole Woman Health abortion facilities in Austin and McAllen, for improperly disposing of aborted babies in a landfill—something that occurred under Hagstrom Miller’s watch as president and CEO of the chain of abortion clinics. To date, Whole Woman’s Health has attempted to downplay these reports, claiming anti-abortion activists have used “clinic inspection reports in other states as purported evidence that the abortion provider was not safe.” “These licensing requirements include periodic inspections by state health departments, which often find minor deficiencies that are promptly corrected by clinics,” Whole Woman’s Health has argued, also saying that pro-life advocates “often mischaracterize these minor deficiencies as gross health violations that threaten patient safety.” Whole Woman’s Health’s spin rings a familiar tone: At the time the Indiana Department of Health pulled Klopfer’s license, his attorney, Mary Watts, downplayed the state’s findings of misconduct, saying “the case is about forms and not about the standard of care patients received.” “He provided good medical care for his patients and did his best to follow the law,” Watts maintained. “It’s a question of documentation.” But now that we know documentation means dead bodies, Whole Women’s Health, Buttigieg, and the Seventh Circuit have some explaining to do.

"101",101,"Pro-Life Win: Federal Court Lifts Colorado Ban On Abortion Pill Reversals","Corso","Sophia",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-10-27"," While some states have implemented legislation since the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson to protect the preborn, other states have doubled down to expand pro-abortion policies in every way possible. But a recent victory for life in Colorado serves as a beacon of hope and an opportunity to inform others of one pro-life service.



Over the weekend, a federal court in Colorado ruled in favor of a Catholic health care clinic, Bella Health and Wellness, to allow to them to continue offering abortion pill reversal services. This ruling in Bella Health and Wellness v. Weiser comes after Colorado passed legislation “making it unprofessional conduct to offer women progesterone when seeking to reverse the effects of the first abortion pill.”



According to a report from Becket Law, Bella asked for this law that prevented this treatment for women and their preborn children to be blocked, and the law was put on hold from going into effect “until three state boards weighed in on the safety of abortion pill reversal.”



“While this hold took place, Bella successfully helped multiple women continue their pregnancies, including one who recently gave birth to a healthy baby,” the report reads, testifying to the importance of this option for pregnant women. Despite the lives saved, lawmakers pressed to move forward with the ban until it was temporarily lifted last weekend.



Now clinics like Bella Health and Wellness can continue providing potentially life-saving services, and the pro-life movement can capitalize on this win by drawing attention to the dangers of the abortion pill and the successes of abortion pill reversal.



The Trauma of Chemical Abortions 



Unlike surgical abortion, the abortion pill is taken orally and can happen in the woman’s own home. In this two-step abortion regimen, the woman first ingests mifepristone, which works to cut the baby off of nutrients — essentially starving the preborn child. Then, the woman takes misoprostol to expel her baby.



Not only is chemical abortion a painful and horrific death for preborn children, but it can also be a traumatizing experience for the woman, as highlighted by the human rights organization Live Action’s “I Saw My Baby” campaign. 



Live Action highlights the story of one woman who had a chemical abortion, who shared, “It was not just a blob of tissue. I had given birth to what looked like a fully formed, intact 14-week-old fetus covered in blood. I scooped my baby out of the toilet. I sat on the floor, held him, and cried.’” 



It’s clear that abortion pills do not leave women feeling empowered, but instead leave them with this trauma and emotional scar.



The abortion pill can also pose physical dangers to the woman ingesting the two-pill regimen. In 2019, a study was conducted to observe the effectiveness of abortion pill reversal, where pregnant women enrolled in the study ingested mifepristone and then 24 hours later a placebo or the abortion pill reversal drug progesterone. 



The study was halted because of the physical safety threats it posed: “Two out of five, or 40 percent, of women who took Mifeprex alone, and did not take progesterone, required emergency surgery, and one required a transfusion.”



How Abortion Pill Reversal Works



For women who take the first regimen of the abortion pill and change their minds, abortion pill reversal gives them a chance to save their child’s life. The reversal drug given to the mother is progesterone, a natural hormone needed to nurture and sustain a pregnancy.



As AbortionPillReversal.com explains, “By giving extra progesterone, we hope to outnumber and outcompete the first abortion pill in order to reverse the effects and provide an opportunity to save the pregnancy.”



Through this, many women have been able to reverse the effects of the abortion pill, carrying to term and giving life to their child. One woman describes her success story with the abortion pill reversal: “After receiving progesterone for a week, I came back for an ultrasound to see if the baby survived. He did. He was alive and well. He was saved. … Without the option of the abortion pill reversal, he would not be here today.”



Keeping the Momentum



As long as chemical abortion exists, abortion pill reversal must be available for women. It’s clear this very service Bella Health and Wellness seeks to provide to women is lifesaving. With the recent court win, this should serve as momentum for the pro-lifers both in Colorado and throughout the nation to educate their communities that abortion pill reversal exists, is effective, and can save a life.



Continuing to expose the dangers of chemical abortion, the dignity of their child in the womb, and the options women have to reverse the effects of the abortion pill will bring us closer to the day when we live in a culture of life.

"102",102,"4 Reasons Donald Trump’s Abortion Answer Was A Betrayal Of Pro-Lifers","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-03-31"," MSNBC held a town hall event Wednesday during which host Chris Matthews asked Donald Trump whether women who seek abortions should be punished if abortion is ever outlawed. Trump hemmed and hawed a bit but Matthews kept pressing him. Finally he said, “There has to be some form of punishment.” After much outrage from the many sides of the abortion debate, Trump issued a statement.
Here are four reasons why this response betrays pro-lifers.
1) No Understanding of the Media Environment
Most of the media do a very poor job of hiding their support for abortion. They never ask consistent pro-choice politicians why they believe it should be legal to kill a child for the crime of being a girl instead of a boy, of having Down syndrome, or of being an inconvenience. But they always think to press pro-life politicians about rape exceptions to protections for unborn children.
The uniformity of thought among journalists has meant that pro-life politicians have to be very careful how they talk about the sensitive subject. The media may forget to cover serial killing abortionist Kermit Gosnell until forced to by public pressure, but they have no problem writing 243,000 stories about a senate candidate saying something wrong about pregnancy.
Even this story, in which Trump betrayed the pro-life movement, the media treated it as something that only pro-choicers might have a problem with. Bloomberg wrote of it, “The comment, which immediately riled abortion-rights supporters…” Riled, perhaps, but they couldn’t have dreamed of a better comment to position themselves against. The Daily Mail seemed to think Trump’s comment was intended to appeal to pro-lifers! Do they know any pro-lifers?
The uniformity of thought among journalists has meant that pro-life politicians have to be very careful how they talk about the sensitive subject.
In any case, think back to when Planned Parenthood ran a media campaign against Sen. Rand Paul. They wanted him portrayed as extreme on abortion. Phillip Elliott, now with Time but then with the Associated Press, has legendary problems covering abortion. My favorite is the correction he had to run for somehow turning pro-choice Satanists into a pro-life problem. Anyway, Elliott ran a story with the headline “Paul won’t spell out abortion ban exceptions.” Other Planned Parenthood minions peppered Rand with questions about his pro-life stance. So after a few days of this, Paul pointed out the rather obvious problem with media coverage of political views on abortion: only pro-life candidates are asked tough questions about it. You can watch Paul’s answer to a reporter’s request that he respond to the Democratic National Committee’s take on his abortion views here, as uploaded by Dave Weigel. (Go 8:00 minutes into the video):

He said, “We always seem to have the debate wayyyyyy over here on what are the exact details of exceptions, or when it starts. Why don’t we ask the DNC: is it okay to kill a seven-pound baby in the uterus? You go back and you ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she’s OK with killing a seven-pound baby that is just not yet born yet. Ask her when life begins, and you ask Debbie when she’s willing to protect life. When you get an answer from Debbie, come back to me.”
To be a pro-life human rights advocate in this day and age requires fortitude and savvy.
Now, Paul is happy to talk about his pro-life stance, but he’s also cognizant of the disgustingly uneven media environment in which any debate about abortion is held. Our media tend to be happy to dehumanize unborn children to make violence against them easier. They don’t even have the moral imagination to consider the other side of the issue. They are not familiar with the philosophical, scientific, or ethical arguments in play.
To be a pro-life human rights advocate in this day and age requires fortitude and savvy.
Trump is a media master. He makes the media dance his tune, and he does a great job of it. That he could not use his amazing communication skills here — and, indeed, would do such a horrific job at communicating a pro-life message — is devastating. His surrogate Ben Carson tried to help him out by saying he wasn’t told it would be a question. Fine, but the last time a major Republican was thrown by this question was 30 years ago. How could you not see it coming from the one-note media?
2) No Understanding of the Pro-life Movement
Trump is a recent convert to the pro-life cause. Converting to the side of justice for unborn children and their mothers is always a good thing, no matter when it happens. As Trump himself notes, pro-life champion Ronald Reagan once signed a law legalizing the killing of unborn children in California. But Reagan didn’t become a pro-life champion simply by converting to the pro-life cause and then giving mumbled statements about the matter. He became a pro-life champion by leading the movement and communicating the pro-life message through a hostile media. He wrote the book, “Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation” and spoke to the massive March for Life each year.
If Trump knew anything at all whatsoever about the pro-life movement, he would know what the movement thinks about abortion and whether mothers should be punished.
March for Life leader Jeanne Mancini was one of the many pro-life leaders who rushed out statements aghast at Trump’s comments:
“Mr. Trump’s comment today is completely out of touch with the pro-life movement and even more with women who have chosen such a sad thing as abortion,” said Jeanne Mancini, President of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund. “Being pro-life means wanting what is best for the mother and the baby. Women who choose abortion often do so in desperation and then deeply regret such a decision. No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion. This is against the very nature of what we are about. We invite a woman who has gone down this route to consider paths to healing, not punishment.”
3) No Deep Thinking about Justice
Pro-lifers understand that abortion is a violent act against women and children. They seek to end the injustice of abortion. They discuss the issue of how to move to a society where all human life is welcomed and protected. Trump showed no understanding of the debates about how to protect vulnerable women and their children from the evil pressure to abort and whether “punishment” is appropriate.
As folks on Twitter discussed, response to abortion requires some moral imagination and conceptions of justice beyond punishment. These issues are such a part of the pro-life movement’s compassionate response to women victimized by abortion that within moments, pro-life thinkers were publishing op-eds on the matter. Charles Camosy explained some of the thinking at play in his New York Daily News piece, “Why serious pro-lifers don’t want to punish women: What Donald Trump (and glib pro-choicers) fail to understand about the anti-abortion movement.” The entire thing is worth a read but here’s how it ends:
What was essential for social equality, according to those responsible for our abortion laws, was that women are able to end their pregnancies when they are a burden on their economic and social interests. But being pregnant and having a child is often so burdensome precisely because our social structures have been designed by and for people who cannot get pregnant. Notice how, in this context, our abortion laws end up serving the interests of men and coercing the so-called “choice” of women.
Someone who is coerced into having an abortion as a means of having social equality should not be put in jail. Women, like their prenatal children, are victims of our horrific abortion policy. Instead, physicians who profit from the violence of abortion ought to be punished. Philadelphia’s Dr. Kermit Gosnell is currently in jail after facing eight counts of murder. Seven of the counts were related to his killing babies beyond the legal limit, counts Dr. Gosnell “didn’t understand” because he was merely finishing off a late-term abortion.
Trump’s most recent switch-a-roo on abortion is yet more evidence that his new pro-life position is deeply unfamiliar. Serious pro-lifers want protection and support for both the prenatal child and her mother, and that is why serious pro-lifers do not support Trump. He is a fake pro-lifer.
4) Pure Sabotage of the Debate
Quin Hilyer at National Review Online raised a point that everyone was missing in the brouhaha. It wasn’t just that Trump said he’d support punishing women. It was also how he made the argument. When Matthews asked him how he’d ban abortions, Trump word-clouded something to the effect of, “You go back to a position like they had where they would perhaps go to illegal places, but we have to ban it.”
As Hilyer writes:
Scrutinize that for a moment. If that doesn’t play into the hands of the anti-life movement, nothing does. This is a wink-wink/nudge-nudge to the idea that illegal abortion mills or perhaps even back alleys are to be accepted as alternatives to legal abortions — rather than that, say, adoptions should be promoted, along with community support for pre-natal care and both pre- and post-natal counseling.
This answer most makes sense if you imagine that Trump’s main goal was to sabotage everything the pro-life movement has ever worked for. Perhaps he’s just so new to thinking about abortion that his mind is a tumbled mess of thoughts. Being an outsider who is new to political discussions has served Trump well thus far in his campaign. In the case of the most important human rights issue of our time, it’s a disaster.

"103",103,"Biden Admin’s New HHS Guidance Shoehorns Unfettered Abortion Into Existing Law","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-13"," The Biden administration’s “new guidance” to hospitals declaring that abortions must be provided in emergencies seeks not to clarify the law but to provide pro-abortion forces a way to skirt state law while pushing several lies to further the false narrative that overturning Roe v. Wade endangers women’s lives.



In a Monday press release, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that through its Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), it had issued what it called “clarifying guidance on the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)” on “abortion services in emergency situations.” 



Congress passed the EMTALA in 1986 “to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay,” by imposing “specific obligations on Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services.” Specifically, under the EMTALA, a medical facility that runs an emergency room — which is not all health care facilities — must “provide a medical screening examination (MSE) when a request is made for examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC), including active labor, regardless of an individual’s ability to pay.” The law then requires hospitals “to provide stabilizing treatment for patients with EMCs,” with a hospital that “is unable to stabilize a patient within its capability” arranging a transfer to another facility. 



The press release issued on Monday announced that HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra had written to health care providers in conjunction with the CMA’s issuances of a new memorandum purporting to explain the mandates of EMTALA “in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.” 



After providing a quick summary of the EMTALA, the CMA memorandum noted that “an emergency medical condition may include a condition that is likely or certain to become emergent without stabilizing treatment” and that “emergency medical conditions involving pregnant patients may include, but are not limited to, ectopic pregnancy, complications of pregnancy loss, or emergent hypertensive disorders, such as preeclampsia with severe features.” 



“If a physician believes that a pregnant patient presenting at an emergency department is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment,” the memorandum continued. The memorandum then concluded: “When a state law prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life of the pregnant person — or draws the exception more narrowly than EMTALA’s emergency medical condition definition — that state law is preempted.”



While federal law clearly “preempts” or overrides conflicting state laws because of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, the CMS memorandum proves problematic for several reasons. But before dissecting the many problems with the memorandum, it is important to highlight the deceptive bait-and-switch Becerra effected in purporting to summarize the memorandum and the EMTALA’s mandates in the letter he dispatched to health care professionals on Monday. 



“Stabilizing treatment could include medical and/or surgical interventions (e.g., abortion, removal of one or both fallopian tubes, anti-hypertensive therapy, methotrexate therapy etc.), irrespective of any state laws or mandates that apply to specific procedures,” Becerra wrote. 



He continued: “Thus, if a physician believes that a pregnant patient presenting at an emergency department, including certain labor and delivery departments, is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment.” Significantly, Becerra then declared that “when a state law prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life and health of the pregnant person — or draws the exception more narrowly than EMTALA’s emergency medical condition definition — that state law is preempted” (Emphasis added). 



As the above excerpt shows, Becerra added the word “health” to the language of the CMS memorandum, which speaks instead to “exceptions for the life of the pregnant [woman].” And that sleight-of-hand is telling to those well-versed in the rhetoric of abortion apologists and their ability to squeeze an elephant into the “health” mouse hole, with “physical, emotional, psychological, familial and the woman’s age,” all framed as “relevant factors” to assess the effects of pregnancy on a woman’s “health,” leaving “health” to mean anything. 



Donna Harrison, an OB/GYN and the CEO for the Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told The Federalist, “The AAPLOG is concerned that by using the ambiguous word ‘health’ that the Biden administration is trying to use EMTALA to force the performance of abortions in situations which are not medical emergencies.” 



“We will be closely monitoring the interpretation of this guidance document,” Harrison added.



Beyond the apparent attempt by Becerra to expand the preemptive force of the EMTALA to situations in which it does not apply, the memorandum itself pushes several fallacies being peddled by abortion apologists since the Dobbs decision dropped, such as that with Roe overturned, women will no longer receive life-saving health care in the case of an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. The CMS memorandum and Becerra’s letter reinforce these false narratives by, in purporting to address the EMTALA’s requirements in light of state abortion laws, including a discussion of the treatment of “ectopic pregnancy” and “complications of pregnancy loss.”



But the medical treatment of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages are not abortions. Elizabeth Kirk, the director of the Center for Law & the Human Person at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America, and Dr. Ingrid Skop, an obstetrician-gynecologist and director of medical affairs at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, corrected those misconceptions in an article for SCOTUSblog’s symposium on Dobbs, “Why the Dobbs Decision Won’t Imperil Pregnancy-Related Medical Care.”



“Medical treatment of a pregnant mother and her child seeks to protect the life and health of both patients, where possible,” they explained. “In contrast, the purpose of abortion is to cause the death of one of the patients, namely the unborn child. An abortion procedure is not the same thing as treatment for an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage management, which even Planned Parenthood admits.” With an ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy outside of the uterus, the medical “indication and interventions … versus elective abortion are vastly different.” In fact, “mifepristone and misoprostol, used commonly to provide medical abortions, specifically do not treat a pregnancy outside of the uterus, and deaths have occurred in women seeking abortion when this condition has not been first ruled out.” 



Further, while the treatments for miscarriage or pregnancy loss, may sometimes “be the same as those for abortion (e.g., dilation and suction or misoprostol or, uncommonly, a combination of mifepristone/misoprostol), the purpose is vastly different, i.e., removing an already dead fetus versus causing the death of a fetus.” 



Likewise, the treatment of “preeclampsia with severe features,” another example the HHS’s supposed guidance suggests would justify an abortion, ignores the distinction between the treatment of the mother’s medical condition and a procedure aimed at intentionally causing the death of the fetus. And because “the incidence of pre-eclampsia with severe features … prior to viability is exceedingly rare,” treating the mother’s emergency medical condition will often allow physicians to save the child. 



Similarly, abortion is not medically necessary to treat placenta previa, which “is a condition in which the placenta covers the cervix, making a vaginal delivery impossible due to the possibility of life-threatening hemorrhage if labor occurs.” As AAPLOG has detailed, placenta previa “are frequently diagnosed in pregnancy on ultrasound around 20 weeks, however approximately 90% of these will resolve on their own before delivery.” 



But “if significant hemorrhage occurs due to a placenta previa (which again is so rare prior to viability that no incidence is even reported), the patient should be taken for an emergency C-section which is the most expedient way to get her bleeding under control.” In fact, “it would be medically dangerous and irresponsible to try to do an abortion since any instrumentation through the cervix would pierce the placenta and cause immediate massive bleeding.” Further, “an abortion would take significantly longer in this case and be much risker for the mother.”



Given these medical facts and the legal reality that states that prohibit abortion clearly define it as procedures that intentionally cause the death of an unborn child, and therefore treating ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages are not abortions, the laws already make clear that an abortion ban is not a ban on providing life-saving medical treatment to pregnant women even if it results in the death of a fetus. 



Health care providers know this, and Becerra and the CMS know that they know this, but the letter and memorandum serve other goals of the pro-abortion Biden administration, including: providing abortion-oriented medical facilities with a basis to skirt state law by framing an elective abortion as mandated by EMTALA; pushing misinformation to the public concerning the treatment of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages; misrepresenting the medical need for an abortion to preserve the life of the mother; misrepresenting state abortion laws to create the false impression that abortion bans prohibit doctors from treating women’s emergency medical conditions; and creating a political talking point that Dobbs puts women’s lives at risk based on the strawman crafted by the administration.



But at the end of the day, the strawman constructed by HHS easily collapses when one remembers that the goal of an abortion is a dead baby, while the goal of treating a pregnant woman with a serious health condition is to save the mother and, if possible, deliver her baby alive.

"104",104,"Winners And Losers From Monday’s Texas Abortion Regulation Court Case","Franklin","Will",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013-10-29"," On Monday, a federal judge struck down one of four provisions in Texas’ new abortion law, while tweaking another, sending the law immediately to a higher court for appeal.
Despite the breathless headlines prematurely declaring Texas’ sweeping new abortion rules dead, or the triumphal tweets from the abortion industry declaring victory, it might be wise to look at the recent history of Texas abortion laws in the courts.
Brief History of Recent Texas Abortion Rulings
Generally speaking, there’s a Groundhog Day-like script here. Planned Parenthood and its allies tend to win the first round in district court, but Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott’s office just keeps winning the appeals.
Take, for example, Texas’ Informed Consent law, more commonly known as the Texas Sonogram Law, which was passed as HB 15 by the legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011. The law requires an abortion provider to display a sonogram of the fetus, make audible the heart auscultation of the fetus for the woman to hear, explain to her the results of each procedure, and to wait 24 hours, with several exceptions, between the sonogram and the abortion. An abortion provider must provide the opportunity, but a woman may opt out of viewing the images or hearing the heartbeat.
Judge Sam Sparks, appointed by President George H. W. Bush, initially blocked the law, citing First Amendment concerns. Four and a half months later, though, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Judge Sparks’ reasoning and sent the case back to him for what amounted to a judicial do-over. An angry Sparks denounced the ruling he was forced to make by his superiors, saying it was “making puppets out of doctors.”
Not surprisingly, Judge Sparks had other run-ins with his judicial superiors and even received an admonition from Chief Judge Edith Jones of the 5th Circuit in another case for his “not funny… caustic, demeaning, and gratuitous” rhetoric that casts “disrespect on the judiciary.”
Then came the case of whether Texas could stop giving taxpayer dollars to providers of elective abortion. Federal District Judge Lee Yeakel, a George W. Bush appointee, ruled that Texas taxpayers were constitutionally obligated to fund Planned Parenthood as part of its Women’s Health Program.
Roughly three and a half months later, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Yeakel’s ruling, paving the way for Texas to defund Planned Parenthood.
What happened next with the Texas Women’s Health Program is one of the more commonly misreported pieces of the story. The 5th Circuit ruled that Texas could regulate the mostly-federal funds (a $9-to-$1 federal/state match) and could keep those funds from going to abortion providers and affiliates. The Obama administration, though, rather than respecting the Court’s decision, denied Texas its due funding for the program beginning in 2013.
The State of Texas picked up the slack, to the tune of $30 million annually, fully funding its Women’s Health Program with state dollars so there would be no disruption of services for low-income women. Planned Parenthood tried and failed in court one last time before it was finally cut off from Texas taxpayer dollars at the end of 2012.
After a series of court challenges, each of Texas’ recent pro-life laws ultimately survived.
Which brings us to Texas House Bill 2 (HB 2), ruled on in district court this week by none other than Judge Lee Yeakel.
First, it is important to understand what is in HB 2. Because HB 2 was taken up during a special session of the Texas Legislature, it was an omnibus bill that included four distinct provisions.
1. Fetal Pain: 20-Week Ban
Most famously, HB 2 moved the late-term ban in Texas on abortion from 28 weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period (“LMP”) to 20 weeks post-fertilization, based on new and emerging evidence of fetal pain. Most of the usual exceptions (including protecting the health and life of the mother, and for severe fetal abnormalities) remain in place. It may seem like an unimportant quibble, but when you see “20 weeks” in the context of the new Texas abortion laws, you’re actually seeing what is considered 22 weeks in 31 states. The distinction between fertilization versus LMP is not just a semantic one. It is a shift in the way pre-born life is conceptualized. It is not an accident that Texas became the tenth state to signal that fertilization itself is the critical moment in the creation of a human life.
Verdict:  The 20-week limit did not face legal challenge in Judge Yeakel’s courtroom and goes into effect today (Tuesday, October 29, 2013). Incidentally, Texas’ new limit is still eight weeks later than France’s.
Clear winner:  Pro-lifers.
2. Ambulatory Surgical Center Regulations
HB 2 included a provision requiring abortion facilities to operate under the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers around the state. This piece of HB 2 was largely a reaction to the horrors of Kermit Gosnell’s substandard clinic. Essentially, abortion can be a dangerous procedure, and in the event of a serious threat to the health or life of the mother, an abortion facility must now meet the same requirements as facilities performing minor outpatient procedures across Texas.
Verdict:  This provision, too, did not face a challenge in Judge Yeakel’s courtroom. The ambulatory surgical center requirement goes into effect in the Fall of 2014, allowing substandard clinics ample time to comply with the new law. However, a legal challenge from Planned Parenthood is anticipated sometime next year.
Clear winner:  For now, it’s pro-lifers, but expect lawsuits in 2014 regardless of the outcome in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
3. Chemical Abortions Must Follow FDA Protocols
Use of the abortion drug Mifepristone, also called Mifeprex, or RU-486, must now follow established FDA protocols, which are clear that RU-486 should only be administered in person by a qualified physician and should not be administered if:
It has been more than 49 days (7 weeks) since your last menstrual period began.
You cannot return for the next 2 visits.
You cannot easily get emergency medical help in the 2 weeks after you take Mifeprex.
It should be stressed that RU-486 is fundamentally different from emergency contraception known as the “morning after pill.” RU-486 doesn’t prevent pregnancy, it terminates it. Moreover, chemical abortion is distinct from — and more dangerous than — taking birth control pills. Indeed, hundreds of women have required hospitalization, more than a dozen have died, and anywhere from 5to 8 percent of RU-486 users require follow-up surgery after taking RU-486, according to the FDA.
Verdict:  Judge Yeakel left most of the new law requiring chemical abortion to follow FDA protocols intact, but he extended the 49-day deadline to 63 days for some “women with particular physical abnormalities or preexisting conditions” and “where a physician determines, in appropriate medical judgment, such a procedure is necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.”
Clear winner:  Not apparent. The abortion industry isn’t happy that nearly all of the new RU-486 requirements in the bill were upheld. Pro-lifers aren’t happy that a procedure accounting for 26.1 percent of abortions in Texas could be subject to such an enormous loophole whose eligibility is ultimately determined by the very individual or organization profiting off of the procedure. But the issue is far from settled.
4. Local Hospital Admitting Privileges
Additionally, because suction curettage (also known as vacuum aspiration; don’t dare google it), accounting for 67.7 percent of Texas abortions, dilation and evacuation, accounting for 6.2 percent, and other abortion methods can and do have unforeseen complications and potentially serious negative health consequences for mothers, an abortionist is required by HB 2 to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion facility.
Verdict:  This is the one part of HB 2 that Judge Yeakel actually blocked. He said the state lacked a rational basis for the law and that the law places an undue burden on the right of women to have abortions.
If one completely ignores the State of Texas’ rationale of the admitting privilege requirement — to protect a woman’s health if she has an abortion and complications arise — the rational basis for the law may not be self-evident. Conveniently, Judge Yeakel avoided any discussion of Texas’ rationale in his ruling, which allowed him to avoid acknowledging that a state has an obvious and compelling interest in protecting the health and welfare of its citizens.
The rational basis test is almost never applied this way in medical regulation cases — or any other area of life, for that matter. Essentially every health and business regulation outside of abortion would not stand up to the kind of scrutiny Judge Yeakel applied in this case.
As far as being an undue burden goes, the burden in this case is entirely on the abortion provider rather than the woman seeking an abortion. Moreover, following Judge Yeakel’s logic to its conclusion, almost any medical regulation of any kind designed to protect patients could be an undue burden. But somehow abortion is special.
Clear winner: For now, the abortion industry. But if recent history is any indication, Planned Parenthood and its allies should not count their chickens before they’ve hatched. Texas Attorney General Abbott has already filed an appeal in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Political Implications
The ongoing fight over HB 2 in Texas is an obvious judicial proxy battle in the gubernatorial race between Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who just keeps winning in court, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate and state Sen.Wendy Davis, who raised nearly a million dollars from mostly deep blue states after infamously filibustering a similar bill over the summer.
For Davis, the case is a double-edged sword. On the one side, Wendy Davis’ entire political identity is inextricably linked to her filibuster, and she is a folk hero for it in monied circles in Park Slope and San Francisco. On the other side, the more HB 2 lingers in the news, the more it will remind Texans that Wendy Davis filibustered on behalf of late-term abortion, something that could preclude her from otherwise making a serious run at turning pro-life Texas blue in 2014.

"105",105,"Indiana Health Dept. Sits On Records Showing Two Babies Born Alive After Abortions, Three Women Dead","Pullmann","Joy",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-04-27"," Indiana abortion records The Federalist obtained this week indicate that in 2022 three women died after abortion procedures and two babies were born alive after chemical abortions. They also suggest Indiana abortionists failed to report four abortions on girls aged 15 and younger, as legally required. One of the minors not referred for a state abuse investigation after her abortion, a violation of state law, was just 13 years old, the records say. 



The Indiana Department of Health receives legally mandated Terminated Pregnancy Reports (TPRs) on each abortion committed in the state. More than 100 of these from January to November 2022 indicate that abortion facilities in the state may have committed crimes and health violations, according to recordkeeping from Voices for Life, a Hoosier pro-life organization. 



IDH has shut down no abortion facilities since January 2022, however, even facilities where records show women died after abortions. As for the 22 abortionists named in these numerous recent reports indicating potential medical malfeasance, “I am not aware of any doctors who have lost their licenses,” Voices for Life Executive Director Melanie Garcia Lyon told The Federalist Wednesday.



IDH communications personnel did not respond to any questions about these records from The Federalist. 



GOP to Reward Incompetent Health Agency



Indiana’s Republican governor and Republican-dominated legislature are poised to increase taxpayer funding for the health department by 2,000 percent this week, from $7 million a year to more than $150 million. IDH also pushed Indiana families into lockdown and Covid testing chaos across two school years despite early-available evidence children were at low risk from Covid-19 exposure. 



Gov. Eric Holcomb is now using the damage his lengthy Covid shutdowns caused, including mental distress, obesity, and academic catastrophe, to amp up funding for the shutdowns’ top enabler and enforcer in Indiana. That enforcer also happens to be low-energy in investigating abortion businesses whose services have resulted in Hoosier women’s deaths.



Voices for Life and their national partner Students for Life collect these records and file complaints about apparent violations with IDH and the state attorney general’s office, Garcia Lyon told The Federalist. Forty percent of the potential violations the group found from January to November 2022, Garcia Lyon said, were from Planned Parenthood locations.



After receiving such complaints, the office of Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita investigates, then submits a summary or a complaint to Indiana’s medical licensing board, said Rokita Press Secretary Kelly Stevenson. The board hears complaints and decides whether to sanction the investigated abortionist or facility. Indiana’s governor oversees that board and appoints its seven members.



On Saturday in Indianapolis, Students for Life and Voices for Life will highlight the state-reported health and safety violations related to an abortion facility that may move across the border to Illinois. That’s the Clinic for Women, currently in Indianapolis.



In September, Indiana banned abortions, except for very small babies who are the claimed results of rape and incest. The law is currently suspended by two injunctions pending litigation. Garcia Lyon noted that the law “still allows for abortion at hospitals. And the same people making these violations often do abortions in hospitals already. [So] code violations will still be relevant once the law goes into place, because it’s still the same people, just moving places.”



Records: 15-Year-Old Girl’s Womb Evacuated By Infamous Abortionist 



One of the abortion reports, dated April 21, 2022, shows a chemical abortion on a 15-year-old girl performed by abortionist Deborah Nucatola in Bloomington, Ind. at a Planned Parenthood. Nucatola was infamously recorded on a 2015 undercover video discussing how to “crush” a child to death during an abortion to leave his organs intact for sale.



The state report suggests this abortion was not reported, as legally required, to the state Department of Child Services for investigation as the potential result of child rape. The space on the form for the date of reporting this abortion to IDH is blank. Legally, the form states, the abortion should have been disclosed to DCS within three days of the child’s death.



   Debora Nucatola_PP Bloomington 4.21.22 Unreported Abortion on Minor (1) by The Federalist on Scribd



One of the four underage girls whose 2022 abortions weren’t reported to child services, as legally required, was 13 years old when her child was aborted, according to state records. That surgical abortion on a seven-week-old baby was performed at a Planned Parenthood branch in Indianapolis by abortionist Cassandra Cashman, the record states.



DCS also failed to answer any Federalist questions about these reports.



Records: 3 Women Died After Indiana Abortions in 2022



According to three TPRs from 2022, three women died in Indiana after abortions at facilities overseen by the Indiana Department of Health. At the Indianapolis Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital, a 31-year-old married woman died after an abortion on June 25, 2022, says one TPR. 



The record says she was given abortion pills when her baby was 21 weeks of gestation, an age at which babies can survive outside the womb in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The baby was diagnosed via ultrasound with a chromosomal anomaly, says the record, which IDH received on July 22, 2022. The physician committing this abortion was listed as Amy Caldwell in the report.



Caldwell was also the abortionist listed on the April 24, 2022 report of another Hoosier woman who died after an abortion at Planned Parenthood-Georgetown in Indianapolis. The 29-year-old unmarried woman was given abortion drugs to kill a 7-week-old baby, say the state records.



The third Hoosier woman to die after an abortion in 2022 undertook a surgical abortion in Bloomington, Indiana, by abortionist Rhiannon Amodeo, says another state record. The baby cut to pieces inside her was an estimated eight weeks old. His mother was 31 years old. The Indiana Department of Health received the report of this double death on November 23, 2022.



Caldwell is also listed as the physician on a January 7, 2022 report that says she delivered a baby alive during an abortion procedure. That baby was also potentially viable in a NICU: she was listed on the report as 20 weeks old when her mother and an abortionist ended her life.



Indiana Department of Health Blaming Data ‘Errors’ Since 2018



In March 2022, Hoosier pro-lifers said the Indiana Department of Health stopped releasing Terminated Pregnancy Reports for a South Bend facility after local conservative news highlighted TPRs indicating multiple illegal abortions at the Whole Women’s Health facility.



“Over the past four years, IDOH has taken zero action on reported abortions that indicate they were illegally performed,” wrote state Rep. Jake Teshka in a March 2022 letter to the agency about the incident.



More than 50 Indiana lawmakers wrote to Holcomb in 2021 complaining about the IDH’s history of alleged data errors and lackluster follow-up on abortion reports that indicate potential crimes. The letter noted that since at least 2018 the department has claimed several abortion reports that indicate criminal or health-violating activity were false, due to “computer error.” 



“We submit complaints all the time about things that are reported on Terminated Pregnancy Reports, and the excuse nearly every time is, ‘Oh, it was an error. Oh, it was an error,’” Jackie Appleman, a Voices for Life board member, told a local newspaper in February after the department used the excuse again over reports of unlicensed abortions occurring in Indiana. “We’ve been getting this excuse back from the (Indiana) health department for the last, I don’t know, three or four years.”



The December 2021 letter from elected officials notes that despite multiple postabortion deaths of women and abortions performed at unlicensed facilities, Indiana abortionists have failed to lose their medical licenses and IDOH has failed to resolve investigations into such cases. The officials asked Holcomb to update them on “on all open cases relating to abortion clinics” and to investigate why complaints “are not examined and resolved.”



Holcomb responded in January 2022, providing no update on IDH investigations of abortion facilities nor announcing any investigation into why IDH fails to secure penalties for abortionists after procedures that lead to women’s deaths. One year later, he moved to reward the badly discredited IDH with hundreds of millions more taxpayer dollars. Holcomb’s office did not respond to a request for comment.



Instead of demanding that IDH prove competence at stopping criminal and human rights violations under its purview before any expansion of its duties, the Indiana legislature is cooperating with Holcomb in rewarding IDH with a 2,000 percent increase in taxpayer funding. 



Update: The day after this article published, the Indiana Department of Health emailed the following in response to Federalist questions:




The Indiana Department of Health carefully reviews any data and reports it receives, including terminated pregnancy reports, for accuracy and works with submitters to verify information when discrepancies are identified. When IDOH receives a complaint alleging statutory or regulatory violations, a survey team is sent to the facility to determine compliance with state and federal regulations. If violations are discovered, a standard correction process is initiated to bring a facility back into compliance to ensure the health and safety of Hoosiers.



No abortion clinics have been closed as a result of surveys or complaints in 2022 or 2023. Actions against licensed medical providers are taken by the Indiana Attorney General’s Office, not IDOH.



In June 2022, IDOH transferred data systems for the collection of terminated pregnancy reports to a new system. During the data transfer, some fields in reports did not transfer properly even though information was entered correctly by the facility, which resulted in fields being omitted or incorrectly populated when historical reports were produced. We have identified the issue and are in the process of correcting it within our system and providing corrected reports.

"106",106,"Meet The Abortion ‘Abolitionist’ Running For Oklahoma Governor","Silberman","James",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-04-13"," Oklahoma will have a new governor in 2019 when sitting governor Mary Fallin leaves office following her second term, the maximum allowed in Oklahoma. One of the candidates vying to be her replacement is former state Rep. Dan Fisher. Fisher represented Oklahoma’s 60th District in the state legislature from 2012-2016 and has pastored in Oklahoma since 1983. Fisher’s campaign is unique for a number of reasons, but chiefly because of his rejection of the “pro-life” designation in favor of the term “abolitionist.”  He is getting the most media attention for his stance on abortion. A central part of his platform is a promise to immediately upon assuming office call a special session of the state legislature to outlaw abortion. In-state Republican leaders recently blocked a bill to classify abortion as first-degree murder. Fisher also says he will “ignore all court orders attempting to thwart the will of the people and advise Oklahoma officials to ignore any federal court orders” relating to abortion, according to The Oklahoman. Republicans currently control the majority of statehouses and the U.S. Congress, but have not used that power to make significant pro-life advances, including repeatedly blocking bills that restrict abortion to 22 weeks of gestation, when studies find babies can feel pain, and refusing to spend political capital defunding Planned Parenthood. Frustration at this situation among the Republican base is helping fuel Fisher’s campaign. This interview has been edited for length. Q: Summarize your campaign, and the difference between your campaign and those of your competitors.  Dan Fisher: There is no political vagueness, no political correctness. We have principles that we believe very strongly in and we’re not ashamed to share those. We don’t shroud our convictions and our positions in political speak. All the planks in our platform are out there and open, and we believe in just telling the people what we’re about, and if they don’t like it, they’ll vote for someone else. Q: Diagnose the problem of abortion in Oklahoma. DF: [Abortion] has remained legal in Oklahoma for 44 years, going on 45, because people, by and large, are convinced that whatever the Supreme Court says is the final word. Obviously, we don’t believe that. First, we don’t believe that the Supreme Court had the constitutional authority to mandate to all 50 states that they have to allow the murder of the unborn. So, it remains because Oklahoma allows it to. Secondly, most of the debate and struggle has ultimately ended up in the courts, and generally, federal judges are not going to rule against the home team, meaning [abortion] remains legal until some state somewhere stands up and says, “No.” [A right to abortion and judicial supremacy] betray the basic principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence, that the job of government is to secure life, liberty, and property. But liberty and property don’t mean a whole lot if you don’t secure life first.  Q: One of the interesting things about your campaign is that you’re not necessarily pro-life. How do you want to see the pro-life-pro-abortion dichotomy shift? DF: I’d just like to see people be honest. Say what you are. I know that there are many people who believe that abortion is wrong and call themselves pro-life, and believe that’s a legitimate title. And for years, I have too. That was until I served in the legislature and discovered that for people in government, that’s a smokescreen. Personally, they might be against abortion, but they’re not going to pay any political price to see abortion come to an end. To them, what pro-life means is you pass a few measures, put a few barricades out there to slow abortion down, but do nothing to end it. There are some who campaign as pro-life who actually fight against measures that move any faster than they want to move in ending abortion. When I came to that realization, I knew something was wrong there, and I realized abortion is something that should end, not be regulated. We don’t regulate murder. We stop it. During the slavery debate in the nineteenth century, there were two groups of people who were against slavery: the anti-slavery group, and the abolitionists. The anti-slavery group thought slavery was wrong and should come to an end, they just wouldn’t lift a finger to do what was right. They certainly weren’t going to lose any blood or sweat or tears to do it. Conversely, the abolitionists were willing to do what it took to end it even if it took them dying to do so. So, I would just love for people to step out and be honest, to say what they’re willing to do. When you say you’re pro-life, does that mean that you would be willing to end abortion and call it murder? That you really want to stop it, not just regulate it? Incrementalism is the real problem here. The belief of many pro-lifers that you can incrementally end this evil. We’ve been incrementally ending it for 44 years, and what we have to show for it is 60 million dead babies, and about 200,000 of them killed here in good old, conservative Oklahoma. Q: Should abortion be abolished in Oklahoma, what response do you expect from Washington DC, and should any federal entity act to enforce Roe v. Wade on Oklahoma, what do you think that confrontation would look like? DF: Then-candidate [Donald] Trump signaled on a number of occasions during the campaign that he believed abortion should be decided in the states. He made that pretty clear. Since he was elected, and in his first year, he has over and over again implied, if not clearly stated, that many things the federal government does is within the purview of the states. I haven’t talked to President Trump and I wouldn’t venture to speak for him, but from everything that I’ve heard from him and everything that I’ve seen, I think he would be our friend. Now, I do not believe that the federal government would be our friend; I certainly don’t believe the federal court system would be our friend. But I believe strongly that the question of abortion is a domestic, meaning within the state, question, and should be decided by the citizens of that state. Now, let me be careful here. Citizens don’t have the right to decide that murder is okay. Murder is fundamentally wrong. So even if the citizens became so perverted that they decided murder is right, murder would still be wrong. But I believe that the states will have to stand. Now, can I predict how that will look? No, I can’t. But we have a few things happening in our country right now that may tip the hat, and there are some things in our history that show what happens when states stand on principle. Wisconsin said “Absolutely not” to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. And they made it very well known that if a slave could make it to Wisconsin, they would be free; and they lived up to it. There have been many other examples in history when states have stood up and said “No” when the federal government was wrong. I believe that a state must stand squarely and firmly on its principles and lets the chips fall where they may, and I would like to believe that reason and right would simply prevail. Q: Regarding legal penalties, ectopic pregnancies, and things like that, what are the details of a bill of abolition that you would like to sign? DF: The job of a physician is to preserve life, which makes it such an egregious contradiction when licensed physicians intentionally end life. In certain problem pregnancies, the doctor is faced with unpredictable and almost impossible situations. The doctor there has to try to save both lives, and sometimes, must allow nature to take its course [if the baby can’t be saved]. Now, we have a lot of medical abilities these days and a lot of knowhow that didn’t exist in 1973. For the most part, these problem pregnancies are incredibly rare, almost negligible in their occurrence, so generally, I consider those arguments spurious, and diversionary tactics to keep us away from the real issue and that is that the overwhelming majority of abortions are performed for one and only one reason: convenience. As for penalties, I would want the Oklahoma legislature to put a bill on my desk that would state that abortion is murder and will be treated as such, and I would sign such a bill. Q: Do you anticipate the legislature working with you to get that type of bill on your desk? DF: I think so. The legislature has made numerous attempts [to do so], with very little good leadership from the governor and other leaders in both houses. There are legislators I personally know who believe the same thing I do, and I believe that some of them have already anticipated not just my run for governor but the need to put forward these kinds of measures. Just last year, in the last session, a resolution passed in the Oklahoma house; now a resolution does not have the force of law, but it is an official statement from an elected body of the people; and the resolution declared that abortion is murder. Period. And that it should be treated as such. That passed the House. Now, again, that doesn’t have the force of law, but it is the official statement of the elected representatives of the citizens of Oklahoma. So I believe there is the will, given the right leadership to do such a thing. Q: With state sovereignty being an important aspect of your campaign, inevitably, people are going to connect that with racism because of the history of the Civil War and all that. How do you respond to people whose minds would go that direction? DF: Racism has nothing to do with state sovereignty and vice versa. Racism is an evil that should be rejected at all levels. We are equal. The Declaration of Independence makes that clear. We are created by God and have unalienable rights, but we’ve struggled through the years to secure those rights for certain people groups, and we’ve got bumps and fumbles along the way, but I would argue that we’ve done a fair job at working to reconcile that. Having said that, state sovereignty has to do with the whole concept of government. Our founding documents say that our government is for the people to secure their rights. Government is not doling out rights. The people inherently have those rights and they organize governments to protect those rights, so government operates according to the consent of the governed. Therefore, the people are sovereign. Unfortunately, we have lost that concept and we believe we have this all-encompassing, benevolent government who gives us the right to enjoy certain freedoms when they choose. It’s completely ridiculous. We fought an entire war of independence over that very idea. So, sovereignty isn’t some wild-eyed, crazy, fringe concept. It’s the very birth principle of what we call our republic. To attach racism to that is just foolish. We need to get these ideas out here. We need to talk about them. Again, racism is deplorable and should be rejected at every level, but when we’re talking sovereignty, we’re simply talking about what is, and we’ve just been ignoring it. Q: From the conservative side, there may be people who point out that Oklahoma, acting as a sovereign state, may very well abolish abortion, but states like California and Illinois, acting as sovereign states, likely won’t. Do you fear that taking the feds completely out of the issue may make it difficult to abolish abortion around the union? DF: That’s a great question. Number one, it’s not the federal government’s job to be involved with this to begin with, so taking them out of it would imply we took something from them. No, they took something from us. Number two, that’s the beauty of federalism. The citizens of a state, with official borders, an official capital, official legislature, determine what set of principles and philosophies they’re going to be governed by. For instance, take Colorado. The citizens of Colorado legalized the recreational use of marijuana. I disagree, but I’m an Oklahoman. I’m not a Coloradan. I applaud the fact that Colorado flexed its sovereign muscles and said to the federal government, “the Constitution doesn’t give you the power to control drugs, that’s a power of the people.” Q: Given your previous answer, what is your view of the Fourteenth Amendment as it relates to abortion? Many conservatives would say that the right to equal protection of the law is an explicit command for the federal government to protect American preborn babies from death. DF: We need to remember the context of the Fourteenth Amendment. That was right after we, as a union, had abolished the horrible practice of slavery. The intention was to make certain that every person is given due process of the law. Unfortunately, the Fourteenth Amendment has been misconstrued to give the federal government almost unlimited power to do whatever they believe is in the interest of how they define equality, and thus a whole doctrine has been implemented: the incorporation doctrine. You don’t find it in the Constitution, you have to read it into it. What is being done today is the Fourteenth Amendment is being taken out of context and being used for unlawful, immoral purposes. Q: What do you say to people who quote Thomas Jefferson’s letter to Danbury Baptist Church, which talks about a separation of church and state, and imply that you are bringing down that wall? DF: I concur with Jefferson, so I’m not trying to bring anything in that letter down. Again, context is everything. Remember that the Danbury Baptists in Connecticut thought that the federal government was going to create a national denomination. Jefferson was addressing that. Now, I don’t know everything that Jefferson personally thought; some things I’d agree with, and some things I wouldn’t. So I’m not defending or criticizing Jefferson in totality, but regarding this letter, yes, there definitely is a wall. It protects the church and religious liberty from government. One would have to take that letter and turn it upside down to read into it that the government needs to be protected from people of faith. Q: Should you win in November, you’ll be confronted with more than just abortion. What other issues are your primary priorities? DF: I believe that a culture which is capable of murdering the unborn is capable of any level of evil: Murdering old people, murdering people who have mental challenges, physical challenges, or just people who have political positions that aren’t popular. Such a culture may be capable of that given the right set of circumstances. So, abolishing abortion is the most important thing. Next, you’ve got to have sovereign states to be able to deal with abortion, seeing as the federal government has seen fit to try to force it on us. But there are other issues and we’re using the abbreviation ASAP to represent those other issues. The A represents small government, it stands for audit everything. In Oklahoma, like in most states, you have corruption and government agencies that want to go rogue. I’m for reducing the size of government down to its core functions and stop wasting the people’s money. I believe smaller government is better government and the best government is that which is closest to the people, because it can hear from the people. Try getting a hold of the director of [Housing and Urban Development] in Washington DC. Oklahoma, like so many states, has bloated government which is wasting taxpayers’ money, and I would argue not only wasting it but stealing it from them in order to waste it. So for us, the A stands for auditing all of the agencies and programs to find out all that’s going on. I’m for reducing the size of government down to its core functions and stop wasting the people’s money. Another thing that’s very important to us is proper government. Going back to the Declaration, Jefferson and the other four members of his committee of five, point out that the primary function of government is to secure our unalienable rights, the most important of which are, of course, life, liberty, and property. That’s the core function of government. It’s not the core function of government to take care of us from our cradle to our graves, to force upon us government-mandated health insurance, to force us to do all number of things. We want to see government do what it is supposed to do, get it out of what it’s not supposed to do, stop stealing from the people through forced taxation and then blowing it on corporate welfare and crony capitalism.

"107",107,"4 Ways State Lawmakers Can Keep Fighting Abortion","Forsythe","Clarke","D.",NA,NA,NA,"2016-08-04"," When five Supreme Court justices in the Texas abortion decision in June (Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt) threw out long-standing, generally applicable health and safety standards for abortion clinics, saying these created too much of a burden, the Five ignored mountains of evidence about medical risks and substandard providers in substandard clinics. The opinion five justices issued virtually invites a sustained rebuke because their cherry-picking through all kinds of medical data and evidence looked more like the work of abortion advocates than impartial judges. The central problem for the justices after Hellerstedt is that they don’t know what they don’t know about abortion, and they claimed to need more information to remedy their deficit.  In the wake of Hellerstedt, there are compelling reasons state legislators should continue to emphasize the negative impact of abortion on women in crafting legislation to protect women in their states. 1. First-Trimester Regulations Okayed First, the media coverage since June 27 has virtually ignored that the Supreme Court, for the very first time since Roe v. Wade, indicated—but only implicitly—that health and safety regulations were okay in the first trimester (when 90 percent of abortions are done). The court specifically acknowledged the importance of abortion facilities being “inspected at least annually” and including appropriate enforcement mechanisms, such as civil and criminal penalties, in abortion regulations and restrictions. Unfortunately, they struck down the actual regulations in front of them coupled—as they have done many times in the past since 1973—with the vague assurance that the states have an interest in protecting “maternal health.” 2. Abortion Spawns Ghastly Hellholes Second, the public health vacuum in abortion clinics across the country isn’t going away. It exists, and the justices created it in Roe v. Wade by prohibiting all health and safety regulations in the first trimester, when 90 percent of abortions occur. (The court also reaffirmed that prohibition in repeated cases throughout the 1970s and 1980s.) Hence, the public health vacuum states have tried to fill, bit by bit, in the face of hostility by federal judges. Hence, the Kermit Gosnells and Leroy Carharts and many others who were allowed to operate “houses of horrors” where women and unborn infants perished.  The history of dangerous conditions and abortion clinic scandals since 1973 is long, detailed, and depressing, and it continues. It doesn’t protect women’s health when the media refuses to report these scandals, resolutely refusing to question any abortion practices publicly on the supposed justification that population control is more important than any risks of abortion. The five justices waved off the Gosnell murder conviction in Philadelphia in 2012 with the weak off-hand remark that bad people will always evade the law. (Does that apply to gun regulations, too?) But this specifically ignores what the Philadelphia grand jury found and reported publicly: that heightened medical standards, including regulations on sufficiently broad hallways, were needed to protect women’s health along with regular inspections. 3. The Supreme Court Relied Upon Bad Data Third, the Five confidently cited the notion that “abortion is safer than childbirth.” That myth has long ago been exploded. The published abortion mortality rate and the published childbirth mortality rate are non-comparable. What goes into the numerator and denominator of each is completely different. There is no basis for comparison. The former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the two published rates should not be compared because they are different measures. Although this has been clear for years, the Five cherry-picked this notion, while ignoring much contrary evidence in briefs filed in the Supreme Court.  4. Give ‘Em the Evidence They Want of Harm to Women Fourth, the Five did not consider the growing body of peer-reviewed international studies finding increased medical risks of pre-term birth, mental trauma, and breast cancer after abortion. An increased risk is not the same as causation, but every woman seeking abortion should be informed of this body of international, peer-reviewed data. The increased risk of pre-term abortion after abortion, for example, is supported by studies of women from more than 30 countries. Since the Five implied more medical evidence is needed, Congress should pass a National Abortion Data Reporting law this summer. None has existed in the 43 years since Roe. There are only two sources of national data, and reporting to both is completely voluntary. California, which used to report one-quarter to one-third of all abortions annually, reports its data to the CDC only sporadically. That annual figure the CDC and the media so confidently report is only an estimate. Consequently, no one can confidently know the rate of complications after abortion. Until there is reliable national data, women are making decisions in the dark without fully informed consent. Obviously, pro-life Americans are concerned about the fate of the unborn child killed in an abortion, but the Supreme Court has long since rejected those sentiments in favor of focusing only on one person involved who is outside the womb. Since the court has made the interests of women the only issue, any strategy worth pursuing will include those interests. Moreover, the nature of abortion puts the mother and child, together, at the center of the decision. The Supreme Court sticks to Roe v. Wade based on the assumption that abortion is good for women. In every pregnancy, various factors may affect the health of mother and child, and Americans care about the health of both. We’ve known since at least the Gallup poll of 1990 on “Abortion and Moral Belief” that many Americans see legal abortion as a “necessary evil” because of some sense (however vague or uncertain) that legal abortion is “good” for women. So focusing on the baby alone does not take account of medical, legal, and social realities. Hopefully the pro-life movement will have the courage and resilience to be on the side of women for the long-term, despite the recent blowback from five agenda-driven justices. There’s more than enough reason and evidence to do so. ","https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/04/4-ways-state-lawmakers-can-keep-fighting-abortion/",0.527,0.473,"male",2012,2012
"108",108,"Abortion Rallies Clash As Supreme Court Hears First Abortion Case With Kavanaugh, Gorsuch","Griswold","Kylee",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-03-04"," As the U.S. Supreme Court heard the oral arguments in the Louisiana abortion case June Medical Services LLC v. Russo Wednesday, advocates and opponents gathered outside in opposing rallies. With the legitimacy of Roe v. Wade on the line, the 2020 election looming, and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh weighing in on their first abortion-related case since joining the bench, tensions were running high. The Louisiana law in question, Act 620, mirrors a similar law in Texas, requiring abortionists to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion facility. The Supreme Court ruled the Texas law unconstitutional in the 2016 case Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt, saying it placed an “undue burden” on women seeking an abortion, a practice the court determined was a constitutional right in the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision.  Louisiana Abortion Law Differs from Texas Law But the Louisiana law differs from the Texas law in practice, resulting in no substantial burden to women. For instance, Texas hospitals require doctors to admit a minimum number of patients each year in order to retain their admitting privileges, resulting in more abortion facility closures, but few Louisiana hospitals require such minimums. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Act 620, saying that since only one doctor at a single facility in Louisiana was unable to obtain admitting privileges, there is no evidence Act 620 would result in any closures. While the Texas law led to a 350 percent increase in women having to drive more than 150 miles to get abortions, driving distances did not increase as a result of the Louisiana law. “One of the differences between June Medical and Hellerstedt is that the record out of Louisiana is full of instances where women suffered greatly because doctors did not have admitting privileges,” Denise Harle, legal counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, told The Federalist in an interview. Harle continued: There was a woman, for example, whose uterus was perforated, and she ended up sitting in the ER for three days hemorrhaging, and they ultimately had to do a hysterectomy, and she lost her ability to have children just because the abortion doctor didn’t have admitting privileges, so there was a huge communication gap between what had gone wrong and the abortion clinic and her ultimate treatment at the hospital. So that was just one example of several on the record, and then there’s other instances in the Louisiana record where women were treated more [improperly because of a lack of admitting privileges] and that was something that wasn’t as obvious in the Texas case.  The Louisiana law also highlights the issue of third-party standing, raising the question of whether it is lawful for abortion providers to sue on behalf of women and whether the interests of abortionists and women align. Evidence suggests their interests actually conflict. For instance, it was a law like Louisiana’s that closed the practice of traveling Indiana abortionist George Klopfer, whose unsafe practices endangered women, landing some in emergency rooms. Upon Klopfer’s death in September 2019, officers found the remains of more than 2,000 aborted babies inside his Illinois home. “Women can speak for themselves,” said Harle. “It’s wrong for doctors who are profiting off of women to come in with this conflict of interest and pretend they speak for women when they’re really asking for an exemption that jeopardizes women’s health.”  Krista Corbello, a rally attendee who previously worked for Louisiana Right to Life after finding out her mother almost aborted her, compared health standards for abortionists to other medical care providers. “My dentist has to have a certain standard in his office, in his practice, so why doesn’t an abortion doctor have to meet that?” she asked. “The narrative should be the safety of women, and if they’re having unqualified medical doctors not meeting the standards to get admitting privileges, to me it’s just common sense that they would meet those standards.” Abortion advocates only talk about access, Corbello said, “And it’s like, are we preferring access over safety? … People should care about the safety of women. [Pro-choicers] are always considered the champion of women, but in this case, I would say not so, not so.” Pro-Abortion Advocates Fear a Roe Reversal Abortion advocates disagree, however, clinging tightly to feminism’s marriage of women’s rights and abortion. “It’s scary to see what’s going on now that this right that we fought so hard to have is being chipped away at little by little,” Elizabeth Smith, a pro-abortion rally attendee, told The Federalist. “It’s got to be federal. Returning it to the states is ridiculous. If you don’t want to have an abortion, that’s it. Okay? This is a personal decision.” “[Abortion] is an ultimate freedom that needs to be assured,” Smith’s friend Sally Bawcombe, a longtime abortion advocate, added. “It needs to be guaranteed.”  While the court hears June Medical, pro-abortion activists look ahead, fearing the possibility of future Roe v. Wade reversal, which would become more likely if June Medical results in a pro-life win. “There needs to be federal [abortion] protections,” Kellsea Mclain told The Federalist, while also saying it may be time to consider a “state-by-state abortion access framework.” Mclain added, “I do worry that Roe isn’t going to be the law of the land much longer.” Who Will Prevail in June Medical v. Russo? Given the differences between the Texas and Louisiana laws and the now-conservative majority on the court, it’s possible the case will result in a pro-life victory. “It’s dangerous to predict what courts are going to do, especially what the United States Supreme Court will do,” Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told The Federalist. “I know what I want them to do. I hope they will uphold Louisiana statute. But all we can do in the U.S. Senate is try to put good, smart men and women on the bench who understand the role of a federal judge, and then you’ve got to trust them. And all of us, those who agree and those who disagree, should trust the United States Supreme Court.”  Both pro-abortion and anti-abortion activists are anticipating the November presidential election, aware that the outcome could result in a reshaping of the Supreme Court and eventually Roe. Two liberal justices are in their 80s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, both Bill Clinton appointees, raising the possibility either or both will retire within the next presidential term. “I think that this election is really, really crucial. I think that right now Trump is our only candidate that is pro-life,” said Carley Kolter, a Liberty University freshman who camped out in front of the Supreme Court overnight in the D.C. rain and wind for Wednesday’s arguments. “Any other candidate doesn’t really have any values that are pro-life. Our best bet is Trump, honestly.” Considering whether any 2020 Democrats would uphold the sanctity of unborn life, Alex Seghers from Louisiana Right to Life told The Federalist, “There’s not a lot of hope out there, but there’s always opportunity for someone to realize what abortion truly is and that they can take a human rights stance against it regardless of party.” If the Supreme Court strikes down Act 620, however, further legitimizing abortion and Roe, pro-lifers are determined to keep fighting. “Fall down seven times, stand up eight. We keep fighting,” Kennedy said. “Defeat is not final unless you give up. We won’t give up in Louisiana. I believe in life.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/04/abortion-rallies-clash-as-supreme-court-hears-first-abortion-case-with-kavanaugh-gorsuch/",0.0073,0.9927,"female",2012,2012
"109",109,"Can Activists Transform Abortion Into A ‘Positive’ Event?","Payne","Daniel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-05-14"," Abortion has had quite the busy month. First, boxer Floyd Mayweather revealed via Facebook that the “real reason” he and his girlfriend Shantel Jackson broke up was that she aborted their unborn twins, a practice to which Mayweather is opposed: “I’m totally against killing babies,” he wrote. Elsewhere, media outlets picked up en masse on abortion counselor Emily Letts’s “abortion video,” which the woman posted on Youtube because she wanted to, quote, “share my story.” “I do not feel like a bad person,” she claims after the procedure. “I feel in awe of the fact that I can make a baby. I can make a life.”  She can also take a life, as well, an ability that inspires decidedly less awe, unless you’re into that sort of thing. Indeed, the abortion story is a kind of literary genre à la mode, with organizations such as the “1 in 3 Campaign” gathering such stories in order to “start a new conversation about abortion” (they sell T-shirts, too. If you’re into that sort of thing.) Pace Hillary Clinton’s desire to see abortion be “safe, legal and rare,” the fashionable crusade is to now remove the pretense of any limits on abortion whatsoever: rare? Why should it be rare? Writing in the Guardian, Jessica Valenti wants to do away with that whole passé, outmoded “keeping it rare” thing: “Saying as much only reinforces the stigma against the procedure,” she claims. And we wouldn’t want to do that. In truth, the 1 in 3 campaign, Jessica Valenti’s blasé dismissal of abortion stigmas, and various other abortion promotion outlets are all part of a loosely-confederated yet still single-minded effort to turn abortion into a largely mainstream medical task, “ending the stigma and shame” of the whole thing, as 1 in 3 puts it. This is what the abortion lobby does. Having won a legally bizarre but so-far-ironclad victory in 1973, the champions of abortion-on-demand have directed their efforts at making abortion a so-so, no-big-deal kind of procedure. That is where abortion is inexorably heading: more and more it will be treated as if it’s the most innocuous undertaking in the world, the least-unusual part of your day. “Every time I watch the video,” Letts says of her abortion film, “I love it. I love how positive it is.” Positive, sure, unless you happened to be on the receiving end of Ms. Letts’s “story,” in which case it was probably not so positive. You can hardly blame abortion’s advocates for attempting to de-stigmatize the act of abortion. A recent CNN poll showed that well over 50% of Americans are largely against abortion and a plurality are completely against it (having been convinced at one time that abortion should be more-or-less legal, I find myself now squarely in the majority and flirting with the plurality). Abortion remains a deeply uncomfortable and repugnant medical act for millions of people who recognize that it is something less than a “positive” experience for one half of the participants. Facing such a large disadvantage, it should hardly be surprising that the abortion lobby is attempting to make it the moral equivalent of getting one’s temperature taken: if you’re having trouble convincing them that abortion is an inalienable right, then try convincing them that abortion is an ethical non-issue.  Hell, if that doesn’t work, try anything. Anti-abortion legislation, Valenti writes, “assumes that women, if not kept in check by the government, are not to be trusted to make good decisions about their bodies and families.” This is comically untrue. Anti-abortion legislation cares not a whit about a woman’s “good decisions,” or even her bad decisions. Pro-life efforts are motivated by nothing more and nothing less than the realization that unborn children are human beings bestowed with the same rights and privileges of all human beings. The issue is not one of trust, or decisions, or whatever other obfuscating platitudes Jessica Valenti can devise: the issue is one of whether or not murder should be legal. At the very least, the two sides of the debate can have an honest discussion if these obvious truths are agreed upon. But good luck with that. Abortion rates are falling, yet what abortions remain will continue to be treated as either neutral events or grotesque “positive” experiences. Should the winds change, and the abortion rate begins to creep upwards again, we can be assured that the ethical mores that once acted as a check against it will have been severely weakened, if not obliterated altogether. “I’m totally against killing babies,” Floyd Mayweather says, to which the abortion lobby replies: “Hey, that sounds totally positive!” Daniel Payne is a senior contributor at The Federalist.

"110",110,"Shorter Princeton Prof: Early Abortions Are Moral Because I Say So","Carter","Joe",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-08-15"," Recently, a Princeton professor joined a YouTube show to discuss her argument for the morality of abortion. She says whether one aborts an unborn child or not, “you can really do no wrong.” Cue the predictable pro-life jeer track. Yet Matthew Lee Anderson, one of my oldest and dearest friends, says that not only am I wrong about Elizabeth Harman’s argument, but so is everyone else who watched the video and found it illogical and incoherent.  I’m not smarter than an Ivy League professor (or, for that matter, than a community college professor). But I’ve made enough incoherent and illogical arguments in my life that I’ve gained an above average ability to spot them. Of course I beg to differ with Harman and Anderson, and here’s why. This Is An Argument About What Constitutes an Argument Matt says we need to be clear on what Harman is not saying: “She is not in fact making an argument for abortion.” An argument is, by definition, a set of reasons given with the aim of persuading others that an action or idea is right or wrong. In the video Harman defends the “liberal position about early abortion” that there’s “nothing morally bad” about early abortions. In doing this she gives a set of reasons (albeit unsupported) why we should accept her view. She is clearly making an argument. But is she making an argument for abortion? Well, she is making an argument that early abortions are “nothing morally bad.” If I tell you there is nothing morally bad about murder, would you assume I was not making a case for murder?  Matt seems to think that because she is not trying to convince conservatives that abortion is morally wrong that she therefore is not making an argument for abortion. He adds, “Her question is not whether abortion is permissible. It’s whether abortion even matters.” If Harman thinks abortion doesn’t even matter, then should we assume she’d shrug if we proposed to outlaw all early abortions? Of course not. But if she’s not arguing for abortion, what it she arguing for? There are two parts to Harman’s argument. There are the claims she makes in the video (which seem, to most of us, to be an argument in favor of abortion) and the claims she makes in the paper the video is based on (which merely assumes based on circular reasoning that early abortion is morally licit). Let’s take a closer look at her paper, “Creation Ethics: The Moral Status of Early Fetuses and the Ethics of Abortion.” In this paper, Harman fleshes out the claims—namely the Actual Future Principle—that in the video confused even James Franco by their incoherence. Matt says, “I find her Actual Future Principle actually interesting.” I don’t. I say her Actual Future Principle is even goofier on examination than it sounds in the video. I don’t think I’ll convince Matt, but I’m hoping I can convince you.  Because I’m an Ivy League Professor! Harman begins by noting “we all make the following assumption” that all “embryos at the same stage of development and in the same health have some moral status or neither does.” She then states this claim can be denied. Why? Because she said so. And as Matt pointed out, she’s an Ivy League professor, so she’s obviously smarter than us. Having dismissed what most people previously believed with a wave of her hand, Harman replaces it with what she calls the Actual Future Principle: “An early fetus that will become a person has some moral status. An early fetus that will die while it is still an early fetus has no moral status.” Where did this principle come from? She just made it up. Why would she make up such a bizarre “principle”? She doesn’t really say, although she does note it implies the following view: “The very liberal view on the ethics of abortion: Early abortion requires no moral justification whatsoever.” Well, okay then. Here’s where her argument becomes a form of illogical circular reasoning. Harman says it is morally trivial to kill something that doesn’t have moral status.
She then claims an embryo doesn’t have moral status if it dies.
Since an abortion causes the embryo to die, an embryo that is aborted can’t have moral status.
Abortion is therefore morally trivial since it kills something that, when killed, no longer has moral status. Matt said that Harman wasn’t making an argument for abortion. But her argument that abortion is morally trivial relies on her argument for the Actual Future Principle that is used as the premise for her claim that there is nothing morally significant about abortion. So, yes, she is making an argument for abortion. It’s True Because I’m Assuming It’s True But, wait, it gets worse. Harman then jumps to a conclusion: “Conclusion 1: The Actual Future Principle is a tenable view of the moral status of early fetuses.” You might be wondering what makes the conclusion tenable. Her answer: “I take myself to have prima facie established Conclusion 1 by stating the Actual Future Principle.” Harman claims actions in the future can also cause changes to the past. Let’s sub in Conclusion 1 to her second sentence: “I take myself to have prima facie [i.e., accepted as correct until proved otherwise] established [the Actual Future Principle is a tenable view of the moral status of early fetuses] by stating the Actual Future Principle.” In other words, by merely stating the principle that she made up (the AFP) she has established the principle (the AFP) is accepted as correct until proved otherwise. (Spoiler alert: She always accepts it as correct.) Neat trick. I guess you can do that if you’re an Ivy League professor. But the neatest trick of all is that, according to Harman, a woman can change the moral status of an early fetus by her future choice to have or not have an abortion. Now, you might have believed that causation only works by changing the future. But Harman has discovered a way to make causation work back in time. In the normal course of the space-time continuum, our actions can cause changes in events in the future. But Harman claims actions in the future can also cause changes to the past. Consider, for example, “women who are genuinely unsure whether they will abort their pregnancies.” According to Harman, “Their choice is unique, because it determines a feature of their present situation. Most choices simply determine the future, but the choice whether to abort determines the present moral status of a living being.” It’s clear that if you kill the fetus that will change its future moral status; it’s less clear how a future decision to abort will determine the present moral status. How exactly does it alter the normal course of cause and effect? Stop asking, you wouldn’t understand. As Matt might say, you’re not an Ivy League professor. The Future Changes the Past? What Harman leaves out is the future decision to abort must also determine the past moral status of the embryo. This is the required conclusion based on Harman’s claim that the moral status is continuous and, once determined, doesn’t change for any given individual embryo. Later in the paper she says: Consider the case of a woman who is firmly decided on one day that she will abort her early pregnancy, but the next day is convinced by a friend’s argument to carry her pregnancy to term; she firmly holds that intention for a week, then has a discussion with another friend and the next day has an abortion. According to the Mother’s Intention Principle, the early fetus in question has no moral status on the first day, then has some moral status for a week, then for a day has no moral status again before it dies in the abortion. This is metaphysically absurd; these fluctuations in moral status do not correspond to any fluctuations in anything we might call the fetus’s nature. She’s right. The change in the mother’s intention can’t change the “fetus’s nature.” So how, then, does the fetus’s nature change because the mother carried out her intention to have an abortion? It can’t have been the case that the action had no effect on the moral status since the decision to keep the child would have established that the embryo, per Harman, always had moral status. How, then, did the woman’s future decision to abort or not abort change the moral status of the fetus at an early time, such as in the days after she became pregnant? How is any of that possible? Who knows? As you’ll discover if you read her paper, Harman makes a lot of assertions that she never even bothers to defend. Her statement, “I take myself to have prima facie established…” could be applied to just about every disputable claim she makes in the paper. If you’re an academic like Matt, collegiality requires you to smile and nod and say, “Sure, I guess that’s possible . . .” But we don’t have to go along with the idea that abortion is so powerful it can go back in time and change the moral status of entities in the past. Can We Fix Her Argument? Matt and others might say that charity requires we try to fix Harman’s argument. If we want to improve on Harman’s argument, we could replace the Actual Future Principle with the Xenu-Determined Future Principle (XDFP). The Xenu-Determined Principle: An early fetus that will become a person has some moral status. An early fetus that will die because Xenu determined that it will die while it is still a fetus has no moral status. By doing this we’ve strengthened the AFP because we’ve provided a cause for the conditional statement “that will die.” If the fetus dies then we can say that Xenu had determined from before the formation of the Galactic Confederacy that a particular embryo had no moral status and was destined to die. We are front-loading the cause rather than needing a future cause to perform the impossible task of working backward and determining the moral status of the embryo. We’ll let Harman keep the AFP as her premise even though she has done nothing to show that any reasonable person should accept it as true. What reason do we have for believing that Xenu can change the moral status of embryos? None whatsoever. But we also have no reason to believe the AFP is true. The XDFP does the exact same work and is at least more logically possible than the AFP. We have no reason, of course, to accept the XDFP. But Harman gives no reasons for why we should support the AFP other than that since she stated it she—and hence we—should accept it as prima facie true. Why? You know why. (My friend Matt: “If you say “Cause she’s an Ivy League professor” one more time I’m going to choke you.”) But even if we do accept the AFP, it does no real work. As philosopher Nathan Nobis has pointed out in peer-reviewed journal article, “the AFP does not seem to do any work in defending a liberal view on abortion: if the liberal view on abortion, as Harman characterizes it, is justified (and I have not argued that it is or that it is not), this is not because of any support the AFP provides.” (Nobis’s whole critique of Harman’s paper that is worth reading. He’s more polite than me but finds her claims “surprising” and “puzzling.”) We can’t toss out the AFP as irrelevant, though, since what we’d be left with is the mere unsupported claim of the liberal view on abortion that early abortion “requires no moral justification whatsoever.” So we’ll let Harman keep the AFP as her premise even though she has done nothing to show that any reasonable person should accept it as true. Matt says we conservatives “shouldn’t deny her the premise that her argument starts from, and then mock her for making an incoherent argument.” I agree. We should allow Harman the premise her argument starts from—and then we have plenty of reason to mock her for its incoherence.

"111",111,"Virginia’s Blood-Spattered Abortion Clinics And Onerous Hallway Widths","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013-10-25"," When an Arlington County, Virginia, judge ruled that a lawsuit challenging regulations of Virginia abortion clinics could move forward, the Washington Post ran a news report emphasizing that the clinic regulations even mandate the width of hallways. It said that providers worry that complying with the regulations would put them out of business. The same article talked about how the owner of the clinic who filed the lawsuit is a “woman of very strong faith” who called the judge’s decision “spiritually uplifting.”  What wasn’t mentioned in the cheery report about Falls Church Healthcare Center was what the Virginia Department of Health found when it made a planned and announced inspection of the clinic in August 2012. As reported in a 65-page document, the facility was found to be blood-splattered and failing to comply with even basic sterilization procedures. Again, this was after being told when to expect a visit from health inspectors. The inspectors observed that two blood collection tubes, designated as “clean and ready for use”, actually had a “dark reddish substance” where the tube for blood collection attached. A staff member said that the cleaning process for these tubes is to run them under water and then soak them in alcohol at the end of the day, but not between patient uses. When the inspectors pointed out the substance, a staff member said, “That looks like blood. They aren’t clean.” So the staffer ran them under water and said the “blood” was gone. The facility was found to be blood-splattered and failing to comply with even basic sterilization procedures. There was also dried blood of various colorations on the foot/leg support of the procedure table and the metal support under the padded area and the metal base of the procedure table itself. A procedure room was reported as ready for the patients scheduled that day, but observation revealed visible dried blood on the metal joints that connected the metal leg stirrup/supports. There was also dried blood splatter in the “Wet Lab”/Dirty scrub room, on the swing door to a second procedure room, the door jamb to the same room and the wall above the freezer. Two pathology containers were contaminated with blood, and clean equipment was put in contaminated areas.  A sponge used to clean blood splatter was kept on a utility sink, and a staff member reported that the cleaning method for the sponge was to rinse it under water. The list of infractions goes on and on. The clinic was found to have, according to the group that filed Freedom of Information requests to get the reports: No bylaws No records obtaining criminal background checks of employees No policy to report violations to the appropriate Boards of the Health Professions No records for verifying that contractors/employees meet personnel qualifications No complaint logs No policy on infection prevention training No procedure for assuring that employees with communicable diseases are ID’d and prevented from transmission to others No policy for reporting disease outbreak No record of patient/staff/visitor deaths & no policy on how to report deaths No record of preventative maintenance on equipment or policy for maintenance And that list doesn’t include the problems with oversight of narcotics or other serious drugs. This information came from just one clinic. Virginia health inspectors filed reports on 20 clinics after Virginia’s General Assembly voted in 2011 to regulate abortion clinics like other outpatient surgical centers. These regulations required clinics to meet standards in record-keeping, building design, and infection control. Prior to the 2011 change, clinics were treated like doctor’s offices and not subject to inspection. What’s fascinating about these reports is that while the Family Foundation of Virginia was able to obtain them by filing a FOIA request, the media are rather dramatically disinterested in them.  The media are dramatically disinterested in health and safety violations at abortion clinics. It’s one thing for media — a group that normally loves investigating controversial industries — to not to run their own investigations about abortion clinic safety. But it’s entirely another issue to ignore or otherwise cover up the investigations done by a state agency. It’s not that the abortion clinic regulations haven’t been newsworthy. A search for the words Virginia, abortion, clinic and regulations at WashingtonPost.com yields 854 results. But if there was even one piece about how clinics such as Falls Church Healthcare Center fared, I didn’t find it. Instead of stories about what the inspectors found at clinics that were expecting them, readers were treated to highly politicized pieces about unnecessary hall widths and the extremism of pro-life activists. And about those hall widths Whenever legislators attempt to strengthen oversight of abortion clinics, opponents usually focus on one thing in particular:  the regulation of hallway widths. “Opponents mocked the idea that the architectural standards would actually translate into better health care,” the Washington Post reported, after specifically citing “wider hallways and doorways.” Planned Parenthood officials in other states have said they are outraged by hallway regulations. Betty Cockrum, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, told JCOnline.com, “At no point does the width of doorways have any bearing on the medical treatment that’s being administered.” RHRealityCheck, an abortion rights site, called the hallway regulations “onerous,” a charge frequently parroted by the media. Regulating hallway width does seem silly. Why in the world would anyone who cared about women’s health and safety want to regulate the width of hallways at abortion clinics? To answer that question, let’s revisit the Grand Jury Report investigating Kermit Gosnell, an abortion doctor in Philadelphia. Unlike most sensational serial murder trials, Gosnell’s was not well covered by the media. In fact, most media outlets had to be flat-out shamed into covering it after massive public outcry. But the long and the short of it is that Gosnell was charged with eight counts of murder, 24 felony counts of illegal abortions beyond the 24-week limit, and 227 misdemeanor counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent law. He was eventually convicted on three of the murder charges related to some of the babies he delivered before snipping their spines with scissors, and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the overdose death of an adult patient. He was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent law. But we were talking about hallways, right? The adult patient who died under Gosnell’s care was Karnamaya Mongar, a 41-year-old refugee from Nepal. Part of her death, it turns out, was due to paramedics’ inability to negotiate hallways at the “Women’s Medical Society” that Gosnell ran. From the Grand Jury Report: [T]here might have been some slim hope of reviving Mrs. Mongar. The paramedics were able to generate a weak pulse. But, because of the cluttered hallways and the padlocked emergency door, it took them over twenty minutes just to find a way to get her out of the building. The Grand Jury account of her abortion and ultimate death reads like an explanatory defense of “onerous” abortion clinic regulations — staff made her sign forms she could not read. Her medication was delivered in an unmonitored and unrecorded fashion. Medical equipment that could have saved her life was not working properly. The poor records and training of staff, along with deliberate downplaying of the problem, meant that hospital doctors never knew what they were dealing with. And it’s not like Karnamaya Mongar is the only patient in recent memory requiring emergency evacuation from an abortion clinic. One pro-life group has been tracking some of the emergency calls placed by some Planned Parenthood clinics since the Gosnell Grand Jury report was issued. A few months ago they’d written about more than two dozen of them. When Gosnell’s clinic was finally raided, it wasn’t because of “onerous” abortion clinic regulations. According to the Grand Jury report, “In the end, Gosnell was only caught by accident, when police raided his offices to seize evidence of his illegal prescription selling.” But when the police got there, they found conditions so horrific that they summoned ambulances to pick up waiting abortion patients. Once again, emergency personnel “could not maneuver stretchers through the building’s narrow hallways to reach the patients.” The Grand Jury said: Clinics must have doors, elevators, and other passages adequate to allow stretcher-borne patients to be carried to a street-level exit. Gosnell’s clinic, with its narrow, twisted passageways, could not accommodate a stretcher at all. So what was that one Planned Parenthood official saying again? At no point does the width of doorways have any bearing on the medical treatment that’s being administered? Karnamaya Mongar would say otherwise, if she were able to. What we mock when we mock regulations Hallway widths are just one of the architectural standards required for clinics serving women such as Karnamaya Mongar. They are supposedly the most ridiculous of the regulations facing Virginia’s previously uninspected clinics. But the fight to avoid such regulations tells us something about America’s abortion regime and the media that support them. Problems at abortion clinics are routinely downplayed, ignored, or excused. The abortion rights mantra about how abortion should be “safe, legal and rare” frames the way pro-choice activism is presented in the media. Which is to say that it is always positive, always fluffy, always light. Remember the clinic owner at the top of the story? The newspaper hid the actual results of state inspections of her clinic … in a story about state inspections of her clinic … so that readers could be told she was a woman of “very strong faith.” Telling. When activists fight safety regulations, as they have in Ohio, Virginia, and Texas this year, there is little push back from the media. Sometimes it’s the opposite of push back. Campaign finance regulators would be forgiven for considering the recent media coverage of state Sen. Wendy Davis (D-Texas) as an in-kind contribution to her political campaigns. Rather than discuss safety regulations at abortion clinics in Texas, rather than discuss late-term abortion, rather than point out how American abortion laws are far laxer than laws even in Europe … we were treated to stories about her shoes. And then more stories about her shoes. Even if you don’t consider the life of the unborn child targeted in an abortion, and only the life of the mother who is undergoing the procedure, abortion carries risk. For an industry and media that claim to care about fighting against a “war on women,” is having hallways that gurneys can pass through really an insurmountable barrier? Much of the Gosnell Grand Jury report was devoted to how state and local officials allowed the situation at Gosnell’s clinic to happen. “We discovered that Pennsylvania’s Department of Health has deliberately chosen not to enforce laws that should afford patients at abortion clinics the same safeguards and assurances of quality health care as patients of other medical service providers. Even nail salons in Pennsylvania are monitored more closely for client safety,” the report said. When BuzzFeed listed a dozen or so “Horrifying Passages From The Kermit Gosnell Grand Jury Report,” this was one of them: They described blood-splattered floors, and blood-stained chairs in which patients waited for and then recovered from abortions. Even the stirrups on the procedure table were often caked with dried blood that was not cleaned off between procedures. Hopefully none of the Virginia abortion clinics being inspected under the new regulations would reach Gosnell-level of horrors, even if they also feature blood spatters and caked blood on procedure tables and elsewhere. But it is worth asking what Virginians think is appropriate oversight. Until the media begin reporting on what announced inspections have found, it will be difficult to have an informed conversation about whether they should be strengthened or weakened.

"112",112,"How Samantha Saved Baby Giselle With A Pill Reversal After Three Abortion Attempts","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-02-08"," Although the abortion lobby loudly derides abortion pill reversal as “unproven” at best and “junk science” at worst, don’t count on a Massachusetts woman named Samantha to join the chorus of science-deniers who oppose this life-saving medical intervention. To Samantha, the only important thing about the breakthrough treatment—a new use of a decades-old, Food and Drug Administration-approved prescription dating back to the 1950s—is that it saved her daughter’s life earlier this year. One of 400 mothers and counting to have saved the life of their unborn children in the past five years this way, Samantha welcomed her daughter into the world this December.  At Abundant Hope Pregnancy Resource Center, which is just down the street from an abortion business in Attleboro, Mass., Samantha found out about abortion pill reversal. Ironically, Abundant Hope came under fire in late 2017 from the pro-abortion Campaign for Accountability, which lodged a formal complaint with the state accusing Abundant Hope of tricking women into rejecting abortion. The complaint was filed less than a week after a church working with Abundant Hope held a baby shower in Samantha—and her unborn daughter’s—honor. “They gave me strength to not go through with that that abortion—that horrifying thing that would have affected the rest of my life,” Samantha said. “It was just an ongoing struggle with what to do in my heart and my head. Abundant Hope has changed my life by being a good support system. When I don’t have anyone else to turn to, I give them a call—even if I just need to talk.” Samantha Tried Abortion Three Times Following her initial visit at Abundant Hope, Samantha tried to abort her baby three separate times. On her third attempt, Samantha took the first of two pills in the chemical abortion regimen. She immediately regretted her decision, however, and reached out to the abortion pill reversal hotline (877-558-0333) for help. Within hours, Samantha was receiving an emergency dose of progesterone. One of 350 physicians who make up the national abortion pill reversal network, the doctor then worked with Samantha to prescribe an ongoing progesterone treatment plan to get her pregnancy back on track.  “It hasn’t been easy for her,” said Samantha Thorpe, client services coordinator at Abundant Hope. “She calls me regularly, and we talk about all of the progress she’s making in her life, as well as the steps she’s taking to make a good life for her children. We’re just being that support system for her in her pregnancy.” ‘I Realized I’d Done the Wrong Thing’ Already a mother of three boys, when Samantha found out she was expecting a fourth child in early 2017, she booked an appointment at a western Massachusetts abortion center. Getting to the appointment proved to be a challenge, though, and when Samantha couldn’t find child care for her boys, she canceled. Then Samantha tried a second time to abort her baby girl, this time keeping her appointment at a Boston abortion business. However, as she sat in the waiting room, waiting for the staff to call her name, Samantha was shocked when the nurse came in and called for another woman: Giselle. That was the name Samantha had picked out for her daughter, whom she was just minutes away from aborting. “I felt like that was a sign of some sort, and I ended up just freaking out and leaving the appointment,” Samantha said.  Although Samantha left the abortion clinic right away, the pressure she was under as a single mother facing an unexpected pregnancy lingered. Soon, Samantha set a third appointment, this time following through by taking a dose of mifepristone—which is meant to end the life of an unborn child. That’s when she reached out to the hotline, which Abundant Hope had told her about at her visit two weeks prior. “I ended up taking the first pill, and immediately after, I realized I’d done the wrong thing,” Samantha said. “I contacted the Abortion Pill Reversal hotline and they got me in touch with a doctor to start the reversal procedure with the progesterone. I started taking that, and now my baby is healthy and everything is perfectly fine.” Abortion Pill Reversal: A Second Chance at Life While at least 400 women have successfully saved their babies via abortion pill reversal in the past five years, abortion industry leaders—as well as their allies in the mainstream media and political sphere—have opposed the intervention at every conceivable turn. The resistance began shortly after a pro-life physician named Dr. George Delgado founded the abortion pill reversal network and hotline in 2012. That year, he also co-published an article in Annals of Pharmacotherapy studying seven women who’d regretted their abortion decision and turned to an emergency progesterone injection to try and save their child’s life. First successfully performed in 2007 by Dr. Matthew Harrison, an OB-GYN in North Carolina, the procedure was featured in The New York Times last summer, and ran with a quotation from Yale School of Medicine’s Dr. Harvey Kliman not only agreeing abortion pill reversal “makes biological sense,” but that he would recommend the treatment for his own daughter. Nonetheless, hostility toward abortion pill reversal has continued unabated. In the past three years, abortion proponents, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), have fought state-level efforts that would require abortion businesses to make women aware of the life-saving procedure. Meanwhile, left-wing media sources including Snopes.com and The Washington Post regularly denounce the reversal as “dangerous” “junk science,” despite the FDA’s longstanding approval of emergency progesterone treatments. Most recently, Heartbeat International—an affiliation group to which Abundant Hope belongs—saw its status as a continuing education provider through the state of California threatened because it trains nurses and other medical professionals on the latest abortion pill reversal information and developments. To Abundant Hope’s medical director—whose name is withheld as part of her membership in the reversal network—the ongoing hostility toward abortion pill reversal flies not only in the face of medicine and science, it’s also an effort to strip a woman like Samantha of her ability to choose life for her precious child. “As a pro-life physician, I find it very encouraging that something can be tried even after a woman has taken a pill to terminate her pregnancy and the life of her baby,” she said. “God Bless Dr. Delgado and the APR nurses and physicians who are willing to give a baby and a mother—and a father—a second chance at life.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2018/02/08/samantha-saved-baby-giselle-pill-reversal-three-abortion-attempts/",0.9929,0.0071,"male",2012,2012
"113",113,"The Gospel According To ‘Christian Abortionist’ Willie Parker","Garnett","Matthew",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-05-30"," Abortionist Willie Parker, in his latest book, “Life’s Work: A Moral Argument for Choice,” recapitulates the traditional arguments for abortion advocacy with a novel layer. Armed with his background as a fundamentalist Christian and teenage conversion to Christianity, Parker urges those who affirm abortion to proselytize. While he most often calls this proselytization “activism,” Parker clearly understands abortion as a moral and spiritual absolute that must be “preached” to survive. He ultimately aims to retain his “deep Christian identity” while promoting abortion.  As with popular works such as “The Shack,” Parker offers a theological treatise, in fact a manifesto, for those who seek to maintain abortion as a constitutional right. For Parker, it is not enough to merely make the scientific, legal, and logical arguments of old. In his mind, those arguments are a given. This new “civil rights movement” must “convert” the “antis.” To put the matter simply, Parker argues that abortion is not only a moral absolute, it is an absolute that must be promulgated en masse. It’s Okay to Kill to Achieve Your Dreams Parker presupposes that life does not begin at conception. From there, he adds that women with unwanted pregnancies have sacred dreams and hopes their society must protect. In chapter four of the book, entitled “Dreams,” Parker asserts, “I see women…all the time (who want abortions)…shouldering the shame that their culture places on them. As a Christian, I feel it is my job to offer a counter narrative. That God gave every woman gifts and the agency to realize those gifts and that nothing about choosing to terminate a pregnancy or delay childbearing, puts a woman outside of God’s love.” Thus, Parker considers it a Christian and moral imperative to not only keep abortion legal but also to make it easily accessible to all women. Curtailing this important service, including with social stigma, effectively denies a fundamental civil and religious right. Because of this, it is the duty of all with proper thinking on the matter to persuade those who are unconvinced of the virtues of abortion and fight to defeat those who seek to deprive women of this right. From this syllogism, Parker quite effectively makes the case that not only is it a Christian virtue to affirm, advocate, and indeed celebrate abortion, it is singularly un-Christian to oppose abortion rights. To him, opposing abortion rights is as much a grievous sin as opposing the civil rights movement inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.  The “antis,” as he labels them, are comparable to the 1960s deep South Klu Klux Klan. Only now, instead of openly lynching and murdering blacks, the antis slowly put poor minority women to death by robbing their futures and forcing them to carry pregnancies to term. According to Parker, “Their goal…is not actually to curtail abortion. It’s to limit access to abortion for…especially white women. Because the thing all too many white, anti-abortion activists really want…is for white women to have more babies in order to push back against the ‘browning’ of America…for the white, racist legislators in the ‘Red States,’ nothing is more threatening than a majority brown country. The white men who are still in charge believe that they, the white patriarchs, are going to become obsolete.” Parker Uses Strongly Religious Overtones and Metaphors Now, if a person is inclined to quip, “Ah. This just the old ‘the baby is not a baby, it’s a fetus’ and ‘women have rights over their own body’ argument,” not so fast. To be sure, in its bare essence, that’s the argument, but he craftily couches all this in religious, particularly Christian language. Indeed, the final chapter of the book is entitled, “A New Theology of Abortion,” and Parker refers to murdered abortionist George Tiller as “Saint George.” Parker speaks of his change of heart on abortion as a “conversion.” He previously refused to perform abortions and now advocates for them. Parker frequently references his days as a fundamentalist Christian, when he went door to door preaching and handing out gospel tracts, as something that helped him stand for “reproductive rights” in the face of adversity.  Parker also refers to his work as an abortionist as a “calling” on par with that of the Apostle Paul in the Bible: “I have purchased cooking pots and a double bass for the leisure I imagine but do not possess. Instead I fill the gaps in my schedule with my other vocation – speaking engagements and board meetings; traveling the country like a 21st century St. Paul; preaching the truth about reproductive rights.” For Parker, women’s reproductive rights are a “religion” and abortion is that religion’s “gospel.” Parker is one of that religion’s “ministers,” charged with the sacred duties of performing abortions and acting assertively so this “religion’s gospel” is not silenced nor abolished. More specifically, he is convinced that abortion is the “savior” of minority and impoverished women. In the preface of the book, Parker proclaims, “I remain a follower of Jesus and I believe that as an abortion provider, I am doing God’s work.” Parker is persuaded that if only women of color and poor means could gain ready and inexpensive access to abortions, many of the plights that face inner-city America would melt away. ‘The Part of You That Is Like God’ Chooses Abortion To be sure, Parker’s arguments don’t aim to convince anyone who might oppose abortion. Certainly some may be lulled asleep by his shrewd attempts to frame the murder of unborn children as mere medical procedures similar to a surgeon removing a tumor from a cancer patient. Yet what is most striking is that at long last one of the most ardent advocates of abortion has admitted that the entire industry is a religion and must be treated as such to survive. It is a belief system that needs converts. Toward that end, Parker makes this impassioned plea in the final chapter of the book: the miracle of life is not some ordinary meeting of sperm and ovum; a morally neutral, purely biological event; but the agency and responsibility…to participate with God in a creative process. God made the world and sexual reproduction is a part of a collaborative process between a male and a female and between God and humans. If you look at it that way…then the whole business is sacred. A pregnancy that intimates a baby is not more sacred than an abortion. You don’t become sacred like Mary just because you’ve conceived and the termination of a pregnancy is not the resolution of an error. It is merely one of the reproductive outcomes. The God part is in your agency. The trust, the divine trust is that you have an opportunity to participate in the population of the planet. And you have an opportunity not to participate. Is God vested one way or another in whether you as an individual become pregnant? No. Is a pregnancy sacred because there will be a baby ultimately…? No. The part of you that is like God is the part that makes a choice. That says, ‘I choose to’ or ‘I choose not to’; that’s what’s sacred. That’s the part of you that’s like God to me. The procedure room in an abortion clinic is as sacred as any other space to me because that’s where I’m privileged to honor your choice. In this moment… God is meeting both of us, where we are. Every religion identifies a deep problem and offers its solution. For Parker, this world’s problem is that unwanted pregnancies stifle the potential of impoverished, minority women. Fighting to provide free access to abortion will solve this problem. Now where would Parker gain such a notion, especially to posit it squarely within Christianity? Put simply, how could he possibly come to understand abortion as a Christian virtue? That notion comes from none other than the deconstructionist, postmodern theologians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Parker specifically names Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schleiermacher, and Søren Kierkegaard as fundamental to his thinking. To put it simply, this approach to such matters takes on this basic form: 1) study the worldviews and truth claims of the past; 2) question each; 3) determine through reason what portions of each worldview should be retained and discarded given current circumstances; (points 2 and 3 are commonly referred to as “deconstruction”); 4) replace deficient portions of these worldviews with modern solutions (For example: since the ancients didn’t have safe forms of abortion, it was illegal and considered immoral. Now that we can perform reasonably safe abortions, the practice should be legalized and the old “truth” jettisoned.); 5) gain community consensus on the findings; 6) provisionally implement the findings upon the community 7) repeat continually. Parker is an intelligent and studied man. Based on his vast life experience and ability to reason, he has concluded that abortion, while stigmatized, must be embraced in the modern era. Thus, women, particularly minority and impoverished women, need abortions to be freed from oppression. Clearly this has gained consensus from the highest authorities of the American community. In “Life’s Work,” Parker finds that the older argument from Justice Harry Blackmun’s “trimester paradigm” needs to be deconstructed and improved upon. His solution is to transform abortion into a religion complete with a “gospel,” “apostles,” and “saints,” and furthermore to call that religion “Christianity.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2017/05/30/gospel-according-christian-abortionist-willie-parker/",0.9984,0.0016,"male",2012,2012
"114",114,"Oklahoma Lawmakers Shouldn’t Force Abortionists To Post Pro-Life Messages","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-12-21"," As a rule of thumb, pretty much anything that causes abortion supporters to recoil in horror is a good sign. To see this proposed litmus test in action, just check out the reaction of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act Gov. John Kasich signed into law December 13, which caps abortion statewide at 20 weeks. “There’s no way we’re going to take this lying down,” NARAL state spokesman Gabriel Mann told The New York Times. “It’s too horrific of a restriction for women who are facing medical complications and situations where they need an abortion around that 20-week period.”  As a quick primer, high-risk OB-GYNs—in sharp distinction from NARAL’s regional sales managers—consistently testify that abortions are never medically necessary to save the life of a mother. Also keep in mind the bill does contain an exception for the life and health of a mother, which would negate Mann’s argument even if it held any water to begin with. Still, “too horrific,” we’re told. The law, which is set to take effect 90 days following Kasich’s signature, corresponds with a timeframe where medical textbooks and journals teach an unborn child can feel pain while he or she is being aborted. That’s a bridge too far for NARAL, which doesn’t plan to “take this lying down,” even if it means taking its unrighteous indignation all the way to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, abortion-peddlers of the Left are busy hand wringing over the mere possibility of Planned Parenthood losing a portion of its $500 million average cut of the federal kitty—even while a Senate committee is calling in the FBI to investigate the nation’s leading abortion business for its illegal for-profit selling of body parts harvested from aborted babies. A Trace Amount of Validity As reliable as the test may be, however, it does have its limits. Once in a blue moon, abortion advocates’ rage does contain a trace amount of validity to which we should give a moment’s pause. Such is the case, it seems, in Oklahoma, where the state’s Board of Health approved pro-life signage that abortion providers will be forced to post in January 2018. As usual, abortion proponents are hopping mad. The difference seems to be that they may have a point.  Signed into law by Republican Gov. Mary Fallin back in June, the state’s Humanity of the Unborn Child Act is an effort to spread awareness both for the sanctity of human life and the availability of life-affirming alternatives to abortion throughout the state. The legislation proposes to create a website that lists state-approved pro-life pregnancy help, empower public school nurses to better assist pregnant teens—referring them only to pro-life pregnancy centers—and use public service announcements in an effort to move toward “an abortion-free society.” So far so good, in other words. The sticking point is the law’s signage requirement. It currently applies to “each facility in [the] state which is open to the public,” meaning virtually everything from restaurants and bars to hospitals and public schools. But a change from the bill’s sponsor would narrowly tailor it to apply only to the state’s five existing abortion business locations. The signage would read: There are many public and private agencies willing and able to help you carry your child to term and assist you and your child after your child is born, whether you choose to keep your child or to place him or her for adoption. The State of Oklahoma strongly urges you to contact them if you are pregnant. While such a statement is indeed both life-affirming and true, forcing abortion facilities to post it smacks of the very same sort of government-mandated speech pregnancy centers are fighting in both California and Illinois.  In Illinois, medical professionals of all stripes are fighting a 2016 law that would force them to directly refer patients for abortions and counsel them about the so-called “benefits” of abortion. The law in California is markedly similar to the signage proposal in Oklahoma. California’s pro-abortion legislature passed its so-called “Reproductive FACT Act” in 2015. The law, which has been enforced in three cases even as it is being challenged in the courts, requires pro-life pregnancy help centers and medical clinics to post signs in their waiting rooms promoting state-covered abortions. Although the signage in California communicates the opposite message to what’s being proposed in Oklahoma, both states’ mandated language, while true, represents a significant challenge to free speech rights enshrined by the First Amendment. In California and in Oklahoma, the problem isn’t that what the proposed signs say is false, but rather, the signs are the state’s way to force compliance with a certain viewpoint. Go Easy on Regulating Free Speech Weaponizing the state to force speech is a two-edged sword. It may seem like an expedient way to handle business when you’re the one holding the sword, but it can become decidedly inconvenient in a hurry. It’s a tactic of the Left and the abortion lobby to puppeteer others into speaking their own message. Just a year ago, the head of NARAL’s California chapter, Amy Everitt, waved off the First Amendment rights of pro-lifers, admitting to a reporter that her organization “can’t regulate free speech.” She wasn’t finished: “If we could we would, but we can’t.” We have a word for what Everitt is dreaming of: coercion. It’s not a good look on the abortion lobby, and it’s not something the pro-life movement ought to emulate. That’s not to say all mandatory signage is zero sum. What about mandating, for instance, signs that speak to the serious physical and psychological risks abortion poses to women? A recent bombshell released by Americans United for Life (AUL), “Unsafe: How The Public Health Crisis in America’s Abortion Clinics Endangers Women,” tells the story of an abortion industry that callously puts its own profits above the health and safety of women. The 200-page report—covering only 227 abortion providers throughout the U.S.—documents more than 1,400 health and safety violations in the past eight years alone. Instead of going to war to force abortion businesses to advertise for pro-life options, wouldn’t Oklahoma best serve its citizens by alerting them—in that crucial moment—to the incredible risks of abortion? A disclaimer that warns women of the dangers of abortion would preserve free speech by meeting the constitutional standard of viewpoint neutrality. As the nation’s top pro-life state (per AUL), Oklahoma has a perfect opportunity to set the tone for the rest of the nation by bringing desperately needed awareness to the homicidal nonchalance of the abortion industry. This type of information is exactly what pro-life pregnancy centers have relayed to their clients for decades. Unlike highly profitable abortion businesses that often leave out the truth, pregnancy centers, ultrasound-equipped medical clinics, and 24-7 hotlines provide the facts about a baby’s development and the many serious dangers of abortion. Rather than evening the score for the abuses of pro-abortion states like California and Illinois, pro-life states like Oklahoma needs to focus on making sure each woman has all the information she needs to make the healthiest choice for everyone involved in an unexpected pregnancy. That’s surely the intent behind the current disclaimer, but now’s the chance to ensure the safety of Oklahoma moms and babies without turning the abortion wars into the free speech wars.

"115",115,"Michelle Wolf’s Grotesque Abortion Flacking Neither Reflects Women Nor Feminism","Swinford","Sophia",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-07-12"," Despite the psychological and physical suffering abortion continues to cause for so many women around the world, mainstream feminism stands firm in preaching abortion as the height of women’s liberation. In her recent “salute to abortion,” comedian Michelle Wolf encouraged abortion providers to boast of their services, saying, “You’re doing a good thing!” Even more troubling, however, than her complete lack of regard for the suffering abortion causes women was her ignorance of the history of the women’s movement. Like so many mainstream feminists, Wolf seems to view abortion as intrinsic to and inseparable from feminism, as though anti-abortion feminists were a silly invention of recent years. She states, “One of the original slogans for the women’s movement was ‘Abortion on demand,’ and that’s exactly what it should be.”  In fact, pro-life feminists have been around long before abortion became associated with the women’s movement. It was an intrusion of the later sexual revolution. Wolf’s monologue quickly becomes a tirade against men, who are supposedly denying women abortion as a way to control them. Although many take issue with what they perceive as feminism’s tendency to villainize men, the far more troubling fault of the modern hybrid of feminism and sexual liberation is that it encourages women to villainize themselves. In much of mainstream feminism’s preoccupation with sexual and reproductive freedom, the enemy is not men—it’s women. The Battle of the Body In an article for The American Conservative, self-identified feminist Natasha Vargas-Cooper described the female experience: “That [menstrual] blood is a symbol of women’s ongoing war with nature. They use hormones, condoms, copper devices, and all manner of contraception to deny nature’s plans for them. When after 28 days they see their period, they know that they won that month. This is a phenomenon that only women experience. Women with vaginas, women who bleed, and women who have had to battle for the right to defy what nature demands of them.” She goes on to describe these battles as “essential elements” to being a woman, and, in a post- revolution society, she’s not entirely wrong. The message that the sexual revolution has fed women for decades now is that to experience freedom, they must use “hormones, condoms, […] and all manner of contraception” to force their bodies to conform both to their own sexual desires and to the career pathways outlined by and for men.  At the end of her monologue, Wolf exclaims, “And women, don’t forget, you have the power to give life, and men will try to control that. Don’t let them.” Both of these sentiments essentially define women and the female experience by their fertility, an ironic understanding from women who advocate for abortion on the basis that women should be valued for more than their fertility. A woman’s reproductive system is, quite obviously, essentially useless without that of a man, but even so Wolf seems to sense that women have a special relationship to new life. While anti-abortion feminists seek to safeguard the mother and child by refusing to violate this bond, pro-abortion feminists equivocate “the power to give life” with the power to take life, as though an unborn child were their property. The outrage at such an unnatural reversal is nothing new. The women’s movement and abortion began as distinct issues with unrelated goals: the women’s movement sought to bring about political and social equality for women, abortion advocates to prevent overpopulation by promoting “abortion on demand.” So how did these movements become so enmeshed that many can hardly tell the difference? Feminism Versus the Sexual Revolution Although the two movements have become synonymous, there was a time, recent but long-forgotten, in which feminist leaders viewed the sexual revolution as an enemy, rather than ally.  In her memoir “Subverted: How I Helped the Sexual Revolution Hijack the Women’s Movement,” Sue Ellen Browder recounts how the sexual revolution’s parasitic relationship to the women’s movement developed. The pro-abortion movement was spearheaded by co-founder of NARAL Larry Lader, who once said to his co-founder Bernard Nathanson, “If we’re going to move abortion out of the books and into the streets, we’re going to have to recruit the feminists.” Lader spent years convincing Betty Freidan, author of “The Feminine Mystique,” to support abortion as necessary to women’s equality. The original manuscript of her book excluded any support of contraception and abortion. In a 1992 interview, Friedan said, “Women are the people who give birth to children, and that is a necessary value in society. […] Feminism was not opposed to marriage and motherhood.” She went on to say, “Maybe some people still haven’t caught on, but the best sex requires deeper, more profound knowledge of oneself and the other person. In the Bible, sexual love was to know. It suggests something deeper.” However, after many years of persuasion, Friedan eventually did concede to the tenets of the sexual liberation movement, supporting some in her infamous book. But when NOW voted to include abortion in its manifesto, it was voted in by a minority, and the resulting pro-abortion approval cost the organization one-third of its members. One disillusioned member left to found WEAL (Women’s Equality Action League), an anti-abortion feminist organization that notably helped to abolish sex-specific job advertisements, thus opening opportunities for women to apply for positions previously denied them. The belief that women cannot be free until they enjoy commitment-free, consequence-free sex is not only deeply patriarchal (by employing artificial methods to make the female body more similar to a male body), but also casts the female body as the primary obstacle to liberation. Our culture has embraced a sexual revolution that has tricked women into villainizing their own bodies and turned feminism in on itself. The pro-woman stance cannot survive by cannibalizing itself. Pro-life Feminism Has Always Been Here After the exclusion of pro-life feminist organizations from the Women’s March, writer Jessica Valenti mourned the existence of pro-life feminists, stating that feminist leaders had allowed the word “feminism” to get away from them. Although feminists on all sides are well within their rights to argue for and against positions that may be treacherous to the pro-woman movement, her comments beg the question: Who gets to decide what feminism is? Historically, the support of abortion and contraception were never part of the women’s movement until men convinced the feminist leaders of the time to include it. This fact alone ought to call for a reconsideration of the intertwining of the sexual revolution within the feminist movement, one that recognizes once again that these movements are not only distinct in definition but incompatible in content. From the moment abortion was adopted into the women’s movement, pro-life feminists have resisted its inclusion as anti-woman. Even Friedan, who had so decisively ensured the inclusion of abortion and contraception into NOW’s mission statement, later regretted her decision to merge feminism with the sexual revolution. In a lesser-known work “The Second Stage,” she asked the women’s movement to “set aside its divisive anger, stop overemphasizing abortion rights, and reaffirm the importance of the family.” She told a reporter during this time, “The women’s movement […] has come to a dead end. […] Our failure was our blind spot about the family.” The Power to Give Life Power is a strange word. It’s not negative in connotation, but it suggests something significantly more meaningful than mere “ability.” The fact that Wolf seems to understand the weight of a woman’s ability to carry life is encouraging for both the women’s and the pro-life movements, but her insistence on manipulating this power as a way to control others and herself is a violation, not an extension, of this fact. No woman is defined merely by her fertility, but that does not mean an attack on her fertility is to her benefit. The women’s movement and the sexual revolution have created a hybrid that encourages women to attack their own bodies as the enemies of their freedom. This ongoing revolution will continue to feed on the women’s movement until women say enough is enough. Far too late in the game, the feminist movement is finally being forced to reckon with its unanswered questions. Those answers will be the redemption or the end of the women’s movement: What does it mean to be a woman? What does it mean to know the responsibility of womanhood?

"116",116,"Yes, I Really Did See An Ultrasound-Guided Abortion That Made Me Pro-Life","Johnson","Abby",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-04-08"," I left Planned Parenthood nine years ago after assisting in an ultrasound-guided abortion of a 13-week-old fetus. I saw the unborn child struggle for its life against the abortion instruments. I saw the empty uterus on the screen where life had been just moments before. This story is now a major motion picture released in theaters nationwide, called “Unplanned.” While the movie defied industry expectations at the box office, attention has also been drawn to an article written about my story soon after I left the abortion industry. I had never felt the need to respond to the false claims in this story until now.  The Texas Monthly published a story just a few months after I left Planned Parenthood entitled “The Convert.” It’s a biased article from a liberal publication that has been used as the sole source for every other abortion-supporting website to try and debunk my story, most of them outright claiming I never witnessed the ultrasound-guided abortion or that it simply never happened. The article claims there were no 13-week abortions done that day, September 26, 2009. It claims the doctor didn’t use an ultrasound to guide his instruments. But that incorrect information comes only from a sheet of paper from Planned Parenthood, not from an official record from the Texas Department of Health, which would never, under any circumstances, release any reports regarding specific abortions performed at specific clinics, in order to protect patient privacy. In fact, the only abortion data that the Texas Department of Health releases is general information about abortions performed by county, ethnicity, age, and type of abortion performed. Under no circumstance, even an open-records request, would the Texas Department of Health release the induced abortion report for any facility (Texas Health and Safety Code 245.011). The Texas Monthly reporter sent me a form from Planned Parenthood that was used as the basis for the story, which looks like something akin to a bad Excel spreadsheet. Planned Parenthood said this is what was sent to the Texas Department of Health, yet that’s not the correct form at all. The actual form is called the Induced Abortion Reporting form and the state requires it for each abortion appointment, not an Excel document. I was the clinic director for this Planned Parenthood, so it was my job to know this information and how to report abortions.  The form Planned Parenthood claims they sent to the Texas Department of Health also has some glaring disparities. Firstly, it doesn’t even have all the information that must be reported to the state, such as any complications and what type of anesthesia was used. Secondly, the form states that the facility performed a surgical abortion on a four-week old fetus. There is no way that would happen until five weeks of gestation at the very earliest, preferably six weeks, because you have to be able to visibly identify the chorionic villi—“tiny parts of the placenta that are formed from the fertilized egg”—which are usually not visibly present until six weeks. Both this random document and the official Induced Abortion Reporting document never state if an abortion is done with an ultrasound guide. What’s important to them is that the abortion is completed. Ultrasound-guided abortions aren’t common, but the doctor doing them that day at the clinic wanted to do it that way, which is how I ended up holding the probe and witnessing the death of a baby on the screen. The document Planned Parenthood sent the Texas Monthly reporter also shows that it was completed on September 30, 2009. But I didn’t resign as clinic director until October 6, 2009, so this supposed “proof” of a document would have been filled out by me. If I had this big scheme to talk about an abortion that never took place, don’t you think that I would have made sure that this form had a 13-week abortion included? However, I had never seen a form like this in my life, because it didn’t exist. The only form that I was aware of was the Induced Abortion Form that is an official Texas Department of Health document. Understand that Planned Parenthood isn’t great at keeping records and the records they do manage to keep are often not correct or are deceptively altered. Planned Parenthood has been successfully sued many times over for Medicaid fraud, paying millions of dollars back to the government for defrauding taxpayers. Undercover videos shot by Lila Rose and Live Action show Planned Parenthood employees on camera willfully acknowledging they have no problem fudging dates here and there. This isn’t a trustworthy organization.  Another argument that is supposed to prove that my conversion didn’t take place as I said it did was that I did an interview for Planned Parenthood on the Sunday after this ultrasound-guided abortion took place. It was a little show on a local station that was hosted by a pro-choice friend of mine. I had agreed to the interview weeks before, and I had not left Planned Parenthood by that time. An important part of my story is that I didn’t walk out of Planned Parenthood immediately after witnessing the ultrasound-guided abortion. It is made to appear that way in the film, “Unplanned,” because they are trying to fit 10 years of my life into an hour-and-a-half-long movie. But as I explained in my book, after witnessing the abortion, it took me a full week to reach out to the Coalition for Life. I didn’t watch the ultrasound-guided abortion and say to myself, “Well, now I am pro-life.” I didn’t want to be pro-life. I hated the pro-life movement. I had been taught to hate them. I thought they hated me. In fact, for at least 72 hours after witnessing the abortion, I was trying desperately to justify what I had seen. My husband was a special education teacher and I didn’t want to give up my salary, my friends, or my identity. I didn’t know who I would be if I wasn’t an abortion-loving feminist. It was much easier for me, less than 24 hours after witnessing this shocking abortion, to continue on with my job. At that point, I didn’t know if I was going to leave Planned Parenthood. I certainly never thought I would find myself walking into a pro-life office, and I never thought that I would one day be pro-life. If none of my reasons are sufficient responses, consider that I have already been to court against Planned Parenthood and won. They tried to put a gag order on me after I left to ensure I couldn’t tell my story. The judge not only threw out the case but reprimanded them for wasting his time. Since then, I have written a best-selling book talking about my experiences. I have a nationally distributed film whose pivotal scene is the ultrasound-guided abortion. If Planned Parenthood actually had proof that this abortion I witnessed never took place, they would have brought it up when they took me to court. They would have already presented this evidence to the public and most certainly have taken further legal action. But they haven’t, because they know they can’t. They can’t because my story is the truth. ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/08/yes-really-see-ultrasound-guided-abortion-made-pro-life/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"117",117,"Will Any 2020 Democrat Align With Americans On Abortion? ‘In A Word, No’","Griswold","Kylee",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-01-27"," Carl Anderson, the supreme knight of the Catholic organization Knights of Columbus, said the fact that most Americans want significant restrictions on abortion will affect the results of the 2020 election “big time.” In an interview during the 47th annual March for Life, The Federalist asked Anderson whether the left has put forth a candidate in 2020 that could appeal to the majority of Americans, who want abortion restrictions. “In a word, no,” he said.  “Now, the question is always what priority pro-life or abortion is in the campaign. You remember in 2016, it was the most Googled question on Election Day,” he said. “While abortion may not be the most discussed issue in the campaign, most Americans, I’m convinced, will vote for a president on the basis of pro-life or pro-abortion, and I think really — if you look at the polling — candidates who take an extreme pro-abortion position really have a vulnerability that they should look at very carefully.” The Knights of Columbus and Marist released their annual abortion public opinion poll this week, showing that 70 percent of Americans want significant restrictions on abortion, such as limiting it to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, allowing it only in cases of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life, or altogether prohibiting abortion. The poll revealed even 47 percent of people who identify as “pro-choice” want some form of these restrictions. Given that the 2020 election cycle is now in full swing, the most damning abortion poll result may be the fact that 65 percent of Americans will likely vote for a candidate who wants significant restrictions on abortion. This is a problem for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, as the  serious contenders among them have become increasingly extreme on abortion. Former Vice President Joe Biden flip-flopped on the Hyde Amendment after backlash from abortion advocates, meaning he now supports using taxpayer money to fund abortions. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has supported the idea of using abortion as a means of population control to affect climate change, and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg used the Bible to try to justify abortion up until the moment of birth, saying scripture talks about “how life begins with breath.”  Sen. Elizabeth Warren has unveiled detailed policy proposals that are radically pro-abortion, including codifying Roe v. Wade and prohibiting states from enacting abortion restrictions by prompting Congress to pass laws establishing an “affirmative and statutory” right to abortion. Like Biden, Warren also supports funding abortion with taxpayer dollars. Even Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who has at times distinguished herself as a semi-moderate on abortion, says she supports codifying Roe v. Wade, although her campaign is fading. The platforms of the 2020 Democrats starkly contrast the overwhelmingly pro-life record of President Donald Trump, who said during remarks at the March for Life, “Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.” Pro-life advocates have certainly seen gains since the 2016 election, with the appointment of 187 federal judges including two Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who could prove instrumental in deciding key abortion cases before the high court, such as the upcoming June Medical Services v. Gee. The Trump administration also issued a pro-life rule governing Title X taxpayer funding, prohibiting recipients from referring patients for abortion except in instances of rape, incest, or medical emergency. The president has also pledged to veto any legislation Congress advances that “weakens pro-life policies or encourages the destruction of human life.”  “They are coming after me because I’m fighting for you,” Trump said to the crowd of pro-life demonstrators. “And we are fighting for those who have no voice. And we will win because we know how to win.” Despite Trump’s Senate impeachment trial dominating today’s media narrative, new polling shows more Americans think Trump should remain in office than those who believe he should be removed. In fact, Trump’s approval rating has risen to 44 percent, matching the highest rating in his presidency. While Vice President Mike Pence has attended past national marches, this year marks President Trump’s first appearance at the demonstration, making him the first president ever to attend the March for Life. “Every life brings love into this world,” Trump said. “Every person is worth protecting. Every human soul is divine, and every human life born and unborn is made in the holy image of Almighty God.” This year’s March for Life marked 47 years since the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide. The annual march, however, drawing hundreds of thousands of people from across the country, demonstrates that a “right to abortion” is far from settled in the minds of voters. Conservative and liberal organizations have launched opposing campaign efforts aimed at affecting the 2020 election. Planned Parenthood is planning to spend $45 million pushing pro-abortion candidates in local, state, and national races, up from the nearly $30 million the organization spent in its successful 2018 election cycle. The organization is targeting 5 million voters across the country, directing its efforts at nine pivotal states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, New Hampshire, and North Carolina. The pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, on the other hand, has planned a $41 million effort to support Trump and other anti-abortion candidates in 2020, in an attempt “to aggressively challenge, erode, and finally, overturn Roe v. Wade,” according to SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. It is “fundamentally unjust,” said Anderson, “to intentionally kill an innocent human being. And the majority of Americans see that, and the majority of Americans realize the injustice that Roe v. Wade inherently is.” “For us, our message is choose life,” Anderson said. “You’ll never regret that.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/27/will-any-2020-democrat-align-with-americans-on-abortion-in-a-word-no/",0.0073,0.9927,"female",2012,2012
"118",118,"Mainstream Media Misses The Story Behind U.S. Abortion Decline","New","Michael","J.",NA,NA,NA,"2019-09-27"," Last Tuesday, the Guttmacher Institute released updated U.S. abortion data for 2017 showing that America’s abortion decline continues. Overall, the U.S. abortion rate fell by approximately 20 percent between 2011 and 2017. Furthermore, the decline was widespread, with 45 of 50 U.S. states reporting declining rates. Considering the salience of abortion as a public policy issue this year, it is unsurprising that Guttmacher’s new data received a great deal of media coverage. On Wednesday morning, the five U.S. newspapers with the largest online circulation, USA Today, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times, all ran stories about America’s ongoing abortion decline.  However, the mainstream media’s reporting on this new data left a great deal to be desired. Of these five newspapers, only one provided any quotes from a pro-lifer. The New York Times did include some commentary by Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel of Americans United for Life. Other prominent media outlets including The Hill and CNN also covered Guttmacher’s new abortion data without publishing any analysis from pro-lifers. Instead, the mainstream media, with very few exceptions, uncritically reported Guttmacher’s analysis of the declining abortion numbers. Unsurprisingly, Guttmacher argued that the recent abortion decline had little to do with pro-life laws or reductions in sexual activity — and was instead largely due to greater use of contraceptives. The Flaws in Guttmacher’s Analysis Of course, Guttmacher’s analysis of the new data is largely superficial. It compares the 32 U.S. states that recently enacted pro-life laws to the 18 states that did not enact pro-life legislation. It found the fraction of states in each group that experienced abortion rate declines was relatively similar. Guttmacher pays little attention, however, to the types of pro-life laws that were being enacted. Furthermore, Guttmacher dismisses research that shows a decline in sexual activity, despite the fact that the Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the National Survey of Family Growth both show long-term declines in percentage of teens who have been sexually active. Most importantly, Guttmacher only considers the change in the U.S. abortion rate from 2011 to 2017. Six years is a relatively short time with which to properly analyze changes in demographics, behavior, or public policy.  Instead, when analyzing America’s long-term abortion rate decline, a different picture emerges. In the United States, the abortion rate increased sharply after the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. The U.S. abortion rate peaked in 1980, however, and has been declining fairly steadily ever since. Overall, between 1980 and 2017, the U.S. abortion rate has fallen by more than 53 percent. Interestingly, during this time period, the unintended pregnancy rate in the United States has fluctuated. In fact, Guttmacher’s own data shows that the U.S. unintended pregnancy rate actually increased between 2001 and 2008 — a timespan during which the abortion rate continued to decline. As such, increases in contraception use are, at best, an incomplete explanation for the significant long-term decline in the abortion rate. A far better explanation for the long-term decline in this country’s abortion rate is that a higher percentage of unintended pregnancies are being carried to term. Guttmacher’s own data shows that in 1981, almost 54 percent of unintended pregnancies resulted in an abortion. That number fell to 42 percent in 2011. Mainstream media outlets that have covered America’s abortion decline have almost completely overlooked this fact. The Efficacy of Pro-Life Activism Indeed, the fact that a higher percentage of unintended pregnancies are being carried to term shows pro-life efforts have been effective. If more women are choosing life for their unborn children, pro-lifers are either 1) changing hearts and minds, 2) providing assistance to pregnant women, or 3) passing protective pro-life laws. Pro-lifers have enjoyed success in each of these activities during the past 30 years.  Indeed, since 1995, Gallup surveys show a significant increase in the percentage of individuals identifying as “pro-life.” According to Gallup, in 1995 only 33 percent of Americans identified as “pro-life.” But the most recent Gallup poll taken in July 2019 found that 49 percent of Americans say they are “pro-life” — a plurality. Additionally, data from the General Social Survey shows increasing opposition to abortion among young adults. Heartbeat International’s data shows that the number of organizations offering assistance to pregnant women increased by 86 percent between 1988 and 2015. Finally, there has been a significant increase in the number of state-level pro-life laws enacted since the early 1990s. Furthermore, a body of academic research shows a range of pro-life laws, including public funding limits, parental involvement laws, and properly designed informed consent laws all reduce abortion rates. This year, abortion has been an exceptionally salient policy issue. Efforts in liberal states to legalize abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy and efforts in conservative states to enact legal protections for the unborn have galvanized activists on both sides of the debate. Furthermore, the confirmations of both Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court have increased the likelihood that the court will uphold legislation that would protect the preborn. As such, accurate analysis of abortion trends has the potential to inform this debate. Good analysis might provide insights about policy strategies that are most effective at protecting preborn children, so it is unfortunate that when new abortion data was released, a vast majority of mainstream media outlets simply chose to parrot the claims of a pro-abortion advocacy group. Their unwillingness to provide balanced commentary and analysis does a real disservice to everyone involved with this debate.

"119",119,"Virginia Ignores Abortionists That Treat Women Worse Than Cattle","Freund","Chris",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-12-01"," In October, New Jersey revoked the medical license of Dr. Steven Brigham after state officials found Brigham guilty on several counts of gross negligence, deception, and official misconduct. This could cause Brigham’s New Jersey abortion centers to close down. This isn’t Brigham’s first run-in with public health officials or the law. He’s lost his medical license in several states, and has become infamous for operating abortion centers, although many states are working to drive him out of business. In 2004, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, home of the notorious abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, banned Brigham from operating abortion centers in that state. He’s even drawn the pseudo-ire of the “mainstream” abortion industry.  Not so in the Old Dominion. In fact, under the leadership of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Attorney General Mark Herring, Brigham is not only welcomed to the state with open arms, but McAuliffe and Herring are working overtime to ensure that Brigham and those like him are protected from any scrutiny at all. All the while, public health officials seem to be ignoring signs that Brigham’s two abortion centers here in the Commonwealth are no better—if not worse—than those places like New Jersey have sought to shut down, and instead have granted him lenience from health and safety standards that already exist. We Don’t Need No Stinkin’ Protections for Women If McAuliffe gets his way, those basic standards will go away, too. In May of this year, McAuliffe announced plans to try to undo Virginia’s abortion center health and safety standards adopted less than a year prior. McAuliffe, to a throng of exuberant media and with representatives of NARAL Pro-Choice and Planned Parenthood at his side, issued a “directive” requiring the Virginia Board of Health to begin an “immediate” review of standards. Calling standards such as regular inspections by public health officials, infection control policies, medical industry sterilization standards, and requirements that abortion center staffs be trained “extreme and punitive,” McAuliffe began paying back an abortion industry that spent nearly $2 million getting him elected. States that are far bluer than Virginia—like New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware—have sought to hold abortion doctors or centers accountable to basic health standards because of the likes of Brigham. In the months since McAuliffe’s directive, Virginia health Commissioner Marissa Levine has been reviewing the standards and is preparing to make recommendations for massive changes at the next Virginia Board of Health meeting on December 4. The board, members of which are gubernatorial appointees, will have to decide that day whether to pursue Levine’s recommendations or ignore the governor’s demand and keep the standards as they are. Remarkably, states that are far bluer than even Virginia—like New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware—have sought to hold abortion doctors or centers accountable to basic health standards because of the likes of Brigham. But Virginians watch McAuliffe and his cohorts try to gut health standards.  Use Our Bloody, Unsterilized Medical Equipment All this, while in the two years since initial standards were adopted, inspections by public health officials of Virginia’s 18 abortion centers have uncovered more than 400 health and safety violations, including bloody and unsterilized equipment, untrained staffs, violations of parental consent laws, and much more. While the abortion industry claims it now supports “reasonable regulations,” as late as 2011 when the Virginia legislature passed a requirement that abortion center standards be adopted, those same industry powerhouses like Planned Parenthood and NARAL argued against legislation that would have required only inspections, licensing, and emergency life-saving equipment. In two years, inspections by public health officials of Virginia’s 18 abortion centers have uncovered more than 400 health and safety violations, including bloody and unsterilized equipment, untrained staffs, and violations of parental consent laws. Some of the findings by public health inspectors have been startling. The Federalist editor Mollie Hemingway wrote recently about the disgusting conditions at one facility, but there are others, as well. At the Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic: “On 7/19/12 the following observations were made: the attending physician was sitting at a desk reading the newspaper. He put the paper away when the patient arrived. The physician interviewed the patient. The staff escorted the patient to the exam room. The physician went into the room … The physician put on gloves and preceded to perform a vaginal ultrasound of the patient. Once the procedure had been completed the physician told the patient to get dressed and he would see her outside the exam room … The physician picked up the patient’s medical record and began to make notations. He removed a prescription pad from a drawer. At no time was the physician observed washing his hands or performing hand hygiene. The observations were pointed out to the physician who stated, ‘I was not doing a procedure, only an ultrasound. If I had been doing a procedure I certainly would have washed my hands.’ The above information was discussed with the administrator who stated, ‘He never washes his hands, he always uses gloves.’ When it was pointed out that sometimes the gloves may have holes in them the administrator stated, ‘Oh! That is gross!’” We’ll Just Stop Reporting Our Gross Violations of Women’s Rights At Brigham’s Virginia Beach abortion center, during a March 2014 inspection Virginia public health officials discovered that for 36.6 percent of patients that had medical abortions (example, through RU-486) in January 2014, a second medication or surgical procedure was required to complete the abortion. That’s a remarkable failure rate. RU-486 is only to be used until 49 days gestation and, if used according to Food and Drug Administration guidelines, has an 8 percent failure rate. The farther along in gestation a woman is, the more likely it is that RU-486 will fail. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, statistics indicate there is a 17 percent failure rate at 50-55 days, and a 23 percent failure rate at 57-63 days. Virginia Women’s Wellness’ rate of 36.6 percent failure is over four times the average. Its plan to correct the problem: “These cases will no longer be documented in the complication log.”  Clearly, a 14-year-old who by statute is the victim of a crime falls within the category of an abused or neglected child. According to a February 25, 2013 inspection report, the Roanoke Medical Center for Women performed abortions on three minors without evidence of parental consent. Two of these patients were 14 years of age when the abortion was performed and under Virginia law, having carnal knowledge of a 14-year-old is a crime. Licensed physicians including both the abortionist and the state health commissioner are mandatory reporters for suspected child abuse and neglect. Clearly, a 14-year-old who by statute is the victim of a crime falls within the category of an abused or neglected child. It is especially alarming because this occurred along the I-81 corridor, where sex trafficking is a concern. Yet no one ever reported any crime and, in the time since, Attorney General Herring has issued a legal opinion relieving abortion doctors and Department of Health inspectors of some of their reporting responsibility. At the same abortion center, an earlier inspection found: “Staff used … a sponge to clean the procedure jars and failed to disinfect procedure jars and stoppers between patients … failure to disinfect three (3) of three recovery cots between patients and one (1) of one lab chair… observation revealed one of the vacutainer needle holders had visible dark red splatter within the hub, which attached to the needle to draw the patient’s blood.” Most recently, an inspection report obtained by The Family Foundation of Virginia through the Freedom of Information Act uncovered violations of federal drug laws by the Charlottesville Medical Center for Women, one of four abortion centers in Virginia owned and operated by Dr. William Fitzhugh. This in addition to multiple violations of basic health and safety standards, including the use of Schedule II narcotics without any staff being trained in advance cardiac life support. Public health officials discovered that the doctor at the facility has been dispensing narcotics without a valid Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) license, which records indicated had expired two years ago (his attorney claims he has a license but didn’t present one at the September Board of Health meeting), and staff at the facility were improperly interacting with and keeping no records of Schedule II narcotics, and transporting drugs with no accountability or license. Federal laws require very specific record-keeping and use of Schedule II narcotics (which include cocaine and methamphetamines), and any doctor who dispenses or handles these kinds of drugs improperly can have their medical license suspended or revoked. Truth: Abortionists Care About Money, Not Women Yet when a report about the violation of DEA regulations was submitted to the Virginia Board of Medicine, the body that has oversight of medical licenses, it refused to take action, stating that, because the inspection report didn’t name the doctor, its hands were tied. Records show, however, that there is only one doctor associated with that particular abortion center: William Fitzhugh. Regardless, how hard would it have been for someone at the Board of Medicine to call the Department of Health to find out which doctor was breaking federal and state drug laws? Or, because it’s abortion, do they simply not care? Having to spend money to train staff and clean their instruments isn’t part of the abortion business model, but paying to have politicians like Terry McAuliffe cover up their actions is. Unfortunately, few Virginians are aware of what has been found in Virginia’s abortion centers because, not surprisingly, the media here has chosen to completely ignore the inspection reports that revealed these violations (you can read more about what inspections uncovered here, here, here, and here). Instead, the media works with the abortion industry to distract people with rhetorical concerns about required “construction standards” that abortion centers can avoid through variances granted by the Commissioner of Health. For years, the abortion industry in Virginia argued that its facilities are safe and not in need of inspections or regulations. But inspections that have taken place have proven that that industry is incapable of policing itself. Simply put, the abortion industry cannot be trusted. It is corrupt, deceitful, and cares little about “women’s health.” It cares about its financial bottom line, and having to spend money to train staff and clean their instruments isn’t part of the business model, but paying to have politicians like Terry McAuliffe cover up their actions is. One wonders: if Kermit Gosnell had his facility in Virginia, would anyone here care?

"120",120,"Biden And The FDA Push New Chemical Abortion Protocols That Endanger Women","Abbamonte","Jonathan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-01-24"," President Biden is bringing to bear the full institutional power of the federal government to promote access to dangerous chemical abortion pills.



A White House memo released on Sunday directed the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, and Attorney General Merrick Garland to issue guidance telling patients and pharmacies how they can obtain chemical abortion pills in states where abortion is either illegal or restricted. The president has also called on federal departments and agencies to draw up recommendations for removing “potential barriers” to abortion pill access.



Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally dropped the requirement that abortion pills be administered, in person, by qualified medical personnel. It also moved to allow pharmacies to fill prescriptions for the pill — a seismic change in policy that could soon turn your local pharmacy into an abortion pill dispensary.



Both changes endanger women’s health.



Abortion with pills involves taking two different drugs in succession. The first drug, mifepristone, typically kills the unborn child by blocking essential progesterone. The second drug, misoprostol, induces contractions to expel the unborn child from its mother’s womb. Both drugs carry risks.



The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 but considered the drug’s risk profile so high as to warrant special heightened monitoring and risk management practices. The agency, therefore, established a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program — a strict protocol governing the administration of mifepristone.



To prescribe the drug, doctors had to meet special requirements. These included the ability to accurately assess the gestational age of the unborn child, the ability to diagnose ectopic pregnancies, and the ability to surgically remove tissue from an incomplete abortion or provide access to emergency resuscitation treatment if necessary. The REMS originally also required two mandatory in-person visits by the patient for administering the two-drug abortion pill regimen as well as a mandatory follow-up visit to ensure no serious complications resulted. Doctors were also originally required to report all serious adverse events to the FDA.



But in 2016, the FDA started allowing non-physicians who met the qualifications to begin prescribing mifepristone. They also removed the requirement for in-person office visits or physical exams prior to having an abortion, keeping only a mandatory follow-up visit in place. The requirement that the pill be administered in person by a certified prescriber remained.



That changed with the pandemic. In July 2020, the FDA temporarily suspended the requirements for in-person administration of the pill and a mandatory follow-up visit. The FDA’s January update of the mifepristone REMS makes these pandemic-era changes permanent.



Additionally, the FDA is moving to expand access to abortion by allowing pharmacies to fill prescriptions for abortion pills. Retail pharmacy giants CVS and Walgreens and online pharmacy Honeybee Health have announced their intent to sell them in states where abortion is legal.



This is all bad news not just for the unborn, but also for women’s health.



Risks of Removing Mandatory Follow-Up Exams



By removing the mandatory follow-up visit requirement, the FDA has made it optional for abortionists to check for post-abortion complications.



That is not because post-abortion complications are not happening. Indeed, abortion pills have more complications than surgical abortion. A study of Swedish women from 2008-2015 found that, on average, 7.3 percent of women had a post-abortion complication such as excessive bleeding, incomplete abortion, or infections after using the abortion pill within 12 weeks of gestation. By comparison, the complication rate for surgical abortion was 5.3 percent.



In the U.S., a recent study in states where Medicaid dollars are used to pay for elective abortions found that Medicaid-eligible women using the abortion pill had a 53 percent greater odds of making an abortion-related visit to the ER than similar women who had surgical abortions.



If we assume women today experience serious complications from the pill at the same rate as seen during U.S. clinical trials, that would put the number of women admitted to the hospital for pill-related reasons between 197 and 2,958 a year.



Risks of Removing the In-Person Pill Administration Requirement



The FDA-updated REMS also makes it optional for abortionists to conduct physical exams prior to prescribing these dangerous drugs. Yet, without an exam, it is not possible to effectively screen for ectopic pregnancies — a potentially life-threatening condition if not detected and treated in time.



The FDA warns that women should not take mifepristone if they have an ectopic pregnancy. But an in-person physical examination using ultrasound, bloodwork, or laparoscopy is needed to rule out the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy, according to Medscape.



Symptoms of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, such as prolonged or heavy bleeding and abdominal pain, can be similar to the side effects of taking the abortion pill. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures after taking the abortion pill, the woman may mistake this potentially life-threatening condition as “normal” side effects. Consider, also, that most pill-induced abortions are done at home with no knowledgeable medical staff on call. For the unfortunate few who could find themselves in this situation, this is a recipe for disaster.



Americans should demand answers as to why the FDA has made the abortion pill riskier for women. Congress should demand answers as well, using its oversight powers to hold the FDA accountable. The more fundamental question, of course, is: Why has the FDA authorized a drug that is designed to kill unborn children in the first place?



Pro-life Americans should move their prescriptions to their local grocery store or non-mifepristone-dispensing pharmacies.

"121",121,"How To Make Abortion Less Profitable For Planned Parenthood","Krumholz","Willis","L.",NA,NA,NA,"2020-01-24"," Two pro-life billboards were taken down in St. Paul, after the billboard stand owner—who remains unknown—threatened the billboard company, Clear Channel, that the stand owner would not renew the lease with Clear Channel unless the billboards were taken down. One billboard gave the website and number for abortion pill reversal (877-558-0333), and another the phone number and website for women facing an unplanned pregnancy, OptionLine.org (800-712-4357). Both advertisements were taken out by Pro-Life Action Ministries (PLAM).  PLAM strategically placed the billboards right next to Planned Parenthood’s St. Paul megaclinic, which performs well more than 6,000 abortions per year. Around 40 percent of these abortions are chemically induced, via the abortion pill regimen. City Pages, a far-left outlet based in Minneapolis, ran a hit piece on the billboards, which may have led to their removal. The City Pages article repeated false information about abortion pill reversal, characterizing the abortion pill regimen as completely safe, while claiming pill reversal is incredibly dangerous. Actually, reversal is much less-dangerous than liberal media have suggested, and the “normal” abortion-pill regimen endangers women. And while no women have died from pill reversal, 24 women have died from the abortion pill regimen, while thousands have been injured. It’s quite possible that the pro-life billboards were beginning to bug Planned Parenthood financially. One wonders how much the local Planned Parenthood affiliate, Planned Parenthood North Central States, coordinates with City Pages.  Planned Parenthood Prefers to Work In the Dark Planned Parenthood operates under a franchise-franchisee model. The national organization handles marketing and broad political activities, while local franchisees, or affiliates—including Planned Parenthood of North Central States (PPNCS)—conduct day-to-day “operations.” These local affiliates are extremely sensitive to basic economics, and are cost-sensitive. They are financially independent from the parent, and must break even on their own. If they do more than break even, they get to pay staff more and offer better benefits. They also depend heavily on abortion. Assuming abortion only costs $500, and the margin (revenue after cost) for abortion is 20 percent—an extremely conservative estimate—the percent of affiliate revenue after expenses that comes from abortion is 35 percent. If the margin on abortion is 40 percent, which is certainly within the realm of possibility, affiliate revenue after expenses from abortion is 75 percent (click here for an explanation of how this number, which certainly wasn’t published by Planned Parenthood, was arrived at). The affiliate revenue after expenses that comes from abortion is probably on the high end both because clinics face little competition, largely due to regulatory pressures, and because while chemical abortion costs around $500-600, surgical abortions—around 60 percent of abortions—cost around $1,000 in the first trimester alone.  Not only do clinics depend heavily on abortion for profit, the other side of the profit equation has led affiliates like PPNCS to opt for megaclinics, like the one in St. Paul, in order to achieve better economies of scale and cut costs further. According to an insider, affiliates have abortion targets and budgets, and aim to have a woman on and off the table in around 5 minutes in order to maximize clinic “productivity.” Because of this crazy, laser-focus on abortion, Planned Parenthood franchisees do a bad job at what they claim in advertising they do—provide birth control. And because women who frequent these clinics don’t have many choices, Planned Parenthood can continue to do a substandard job at providing birth control. In fact, Planned Parenthood’s target customer, young unmarried women who are disproportionately black American women, may help explain the high abortion rate among black Americans—which should be seen as a national crisis. Critics say this is because of a lack of access to birth control, but Planned Parenthood is the organization supposedly providing this demographic birth control access. In other words, the City Pages hit, and Planned Parenthood not liking the billboards, is not just about a disagreement over a controversial issue. It’s about money. What Can Lawmakers Do? Time to crack down on the perverse profit motive. For starters, policymakers can continue to pass laws that increase the costs to Planned Parenthood affiliates. One example is a law requiring ultrasound use during the abortion procedure. This would hit franchisees’ bottom line, and make the procedure safer for women. States should also require mandatory reporting at emergency rooms, to track how often a woman is admitted with leftover remnants of the fetus in her womb, often due to an abortion performed by a hurried doctor (with a profit motive). Clinics that send women to the E.R. should face stiff penalties, and ultimately closure. Another example is laws that require increased oversight and warnings about chemical abortions, which Planned Parenthood is attempting to at least partially shift toward, probably because of the higher margins involved. Another solution still is more birth control providers to poor women who don’t offer or refer abortions, and thus don’t have an extreme financial incentive to guide customers toward abortion. Finally, too many U.S. abortions are subsidized by taxpayers. That’s because, while federal Medicaid doesn’t broadly fund abortion, 16 states direct Medicaid to pay for all or most abortions. Nine of these states do so because of a court order. In Minnesota, taxpayers fund more than 4,000 abortions per year. The Trump administration laudably ended Planned Parenthood’s access to Title X, but the big money comes from Medicaid. To the extent possible, the administration should look to crack down on federal Medicaid funding to abortion providers, and foster greater access to birth control providers who don’t provide abortion.

"122",122,"Study Says Women Feel Great After Having Abortions","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-07-15"," You know that weird thing when people fund studies that propagate their interests, then have a big party when the study turns to totally promote their interests? It happens in more industries than it should and more often than it should. While it’s definitely frowned upon, especially in the business or political world, what about when it comes to a cultural issue like abortion? A study just published called “Decision Rightness and Emotional Responses to Abortion in the United States: A Longitudinal Study” set out to find out if women feel happy or sad after an abortion, for up to three years later. It concluded that 99 percent of “[w]omen experienced decreasing emotional intensity over time, and the overwhelming majority of women felt that termination was the right decision for them over three years.”  Groups like ThinkProgress  are having dance parties. You would too if you sold, say cigarettes, and a study claimed smoking was as healthy as eating blueberries. But they should think twice before busting any moves. I mean, I’m no PhD, but common sense says if a survey concludes nearly 100 percent for anything or anyone at any time it’s bunk, right? No product, no person, no experience has a 100 percent satisfaction rate—not even sex or looking at cute pictures of baby kittens. So immediately, to most people with a brain, this study—and those who collected and analyzed the data for the rest of us pedestrians—has lost credibility. Even your average megalomaniac, banana republic tyrant isn’t so brazen as to say 99 percent of the population supports him. But in case you’re one of the few who doubts a nearly 100 percent approval rating, here are a few more chinks in the armor. Study Was Funded by Abortion Advocates As with Hansel and Gretel, who followed a trail of crumbs to a sweet haven full of deceit and heartache, the study’s money trail leads to a destination that’s just as revealing, manipulative, and deceitful. To start with, the study was supported by a gift from several organizations, including the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation, both Planned Parenthood donors. Shocking! The researchers say they “used data from the Turnaway study,” which was funded by Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH). One of the researchers is from the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. Guess who that organization donates money to? If you guessed Planned Parenthood, you get a gold star! ANSIRH, for those who are wondering, also produces an “Early Abortion Training Workbook” which includes a picture on their website of a woman practicing an abortion by stabbing a papaya.  .@JuddLegum The Bixby Center, which houses ANSIRH, doesn’t get *any* support or funding from Planned Parenthood? Bless your heart.
— Sean Davis (@seanmdav) July 13, 2015 Supporters of the study, on Twitter, would have you believe the researchers are merely academics and the organization is merely a think tank. Nonsense. Like Bob Dylan said, everybody’s “gotta serve somebody.” Nearly every single foundation or researcher related to this study has a vested interest in groups that either support or perform abortions. Any other conclusion is simply ignorant. @seanmdav They are an academic institution working on science
 — Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) July 13, 2015  We Know Many Women Regret Their Abortions The study’s findings have to be surprising, or at least confusing, even to many abortion advocates who admit many women struggle emotionally following an abortion. In The Atlantic in 2013, Prisca Lecroy wrote how, after choosing to have an abortion, Lecroy’s mother says she experienced “unrelenting tears, guilt, shame, and depression.” This piece in Slate piggybacked off Lecroy’s experience, claiming it wasn’t representative of how most women feel. “Some women experience sadness and guilt, but they’re more likely to feel relief and happiness…The emotional fallout from an abortion also needs to be understood in the context of a woman’s range of options when an unwanted pregnancy hits.” Many abortion advocates admit many women struggle emotionally following an abortion. User Katebyard writing at Sherights says she regrets her abortion, but is still pro-choice. She describes the agonizing choice to end her pregnancy, due to pressure from the baby’s father and other chaotic life circumstances at the time, although she believes women should be free to choose abortion. “The weeks, months, and years after my termination were a downward spiral in terms of my mental health; every period I had and every child I saw was a violent reminder. I ended up attempting suicide and being sectioned.” Colleen Tronson had multiple abortions before a change of heart propelled her to encourage women to follow a different path. She is now the director of the Minneapolis-based Metro Women’s Center, a place that counsels women considering abortion. She said it’s normal in any “crisis situation” to feel relief: “Many women do not struggle with the aftermath of an abortion decision until many, many years later.” As a labor companion, she’s seen women who experience abortion flashbacks during labor, complicating the process. “Feeling emotionally fine is not a good indication of future problems related to the decision,” she says.  Poor Methods and Conflicting Results The study says “We recruited a cohort of women seeking abortions between 2008-2010.” Say what? You recruited (less than 1,000) women? I’d be curious to know how the “recruitment” process worked. Were women who expressed negative feelings about their abortions screened out? If you smell sophistry, it’s probably there. It’s like when you’re going out: You don’t ask your super-skinny, always-has-it-together friend if you look good. You ask your boyfriend or husband—who has a vested interest in responding positively—if you look like the smokin’ hot babe that you are. I’d be curious to know how the ‘recruitment’ process worked. Second, the study makes a slight, albeit important distinction between regretting an abortion and feeling negative emotions when thinking of the abortion after the fact. “Women with more planned pregnancies and who had more difficulty deciding to terminate the pregnancy had lower odds of reporting the abortion was the right decision […] Both negative and positive emotions declined over time.” But if 95 to 99 percent of women reported no negative feelings of the abortion, how can their nonexistent feelings also decline? Even the study admits it might be flawed: “Because no formal measures of abortion emotions exist, the scales we used may not have validly captured women’s emotions. Although the emotions we examined were similar to those assessed in prior studies [6, 7, 12], they were not necessarily the most relevant aspects of the abortion experience […] Asking participants biannually about their emotions and how often they thought about the abortion may have led to higher reported levels of all outcomes than otherwise would have existed” (page 12). They even say “the relatively low participation rate might raise concerns about selection bias.” You can almost hear the researchers sighing, Welp! Too late now, suckas! Study’s Conclusion and Thus Its Purpose Is Deceptive The study admits its findings seem unusual. “The typical participant, however, had >99% chance of reporting that the abortion was right for her over three years, and her negative emotions subsided over time. These findings differ from those of the only other large-scale US prospective study, which found that negative emotions increased, and satisfaction with the abortion decision decreased slightly, over two years” (page 10). ThinkProgress says this study should “end the debate about whether women should regret having abortions.” Tronson doesn’t seem surprised how abortion promoters will use these results: “[W]hy would they not want to claim that their services provide only happy customers? It is in their best interest to make the public believe that everyone (99%) leave feeling satisfied. The ‘buyers’ remorse’ of an abortion experience would not be good marketing.” No doubt the results of this study will be passed around Planned Parenthood offices nationwide, probably on a nifty little postcard, reassuring women that their (recruited) peers didn’t feel bad about abortions, so neither should they. At best, this study was funded by groups who want to manipulate the national debate and stigma over abortions. At worst, the obviously skewed results will be propagated to present a misleading, if not entirely false, picture of the aftermath of a choice that actually leaves devastating consequences for women and babies alike.

"123",123,"How Amy Mendoza Reversed Her Abortion Then Gave Birth To A Beautiful Boy","Burton Brown","Kristi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-10-11"," When Amy Mendoza had a change of heart the day after she swallowed an abortion pill, a word she’d seen on Facebook flashed through her mind: “reversal.” She recalled a story she’d read on social media about another woman who had saved her baby’s life using abortion reversal. Amy couldn’t remember all the details and didn’t even know if she could try abortion reversal, but she knew she had to find out. She also knew she couldn’t turn to Planned Parenthood. The Planned Parenthood facility in Boulder, Colorado, had already instructed Amy that once she took the first abortion pill, her decision couldn’t be changed. She says Planned Parenthood told her she had to take the second pill.  How a Chemical Abortion Reversal Works The abortion pill, also known as medication abortion or chemical abortion—and very different from the “morning after pill”—is a two-step process. The first pill in the process stops a woman’s body from producing progesterone, a hormone needed to support and nurture the growing child in her womb. The second pill, taken one to two days later, causes her uterus to contract to expel her now-dead child. A former abortionist, Dr. Anthony Levatino, explains the abortion pill process in more detail in a video here. There is a window of time, after a woman takes the first pill and before she takes the second pill, to “reverse” the effects of the abortion pill-induced absence of progesterone by adding this necessary, natural hormone back into her body. The type of progesterone used in abortion reversal is known as “natural” or “bioidentical progesterone” because it is the same kind the woman’s body naturally produces. Ob-Gyns often use progesterone to preserve the pregnancies of women who have suffered repeated miscarriages. Its safe use in pregnancy has been established for decades. While the use of progesterone specifically to reverse an abortion is innovative, as far as science goes, its effectiveness is really nothing new. Mendoza shudders when she holds her healthy son and wonders what would have happened to her and to him if she had never seen the term “abortion reversal” and done her own Google search to find help. Amy’s search led her to Bella Natural Women’s Care. This health center has three offices in Colorado and focuses on innovative health care for women that also supports the lives of their children. Bella was able to give Amy the quick care she needed to reverse her abortion and the longer-term care she needed to give birth to her son.  You Can Act on Your Regret Unlike Planned Parenthood’s deceptive admonition, Bella acknowledges that when a woman regrets her original choice for abortion, she deserves information on other science-based options. Planned Parenthood left Amy with one option: swallow the second abortion pill. Amy believes Planned Parenthood’s instructions to her were part of the staff’s normal process—one that firmly stops a woman’s right to reconsider abortion. Even those who advocate for “choice” can readily acknowledge that a real choice should include the option to change one’s mind. If a woman can choose to have an abortion, why should she not be allowed to choose to stop that abortion, especially when science has declared the method safe and when 350 qualified doctors stand ready to help a woman who wants to take this option? Perhaps Planned Parenthood avoids the scientific reality of abortion pill reversal for a more ideological reason. Acknowledging that some abortions, once begun, can still be stopped requires acknowledging that a living child will now be born. Without the intervention of abortion reversal, this same child would be dead. And while abortion reversal saved his life, the abortion pill, as prescribed by Planned Parenthood, would have ended it, if followed through to its final conclusion. Abortion reversal forces Planned Parenthood to look at the faces of babies—sweet, chubby-faced babies just like Amy’s son—whose lives they attempted to end. That may be too hard a pill to swallow.

"124",124,"If Abortion Providers Cared About Women, They Wouldn’t Fight Abortion Safety At The Supreme Court","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-03-03"," Fearing a case that goes all the way to the Supreme Court and overturns Roe v. Wade—which would leave abortion’s legality up to each state—pro-abortion politicians across the country are working to enshrine abortion in individual state laws.
Most of the proposed state-level laws follow the template of New York’s so-called Reproductive Health Act, which was passed in 2019 on the 46th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and eliminated virtually all restrictions on abortion in New York. The RHA makes abortion legal at any time, including the last trimester of pregnancy, allows abortions to be performed by medical practitioners who are not doctors, and removed abortion from the criminal code.
The latter change means prosecutors can no longer prosecute charges of second-degree murder in cases where an attack on a pregnant woman leads to the death of her unborn child.
The abortion extremists pushing these state laws typically advocate abortion through all nine months of pregnancy and even support infanticide if an unborn baby survives. They want us to believe they’re working in the best interests of women. Looking at the facts, that’s far from the truth.
On March 4, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case of June Medical Services v. Russo, which challenges Louisiana’s Act 620. That act, which is crucial for women’s health, requires that abortion providers are located within 30 miles of a hospital so women can get prompt medical care if anything goes wrong during the procedure.
Act 620 does nothing to limit access to abortion, yet its opponents refer to as a “restrictive” abortion law putting undue burden on women seeking abortions. As one of the more than 2,500 women plaintiffs in an amicus brief regarding this case, I find it ironic that abortion providers are the ones who insist they are speaking for women.
The very people who make their money performing abortions, and would be the ones responsible if an abortion goes wrong, are objecting to precautions that could mean the difference between life and death for women.
As someone who has actually experienced the detrimental effects of abortion and has been working with other women for more than 20 years—many of whom have been injured, emotionally and physically, as a result of abortion—these are the last people I want speaking for me and other women.
Although the pro-abortion side doesn’t like to acknowledge it, women still die from abortion-related complications every year. Others suffer serious damage to the cervix, perforation of the uterus, infections, and hemorrhaging.
Those problems are separate from the psychological impact, which for many women includes depression and suicidal ideation. Statistics are hard to come by because the official line is that women suffer no deleterious psychological or emotional effects from abortion. It’s a cruel irony when people who claim to advocate for women are the very same people gaslighting women by telling them their feelings aren’t valid or real.
Women who get abortions are everywhere. They are our mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends. Why would anyone object to ensuring their safety if there is a medical emergency as a result of an abortion procedure?
In the past year at Planned Parenthood’s Margaret Sanger Clinic in New York City, at least 13 women were carted away in ambulances, according to a tally kept by Operation Rescue. We never hear about those cases. Where is the outrage from abortion extremists? Where is their concern for the safety of women?
Ask their families, or the families of those who have died, if abortion clinics should have hospital privileges. My guess is they would all say yes.

"125",125,"Don’t Forget Men In The Abortion Debate","Scarlett Wilson","Sara",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-05-08"," The repeal of Roe v. Wade has shifted the discourse on abortion into a new phase, ranging from availability and legality to ethics and safety, as well as states’ and women’s “rights.” 



But as the policy and legal debates have changed, what has stayed the same is the framing of abortion as an exclusively female issue. Whether the procedure was mutually desired and agreed upon or not, a man’s perspective on an unplanned pregnancy is too often the last heard, or outright dismissed as irrelevant. Some feminists would see that as a good thing, but this one does not, and neither should Christians. 



Men who have been affected by abortion are a neglected voice in the abortion debate. It is an oft-repeated mantra that men need therapy — and new research indicates this may be especially true for men experiencing grief after abortion and disenfranchisement of their pain.  



Support After Abortion, an after-abortion healing research and education organization, found that 71 percent of men suffered issues after abortion — including almost one-third of men who identify as “pro-choice” — and that 82 percent of men did not know where to find help. Men struggled regardless of their involvement in the abortion decision, and even men who fully supported their partner’s decision found themselves with anger, grief, and other negative emotions when thinking about the child or children they never got to know. 



This research is just the latest to show that, just like women, many men need help after an abortion. In Psychology Today, Dr. Mary C. Lamia observes that “post-abortion grief is often silently held as a result of contradictory emotions.” Despite feeling limited relief, “qualitative research has illustrated that [men] experience intense grief over the loss of a child and fatherhood, even after many years post-abortion,” according to Lamia. 



Abortion can cause profound problems for men for years, regardless of their involvement in the abortion decision. Yet our culture tells men that their voice doesn’t matter. 



Like any mental health issue, after-abortion suffering has profound negative effects. Guttmacher reported 18 years ago that finances and relationships are the reasons the vast majority of women have abortions. And we know that people suffering from trauma often engage in unhealthy relationships and harmful decisions in those relationships — both of which can lead to unplanned pregnancies under difficult circumstances, which often is the catalyst to abortion. 



On the other side of the coin, men and women who are emotionally and psychologically healthy tend to make healthier financial and relationship choices. They often work together when facing challenges because they are healthy, equal partners. The Guttmacher research strongly indicates that when men and women work together on their relationship that reduces the chances of an abortion. 



Greg Mayo, who authored a white paper for Support After Abortion which discusses the study in context to America’s cultural dismissal of men’s roles during and after abortions, experienced intense grief after losing two children to abortion as a young man. Mayo has spoken publicly about how it took him until almost the age of 40 to come to terms with his lost children and related feelings of regret, powerlessness, and fear. 



Men’s after-abortion suffering is a human issue that Christians should address. How we do so will require care and sensitivity. Yet only 7 percent of the men who responded to the survey said they would go to a member of the clergy for help, even though 40 percent said they would prefer a religious healing program.



This poses a challenge and an opportunity for Christian churches. Pro-life religions are often framed and perceived as judgmental for opposing abortion, but they often have a lot to offer to suffering women and men after abortion. Many church critics think it’s all about “abortion is murder” at the pulpit, but there are community resources like spiritual direction, after-church social gatherings, and — in my Roman Catholic faith — confession. Trials of grief counseling programs and support groups designed specifically for men could be a vital lifeline for men who have hitherto suffered in silence. 



Support After Abortion is leading on this with a pilot program in Venice, Florida with the support of Bishop Frank J. Dewane, a member of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Pro-Life Secretariat. Results are not available, but the support of a leading pro-life bishop is a sign that good change may be coming.



With America and the West less religious than ever, the old approaches to healing won’t work. The path to hell is paved with good intentions — and the path to heaven with initially secular solutions that open people up to spiritual solutions. Christians have an opportunity to use compassion and care to improve lives, change souls, and improve their public reputation on a divisive issue. 



Just as Christ often physically fed His followers before he spiritually healed them, churches should tailor their approach to where each man or woman is. Men are dismissed in the abortion conversation and the negative effects are powerful. Our goal as Christians should be to create places where anyone can come to heal in the ways they need.

One of the most despicably desperate efforts was a recent New York Times editorial by a particularly infamous late-term abortionist explaining (and this is not a typo) “Pregnancy kills. Abortion saves lives.” Pregnancy: Very bad. Abortion: Very good. But of course, 100 percent of everyone who has ever existed does so because a pregnancy did what it naturally does and an abortion didn’t. The craziness of this editorial is a dramatic demonstration of just how paralyzed with fear these folks are about losing their cherished right to be free of children.  The Atlantic recently published a less dramatic, but equally desperate, article entitled “A Pastor’s Case for the Morality of Abortion.” Three trigger words here are supposed to create a confused dissonance: Pastor. Morality. Abortion. A case for the morality of abortion by a pastor. We imagine The Atlantic’s headline writers envisioned so many of us concluding abortion might not be so bad if a pastor thinks it’s moral. There is no other reason for the story. It’s certainly not newsworthy. This pastor, Jes Kast, is not well-known. She is extremely fringe and not particularly influential. She didn’t recently change her position on the issue through dramatic soul-searching. And she’s a United Church of Christ pastor, a denomination that never saw an abortion it couldn’t celebrate. She also describes herself as a femme queer lesbian who wants us to “queer this sh-t” we call our lives. She serves on Planned Parenthood’s national Clergy Advocacy Board and talks endlessly about the need to protect “reproductive rights,” as if she’s pro-fertility. She’s not. She’s a woman who’s proudly political even in her choice of lipstick. Every day I put my lipstick on, it is a form of protest. When Hitler took over and the war was going on women who were fighting back against the Nazi infiltration would wear red lipstick. Hitler apparently hated it when women wore red lipstick. So for me, it’s an act of protest to put red lipstick on. This is the person The Atlantic chose to make the moral case for abortion. On top of all this, she doesn’t even make a decent case, as if there is one, much less from a Christian perspective. But let’s give her the respect of taking seriously what she says.  Abortion For Any Reason Is Totally Moral First, she is very clear that she is all-in on abortion. When asked if she perceives any instance under which abortion is immoral, she says definitively, “I don’t. I really don’t.” These are the words of a fanatic. That’s not an accusation, but a fact. She believes that snuffing out the life of a pre-born child is such an inherent good in and of itself that nothing should override it. Not the abortion of a girl because a boy was desired, which happens by the millions around the world. How does a feminist square that? Not because one has a cruise coming up in six months. Not because the mother just wants to. These and any other reason are more weighty than the life of the child. That is pure fanaticism. If Kast thinks the above are extremist examples, then she shouldn’t justify abortion by bringing up the rationale of the 12-year-old rape victim, which she does. It’s the reddest of herrings. Tragic as this would be, the extremely abortion-friendly Guttmacher Institute tells us that only 1 percent of women who get abortions do so because of rape and less than 0.5 percent do so because of incest. But these make up perhaps 98 percent or so of the reasons folks give for why abortion should be legal. According to Guttmacher, 74 percent say they had their abortion because having a baby would dramatically change their lives or because they think they can’t afford a baby right now.  The Jesus Who Allows Whatever I Want So what is Kast’s theological case? Most anyone would agree she’s quite creative with scripture. In her rationale, she quotes Jesus saying, “I have come that they might have life and have it abundantly.” It’s a wonderful statement from the savior, but you should sit down for her commentary on how this makes abortion moral. What Jesus means here, she explains, is that “God’s plan for our lives is to actually have a meaningful life with loving contentment and satisfaction.” She continues, “Because of that—because I value life, and I believe Jesus values life—I value the choices that give us the type of life we need.” Claiming that access to abortion is a part of why Jesus came and the abundant life he offers is abhorrent and blasphemous. Has she no shame? But she’s not done; “When people talk about, ‘Our body is a temple of God, and holy,’ I see that as, I have the right to choices over my body, and the freedom to make the decisions that are right for me.” Apparently she thinks this is compelling. That is the fullness of her case for the morality of abortion. Basically, she is giving the precise rationale for abortion that prosperity preachers give for why God wants you rich. The True Christian Story Starts in the Womb What this pastor misses is that which is at the very center of Christianity—Christ Himself. She must know where His story starts. The Christian story begins with God becoming fully human, not in the Christmas manger, but nine months earlier as a human zygote in the womb of a teenage girl who was not yet married. This is quite a dramatic introduction to Christianity, and it says everything about the morality of abortion for the Christian. If God enters the world as the smallest of unborn human life, the smallest of unborn human life is very significant indeed. Christianity’s savior grew every day from that moment of his divine conception in Mary’s fallopian tubes, nestling and growing in her womb, never becoming anything more than what he was at that moment—fully God and fully man. Thus, Christianity has always taken an extremely high and unique view of the unborn, more so than any other religion or philosophy. This cannot be overstated. Our pastor misses that this is precisely why the earliest official collection of Christian ethics and morality—found in the “Didache,” or “Teaching of the Apostles”—clearly states that no one “shall murder a child by abortion, nor kill them when born.” This is in the same list that prohibits adultery, fornication, stealing, murder, lying or speaking evil. (Chapter 2:2) Abortion is immoral. The First Worshippers of Christ Understood This Our pastor also fails to appreciate who the first recorded worshipers of Jesus were, and where this all took place. It happens in a very wonderful and intimate place—another woman’s womb. Early in her pregnancy, Mary, Jesus’s mother, goes to visit Elizabeth, her close family member who is also with child. The moment Mary walks through the door of Elizabeth’s home, something remarkable happens in utero. The child growing inside of Elizabeth, none other than Jesus’s cousin, John the Baptist, leaps with joy at the arrival of his savior. Likewise, Elizabeth reveres the one who is in Mary’s womb. The first worshipers of Jesus are a pregnant woman and her unborn son. The womb and its natural bounty are very sacred and fundamental parts of the Christian tale. Thus, no pastor can remain faithful to the belief system he has supposedly dedicated himself to serve, teach, and proclaim, yet dismiss the inestimable value of life in the womb from the moment of conception. A life exists there because God delighted in creating and sending that wholly unique life into the world as a gift and blessing. A life that bears God’s very image and likeness. People who contend that ending life in the womb is moral have made themselves God, telling Him they reject His gift and know best. They have denied who Christ was and became. It is to dismiss the wonder of His own history and essence. Any pastor who teaches this has denied the center of his own faith. This pastor says she follows “this guy named Jesus who said, above all … love your neighbor as yourself.” She believes protecting so-called “reproductive freedom” and “women’s health” does this. She refuses to appreciate that the unborn is the most vulnerable of neighbors that lives right under a mother’s heart. There is no moral, Christian case for abortion. And there’s no space in Christianity for pastors, in direct violation of the Lord’s apostles , who teach that there is.

"128",128,"Nazis And Eugenics Brought Us Chemical Abortion: Here’s Proof","Schroder","Rachel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-08-26"," Chemical abortion is the backup plan of the abortion industry post-Roe, but it shields a ghastly history. The demand for this dangerous drug is rising in the U.S. despite its four times higher complication rate than surgical abortion and a jaw-dropping reality: the chemical abortion drug is connected to Nazi Germany. The affiliates of those who killed innocent children in the Holocaust introduced to our county the drug that is today killing innocent preborn children and numerous mothers.



Pro-life activists often argue that the dehumanization of Jews by the Nazis and the dehumanization of the preborn by the abortion industry are philosophically similar phenomena. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was a relentless racist. However, few know the true historical relationship between the Nazi genocide during World War II and today’s chemical abortion industry, now responsible for 54 percent of abortions nationwide.



In the early to mid-20th century, the pharmaceutical holding company I.G. Farben Chemical Company controlled much of the German chemical industry. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the infamous Auschwitz was one of I.G. Farben’s very own chemical plants, responsible for the slavery and deaths of more than a million people in World War II.



Several of Farben’s directors were also found guilty in the U.S’s Nuernberg War Crimes Trials for slavery and mass murder. Georg von Schnitzler, a member of the managing board of directors of Farben, was even a captain in a violent division of the Nazi party that helped facilitate Hitler’s rise before WWII. I.G. Farben Chemical Company was the archetype of an industrial demon.



After the war, Western countries attempted to utterly splinter I.G. Farben industrial power, but divided the holding company into three of its own industrial members, Hoechst, Bayer, and BASF. 



In 1974, the first of these three entities, Hoechst, gained a majority share of the holding company Chimio that controlled a French pharmaceutical company called Roussel Uclaf. By 1982, Roussel Uclaf had developed the RU-486 chemical abortion drug mifepristone.



Abortion Drug’s Ties to Population Council, Planned Parenthood



During the mid-1990s, Roussel Uclaf allied with the nonprofit Population Council, which led the charge for FDA approval of the abortion pill in the U.S., officially granted in 2000. During that time Hoechst acquired the remaining shares of Roussel Uclaf.



Like Hoechst, the Population Council had deeply eugenic roots. Aided by the director of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the organization was founded by John D. Rockefeller III, son of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.



Rockefeller Jr. sponsored German eugenic research leading up to the late-1930s that influenced later Nazi policy. Through the Rockefeller Foundation, he funded multiple institutions at which Ernst Rüdin, who spearheaded Hitler’s gruesome medical research during the Holocaust, held leading roles. One such organization was the Institute for Brain Research. According to The History News Network:



Everything changed when Rockefeller money arrived in 1929. A grant of $317,000 allowed the Institute to construct a major building and take center stage in German race biology. The Institute received additional grants from the Rockefeller Foundation during the next several years. Leading the Institute, once again, was Hitler’s medical henchman Ernst Rüdin. Rüdin’s organization became a prime director and recipient of the murderous experimentation and research conducted on Jews, Gypsies and others.



Following in the footsteps of the organization his father founded, in the 1950s Rockefeller III’s Population Council supported the American Eugenics Society, eugenics-motivated sterilization of women, and the use of sex-selective abortion. It also tested, along with International Planned Parenthood Federation, population controlling IUD contraceptives in Pakistan, Taiwan, South Korea, and India in the ’60s despite knowing their dangerous side effects on women. The council itself was led for years by openly eugenicist presidents Frederick Osborn and Frank Notestein, both of whom were members of the American Eugenics Society.



Aborting Minorities



Rockefeller III acted as chairman of President Nixon’s 1969 Population and the American Future Commission just two years after receiving Planned Parenthood’s Margaret Sanger Award. The commission staff was headed by Dr. Charles F. Westoff of the American Eugenics Society and advised by eugenicist Daniel Callahan. The final report endorsed decreasing population growth through supporting the option for women to obtain contraception and/or abortion. No wonder the Population Council was such a willing candidate to spearhead FDA approval for the Hoechst/Roussel Uclaf chemical abortion drug. 



Certain mid-19th century eugenicist figures such as Gunnar Myrdal in his 1944 book “An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy” schemed that “the most effective way they could advance their agenda would be to concentrate population control facilities within the targeted communities,” according to Life Dynamic’s Racial Targeting Report. Today, abortion is the leading cause of death among African Americans, having taken an estimated 19 million black lives. According to Students for Life of America, “Almost 80% of Planned Parenthood’s abortion facilities are located in minority neighborhoods. 88% of its new ‘mega facilities’ are located within walking distance of minority neighborhoods.”



Today’s abortion industry today is continuing Sanger’s racist legacy. As filmmaker Jason Jones bluntly put it, even though today’s abortion supporters generally reject eugenics, by still endorsing policies (namely abortion) that disproportionately kill black babies, they are “watering an apple tree hoping they get peaches.”



A disproportionate number of black babies are being killed by the abortion industry. This is the effect Planned Parenthood founder and eugenicist Sanger hoped for. It is no surprise that organizations like Hoechst and Population Council, who have eugenic roots too, were inclined to join the abortion bandwagon considering its ability to control populations.



Eugenic leaders laid the groundwork for today’s abortion industry. Similar to the 1969 Commission using the language of women’s choice to propagate what was possibly the eugenic dispositions of its leaders, today’s abortion industry touts the language of bodily autonomy to bolster their abortion business. Considering that nearly half of black babies are aborted in the U.S. today, abortion supporters don’t seem to care that their policies, in effect, carry on the eugenic tendencies of the Population Council, both J.D. Rockefellers, I.G. Farben Chemical Company, and Margaret Sanger.



The sad irony is that while the language of the abortion industry changed, its policies did not. Planned Parenthood still propagates a eugenic legacy through killing innocent children by chemical abortion.

"129",129,"Out-Of-State Democrats Pay Millions To Influence Kansas Election Because Abortion Is On The Ballot","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-08-01"," Kansans head to the polls Tuesday to vote on the proposed “Value Them Both” constitutional amendment that seeks to overturn the Kansas Supreme Court’s decision in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt that declared that the state constitution guarantees a “fundamental right to abortion.” Many Kansans may not realize, however, that the votes they cast on Tuesday may have been heavily influenced by out-of-state abortion apologists who contributed a whopping 71 percent of the $6.54 million spent by the lead group campaigning against the amendment. 



The proposed Value Them Both amendment passed the Kansas House and Senate in January 2021 by the two-thirds threshold required under the state constitution to place the proposal on the ballot for the citizens of Kansas to decide. The amendment would overturn Hodes’ holding that a state constitutional right to abortion exists by adding to the Kansas Bill of Rights a section defining the propriety of abortion regulation, stating: 



“Because Kansans value both women and children, the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion. To the extent permitted by the constitution of the United States, the people, through their elected state representatives and state senators, may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, laws that account for circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or circumstances of necessity to save the life of the mother.”



At the time of the Hodes decision, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey remained the law of the land under the federal Constitution. Pro-life Kansans nonetheless responded to the opinion by pushing for the Value Them Both amendment for two reasons. 



First, the Kansas Supreme Court’s Hodes opinion created a so-called right to abortion even broader than the then-controlling right established in Roe and tweaked in Casey — a state constitutional right so expansive it would guarantee a right to taxpayer-funded abortions. 



Second, pro-life Kansans wanted to ensure that if the Supreme Court overturned Roe and Casey, its legislature would regain the right to regulate abortions. While opposition to the amendment by Kansas’s supposedly pro-life Democrat lawmakers initially delayed the state legislature’s approval of the Value Them Both amendment, early last year, the proponents of the amendment garnered the votes necessary to put the proposal on the August primary ballot, which occurs tomorrow. 



Enter Dobbs



But then came Dobbs, in which the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe and Casey and held there is no federal constitutional right to abortion. The Dobbs decision makes the outcome of Tuesday’s vote crucial to the question of whether Kansans will now be able to decide on the appropriate regulation of abortion through their elected officials or whether it will be a Midwest abortion haven. 



While politicians and pundits see the outcome of Tuesday’s vote on the Value Them Both amendment as registering the pulse of the public on abortion policy, the disparity in out-of-state money flooding the airwaves with the deceptive talking points of abortion apologists, and the reality of the actual issue on the ballot, render the outcome less prophetic then billed. 



For the period of January 1, 2022, through July 18, 2022, campaign finance reports summarize the source of donations to the two competing campaigns. The Value Them Both Campaign, led by Kansans for Life, Kansas Family Voice, and Kansas Catholic Conference, supports passages of the amendment, while a group calling itself Kansans for Constitutional Freedom heads the anti-amendment campaign.



The anti-amendment campaign group raised $6.54 million during the approximate half-year reporting period, of which 71 percent of the donations came from out of state and only 29 percent came from in-state sources. In contrast, the Value Them Both Campaign received donations of $4.69 million during the same time period, with less than 1 percent of the donations originating from out-of-state and more than 99 percent of the donors residing in Kansas. 



One would think Kansas politicians would resent such out-of-state influence, but rather than condemn the outsiders’ interference in a matter of state law, Kansas Democrat Sen. Cindy Holscher attacked Catholic churches and dioceses in Kansas for donating money to support the Value Them Both Campaign. In a Friday op-ed for the Kansas City Star, titled “Kansas Constitutional Amendment on Abortion is a Bailout for the Catholic Church,” Holscher argued the church doesn’t “value them both.” “No,” she wrote, the support for the amendment “is the church valuing its bottom line.”



Beyond Holscher’s dizzying logic and nonsensical thesis that Kansas Catholic churches want to ban abortion in their state so they won’t lose more pro-abortion parishioners — yes, that truly is her argument — the Kansas senator completely ignores the donations made by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund ($850,000) and Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes ($492,000) to the Kansans for Constitutional Freedom campaign. Now there you have a money motive.



Even more appalling is the false framing of the amendment Holscher posed in her op-ed, inaccurately claiming that “the Legislature currently has the power to pose limits on abortion. To date, there are dozens of restrictions. What the Legislature can’t do is ban the procedure, as the Kansas Constitution currently guarantees access. That’s what this amendment is about, contrary to the confusing language that appears on the ballot.” 



Democrats’ Spin



It is not the ballot’s language that is confusing, however, but rather the spin put on the Value Them Both amendment by Holscher and her fellow Kansas Democrats. As the Democrats know full well, a state constitutional guarantee to abortion “access” means virtually every law passed by the legislature will be declared unconstitutional by the state courts. Waiting period: struck. Parental notification: struck. Informed consent provisions: struck. But taxpayer funding of abortions to ensure “access” for poor women — that will be required. Conversely, the passage of the amendment merely means that the authority to regulate abortions will be returned to the legislative branch, where it rightly belongs. 



Many of the political advertisements funded by out-of-state donors repeat the same false claims about the Value Them Both amendment as peddled in Holscher’s Friday op-ed. And it is not merely the Planned Parenthood types flooding Kansas with money in the hopes of defeating the amendment. An out-of-state billionaire heiress who promotes left-wing causes contributed 15 percent of the total raised by the anti-amendment group, or $1,000,000. A further 23 percent of the donations to the anti-amendment Kansans for Constitutional Freedom campaign came from liberal super-PACS, including groups that the Atlantic and Politico have classified as leftist dark-money networks, such as the 1630 Fund and the North Fund. North Fund “operates an umbrella group for various left-of-center advocacy organizations and has spent millions to promote causes” that included “opposing a 22-week abortion ban.” 



With such huge influxes of cash from outsiders, those pushing to defeat the Kansas amendment have been able to blanket the airways with distortions about the legal import of the Value Them Both amendment. And according to Danielle Underwood, the director of communications for Kansans for Life, “out-of-state, radical activists and politicians in Washington, D.C., are trying to force their extreme pro-abortion agenda on the people of Kansas.” “These unwelcome intruders include the Biden administration and far-left congressional members like Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren,” Underwood told The Federalist, and they “do not represent the people of Kansas or our values.”



“At this critical moment,” Underwood added, “Kansans can and must fight back against outside interests’ aggressive tactics by voting ‘yes’ on the Value Them Both Amendment. It is the only way to safeguard the common-sense abortion limits we already agree on and show the world our state believes in protections for both women and babies.”



Kansas voters may not recognize the outside influences in play, however, but if they take the time to actually read the proposed amendment before marking their ballots tomorrow, they’ll realize that the “no” side of the debate has been lying to them for the last year-and-a-half. Or Kansas voters can instead learn the truth the hard way when, once the amendment has been defeated, abortion activists turn to the state courts to start striking the current abortion regulations on the books and obtain taxpayer-funded abortion. Conservative Kansans will then learn what so-called “abortion access” really means.



Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the reporting period during which the anti-amendment group raised $6.54 million was approximately a half-year, not one-and-a-half years.

"130",130,"Without Roe, The Pro-Abortion Crowd Can’t Avoid Defending The Indefensible","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-20"," Democrats are foolishly trying to win the abortion debate. Now that the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion supporters have to make their case to the people and their representatives, rather than judges. But many of them have apparently forgotten that they win the argument by avoiding it.



This strategy was perfected by President Bill Clinton’s model of rhetorical moderation joined to legal extremism. Clinton said that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare” — and then he opposed any limits on it. And Roe, along with a compliant media, let him and his party get away with this, because they could let the courts do most of the dirty work. Now that they don’t have that shield they are struggling.



It is normal to want to justify one’s views, but it is often political malpractice. With regard to abortion, the majority position on abortion is inconsistent. The average American supports legal abortion early in pregnancy, wants it restricted or banned by the second trimester — and really, really doesn’t want to think about it. New York Times readers might like the idea of a comedy special about abortion, but most Americans are repulsed by it.



These voters in the middle see abortion as a sometimes necessary evil, or at least an expedient one. They find a consistent pro-life ethic uncomfortable and impractical, but they view a consistent pro-abortion ethic of late-term abortion on demand without apology as horrible. These voters tended to have a poor understanding of the Supreme Court’s abortion rulings, which is why polls often showed majority support both for Roe and for abortion restrictions prohibited by Roe, such as a ban on elective abortion after 15 weeks.



Democrats Running on Wrong Issue



Now, the pro-abortion side is trying to find a consistent, winning argument, not realizing that the attempt is a losing effort. Swing voters in the mushy middle on abortion usually vote on other issues, and the rhetoric being used to make the case for unrestricted abortion is alienating to them.



As momentous as the Dobbs decision was, most voters are more concerned with soaring inflation, a looming recession, and other economic woes. Nonetheless, Democratic leaders and activists are determined to push abortion to the fore. The New York Times alone has published multiple columns declaring that running on abortion will pave the way for Democratic victory.



This is nonsense, though in the face of impending midterm disaster, and saddled with a president who is about as popular as gonorrhea, Democrats might believe that their best chance to limit their losses is to rally their base by focusing on abortion and other social issues. This would explain House Dems voting repeatedly for radical pro-abortion bills that they know will fail in the Senate, and the attacks by Democrats such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on pro-life pregnancy resource centers.



Woke Pieties Estrange Working Class, Minorities



But even if this culture war strategy staunches the immediate electoral bleeding, it may set Democrats up for problems in the future. In particular, it will likely accelerate the realignment in which Dems gain educated whites at the loss of working class and minority voters, especially Hispanics. Even when Dems work hard to frame the issue in ways favorable to them, they are still focusing on something that these voters are not that concerned with right now.



Democrats also become ridiculous when their abortion absolutism combines with their woke pieties. Democrats are eager to insist that pregnant men have a right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand until birth. But as Megan McArdle recently tries to warn them, most Americans think third-trimester unborn babies have value and that it is women who get pregnant.



Furthermore, the left justifies its pro-abortion extremism using rhetoric derived from a worldview that is alien to the lived experience of most moderate voters. Phrases such as “forced birth” and “bodily autonomy” are popular with the online left, but they reveal a perspective that sees nature as a prison and unchosen obligations as slavery. Consequently, they necessarily view female fertility, with its natural dependencies and vulnerabilities, as a burden to be suppressed, and they want the state to take over and professionalize the duties of providing care to dependents.



Voters Fleeing Dems See Dependence Differently



But the voters fleeing the Democratic coalition do not live with the presumptions that female embodiment is imprisoning, that dependence is despicable, and that we should be free from unchosen obligations. Though they may not have a coherent, developed theory of dependence and duty, their moral intuitions are not oriented toward radical individualism and personal autonomy. Likewise, though they may not have a consistent pro-life philosophy, they know that a life of love in family and community requires fulfilling duties of care toward dependents.



And they know that the future of families and communities depends upon those who are dependent. This is most obvious with children, but the realities of interdependence extend to all of us. All of us are dependent for much of our lives, and even our moments of apparent independence are less than they seem. And we are always dependent on others for what is best in this life, for the love and kindness and friendships that are necessary for human flourishing.



The left’s concern for solidarity has been swallowed up by its radicalism, especially on abortion. Its electoral prospects might suffer the same fate, as pro-abortion extremism pushes Democrats to ignore voters’ concerns in favor of pushing unpopular positions justified by alienating rhetoric.

"131",131,"Why Pro-Lifers Don’t Support Punishing Women For Abortion","Lu","Rachel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-04-05"," Should a woman be punished for seeking abortion? In a rare and impressive feat, Donald Trump managed to outrage both pro-life and pro-choice activists last week by answering the question in the affirmative. Defenders of America’s abortion regime seized the opportunity to pontificate about the ways regulations relating to abortion are already “punishing women” (read: inconveniencing them). (Anyone who recalls the horrors of Kermit Gosnell’s establishment might reflect that unregulated abortion providers are likely more punishing to their clients.) Pro-lifers were appalled to hear the Republican front-runner talking casually about assessing punishments to desperate mothers, evidently believing that this sort of talk would please them.  Punishing Abortionists, Not Mothers The pro-life movement has consistently maintained that abortion providers deserve to be punished. By all means, let’s pass laws that enable us to prosecute people who profit off the desperation of pregnant women, actually building careers out of the grisly business of destroying nascent human life. What sort of people keep the abortion industry running? Quite recently, the Center for Medical Progress has given us good, hard look. It wasn’t edifying. It turns out, regardless of the legal situation, that people who volunteer to kill unborn babies all day generally aren’t the sort you’d want to leave with your kids. Most pro-lifers would be thrilled to see the Deborah Nucatolas and Mary Gatters of the world hauled into interrogation rooms to answer for their crimes against humanity. The pro-life movement has never advocated criminal penalties for abortion-seeking women. By contrast, the movement has never advocated criminal penalties for abortion-seeking women. Prior to Roe v. Wade, the American legal tradition overwhelmingly sided against such penalties. This is understandably puzzling to some. After all, if the fetus is indeed an innocent human being with a right to life, wouldn’t abortive women effectively be guilty of murder? Isn’t abortion-seeking rather like hiring a hit man to kill one’s own child? Why wouldn’t we punish that? Isn’t the pro-life movement just being inconsistent here? Actually, this issue is a good one for illustrating the real strengths of the pro-life movement, which is truly one of America’s great humanitarian achievements. Pro-lifers do absolutely believe that the unborn are precious human beings with a full right to life. Human lives are precious, even when they’re small.  Nevertheless, pro-lifers have managed to maintain this without losing the virtue of prudence. They are zealous, but not zealots. This movement is far more than just the working out of a metaphysical principle. More Than Metaphysics An unborn child is precious, and the decision to have it killed is terrible indeed. Still, we can recognize that fact without losing sight of the tremendous burden a child can place on the woman who carries him. As champions of life, we know that mothers and babies are intimately connected. It’s generally quite difficult to help the latter by threatening the former. Progressive liberals frequently speak as though mothers and children are natural enemies. We try to avoid making that same mistake. Mothers and babies are intimately connected. It’s generally quite difficult to help the latter by threatening the former. This is more than just a rhetorical nicety. Progressives would have us believe abortion is liberating for women. It isn’t. Simply by being available, abortion undercuts the customs and sensibilities that enable expectant mothers to find the support they need in a difficult pregnancy. The procedure itself rips apart two people who are connected by a deep natural bond. It is gravely injurious to the women as well as the children, whether or not they fully appreciate this damage. To a great extent, they do. Women seeking abortions regularly report they would prefer to keep the baby if only they had more support. Post-abortive women often experience deep depression and other health problems. When pro-lifers claim women are the second victims of abortion, they aren’t just being politically correct. Many people are hurt by abortion, but mothers tend to pay a much heavier price than the disinterested boyfriends or other associates who frequently pressure them to make the “easy” choice.  Victimhood Doesn’t Preclude Guilt In saying this, we in no way deny that an abortion-seeking woman does a grave wrong. All sin injures the sinner, and this isn’t necessarily an argument against punishment. Some women, in light of their immaturity and desperate circumstances, may not be very blameworthy when they opt for abortion. In other cases, women kill their unborn children for relatively trivial reasons, and some of these surely do deserve serious blame. It hardly seems possible that abortion-seeking women recognize the hideousness of what they do. I have found, anecdotally, that some pro-life men (not all) view abortion-seeking women with a kind of horror that makes forgiveness difficult. I think that’s understandable. Decent men naturally feel called to protect women and children, especially in times of vulnerability (such as pregnancy). It can be hard to look compassionately on women who deny men even the opportunity to do the right thing. For me (as a pro-life woman and mother of four) abortion stories are likewise horrifying, but the effect is somewhat different. Even when the tone is defiant (as in the #ShoutYourAbortion campaign), I feel overwhelming pity for the authors. Regrettably, most women today have a radically underdeveloped sense of the moral importance of fertility and nascent life. It hardly seems possible that abortion-seeking women recognize the hideousness of what they do. Pastors, priests and psychiatrists can help individuals decide how blameworthy they are in particular cases. With respect to the law, though, we should recognize that abortion is intrinsically harmful to two closely connected people, and a law that implicitly pits one against the other may not send the right message about the value of life. All Lives Matter All human life is precious. That doesn’t mean that all wrongful deaths call for identical responses. Of course, courts are used to considering a broad range of factors in determining the degree to which one person is responsible for another’s death. Intentions matter, as do broader circumstances. Even those guilty of intentional killing may have mitigated responsibility for a variety of reasons. When we appreciate how gravely abortion harms the involved mothers, we might find ourselves drawing many parallels to suicide. An interesting comparison might be drawn between abortion and suicide. The Western tradition has generally regarded suicide as gravely immoral, which makes sense from the standpoint of valuing all life. Some might be inclined to argue that a person has ownership over his own life, such that taking it is his prerogative. They might reflect, however, that such radical claims of self-ownership might bleed fairly easily into the kind of “my body, my choice” rhetoric that is often used to justify abortion. There can be no doubt that suicide causes enormous pain and injury to friends and family members of the deceased; whether or not a crime, it certainly isn’t victimless. Until the late 1960s, suicide was illegal in the United States. Of course the successful suicide cannot be prosecuted. Still, given that the great majority of suicide attempts are unsuccessful, we could in principle prosecute large numbers of people for unjustified attempts on their own innocent lives. Why don’t we do this? In general, it doesn’t seem either prudent or constructive. Suicidal people typically aren’t a public safety risk. Anyone who wants to end his own life probably needs support and care. This is not to deny that suicide can, in some instances, be intensely selfish, and quite possibly worthy of blame. Still, recognizing the psychological unhealth that a suicide attempt evidences, we’re usually more inclined to offer help, compassion, and prayers. When we appreciate how gravely abortion harms the involved mothers, we might find ourselves drawing many parallels to suicide. The desperate decision to have one’s own child killed, from within one’s own body, comes perilously close to self-annihilation. Like suicide, the decision can still be blameworthy. But there’s no good reason to think that abortive women pose a broader threat to public safety, and in general, we’re more likely to help both women and children by responding to abortion with compassion and offers of support. Let’s Focus On Saving Lives “We are interested in saving babies,” wrote Robert George in First Things, “not punishing mothers. And we know that we don’t need to punish mothers to save babies.” For decades, pro-choice Americans have tried to paint the pro-life movement as misogynist, chauvinist, and otherwise fixated on curtailing the rights and freedoms of women. For decades, pro-lifers have patiently repeated that they have no desire to persecute or shame women. They simply want to protect the lives of the unborn. Trump’s remarks demonstrate how completely his sensibilities have been formed by the progressive left. He cannot even pretend to be pro-life without drawing on the ugliest of progressive stereotypes. But no one should be fooled; we’re better than that. We are pro-mother and pro-child. That’s what it means to be pro-life.

"132",132,"Democrats Have Taken The Abortion Debate Into Another Stratosphere","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-10-08"," Abortion ranks right up there as an essential American experience, according to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and he means to jealously guard the “right” to kill an unborn baby the same way Americans hold their constitutional rights dear. Schumer’s candid admission during a Marist Poll podcast foreshadowed the lengths Democrats would go to block any Supreme Court nominee who does not swear fealty to the cult of death. Apple pie. Fireworks on the 4th of July. Football on a Sunday afternoon. And abortion?  “We’ve had Roe for so long,” he told the Marist podcasters in August, “and it’s been so much the part and fabric of American life that people think well no matter who’s on the court it’ll pretty much stay where it is. I don’t think that’s accurate.” It’s hard not to acknowledge the dominating role of abortion in our society, from the way it’s become a litmus test for judicial appointments to billboards straddling highways in the American heartland proudly proclaiming, “People of faith love those who have abortions” and “God loves those who have abortions.” We have the “Shout Your Abortion” movement, which tells us abortion is normal and beyond reproach: “Our stories are ours to tell. This is not a debate.” We have countries like Ireland — a long-standing bulwark against unfettered access to abortions at any time and any place — taking their cues from American abortion activists, literally jumping for joy and declaring a “Feminist Christmas” at the repeal of an amendment banning the procedure.  This is not the way abortion was sold to the American public in the wake of Roe v. Wade, and it represents a seismic shift in the way abortion advocates have justified the taking of innocent human life. Only ten years ago during her first presidential run, Hillary Clinton positioned herself as a moderate on the issue and vowed abortion should be “safe, legal and rare, and by rare, I mean rare.” Extremists on both sides had failed to compromise, Clinton said, drawing rapturous applause from a debate crowd as she lamented “a great failing on all of our parts” to limit abortion. Eight years later Clinton “recalibrated” her position, dropping the “rare” qualifier and declaring unequivocal support for taxpayer-funded abortions in an effort to appeal to her party’s base during a tougher-than-expected primary run against Sen. Bernie Sanders. With more than 55 million abortions performed in the U.S. since its legalization with Roe v. Wade in 1973, abortion is anything but rare.  Perhaps that explains the shifting rhetoric on the part of abortion supporters like Schumer, who present the killing of the unborn as part of a tapestry, beautifully woven for the health and welfare of women. One need only look closely to see the fabric is frayed and torn almost beyond salvaging as countless lives and families are destroyed as a result of abortion. It’s not just women either — the issue impacts men, siblings, survivors of botched abortion procedures and the countless relationships torn apart as a result. Yet the public rarely hears about those consequences. We’re led to believe that if we really care for women and their health, we must support abortion. Anything else is deemed unacceptable and opponents are deemed anti-woman, even those of us who have experienced abortion ourselves and suffered because of it. We’re told we have no right to speak out against it. We’re denied a platform to acknowledge the psychological, spiritual and sometimes physical damage abortion inflicts on women. We’re gaslighted and told other factors are to blame, including religion, and familial and relationship pressure, as if everything but the taking of life itself can inflict trauma. Men aren’t permitted to grieve for the loss of unborn children, yet countless numbers of them suffer and mourn the children they did not have. Oftentimes the regret surfaces after the birth of subsequent children, leaving the parents to face the reality of what was lost, while society tells them their feelings aren’t real. Marriages and relationships are destroyed. Women who harbor the secret of a past abortion often have trouble with intimacy and feel they can’t tell their partners why. After all, they’re told, there are no negative consequences from having an abortion. Surviving siblings come forward as they struggle with feelings of guilt for being alive. They wonder if they were wanted, if they carry the names that would have been given to their aborted siblings, struggling to reconcile how their parents — the people who love and protect them — could have been responsible for the death of a brother or sister. Many suffer silently, feeling there is nowhere to go with their pain. Finally, we have abortion survivors like the 70-year-old woman who contacted me a few weeks ago after spending her entire life wondering why her mother tried to end her life. Why would a mother do that? There are no easy answers. Decades after she was told, this woman still struggles with the knowledge that she was unwanted. Try as they might to remove the stigma of abortion, the tattered fabric remains in the lives of millions who have been impacted. Abortion extremists may be successful in shutting down debate in the public arena, but the people whose lives were touched know the truth. Those who support abortion will say it doesn’t bother them. They may even shout for joy when restrictions on killing their children are rolled back. But those who suffer know the negative impact of abortion, whether the Schumers of the world choose to acknowledge it or not. Yes, abortion is part of the fabric of American life, tattered, worn and ripped. Hopefully we will wake up and heal as a nation before we are hanging on by a thread.

"133",133,"Abortion Industry: Don’t Tell Women They Can Reverse Chemical Abortions","Smith","Mailee",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-04-23"," Trusting women to make good decisions when provided with accurate information seems like a noncontroversial healthcare policy. But the abortion industry has fought tooth and nail against two straightforward informed-consent provisions recently enacted in Arkansas and Arizona. If a woman is undergoing a chemical abortion, such as the two-drug RU-486 regimen, the laws say she must be informed that it “may be possible” to reverse the effects of the chemical abortion if she changes her mind, “but that time is of the essence.”  The necessity of such informed consent provisions is clear. Some women change their minds before completing the two-drug RU-486 regimen—as evidenced by the 140-plus babies born or currently in utero following the chemical abortion reversal process. And the process itself is based on an established medical principle. Providing information on the possibility of reversing the effects of chemical abortion respects a woman’s intellect, acknowledges the complexity of her decision, and communicates relevant medical information. But the abortion industry is so intent on hiding the reality that chemical abortion may be reversed that it is undermining its own strategy and previous claims, disingenuously asserting that it cannot tell women of the abortion reversal process because that process has not been addressed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an entity that up to this point the abortion industry has been glad to ignore. Industry Ignores FDA on Chemical Abortions The abortion industry routinely administers chemical abortion drugs in ways that contravene protocols approved by the FDA. Specifically, according to the FDA, the drugs in the RU-486 regimen should be provided only through 49 days gestation, and the woman should return to the clinic on day three to (orally) ingest misoprostol, the second drug in the regimen. Prior to approving RU-486, the FDA informed the drug manufacturer that ‘restrictions’ ‘are needed to assure safe use.’ In fact, the FDA was so concerned with the proper administration of the RU-486 regimen that it approved it under a special code section, known as Subpart H, which allows the FDA to place post-marketing restrictions on the drugs and providers. Prior to approving RU-486, the FDA informed the drug manufacturer that “restrictions” on the “distribution and use of mifepristone [the first drug in the regimen] are needed to assure safe use.”  On approval, the FDA required that both the provider and patient sign a statement attesting that the woman is no more than 49 days pregnant and that she will return to the office to administer misoprostol. Big Abortion ignores the FDA restrictions by providing the drugs up to at least 69 days gestation and sending women home to (vaginally or bucally) self-administer misoprostol without medical supervision. And abortion advocates have worked tirelessly against laws that would protect women’s health by limiting the use of life-ending drugs to the protocol required by the FDA. Big Abortion Serves Itself, Not Women As of 2011, the FDA had received over 2,200 adverse events reports related to use of the RU-486 regimen, including eight women who died of severe bacterial infections. Notably, each of the eight women had been instructed to administer the drugs in ways not approved by the FDA. Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers increasingly tie their profits to the distribution of abortion drugs. The FDA has never approved of this blatant deviation from its restrictions. Instead, the FDA continues to note that “[t]he safety and effectiveness of other [RU-486] dosing regimens, including the use of oral misoprostol tablets intravaginally, has not been established by the FDA.”  With the FDA lacking enforcement power to ensure adherence to its Subpart H restrictions, the onus falls on the states to rein in the abortion industry’s potentially life-threatening use of chemical abortion drugs. Significantly, one of Big Abortion’s main arguments against such laws is that it is unnecessary to adhere to the FDA restrictions. The industry hypocritically fights to physically administer abortion drugs in contradiction to enumerated FDA restrictions, but it refuses to simply provide information to a woman that may allow her to change her mind mid-abortion. While we know that Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers increasingly tie their profits to the distribution of abortion drugs, an additional motive could be at play in the abortion industry’s refusal to inform a woman that she can potentially reverse the effects of RU-486. According to the industry’s preferred (and unapproved) protocol, the woman has already ingested the first drug and has been sent home to administer the second drug alone. There is no guarantee that the woman will ever return to the clinic—which means, more likely than not, that the clinic has already been paid when the woman leaves. So simply informing a woman that she can potentially reverse the RU-486 process after she leaves the clinic may not impact the clinic’s profit. Hiding this information reveals that the industry is more interested in ensuring dead babies than in protecting the women it claims to serve.

"134",134,"There’s Nothing Pro-Woman About Shoddy Standards For Abortion Pills That Can Kill Them","Donovan","Chuck",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-11-09"," When it comes to distribution of the abortion drug mifepristone, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been asleep at the switch. Despite comprehensive data showing higher rates of complications and emergency room visits from chemical abortion, the abortion pill has been feted by the corporate media, promoted as “safe” by President Joe Biden, and subjected to increasingly lax oversight by the FDA.



All of this makes a little-heralded recent story in Politico even more interesting. An anonymous FDA source warns against the intensifying abortion industry campaign to give abortion pills to women and girls who are not pregnant. Politico quotes the unnamed FDA spokesman expressing concern that this approach poses new health risks to women: “Mifepristone is not approved for advance provision of a medical abortion.”



The anonymous source goes on to list several safety concerns including the inability of doctors to screen for ectopic pregnancy or properly date a pregnancy (abortion pill risks increase exponentially with each week of pregnancy). To that list, we add the very real risk of sex traffickers or abusive partners using careless distribution of abortion pills to commit crimes of coercion. The Charlotte Lozier Institute has been sounding the alarm on these risks for years, though often falling on deaf federal ears.



There is little sign that the abortion industry cares about these concerns, as even the FDA has given mifepristone glancing affirmation in recent years. In fact, the FDA has been in more or less full retreat from its oversight of mifepristone. 



The abortion drug regimen of mifepristone (to kill the baby) and misoprostol (to expel the dead baby) was first approved in the waning days of the Clinton administration under a regulation designed to reduce the risks associated with hazardous drugs. Known as ETASU, Elements To Assure Safe Use, the regulation was meant to ensure women obtain abortion drugs from a certified physician capable of monitoring and treating complications. For abortion pills, those complications range from death to hemorrhage to infection, requiring visits to the emergency room and, in many cases, follow-up surgery.



FDA Loosened Requirements



The initial FDA rules also required reporting and tracking these complications, which proved to be wise. Mifepristone’s original mode of administration was found to be associated with lethal infections. Other complications proved more frequent than the rate associated with surgical abortion procedures.



How did the FDA react? It changed the recommended procedure for administration, but oddly enough in March 2016, the FDA removed the requirement that only a physician could prescribe the drug and dropped any prescriber requirement for reporting non-fatal complications, the exact opposite of what one would expect the FDA would do to assure safe use. The goal was to widen distribution of the abortion pill, while learning less from its manufacturers about the dangerous complications the new policy might cause.



Use of mifepristone-misoprostol accelerated after 2016, to the point where today it is the method deployed in the majority of reported abortions. Taking advantage of the declared Covid emergency, the pro-abortion American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists brought suit in a friendly federal court and won suspension of the in-person dispensing requirement, allowing the drugs to be distributed via telehealth and the mail. The ruling was reversed by the Supreme Court in late 2020, but not for long. 



Then the Biden administration, well prior to the Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, paved the way for abortion pills by mail, a prelude perhaps to selling the drugs over the counter. In April 2021, the FDA announced it was suspending the in-person dispensing requirement under the guise of the Covid “emergency.” In December 2021, the FDA decided to permanently allow abortion by mail.



Profoundly Anti-Woman Implications



The implications of these policies are profoundly anti-woman and anti-family. Research based on 17 years of Medicaid claims data analyzed by the Charlotte Lozier Institute shows that chemical abortions are a growing public health threat, with the rate of abortion pill-related emergency room visits spiking more than 500 percent from 2002 to 2015. The need to utilize claims data reflects the lack of FDA reporting requirements, exceptionally weak state abortion reporting laws, and only voluntary federal reporting.



The advent of “no-test” administration of mifepristone only compounds the risks to women and girls. Without physical examination, ultrasound, labs, or a physician-patient relationship, women can obtain abortion pills through the mail or telehealth and commence an abortion, absent the confirmation of an intrauterine pregnancy, correct gestational age, and determination of potential risk factors for future pregnancy complications. 



Imagine being a parent and discovering that your 15-year-old daughter has somehow obtained mifepristone and misoprostol via her school, a friend, or the internet. Imagine she is one of the women who endure up to 16 days of hemorrhaging from the drug, or that she is further along than the 10 weeks of pregnancy for which the drug is authorized. Imagine she delivers an extremely premature baby — which by 10 or 11 weeks of gestation will have fingers and toes and more than 4,000 distinct body parts — in the family bathroom, alone, frightened, and weighted with an unerasable memory.



This is increasingly the state of abortion in America. The abortion industry has steadily decreased expert medical care for pregnant women, ignored all standards of prudence, isolated the young without family or counseling support — and, adding insult to injury — devised distribution schemes for abortion pills that will both foster and rely on the absence of public health oversight. The FDA is right to finally be alarmed, but the hour is late.

"135",135,"Democrats Muddy The Waters To Ensure Support For California’s Late-Term Abortion Amendment","Osburn","Madeline",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-11-04"," Abortion is on the ballot in California next week, or at least that’s what Democratic leaders want voters to believe. Californians will vote on an amendment, Proposition 1, which would add the “fundamental right to reproductive freedom,” to the state constitution in a jurisdiction where abortion is already legal and widely popular. But that hasn’t stopped prominent Democrats from spending time and money on building support for the amendment. 



Even though Proposition 1 adds no new protections to abortion, and abortion is and will remain legal in the state of California without passing the amendment, many of the country’s most prominent Democrats such as Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have rallied and raised millions for the “Yes on Prop 1” campaign. In addition to Proposition 1, Newsom is expected to sign more than a dozen abortion-related bills this year. 



Democratic political strategist Robin Swanson told CapRadio, a Sacramento NPR affiliate, that the state’s leaders are banking on the issue not only as a way to boost voter turnout for tight races but to send a message to the rest of the country that California is an abortion “safe haven.”



“I think they’re trying to create a sense of urgency around it,” she said. “A lot of Californians feel sort of immune to these right-wing, conservative ideas affecting our lives. But seeing 50 years of precedent overturned should be a shock to our systems.”



Newsom, Clinton, and their ilk in the pro-abortion Democrat Party have warned about the disappearing “right to abortion and birth control” that would allegedly ensue if the motion fails to pass, but little has been clarified for voters on what it would look like for Prop. 1 to take effect — particularly for health care workers, court systems, and the unborn. 



Expanding Late-Term Abortion



Proponents of the bill, such as California Attorney General Rob Bonta, say Proposition 1 does not lead to late-term abortions but simply enshrines the constitutional “right to abortion.” On the contrary, the language is vague and lacks specifics. In fact, one doctor who contributed to authoring the amendment is on the record explaining the vague language was “on purpose.”



Dr. Pratima Gupta, a San Diego OB-GYN who consulted on Proposition 1, told KQED they intentionally left out the word “viability” — the key descriptor in determining the limit, if any, at which point during gestation an abortion can legally be performed. 



“Every pregnancy is individual and it’s a continuum,” Gupta said. “If I see a patient who has broken their bag of water at 23 weeks of pregnancy, that doesn’t mean that it’s viable or not viable.”



Under laws already on the books such as the California Reproductive Privacy Act of 2003, abortion is limited to “before the viability of the fetus.” The text of Proposition 1 would embed a “fundamental right to choose to have an abortion” without any limits or qualifications about the viability of the baby. California’s own Voter Information Guide states that the amendment “will allow unrestricted late-term abortions” and “will allow late-term abortions at taxpayer expense without limitation for any reason at any time up to the moment of birth — even when the mother’s life is not in danger, even when the healthy baby could survive outside the womb.”



Catherine Hadro, director of media relations for the “No on Prop. 1” campaign, told The Federalist that even some pro-abortion Californians are against the amendment because they fear future court battles will lead to more restrictions on California abortion laws. 



“Legal experts have already cautioned the proposition’s flawed, vague language is likely to invite serious legal challenges that would cost California taxpayers millions more and allow random judges to interpret reproductive health in California,” Hadro said. 



Dr. Forrest Smith is one of the longest-practicing abortionists in the United States. He has performed anywhere from 30,000 to 50,000 abortions throughout his career, over the course of 50 years. In an ad for the Center for Medical Progress, the pro-abortion OB-GYN explains that “Proposition 1 is really just the same 2003 law, but with the fetal viability clause eliminated. If Proposition 1 is put in our state constitution, abortion doctors will have a right to legally kill viable and healthy babies up to the moment of birth.”



Reconciling the Polls 



It seems that post-Roe, pro-abortion Democrats and corporate media allies have intentionally muddied the waters on the abortion debate to the point that even the most extreme policies, which would normally face pushback across the spectrum, are flying under the radar. Polling around Proposition 1 reflects that confusion. 



A Berkeley IGS poll conducted in mid-August found that 71 percent of California voters said they planned to vote for Proposition 1. A poll from the Public Policy Institute of California conducted in early September found that 69 percent of voters support Proposition 1 while 25 percent said they will vote no.



And yet, a poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports in October found that even though a majority of California voters support the amendment, a majority are also against late-term abortion: “only 14% of California Likely Voters believe abortion should be legal at any time during pregnancy up to the moment of birth.”



“Thirteen percent (13%) think abortion should be legal up to six months of pregnancy, while 34% say abortion should be legal up to three months of pregnancy. Nineteen percent (19%) believe abortion should only be legal during the first month of pregnancy, while 15% think all abortions should be illegal,” the Rasmussen/Capitol Resource Institute study reported. 



“We are seeing both in-person and in the polls that voters reject what Proposition 1 would allow in California,” Hadro said. She added that the Rasmussen poll “illustrates support for the proposition drops when voters are educated on the realities of Proposition 1.”



Despite efforts by the pro-life movement, Democrats are doing their best to obscure those realities.

"136",136,"Why Handing Out Abortion Pills On California State Campuses Is A Horrific Idea","Tasy","Bernadette",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-08-02"," I recently addressed a California state assembly committee to talk about Senate Bill 24, one of many abortion experiments legislators are considering in my home state. It would mandate that all California public universities distribute RU-486 abortion pills in their student health centers. These pills cause abortions for women who are up to 10 weeks pregnant, well after which the baby has developed a heartbeat. Tensions were high as my colleague and I began our very short allowance of two minutes each to explain our opposition. Given the risks to my peers and fellow Californians, I had to try.  Providing abortion on school campuses is already a ridiculous concept, but the bill, which is expected to go before the full California Assembly by summer’s end, contains numerous flaws. My testimony consisted of three main points. First, the bill author, state Sen. Connie Leyva, continuously argues that the bill is about “access” to abortion and that public university campuses are not in close proximity to abortion pill providers. Most campuses, however, are within just a few miles of these facilities. The bill places the mandate on all 34 campuses, costing millions of dollars for a completely unnecessary program. Second, although the bill is supposed to save students money for car service transportation to off-campus abortion appointments, the public university systems have stated repeatedly that they will need to raise mandatory student fees to fund this on-campus program. And in California, Medi-Cal patients receive free transportation services to these appointments. Third, one of the author’s key witnesses testifying at several hearings in support of the bill co-authored an article demonstrating the failure rate of RU-486: If the student is six-weeks pregnant when she takes the pills, the failure rate is about 3 percent, but if the woman is nine- to 10-weeks pregnant, the failure rate is more than 15 percent. The author estimates 500 students will take these drugs statewide on campus each month, so at least 15-75 students will have a failed abortion each month and need a second, surgical abortion.  My colleague, a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, pointed out concerns regarding the safety of the abortion pill and the fact that there are no conscience protections for student health center professionals nor for the students funding the program with their mandatory fees. The morality of abortion was not mentioned in the hearing. This bill is so poorly designed that it continues to be opposed even by pro-choice people, including California’s former governor, Jerry Brown, who vetoed last year’s version of the bill, SB-320. When a pro-life legislator questioned how the universities are expected to handle the biomedical waste that would be left in campus bathrooms and sewage system after the abortions, the author and her expert witness struggled to respond, ultimately pushing aside the question.    Although the University of California and California State University school systems have not supported the bill, and their testimony has changed very little from the first hearing in 2017 to the most recent hearing this past June, their reluctance is clear. They stress concerns regarding financial liability and appropriateness of maintaining an abortion program on campus.  In most of the SB-24 hearings I have attended, the bill’s author has had a student testify about being unable to get abortion pills in time, leading to the student obtaining a surgical abortion instead. The UC representative’s testimony points out that this issue was a result of the universities’ referral process but that it does not warrant the dramatic response of mandating that every public university become an abortion provider. Of course, with the high failure rate of the drugs, the students’ experience may include a second, surgical abortion anyway. The legislators ignored our comments. The author did not respond to any of the arguments my colleague, the pro-life legislator, the University of California, or I made. Each legislator who continues to vote in favor of this bill simply turns a blind eye to any serious concerns or even contradictions within the bill itself. This isn’t about pro-life versus pro-choice. It’s about common sense versus a radically ideological agenda. California legislators this term are considering several bills or resolutions that either directly or indirectly propel a pro-abortion agenda, including one that even offers a tax credit for motion pictures made in California rather than states that restrict abortion. In 2016, the state approved a sexual education curriculum written by organizations including Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union; this is now undergoing revisions that include proposed sexual education content as early as kindergarten, at one point even encouraging sexual behavior as young as the fifth grade. Most if not all of these bills, resolutions, and revisions will likely pass. California is one of the most aggressively pro-abortion states in America. It already has 150 abortion facilities and more than 500 abortion providers statewide, no restriction on race- or sex-selective abortion, and no requirement for verbal counseling including optional ultrasound information for women to make an informed decision about pregnancy. In fact, California is the one and only state listed as “very supportive” of abortion rights in the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute’s latest analysis of state abortion laws. Being active in this fight for the last three years as I attended a California public university, I know I have a lot to learn, yet I have already seen so much of the politics surrounding the legislature’s abortion agenda. I am grieved by the carelessness of our representatives who would push forward this reckless bill despite its many problems. But if you think this extremism will stay right here in California, think again. It’s looking more and more like we’re just the guinea pig state.

How many voters know this position aligns with only six other countries in the world — three of them, not incidentally, being North Korea, Vietnam, and China?



Indeed, Democrats want to pass a federal law overturning the democratic will of states that ban sex-selective abortions or the dismembering of the post-viable unborn or require parental or guardian notification for minors before getting abortions. Democrats want to allow non-doctors to perform abortions (probably because it’s not medical care) while at the same time stripping real medical workers of their conscience rights by compelling them to participate in the procedure or lose their jobs. Democrats want to eliminate the popular Hyde Amendment that stops the federal government from funding abortions with taxpayer dollars. They believe abortion is vital in ensuring that poorer Americans have fewer children.



Now, maybe a majority of voters aren’t aware of Democrats’ maximalist positions because the media endlessly lies and obfuscates them. And maybe pollsters rarely ask useful questions on the topic — offering absurdly vague queries like “do you support abortion access” or should “abortion be legal” rather than should it be legal until the “due date” or “for any reason” or “after the baby is viable” or “for sex selection” — because the answers are a lot more complicated than they’d like.



And, maybe, after the shock of Roe being overturned — treated by Democrats as if it had been chiseled into magical stone tablets over the past 50 years — the energy and passion of the debate will temporarily reside on the pro-abortion side. And, maybe, if every voter knew all the facts, it still wouldn’t matter. Abortion is a complex and emotional issue.



None of that excuses the inability, or aversion, of national conservatives to make a coherent and compelling pro-life case. Sometimes it feels like Republicans are more terrified by the Dobbs decision than pro-abortionists. Even if pollsters were right about the unpopularity of abortion restrictions, there is this crazy thing that politicians occasionally engage in called “persuasion.” Rather than just chasing around voters for approval, this entails convincing them with arguments.



The problem, it seems, is that too many in the GOP accept the media’s concern trolling or listen to risk-averse advice of the consulting class. Take Wisconsin. On the same day Republicans took a supermajority in the legislature, Janet Protasiewicz beat conservative Dan Kelly by 10 percentage points to flip the state’s Supreme Court. Virtually every outlet treated the race, in which 36 percent of Wisconsin voters showed up, as a national referendum on abortion. Anonymous consultants were recruited to offer off-the-record comments voicing their deep concern about the deleterious effects of the abortion issue. “The drubbing Republicans took in Wisconsin this week revealed how harmful the issue of abortion still is to the party — and will likely remain through 2024,” Politico explained. “Wisconsin Supreme Court election sends message on abortion rights,” says the Washington Post. And so on.



Weird how this dynamic only works in one direction. In 2020, Brain Kemp, who signed a heartbeat bill limiting abortion to the first six weeks a year earlier, easily defeated media darling Stacey Abrams to win the Georgia governorship (in a state that Donald Trump also lost.) Abrams made abortion, along with guns, the central issue of her campaign, carpet-bombing the state with ads. In 2018, Terry McAuliffe also attempted to make abortion the dominant issue of his campaign against Glenn Youngkin. At the time, two of the Washington Post’s most dedicated partisan flaks promised that the race was “our first big test of the new politics of abortion.” Well, Youngkin, who supports 15-week abortion limits, won. Alas, there were no four-bylined handwringing deep dives from the Post about abortion undermining Democrats.



Georgia and Virginia are swing states. Ohio, where Mike DeWine signed a six-week ban in 2019 and won the state by 10 points in 2022, was one not long ago, as well. This is the same state in which pro-life JD Vance easily beat “moderate” Tim Ryan. But Ohio and Virginia teach nothing about abortion. Only the Wisconsin Supreme Court race matters.



This week, the governor of Florida and prospective presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis, signed a six-week ban on abortion. One imagines DeSantis will be just as popular among Republicans in his state since the bill passed overwhelmingly in the Florida Assembly. Of course, conventional wisdom says this hurts his presidential chances.



Every GOP president since Ronald Reagan has taken a pro-life position. Even in a post-Dobbs world, the idea that abortion is going to be the determinative factor in the presidential race is likely wishful thinking. Now that Roe has been overturned, the president has even less say over the future of abortion. Abortion has become a state issue. That’s what irks Dems.



Whatever the case, the Republican nominee doesn’t need to impress California voters. They need to convince social conservatives in Virginia, Ohio, and Florida to go out and vote. Does anyone really think DeSantis would be better off politically if he vetoed a pro-life bill? Running from the abortion conversation, as so many Republicans seem to do, creates the impression they don’t really believe in their own stated position. Quite often, that’s probably the case. If you’re going to run as a pro-lifer, allowing the opposition to define your beliefs makes little sense. Especially when making a rational and moral case for protecting viable life, at the very least, isn’t particularly difficult — certainly not when contrasted with the left’s extremism.   



Then again, if every Republican lost every race in the country over abortion, it still wouldn’t make killing human beings for convenience any less of a moral abomination or the fight to stop it any less important. A majority position isn’t, by default, moral or decent — quite the contrary. And meaningful political fights aren’t predicated on short-term gains. Overturning Roe took 50 years. The political fight over abortion might take even longer.

"138",138,"Report: Abortion Industry Routinely Offers Women Grisly, Unsanitary Facilities","Wallace","Deanna",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-12-13"," For me, the fight for abortion clinic standards started with a name: Deanna Bell. I will never forget the moment I first saw her name on a list of women who had died from “safe,” legal abortion. I felt an immediate connection to this young girl who shared my name. Deanna was only 13 years old when she died at an abortion clinic in Chicago that had not been inspected for 18 years despite having a history of unsanitary and unsafe conditions that put women and girls at risk. I quickly learned that Deanna was not alone. Since Roe v Wade was decided in 1973, more than 400 women have died during abortion procedures, and countless others have been injured by the under-scrutinized, inadequately regulated, and profit-driven abortion industry.  In a new investigative report “Unsafe: How The Public Health Crisis in America’s Abortion Clinics Endangers Women,” Americans United for Life shines a light on some of these largely untold stories of heartbreak, profiling 11 of the thousands of women who have been killed or gravely injured in legal abortion clinics. These profiles include the very women whom abortion advocates claim “need” abortion access the most: underage girls, poor women, and women of color. The stories of substandard treatment, indifference, and negligence include a refugee who could not even read her “informed consent” form, a teenager whose mother begged for an ambulance to be called for her critically injured daughter, and women whose desperate calls for help went unanswered by abortionists who had already left the state. Putting Women’s Health at Risk “Unsafe” also features a detailed analysis of hundreds of violation and deficiency reports from state health inspectors, showing that abortion clinics, including Planned Parenthood facilities, have been routinely cited for putting women’s health and safety at risk over the past eight years. Among the most common violations found in America’s abortion clinics are failing to ensure a safe and sanitary environment, failing to document and protect patient records, failing to properly train staff, allowing unqualified staff to provide care to patients, using expired medications and medical supplies, failing to purchase and maintain required equipment, failing to adopt and follow health and safety protocols, failing to properly handle medications, failing to comply with physical facility standards, and failing to monitor patient vital signs. More than 750 major violations of these common-sense health and safety standards were found over just the past eight years. Shockingly, at least 65 of the abortion providers examined were chronic offenders who had been cited multiple times for the same violations in subsequent years. Further, at least 13 abortion providers either failed to report suspected sexual abuse of a minor or failed to implement practices to protect minors from ongoing sexual abuse. At least 30 abortion providers failed to provide or post all required informed consent information, and more than two dozen abortion clinics failed to comply with abortion reporting requirements. While these numbers are appalling, it is important to note that this is simply the tip of the iceberg, as in some states it is difficult or impossible to obtain information regarding abortion clinics and individual providers.  Supreme Court Ignores Safety Evidence Yet despite the overwhelming body of evidence demonstrating the abortion industry’s proclivity for putting women’s health at risk, the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt prioritized “mere access” to abortion facilities and abortion industry profitability over women’s health and safety. In evaluating the potential damage this flawed decision may inflict upon American women, it is important to remember that Philadelphia abortionist and convicted murderer Kermit Gosnell provided “mere access” to abortion in a clinic where a woman died because a stretcher could not fit through the hallways, where unsterilized instruments spread infections, and where parts of unborn babies were stored in jars and cat food cans like macabre trophies. Despite claims to the contrary by abortion advocates, the evidence compiled in “Unsafe” clearly demonstrates that Gosnell is not an aberration, but rather the norm in an industry desperate to avoid all meaningful regulation and oversight. While Donald Trump’s election has reinvigorated hopes of overturning Roe, we must take care not to neglect the fight to protect women that is currently taking place in many state legislatures. We must not forget that every single day women are frightened, lied to, coerced, and even forced into abortions that put their lives at risk. We cannot abandon them to unscrupulous “doctors” who don’t care about their safety or clinics that care only about the fees they can collect and not the women they harm. We must continue to fight for the safety of these women with the same passion with which we fight for the safety of their unborn children. We must continue to fight for girls like Deanna Bell.

"139",139,"Will The NYT’s Survey Of Women Who Had Abortions Tell The Truth About Our Pain?","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-05-29"," In late April The New York Times posted a survey asking women to share their experiences with abortion. The paper has a long record of gaslighting women who regret aborting their children, insisting post-abortion trauma doesn’t exist and marginalizing the feelings of millions of women. In the #MeToo era, at a time when feminists repeat “every woman should be believed” like a mantra, was the survey a signal The New York Times finally recognizes the suffering of so many women? Would the newspaper finally stop telling women their feelings aren’t real? I doubt it. Articles attempting to debunk the negative experience of abortion continue to be everywhere. Those of us who have experienced the negative consequences find it frustrating and unjust.  “The Conversation” recently published an article telling us “There is no evidence to suggest that induced abortion has any significant impact on persistent and serious mental health issues.” BuzzFeed News was also right in there with the article “Here’s Why Mamamia Just Deleted an Article About Abortion.” The article goes on to tell us once again about the lack of “evidence” about abortion’s negative impact. Even a Small Percentage Is Millions of Women In the article, Kate Marsh of Queensland pro-choice counseling service Children by Choice states, in an attempt to solidify abortion supporters’ beliefs, “We offer post-abortion counselling for the small numbers of women and pregnant people who’ll require it, but it makes up less than 5% of our work,” she said. “This is demand driven, not because we’ve decided to only devote a small amount of time to it.” In the United States since the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973, we have aborted 60 million unborn babies. Five percent of their mothers experiencing regret, which for many reasons I believe is extremely low, would still mean we are speaking about millions of women. Secondly, would those experiencing negative effects go to a place where it is obvious their experiences are denied, and they are told their struggles do not exist? Of course not! A quick look at quoted research papers or Web sites such as the Guttmacher Institute, a former arm of Planned Parenthood whose business is abortion, would quickly let a woman know that she is not allowed to say abortion hurt her and that if she is saying it did, she certainly had prior mental health issues.  How is it that today we can be traumatized by someone using the wrong pronoun to address us, put crying rooms on campuses because of stress, or condemn someone for wearing a dress of a different culture, but women are not allowed to say they are traumatized by an abortion experience during which they participated in the death of their child? Who Is Really Putting the Stigma on Abortion? The extreme pro-abortion groups are quick to cite the so-called “stigma” of abortion, blaming regret on society. I venture to say the stigma comes from them, as they refuse to believe the experiences of the women speaking out and continue to deny our existence and the very real effects abortion has on mental health for countless numbers of women. After 20 years of working in post-abortion healing with an average of 200 new clients each year, I know millions of us are out there living with this negative impact, yet not once have organizations like Operation Outcry or Silent no More, or any of the several ministries that assist women to heal, have been called to participate in the media-touted so-called studies. Millions of women continue to live in silence and suffer alone because they are afraid to let anyone know of their abortions. They think they are crazy that it bothers them because, after all, they are constantly told there is no such thing as post-abortion trauma. Some live in fear because they have not told a spouse. Some are unable to have other children, while others turn to addictions.  The very fact that there is such an intense effort to deny what we have experienced shows that those who promote abortion fear the truth so must pretend we do not exist. What a great disservice to women. The Times Has Shunned Women’s Stories Before Should we give The New York Times the benefit of the doubt and take the newspaper at its word when it says it wants to hear real stories from women who have had abortions? The paper’s track record doesn’t give me much hope. As The American Thinker’s Ed Lasky noted, The New York Times has a history of ignoring peer-reviewed studies that don’t support the pro-abortion line, and gives disproportionate coverage to sources who deny women suffer from the procedure. On the rare occasions the Times does recognize there are women and groups on the other side, it’s only to claim they subscribe to bunk science and are confused about their own feelings. When I read articles denying the very real problems abortion has caused for women, I can’t help but think of many hurting women we have served over the years, like Mary, who ended up working with me for many years. Mary’s husband had coerced her into an abortion, threatening to leave her if she did not comply. Besieged with depression, each year around the anniversary date of her abortion she ended up hospitalized, but as is the case so often, no one would acknowledge her post-abortion trauma. How many women are currently in hospitals or recovery programs with no one acknowledging their experiences? Mary suffered alone for 20 years before she found us and began the process of healing from what the pro-abortion contingency says does not exist. This woman suffered for decades feeling crazy for her feelings because society chose to deny them. There are millions of women like Mary out there. I filled out The New York Times survey, but not because I thought the truth will be told, or because I think The New York Times cares and wants to let women that are suffering know they are not alone. A prime example of this can be found in their January 28, 2011 article, “Parenthood not Abortion Linked to Mental Illness,” where they actually quoted our blog Reclaiming Our Children. It is no surprise that instead of saying who we are—woman who have had abortions helping each other—they label us “anti-abortion” and deny our experiences. No, I filled out the survey hoping maybe someone who is suffering in silence will see she is not crazy nor alone. We are out here, countless numbers who have experienced what they are going through, ready to accompany others on their healing journey.

"140",140,"No, Life Doesn’t Go ‘Back To Normal’ After An Abortion","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-07-14"," On July 10, I dragged myself out of bed and took the ride to Brooklyn to participate with others at St. Paul’s Church for Mass and a procession to a Planned Parenthood facility to pray that moms would change their minds and babies would not die.
As someone coerced into an abortion as a teen, I know all too well the repercussions of abortion. I also know countless numbers of women believe that if they terminate an unplanned pregnancy, life will return to the way it was before the pregnancy.
Because of this knowledge, I brought a sign I had made as an effort to get those entering the abortion facility to know that just is not true, and to offer concrete help. It says: “I had an abortion. Life does not go back to normal. Save your baby and yourself! Call 800-723-8331.”
As Mass was about to end that morning, we could hear the chants outside by the radical group NYC for Abortion Rights. They were determined to block our path to the abortion center while hurling chants our way.
Thanks to the presence of the police, who formed a line to separate us, we were shielded from them screaming in our faces, as they tried to drown out our prayer and disrupt the vigil. The thing that struck me most was the irony of what they shouted, and their ignorance to the reality of abortion.
“Abortion saves lives”—whose, exactly? “God loves abortion”—which god is this?
The protesters screamed such slogans while wearing shirts that read “Abortion is freedom” (they obviously have not spoken to too many women who have had one) and trying to prevent us from getting to the abortion facility to pray. It took us two hours to walk seven blocks. Just who is harassing who?
As I looked at the many young faces, it struck me how ignorant they were and how they have grown up in abortion culture. They probably have never been shown or told the truth of the destruction of abortion, not only in the death of the baby but of the mother, father, and countless others who are injured. It was obvious they bought into pro-abortion rhetoric and the lies of the industry.
I didn’t feel mad, I felt really sad for them and incredibly grateful to God that I had experienced His mercy. It’s a mercy I know is waiting for each of them if they want it.
Our society has gone way past the “safe and rare” sold us when abortion was legalized. We have come to a place of abortion any time, for any reason.
We now use these poor babies for experimentation, and no one blinks an eye. They are sold on the market, and the silence from so-called leaders and even citizens is deafening.
Just last week, the body of a baby was found in the trash at an Ohio abortion center, and two abortionists from New Mexico were caught experimenting on women who came to their facilities. When will it end? What will be too much? How did we get here?
Towards the end of the day as we were in front of Planned Parenthood, I happened to drop my sign. One of the young women with the pro-abortion group picked it up and would not give it back to me. Instead, she got a magic marker and wrote on the opposite side “God loves abortion.” A police officer saw and made her return it to me.
I could not help but think how her actions proved how true my sign really was. This was not normal behavior.
After an abortion, life does not go “back to normal.” You either live in denial, or become pro-life. I know for sure God does not love abortion, but despite this woman mocking God and being so intent on glorifying abortion, He loves her.

"142",142,"Legalizing Abortion Hasn’t Ended The Back Alley","Freund","Chris",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-04-18"," When Tina walked into the Planned Parenthood abortion center in Richmond, Virginia, that warm July 2014 day, it’s impossible to know what thoughts were going through her mind. Was she scared? Was her decision to have an abortion an easy one, or extraordinarily difficult? Did she have someone with her to give her support, or was she there through the subtle coercion of the child’s father? Whatever the case, she perhaps believed the soft pastel brochures and warm assurances from Planned Parenthood that she’d receive the finest women’s health care available. Maybe a friend sold her on Planned Parenthood as the best option. Perhaps she was a regular customer. Or maybe it was just conveniently located in her neighborhood, or close to her job.  When she walked out of that Planned Parenthood facility, maybe she believed her pregnancy had been “terminated.” Two months later, as Tina sat in the outpatient emergency department of a local hospital, she may have regretted her decision to trust Planned Parenthood. When the medical staff at that hospital told her she’d have to undergo a second-trimester abortion when she thought the Richmond Planned Parenthood had “taken care” things in July, perhaps she realized that the soft pastels and warm rhetoric had all been a lie. While the name Tina is fictitious, the story above is real, and based on a patient file from the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood’s Richmond, Virginia, abortion center on Hamilton Street, included in an inspection report from a Virginia Department of Health official. According to the official’s report, obtained by The Family Foundation of Virginia through a Freedom of Information Act request, this is what happened.    Based on this report, one could conclude that the Richmond abortion center not only failed to perform the first-trimester abortion and potentially lied on the patient documentation, but also failed to properly read an ultrasound done during a follow-up appointment, not noticing that the unborn child was still there.  Perhaps there is another viable explanation, but the timeline would certainly indicate that the Richmond Planned Parenthood likely botched the abortion and the follow-up care, resulting in the patient ending up in an emergency room and hospital. Officials Refuse to Investigate Well, you say, this is just one case. That Planned Parenthood abortion center does hundreds of abortions per year. Mistakes happen. Or, as one political appointee of Gov. Terry McAuliffe to the Virginia Board of Health, the group empowered to oversee abortion center regulations, put it, maybe you “just don’t want to hear” about that one patient. The truth is, women could end up in emergency departments after botched abortions and no one else would ever know. But this is just one case we know about. We also only know because Virginia’s abortion center health and safety standards require abortion facilities to report to the state any time a malpractice file is claimed, which happened in this case. Unfortunately, because of the secrecy that surrounds so many abortions, where women don’t want friends or family to know, few malpractice claims are actually filed. So women harmed stay silent, and the abortion doctors continue on unrestricted. How many other patient files at Planned Parenthood or Virginia’s other abortion centers contain similar stories is anyone’s guess, except of course for Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry. They know.  The truth is, women could end up in emergency departments after botched abortions and no one else would ever know. Women can end up in emergency departments or at a doc-in-a-box or even at their primary care physician with an infection due to unsterile abortion center environments and no one would ever know. This is the case because there is absolutely no law or regulation in Virginia that requires medical personnel to report most injuries or complications sustained during abortions. Shoot the Messenger I say “most” because the very abortion health and safety standards Virginia’s pro-Planned Parenthood governor has targeted for watering down require abortion centers to report to the Department of Health’s Office of Licensure and Certification any “serious injury” that results from an abortion. “Serious injury” is not defined. The Richmond Planned Parenthood did not deem a failed abortion that resulted in an emergency room visit, surgery, and hospital stay as a ‘serious injury.’ In this specific case, according to the Office of Licensure and Certification, the Richmond Planned Parenthood did not deem a failed abortion that resulted in an emergency room visit, surgery, and hospital stay as a “serious injury” because it was not reported as of September 30, 2014. The health and safety standards do not require the medical personnel at the emergency room where the woman ends up to report anything to anyone. Consequently, few if any complications to abortion are recorded anywhere. Remarkably, in an act of unfettered arrogance, McAuliffe recently held a ceremony at that same Richmond Planned Parenthood facility, where he vetoed legislation that would have protected Virginia taxpayers from subsidizing the abortion industry by blocking non-Medicaid funding. My guess is that “Tina” wasn’t invited to participate. The $1 billion abortion industry, with the help of its PR machine and the mainstream media, has sold itself to be the epitome of women’s health care. Video scandal or not, most Americans are either too disinterested or too naive to believe otherwise. Unfortunately, it’s a myth the Tinas of the world have to live with for the rest of their lives.

"143",143,"For Proof Abortion Is Inhumane, Look No Further Than Supporters’ Defenses Of Killing Disabled People","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-01-26"," Evidence of the humanity of the unborn and the inhumanity of abortion activists continues to accumulate. The most recent revelation of the latter came in the form of a tweet promoting the pro-“choice” position, declaring: “It is okay to think that every child matters however a lot of them do not hence the amnio test which should be a mandatory test and if it proves negative and the woman does not want to abort then all bills accrued after that is on her and the father … ” And then thinking she was proving her point, the abortion advocate, using the Twitter handle @OBSIDIANSMOAK, included a screen shot of 9-year-old Sophia, a little girl who suffers from Rett syndrome, “a rare neurological disorder that affects a child’s ability to eat, speak, walk and breathe [and] an unknown syndrome that has caused facial deformities.”  Sophia’s mother, Natalie Weaver, reported the tweet, but when Twitter initially responded that it had found no violation of its rules, Weaver blasted the social media mogul for refusing to suspend @OBSIDIANSMOAK for, as Weaver put it, “using my child’s image as the poster child to ABORT & to weed out all the ‘defectives’ in utero … ” Weaver, who co-founded of Advocates for Medically Fragile Kids NC, suggested Twitter “also add ‘hate towards people with disabilities’ to their violation reporting categories,” reported Fox News. Twitter later apologized and suspended @OBSIDIANSMOAK’s account, but the post’s very existence and Twitter’s initial response exposes a sad reality: Abortion isn’t about choice, it’s about dead babies — at least when the unborn aren’t “perfect,” according to our flawed human standard. While @OBSIDIANSMOAK’s tweet stirred outrage, it was only because of the bluntness of the post — not the content. The Left regularly rests its defense on late-term abortions on the disease, disability, or deformity of the unborn — they just do so more gently. So gently, in fact, that news outlets succeeded in positively spinning Iceland’s “eradication” of Down Syndrome through abortion, even though  the “choice” exercised by 100 percent of the mothers-to-be flowed from pressure and propaganda.  Those pushing for Ireland to legalize abortion likewise tout a eugenics-based justification for abortion.   Then there was the (Liberal) Women’s March this weekend, where Kelsey Harkness, Federalist contributor and Senior News Producer for the Daily Signal News, spoke with attendees about abortion. The typical tripe of “choice” and “bodily integrity” made appearances, but so too did the idea that ending up in foster care or adoptive homes is “worse than abortion.” So, now pro-“choice” advocates aren’t just judging physical “perfection,” they are also presenting privilege (or lack thereof) as a litmus test for life. Abortion — it’s about dead babies. A recent vote in the House of Representatives exposed a similar truth. As Timothy Jackson detailed earlier this week, when the House voted on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act — which would require health care practitioners to exercise reasonable care for born alive infants and immediately admit the babies to a hospital — “nearly all Democrats in the House voted against it.”  This law has nothing to do with a woman exercising control over her body; this law only applies after the abortion procedure is completed and the baby is born alive. Yet Democrats, en masse, opposed the legislation. So, for the Left, abortion also isn’t about a woman’s right to bodily integrity, it’s about dead babies. The advancement of artificial wombs further revealed this reality. When scientists announced the promising results of testing of artificial-womb technology on premature lambs in April 2017, abortion activists expressed concern over the impact on the “right” to abortion. At the time, according to Gizmodo, I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law School bioethicist, suggested the technology “has the potential to really disrupt things, first by asking the question of whether a fetus could be considered ‘viable’ at the time of abortion if you could place it in an artificial womb.”  Cohen added:  “It could wind up being that you only have the right to an abortion up until you can put [a fetus] in the artificial womb. It’s terrifying.” Well, it would only be terrifying if what activists really want women to have is a dead baby — and not merely control over their own bodies.  Abortion isn’t about choice. Abortion isn’t about bodily autonomy. Abortion isn’t about what is best for the baby. And abortion isn’t even about what is best for women, because if it were, abortion activists wouldn’t seek to silence the suffering of women who have aborted their children. At the end of the day, alone in the night, they cry for their children, because women know the truth: fetus is merely the technical term for an unborn baby, and abortion kills their unborn baby. They suffer greatly, as A.D.P. Efferson exposed earlier this week: “We know it’s a lie that abortion doesn’t harm women. We know this anecdotally, from talking with mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends who have had abortions, and shared their stories of pain, doubt, shame, guilt, and suffering. We also know it from research that demonstrates quantitatively that significant numbers of women are left clinically depressed as a direct result of having had an abortion.” Women deserve better.

"145",145,"Race-Obsessed Leftists Don’t Want To Talk About The Abortion Rate Of Black Babies","Stone","Austin",NA,"T.W. Shannon",NA,NA,"2022-02-25"," In a hearing last week about racism in public school curriculum, Arizona state Rep. Walt Blackman said any “honest conversation” about America’s past of slavery and discrimination must also acknowledge the genocide of our present age: abortion. 



“There are more black babies aborted than born every day,” he said. 




State Representative @theWaltBlackman drops the mic on House Democrats today during the vote to approve Rep. Kaiser's #HCR2001, a measure to stop critical race theory and racial discrimination in schools. #azleg pic.twitter.com/vNihdA7o1K— Arizona House Republicans (@AZHouseGOP) February 17, 2022
White leftist activists constantly talk about racism, but they conveniently ignore that their sacred cow of abortion is racist to its core.



Abortion should never have become a political football. It used to be something every American, Democrat and Republican, agreed was wrong. 



Democrat politician and activist Jesse Jackson is a good example. In 1975, he compared the Roe v. Wade decision to slavery: “There are those who argue that the right to privacy is of a higher order than the right to life … That was the premise of slavery.” But after Jackson ran for the Democrat presidential nomination in 1988, he conformed to the pro-choice party line.



Since then, a tragic dissonance has ensued in the black community over party affiliation and abortion. While most black Americans (54 percent) think abortion is morally unacceptable, they are still more closely associated with the Democratic Party and its abortion-friendly platform. Many black voters find themselves out of step with Democrat candidates seeking their votes, especially on social issues, similar to blue-collar voters who feel Democrat policies have left them behind.



Democrats can easily reconcile with their voter base on this issue. Restoring respect for all life would win the hearts of many in the black community. 



A recently released report from an organization we work with, the Center for Urban Renewal and Education (CURE), shows the devastating effects of abortion on generations of black Americans. The report details the abortion industry’s predatory practices — how abortion providers seek out minority women, advertise directly to them, and sometimes perform illegal procedures, like the infamous late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell. This multi-billion dollar industry isn’t trying to protect anyone’s rights; it’s trying to profit off desperate women, especially black women.



In 2012, the Life Issues Institute reported that “79% of Planned Parenthood’s surgical abortion facilities are strategically located within walking distance of African-American and/or Hispanic communities.” In 2017, they updated these numbers to include 25 new abortion mega centers, 100 percent of which were within walking distance of minority neighborhoods. With each abortion bringing in hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on whether they are early- or late-term abortions, it’s clear that abortion providers are engaging in a grisly sort of supply-side economics.



Worse still, abortion has always been a tool of racial eugenics, the ideology that seeks to limit “undesirable” black births. Star Parker, the founder of CURE and author of the report, argues that “From its inception, the abortion industry has sought to control and hinder the growth of the Black population, a core objective of the movement’s founders.” 



This is a historical fact. Margaret Sanger, the founder of abortion giant Planned Parenthood, was a racial eugenicist who was concerned that “the mass of Negroes … still breed carelessly and disastrously,” and hired black pastors lest “word go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.” Many other early abortion activists, such as Hugh Moore and Edward Ross, sought to expand abortion to prevent non-white population growth. Today, there are still abortion activists who behave like the black community needs more abortions.



The politicization of abortion — an issue that is moral to its core — is a wound in our national fabric that we feel deeply and personally. One of us was born to a single mother and later adopted, but many others in the exact same situation were aborted. We work with CURE to support policies that help mothers with unplanned pregnancies avoid the grievous act of abortion. Black mothers especially face intense manipulation and pressure because of the politics of abortion. 



We must restore bipartisan moral common sense and offer hope to these women. There is no hope without justice, and there’s no justice without truth. We can’t talk about racism without talking about the dark stain on our society that abortion represents. Black Americans, who suffer disproportionately from abortion, deserve equal rights, including the right to life. The unborn deserve racial justice too.

"146",146,"Why It Can Be So Hard To Choose Adoption Over Abortion","Carrington","Emily",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-05-23"," One night as I was droning through Facebook, I noticed a plea for prayer from pro-life leader Abby Johnson: “A woman in her third trimester is scheduled to abort her twins this week. She has an adoption plan, but because of deceit and manipulation, she believes abortion is now her best option.” The next day Abby updated supporters: “UPDATE: The mother scheduled to abort her twins in the 3rd trimester has NOT shown up for her appointment that was scheduled for this morning…Please keep praying. She has not yet made a firm decision for life.”  As I read these posts I felt desperate for the babies. I thought about how pro-lifers did everything right to avoid the need for an abortion. A family made a commitment to life inside and outside of the womb as they opened their home to two children. If the nearly full-term babies have been assured a place in a family, why would a woman still consider an abortion? Others echoed my frustration as the comment section filled quickly with people praying for the babies, praying that the woman would choose life, praying for the adoptive parents, and even praying for the adoption stories of other families. Other commenters were confused. They couldn’t figure out why she couldn’t just have a C-section and give the children to the adoptive mother waiting for her babies. The babies had to come out, so why not take them out alive? This story felt extra hopeless because both sides of the abortion debate often champion adoption. Even while celebrating Roe v. Wade, President Obama affirmed adoption as an alternative to abortion as he called Americans to “stay united in our determination to prevent unintended pregnancies, support pregnant women and mothers, reduce the need for abortion, encourage healthy relationships, and promote adoption.” So why would a nearly full-term mother with an adoption plan still consider an abortion? Adoption or Abortion: A Distinction Without A Difference? Perhaps from her perspective, abortion isn’t that different from adoption. Yes, one decision would lead to life and the other to death, but in either case, the woman would lose her babies. For one mother to adopt a baby, another mother must relinquish her parental rights. While one mother celebrates unity with her child, the other mother suffers separation. While many prayed she would be willing to save her children’s lives, many overlooked the suffering she would endure as a mother facing child loss.  Yes, one decision would lead to life and the other to death, but in either case, the woman would lose her babies. Our current dialogue is inadequate, as so much of the adoption versus abortion debate focuses on the baby and the best way for the birth mother to get rid of it. While there are many ways to separate mother from child, you can never separate a mother from her motherhood, despite a general assumption to the contrary. For her doctor at the abortion clinic and other pro-choice advocates, the woman’s reality as a mother is not a concern. Behind the many misguided justifications of abortion is a dangerous lie: a pregnant woman only becomes a mother when she chooses to be a mother. Prior to this choice, she has the freedom to reject not only the life of her own child, but her own motherhood. This lie is driven by a focus on the woman and her equal right to walk away from sexual activity. According to Obama, “We must also continue our efforts to ensure that our daughters have the same rights, freedoms, and opportunities as our sons to fulfill their dreams.” The burden of pregnancy and parenthood can inhibit freedom, but making abortions available can free a woman from her motherhood. In adoption, however, pro-lifers make a similar, though less deadly, assumption. We do not say that a woman who gives up her baby for adoption was never a mother. But we at times neglect to speak of her as a mother, as though, in the act of adoption, she can and does give up her motherhood. To respond to pro-choice advocates such as the president, pro-lifers must proclaim that not only that life but also motherhood begins at conception, and that any mother without her baby is a tragedy.  Motherhood Without A Child To fully affirm motherhood, we must recognize that not every mother is easy to identify. Some mothers don’t have a minivan full of sticky hands and Cheerios. Instead, these women are alone and silent. Whether the woman suffered a pregnancy or child loss, elected for an abortion, or decided to offer her baby up for an adoption; whether the pregnancy was planned or unplanned, wanted or unwanted: this woman became a mother when life started inside of her. Whether the pregnancy was wanted or unwanted, this woman became a mother when life started inside of her. Unfortunately for these mothers, society continues to perpetuate the narrative that you are not a mother until you choose to have babies in your arms. But for these women who have held life in their wombs yet have empty arms, their motherhood is real. While it might seem this lie started with modern abortion rhetoric, women have been encouraged to escape their motherhood for more than 70 years. In her work “The Girls Who Went Away,” Ann Fessler presents stories of women who surrendered their children for adoption during the decades between World War II and Roe v. Wade, a time known as “The Baby Scoop Era.” While every story is unique, the general outline is the same: young women faced with unwanted pregnancies forced to go off to maternity homes alone, deliver their child, and then coerced into surrendering their child for adoption, all guided by the lie that they could return to their lives and pre-mother identity. But each story speaks of the haunting reality that their babies changed these mothers. Abortion Is the New ‘Baby Scoop’ Some respond to the tragedies of this era by arguing we need to discourage the adoption narrative as a lingering relic of that oppression. In her article “Shotgun Adoption,” Kathryn Joyce argues that nothing has changed as she condemns modern crises pregnancy centers for using the same “deceptive tactics” to “hinder abortion access,” pointing Fessler’s work as the beginning of this coercive narrative. Instead of forcing adoption on single but otherwise fit women, professionals and experts now offer abortion as a way to escape motherhood. Joyce’s objections, however, misunderstand the continuity between “The Baby Scoop Era” and today, since the deceptive tactics used then now linger in pro-abortion rhetoric. According to The Baby Scoop Era Research Initiative, it was the influx of professional social workers and sociologists into Christian maternity homes that ushered in this period. They promoted adoption as “the best solution to the challenges presented by single motherhood.” In Fessler’s book one woman explains, “Those social workers kept telling me I wasn’t good enough to parent my son.” Another was told, “Your baby could have a better life. How would you dare to cheat your baby out of this good life.” No longer grounded in Christian charity, professionals were concerned with social progress. Progress demanded that they could (and should) make the choice to no longer be mothers. Although Joyce points to abortion as what freed women from this era, women have not been freed. Instead of forcing adoption on single but otherwise fit women, professionals and experts now offer abortion as a way to escape motherhood. Abortion didn’t fix the problem, it only allowed for it to continue and foster our own “Scoop Era” that takes the lives of nearly three-quarters of a million U.S. children per year. Women choose abortions because abortion advocates tell women the same lie today: Women can (and should) give up their motherhood. The Response: Adoption as Paradox The reality of motherhood requires the pro-life movement to recognize a tension: adoption is life-affirming and good, but adoption is also tragic. Unfortunately, some circumstances require separating a mother and child, and pro-lifers must offer life-giving opportunities in this case without overlooking the motherhood of the woman. The reality of motherhood requires the pro-life movement to recognize a tension: adoption is life-affirming and good, but adoption is also tragic. The modern adoption process recognizes this tension—the role of the mother in the process has increased. Today mothers can choose the adoptive family for their babies based on profiles and enter into an open adoption, reducing the separation. The mother is also provided with counseling services and care throughout her pregnancy and after giving birth. Perhaps those who acknowledge this best are the adoptive families who live in this tension of dual motherhood. In a beautiful blog post about the birth mothers of her two children, Shayann Barger—who has two children from two different mothers, one with a closed adoption and one with an open adoption—demonstrates the bond between adoptive and birth mothers. This connection is not only based on shared experiences, but a recognition that they “are BOTH mothers.” She emphasizes: “Please note, I said mothers. Plural. Mothers. We do not co-parent, but we both completely love our little girl as mothers.” Barger describes the love she has for these women: “there is no word yet created, in any language, that describes the intimate bond that is created when one woman places a piece of herself into another woman’s arms to raise.” Barger not only affirms life, but affirms motherhood. Speaking Love in The Darkness While those who are immediately connected to adoption address the motherhood of the birth mother, our public language is still haunted with the lies about pregnancy and motherhood. Barger’s piece on her feelings for her children’s birth mothers comes as a defense of comments she hears as an adoptive mother. If an adoptive mother is harmed by our lazy dialogue, imagine its effect on the birth mother. She writes to respond to people who make comments “wondering how somebody could ever ‘give her baby away’ or inquire if my daughter’s birth mother was on drugs, or homeless, or even make that statement implying that my child’s birth mother didn’t love him/her, criticize her decision, judge her healing or coping.” If an adoptive mother is harmed by our lazy dialogue, imagine its effect on the birth mother. To adequately address this, the pro-life movement must affirm not only the life of the baby, but the motherhood of the woman. Billboards, picket signs, and Facebook memes all rightly proclaim the life of the unborn baby, but we must add to this proclaiming the motherhood of the woman. This won’t magically fix the problem, but it will further the cause of life. This is not simply rhetoric; this is the truth. This truth not only discourages abortion, but encourages love and sympathy as we care for the women in crisis pregnancies. As I dwelt on the woman in Abby’s story, I realized my own inadequate compassion, insufficient prayers, and failure in my conversations. I had failed to see the difficulty of a choice between two options that leave a mother childless. With the prayer of many and the support of the adoptive mother, this woman did make decision for life—but not without a struggle. While we don’t know what caused this woman to reconsider an abortion, we have to acknowledge the tragedy of separating mother and child. The better we publically understand her pain as a bereaved mother, the more room she has to grieve the loss of her children. Perhaps, as we give her this space, the more we might empower her to make a choice for life.

"147",147,"Post-Roe America Is Not The First Instance Of Abortion Supporters Inflating Illegal Abortions","Troutman","Elizabeth",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-08-17"," Abortion advocates argue the Supreme Court overturn of Roe v. Wade will only cause more women to seek illegal abortions. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said “women are going to die” due to abortion restrictions. A New York Times editorial last week said more women are “self-managing” abortions. Protestors outside the court brandish signs with hand-drawn coat hangers, suggesting women will use dangerous and violent self-induced abortion methods post-Roe. 



Members of the pro-abortion left have used this argument since the 1960s when two men exaggerated the number of illegal abortions occurring to convince women’s rights activist Betty Friedan to add abortion to the feminist platform. 



National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL) founders Larry Lader and Dr. Bernard Nathanson lobbied state legislatures to repeal abortion restrictions, but their success came when they linked abortion to the rise of feminism. Due to Lader and Nathanson’s influence, feminism transformed from a movement for equal rights to the belief that childless women are best equipped for success.



“If we’re going to move abortion out of the books and into the streets, we’re going to have to recruit the feminists,” Nathanson repeated Lader saying in his 1979 book. “Friedan has got to put her troops into this thing — while she still has control of them.”



In Friedan’s landmark feminist book, “The Feminine Mystique,” she encouraged women to seek jobs outside of the home, drawing attention to the “problem with no name,” the belief women could only achieve happiness through being a wife and mother. But Friedan wanted to protect a woman’s right to have a family.



“Women are the people who give birth to society, and that is a necessary value in society,” she said in an interview with Playboy. “Feminism was not opposed to marriage and motherhood. It wanted women to be able to define themselves as people and not just as servants to the family. You want a feminism that includes women who have children and want children because that’s the majority of women.”



A woman’s right to be a mother was a personal issue for Friedan, as she was fired from her job as a reporter in the 1940s because she was pregnant. Her feminism was not a fight against marriage and family, but a fight for equality. The first issue of “The Feminine Mystique” did not mention abortion, rather it focused on creating a world where women could be equals in the workplace without sacrificing their children. 



“It’s just so unrealistic to be a woman who is anti-family,” she said. 



Friedan was one of the founders of the National Organization for Women (NOW), writing its mission statement “to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.” Abortion legalization was absent from NOW’s founding list of issues. 



Shifting the Cause



After Lader, who wrote the biography of Planned Parenthood founder and eugenicist Margaret Sanger, founded NARAL with Nathanson, they worked to get feminists like Friedan on board with their cause. They overstated the number of illegal abortions in America to convince Friedan that true equality for women could be achieved only through the legalization of abortion. 



Nathanson, a former abortionist who became a vocal pro-life activist after becoming troubled about the number of unborn deaths he presided over, later admitted he and Lader fabricated the figures they told Friedan. 



“It was always ‘5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year,’” he said. “I confess that I knew the figures were totally false. … The overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated, and anything within reason that had to be done was permissible.” 



Lader and Nathanson’s intent was not to protect women but to provide a way for men to avoid accountability in light of the Sexual Revolution, Sue Ellen Browder wrote in her book “Subverted.”



Even after Lader and Nathanson convinced Friedan to become pro-abortion, she valued family, as she herself was a mother of three. She called feminists to shift their focus from abortion activism to issues she considered more important: child care, parental leave, and flexible work hours. 



“Ideologically, I was never for abortion. Motherhood is a value to me, and even today abortion is not. … I believed passionately in 1967, as I do today, that women should have the right of chosen motherhood,” Friedan said in 2000, six years before her death. “For me the matter of choice has never been primarily the choice of abortion, but that you can choose to be a mother. That is as important as any right written into the Constitution.”



Even the Left Knows Abortion Numbers Will Decrease



The pro-choice argument after the overturn of Roe mirrors the argument Lader and Nathanson made to Friedan: that making abortion illegal will not decrease abortions, but compel women to terminate their pregnancies through other means. 



But even left-wing pro-choicers admit the overturn of Roe will decrease abortion numbers. 



The New York Times article titled, “Most Women Denied Abortions By Texas Law Got Them Another Way” laments that the overturn of Roe “will cause some women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term,” which is another way of saying the decision saves unborn lives. Additionally, economists concluded a 2013 Texas bill that banned abortion at 20 weeks saved 3,230 unborn lives the year after the law took effect.



Randall K. O’Bannon, director of education and research at National Right to Life, said the abortion industry is encouraging women to seek self-induced abortions or chemical abortions by offering to fund their travel or send mifepristone and misoprostol pills to their homes.



“We’ve never claimed pro-life laws will stop all abortions, but a number of lives will be saved and that’s the point of the legislation, to encourage women to choose life for themselves and for their baby,” O’Bannon said. 



Abortion advocates have downplayed the life-saving nature of pro-life laws and rulings before, and they can trick Americans like they tricked Betty Friedan again.

"148",148,"How To Sidewalk Counsel Abortion-Minded Moms Without Going To Prison","Muzyka","Lauren",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-02-29"," As president and CEO of the nation’s largest sidewalk outreach organization serving outside of abortion facilities, I’m deeply concerned when I hear of someone being arrested for their presence at a facility. Recently, six pro-life activists in Tennessee were convicted for supposedly singing hymns outside an abortion facility. After throwing on my attorney hat and digging into the case, it became clear there was more to the story than many are letting on. I hope to shine a light on the difference between what I see as risky bravado and strategic, life-saving outreach. 



The facts of the case note that pro-life demonstrators in Tennessee were convicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act —  or, more definitively, for blocking the door of an abortion facility by sitting in front of it. Just last year, the Department of Justice (DOJ) convicted another group of individuals for violating the FACE Act after they blocked access to a Washington, D.C., abortion facility using their bodies, tying themselves to furniture with chains and ropes. One woman testified that the activists “grabbed at her, told her she was going to hell and followed her all the way into the clinic — where they barred her from entering,” WUSA9 reported. I was shocked to read about these modern-day “rescues,” as some are calling it, knowing how delicate it can be to win a life-saving conversation with a mother considering abortion.



The goal of Sidewalk Advocates for Life’s interaction with an abortion-minded mother is to soften her crisis such that she’ll consider life-affirming help. Our teams, unlike those described above, never physically block or touch a woman because we hope to create a safe place for dialogue, in contrast to the abortionist who wants to hurt her and her child. Sadly, modern-day “rescue” attempts often confuse women, making the abortion facility the safe haven, according to testimony from And Then There Were None, which ministers to former abortion workers.



Meanwhile, the Biden DOJ has been eager to use FACE specifically to protect the abortion industry, while failing to prosecute those who vandalize and threaten pro-life pregnancy centers, which can also be protected under the FACE Act. Even though the FACE Act is unjustly applied as a legislative weapon against pro-life activists and unnecessarily duplicative of local laws that already address the criminal activities the FACE Act purports to prohibit (e.g. trespassing, assault, etc.), sidewalk counselors can still work within the current legal landscape and reach people effectively.



I’ve dedicated my life to this cause, discerning how best to help abortion-vulnerable women choose life. After 22 years on the sidewalk, I can tell you that, to truly reach the heart of a mother in crisis, we have to go out of our way to create a safe, confidential space and avoid anything that could paint us as unapproachable or threatening, including doing anything illegal. Our peaceful, prayerful, law-abiding presence has helped us build relationships with thousands of women and their families when they encounter us in a dire moment of need, thereby saving their precious children.



Downsides of this Strategy



Regarding a law-breaking strategy, it’s hard to discern the perceived win of shutting down a facility for half a day while police are called, just to — according to testimonies of former abortion workers — have abortion appointments rescheduled at that facility or one nearby. It neither helps the pro-life movement nor a pregnant woman in crisis when an abortion facility closes for a few hours, pro-life individuals are arrested, and facilities reopen to continue the killing. Further, those individuals who sought to help are removed from ministry, tied up in needless litigation, and separated from the everyday conversations that change hearts and minds. This is in stark contrast to the numerous opportunities to reach women safely and legally on the public sidewalk. Additionally, it’s paramount that abortion facility outreach is law-abiding, because breaking any law outside an abortion facility gives state and city governments fodder to create unconstitutional buffer/bubble zones around abortion facilities, which put a perimeter around a facility to limit pro-lifers speaking with abortion-minded women. When sidewalk outreach is forced dozens of feet away from the facility, it can be very difficult to warmly, lovingly, and peacefully reach a woman in need.



Achievements of A Gentler Approach



While my heart understands the urgent drive to save preborn children from death, we must be wise as serpents and gentle as doves in these high-stakes, life-or-death scenarios. And there is an alternative that is working! Peaceful, prayerful sidewalk advocacy has proven to be effective, and we have trained thousands of people to connect with women using this tool, leading to 22,000 preborn children saved. Not to mention, our presence has given us opportunities to form friendships with abortion workers, encouraging 88 of them to leave their jobs. It has moved women who have experienced abortion to find healing and to report their sometimes-horrific experience to legal counsel, all of which helps shut down these facilities for good. We are now celebrating 55 abortion facility closures, in fact!As leaders, we have a moral obligation to wrestle with what is working and what is not. More confrontational approaches can seem like an exciting way to right the grave injustice of abortion, but I’ve yet to see it do that. These tactics rarely save preborn children or bring more understanding or compassion to our side — but they can put many well-intentioned people in federal prison. 



If we say yes to peaceful, prayerful, law-abiding outreach at an abortion facility, our name may not be in the headlines, but we’ll win a much greater prize: more lives of innocent children, more hearts of hurting women, and more communities gradually proclaiming a culture of life. And because we’re not embroiled in legal battles or imprisoned on federal charges, we’ll be free to reach countless more souls and save countless more lives for years to come.

"149",149,"Can The AP Be Trusted To Cover The Abortion Issue Fairly?","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-03-14"," Yesterday, abortion opponents were alerted to the latest example of media advocacy in favor of abortion when they read a dispatch from a pro-life event in D.C. by Associated Press reporter Philip Elliott, who “writes about politics and trends from Washington.” WASHINGTON (AP) — Calling their opponents Satan worshippers and savages, anti-abortion lawmakers on Wednesday insisted that Republican contenders keep an intense focus on social issues in the upcoming midterm elections and the 2016 presidential race. No, I did not just make that up. He really wrote that. Now, if you read the rest of his story and knew something about the pro-life movement, you could decipher that what had actually happened was that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had discussed a real thing that happened — and there are videos of it should you have more curiosity than an AP reporter — in Texas last year during debate over abortion legislation. Pro-choice activists countered pro-life prayers and singing with chants of “Hail Satan!”  There are five dozen references to these Satan chants in Nexis from the week it happened. Almost all of them — save mentions by the Independent (UK) and Telegraph (UK) — are from conservative, pro-life or religious media. You can read all about the failure of media to note this angle of an otherwise-obsessively-covered event in “Could it be … Satan? Not in the news coverage.” One of the very few American reporters to even note the Satan issue was Elspeth Reeve of TheWire.com. She attempted to debunk pro-life reports of the event but ended up beclowning herself. First she downplayed the idea that pro-lifers were skeeved out by the Satan chants: A few protesters against a Texas bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks appear to have chanted “Hail Satan” to mock anti-abortion protesters singing “Amazing Grace” in Austin on Wednesday. She said she “can’t make out the word ‘Satan,'” but acknowledges that a CNN producer had confirmed it on Twitter. Either way, she’s pretty sure she caught the pro-lifers lying about whether a little girl was holding a sign that read: “If I wanted the government in my womb, I would f*** a senator!” Except, well, whoopsie!  But other than these issues, Reeve’s attempt to fact-check the Satan-chants-and-disgusting-signs-held-by-children meme could not have gone better.  The AP has “updated” its article to be still wrong but not quite as wrong. It now reads: WASHINGTON (AP) — Invoking fiery references to Satan, “savagery” and a “culture of death” to criticize their opponents, anti-abortion lawmakers on Wednesday insisted that Republican contenders keep an intense focus on social issues in the upcoming midterm elections and the 2016 presidential race. Uh, no and no and also no. And “fiery”? Really? Dramatic much? Major props to the brave Melinda Henneberger of the Washington Post for writing a piece about the event that subtly but effectively took the AP reporter to town: And multiple complaints about news media bias seemed pretty accurately reflected in the initial Associated Press report on the dinner, which began this way: “Calling their opponents Satan worshipers and savages, antiabortion lawmakers on Wednesday insisted that Republican contenders keep an intense focus on social issues in the upcoming midterm elections and the 2016 presidential race.’’
Only, no one did call their opponents Satan-worshipers or savages; Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) described an abortion rights protest last year in Austin at which demonstrators shouted “Hail, Satan,’’ to drown out antiabortion protesters singing “Amazing Grace.”
Cruz described them as “arm-in-arm, chanting, ‘Hail, Satan,’ embracing the right to take the life of a late-term child.’’ Which certainly isn’t how those demonstrators would see it, but also isn’t the same as calling them Satan-worshipers.
The Associated Press reference to “savages” came from a comment by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that he refuses to call abortion rights supporters “pro-choice” because in his view “that’s a euphemism for the savagery they advocate.”
Isn’t the political rhetoric about this divide rancorous enough without exaggerating? Other media outlets that should have known to be more skeptical didn’t exhibit such smarts or courage. Religion News Service–not recently faring so well with shoddy handling of religious liberty and, well, comparisons of Christian kids to Nazis (since retracted)–got in on the action (since deleted, but the screencap follows). (Which was funny because they never got around to mentioning the Hail Satan crowd when it was actually, well, religion news.)  And National Journal’s Emma Roller packed more falsehoods into a few sentences than most reporters achieve in, well, twice that many sentences.  Just by way of example, let’s take her first sentence: “At a speech to an antiabortion crowd in Dallas on Wednesday night, Republican lawmakers outdid each other to denounce abortion.” She adopted Elliott’s take hook, line and sinker but forgot to also steal his dateline or details. Nobody spoke in Dallas and Lee and Cruz spoke during the day. Our not-so-diligent reporter had a few more mistakes before before asking, “How does an actual Satanist feel about that comparison?” And Lucia Graves, another National Journal reporter, wrote, “Ted Cruz compared abortion supporters to Satanists and Satantists responded with this…” So Ted Cruz gets accused of doing something he didn’t and one Satanist becomes Satanists! I love it! Except for how it’s not, you know, journalism and how the “actual” Satanist used by supposedly objective journalists to bash Ted Cruz turns out to be a tad more complicated. (See this Vice interview here or a more critical take here, or this sample of work here.) Worse Than One Bad Story Anyway, we were talking about the AP. And I worry that our problem with the AP is not just one very bad story. Remember the complete media melt-down over Susan G. Komen for the Cure’s attempt to get away from funding Planned Parenthood, the country’s largest abortion provider? For background, Planned Parenthood has a $1 billion budget and has ended the lives of 1 million unborn children in the last three years alone. Komen had a problem with what it used to call “crappy” grants — poor quality grants with minimal results — and redrafted a policy. This affected the 19 grants to Planned Parenthood in 16 communities. Planned Parenthood doesn’t actually perform mammograms and the affiliation with a large abortion business was seriously harming donations. The total amount Planned Parenthood received — $680,000, was less than one percent of Komen’s total $93 million community grant portfolio. The coordinated public relations campaign against Komen, joined by most media outlets, began with David Crary’s report for the Associated Press. (You can review media coverage of that debacle via my analyses from that time: February 2, 2012: Media discover Planned Parenthood is controversial , February 3: Media genuflect before Church of Planned Parenthood,  February 6: Planned Parenthood and media thank each other and February 7: Kurtz: Of course Komen stories were biased.) In former Komen executive Karen Handel’s book about what happened, she noted that Crary was a national reporter who wrote frequently about women and social issues. The Komen team described him as a “Planned Parenthood ally,” who had “gushed” over Planned Parenthood in a February 2011 article featuring Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards. “The article was essentially a rehashed Planned Parenthood press release,” Handel writes. He’s described as “sympathetic” to Richards and “deeply biased” in favor of Planned Parenthood. Komen’s media person says, “she had never spoken to a national reporter who was so openly biased.” Crary ended up penning nine stories that mentioned the matter. The first five were doozies: “Cancer charity halts grants to Planned Parenthood,” “Reactions heated on Planned Parenthood-Komen rift,” “Komen drops plans to cut Planned Parenthood grants,” “Cancer charity confronts backlash over grant cuts, ” and “Komen exec quits after Planned Parenthood flap.” He worked mentions of Komen into another three stories, all of which advance a particular political narrative: “Limbaugh slur of law student draws Obama into fray,” “Obama joins in assailing Limbaugh slur of student,” and “Ridicule helped doom Va. ultrasound bill.” Finally, he later wrote a story about the very book that trashes him as deeply biased … without mentioning that he actually plays a significant role in the book. This can’t be the most ethical journalistic move ever. So How Did He Do With Gosnell Coverage? Crary’s twitter profile describes himself as a “New York-based reporter with The Associated Press, covering national social issues.” But guess how many stories he wrote on abortionist and serial murderer Kermit Gosnell, one of the biggest national social issues stories of the last decade. If Komen attempting a minor budget cut to the wealthy, powerful and taxpayer-funded Planned Parenthood got tons of stories, you have to figure you could get some out of an abortion doctor running a practice for decades until it was shut down with the completely accidental discovery of late-term babies being born alive into a cat urine-soaked clinic and murdered by snipping their spinal cords. The story had angles usually of interest to national social issues reporters, such as health and safety regulation of medical clinics, immigration, drug policy, exploitation of the poor, murder of a woman seeking an abortion, late-term abortion, infanticide, do I need to go on? So I’m thinking that must have kept David Crary extremely busy for several years. Let’s go to Nexis. Oh, hunh. That’s really weird. He only wrote two stories about Kermit Gosnell. “Philly abortion murder case fuels national debate,” written January 20, 2011, begins and ends with quotes from abortion rights activists and pro-choice framing overwhelms the piece. His next piece came more than two years later on May 4, 2013. That piece was headlined “Philly abortion murder trial has national impact.” It has the same preponderance of pro-choice arguments and framing. How weird to claim “national debate” is coming and “national impact” was had without any coverage by the “national social issues” reporter. Call me crazy but in order to fuel a national debate or have a national impact, usually you need the media to actually, you know, cover it at the national level. The Washington Post’s Sarah Kliff told me that she considered Gosnell to be a local crime story. The AP in fact covered it just like that, having a local reporter cover it and letting its national social issues reporter ignore it for years. Just by way of comparison, if you want to talk about “fueling” a national debate, I notice that the AP has tweeted out more than 350 times about George Zimmerman, the local man who shot and killed the local Trayvon Martin, since March 2012. On Gosnell, convicted serial murderer? Two. Both from the last days of the trial. Looking At Pro-Life Legislation I still remember that the first article I read about the Texas’ legislature’s effort to tighten health and safety standards at abortion clinics and enact mild protections for unborn children who had reached five months’ gestation was framed this way by the Associated Press: AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Republicans armed with Bible verses have given preliminary approval to some of the strictest abortion regulations in the country as time runs out on the Texas special legislative session. What in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks does this mean? I have no idea. I have no idea what being “armed” with Bible verses means. The remaining five sentences don’t tell us. They also don’t tell us what the Bible verses are. Neither do we learn why in the world Bible verses were mentioned in this “news” report. Or what Democrats were armed with. That was just one of the problems, repeated during the weeks surrounding the filibuster by media darling Wendy Davis. Quick quiz: Planned Parenthood press release or AP lede: Republicans pass new restrictions expected to close almost every abortion clinic in Texas. No matter which one you answered, you’re right! At some point, the AP Twitter feed actually sent out a tweet with the pro-choice hashtag #StandWithWendy. Higher-ups suggested such a move was not-so-smart. But then the AP was sending out still more alarmed, if completely unsubstantiated, notes about the Texas legislation that made the Planned Parenthood press releases seem tame by comparison. The stories out of Texas routinely failed to mention how U.S. late-term abortion laws compare to other countries (we’re one of only seven countries in the world that permit abortions after 20 weeks) as well as the recent context of abortion doctors such as Kermit Gosnell and Texas’ own Douglas Karpen or details about clinic conditions. This is not a new problem (The Los Angeles Times published an absolutely devastating expose of the abortion coverage problem in 1990!). It does seem to be getting worse, though. The Associated Press is a good journalism brand that is being tarnished by shoddy coverage of the pro-life movement even as coverage of pro-choice activists and their arguments could not be more favorable. Let’s hope some higher-ups recognize the need to fix this problem. If there aren’t reporters who can cover both the pro-choice and pro-life movements fairly, perhaps the AP can hire some reporters who can balance out reporters David Crary and Philip Elliott, who seem to be struggling in their efforts to fairly cover pro-life activists and the larger movement. Without better journalism at the national level, it may be difficult to encourage the same in the local bureaus.

"150",150,"State-Level Democrats Revolt Against National Leaders’ Abortion Extremism","Dannenfelser","Marjorie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-05-03"," National Democratic leaders and presidential candidates continue to embrace radical positions on life issues. But grassroots Democrats are resisting the national party’s platform where the voters live: the states. In 2019, prominent Democratic figures have gone to extremes to embrace fringe life-issue positions such as late-term abortions and infanticide. In January, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D–NY) signed a bill to cement the central holdings of Roe v. Wade as state law. In lockstep with other Democratic leaders, Cuomo deployed “health” as an undefined, catch-all term to open the door for abortion at any stage of pregnancy. Moreover, he repealed protections for infants born alive that formerly entitled them to all life-sustaining efforts.  Eight days later, Gov. Ralph Northam (D–VA) endorsed the removal of third-trimester abortion restrictions through labor and delivery. Northam argued that physicians should deliver the infant alive when the mother is in labor, then keep the infant comfortable, he said. Then, if the mother desires, physicians should resuscitate the child, or leave the child to die. He said at that point the physician and the mother should discuss how to proceed—i.e., whether to kill or care for the infant. Merely 13 percent of Americans support national Democratic leaders’ position on third-trimester abortion. Nevertheless, Democratic presidential candidates Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg favor third-trimester abortion. They aren’t alone on this in the Democratic presidential field. On January 31, 2019, Sen. Ben Sasse (R–NE) introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Under the bill, infants born alive after surviving an attempted abortion are legal persons under American law and entitled to all legal protections thereunder. Moreover, the bill would entitle infants to the same level of care as any other patient. However, Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate voted against the bill. Sens. Cory Booker (D–NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D–NY), Kamala Harris (D–CA), Amy Klobuchar (D–MN), Bernie Sanders (I–VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D–MA) voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Yet, 87 percent of Americans reject third-trimester abortions. Seventy-seven percent of voters support born-alive infant protections. Now grassroots Democrats are taking notice.  Some Democrats, At the State Level, Have the Right Idea In Ohio, all Democratic state senators approved a bipartisan resolution to urge the U.S. Congress to adopt Sasse’s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. In New Mexico, legislators attempted to enact third-trimester abortion legislation similar to the proposals advanced in New York and Virginia. However, New Mexico’s Democrat-led Senate delivered a blow to the national party by voting against the measure. North Carolina’s General Assembly passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act on April 16, 2019. Four House and two Senate Democrats voted in favor of the bill. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the measure. Republicans and supportive Democrats must seek additional support from other Democratic lawmakers to build a veto-proof super-majority. Arkansas saw three Democrats join Republicans to pass the Cherish Act, which banned abortion after 18 weeks except in cases of rape and incest. Moreover, the Cherish Act required abortion providers to determine the unborn child’s probable gestational age prior to inducing or performing an abortion. Previously, Arkansas banned abortion after 20 weeks of gestation in a mother’s womb. Florida Democrat Kim Daniels voted to advance HB 1335 from the Judiciary Committee. HB 1335 requires minors to obtain parental or legal guardian consent prior to the abortion procedure. Minors may petition the corresponding circuit court and obtain court-appointed counsel to request that the court waive the consent requirement. HB 1335 has passed the Florida House and is pending in the state’s Senate.  In 2018, 27 percent of West Virginia Democratic lawmakers voted to place Amendment 1 on the ballot. Amendment 1 establishes that “nothing in the [West Virginia] Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.” West Virginians, a narrow majority of whom are registered Democrats, approved the amendment. Rhode Island lawmakers are deliberating over H5125, which would codify Roe v. Wade’s central holdings of abortion on request as state law. The bill advanced to the Rhode Island Senate Judiciary Committee by a 44-30 margin. However, 22 Democratic state representatives voted against the bill, which faces another test in the Rhode Island Senate. In Tennessee, Democratic state Reps. Joe Towns, John Windle, and John DeBerry voted in favor of HB 0077. Under HB 0077, abortion is prohibited once the unborn child’s heartbeat is detected, except in certain medical emergencies. The Tennessee Senate deferred the bill for a study. Towns’s vote irked Planned Parenthood. In 2018, Towns sought and received Planned Parenthood’s endorsement. Planned Parenthood revoked its endorsement of Towns and is pursuing a challenger to his seat. Louisiana state Rep. Katrina Jackson, a Democrat, continues to challenge the national Democratic Party’s status quo. Jackson joined U.S. Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D–IL) as one of two elected, pro-life Democratic speakers at the 2019 March for Life. Jackson sponsored Louisiana Act 620 in 2014. Under Act 620, Louisiana abortion providers must have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of their clinic. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked Act 620 from going into effect, by a 5-4 vote. On April 17, 2019, the pro-abortion group Center for Reproductive Rights petitioned the court for a writ of certiorari. Jackson laid the groundwork for what may be the first major pro-life case heard by the new court. A Democratic Party Divided Grassroots Democrats must come to terms with the national Democratic Party’s radical positions on life issues. Democratic leaders and presidential candidates continue to double down on late-term abortion on demand. Infanticide is alarmingly close to becoming Democratic Party orthodoxy, if it has not already. But many grassroots Democrats continue to listen to their consciences and their constituents. More than three-quarters of voters support born-alive abortion protections. Meanwhile, 62 percent of voters oppose legislation that authorizes late-term abortions. And Americans increasingly identify as pro-life. Life issues are not a Democrat or Republican issue. They are a bipartisan issue, and both sides are welcome to the right side of history. The gap between the extremism of the national leadership of the Democratic Party and the votes of the party grassroots across the country offers persuasive proof.

"151",151,"In ‘Right To Lie’ Case, SBA List Told Truth On Abortion Funding","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-06-16"," The unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision in Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus is an important victory for free speech. The court held that SBA List could bring a First Amendment challenge to an Ohio law that prohibits making “false statements” in an election campaign—a law that Rep. Steve Driehaus used to prevent SBA List from speaking out against his vote for Obamacare as authorizing taxpayer funds for abortion. Predictably, leftwing commentators claim that the unanimous decision is about whether the pro-life group has a “right to lie” about Obamacare resulting in taxpayer funding of abortion. Other “mainstream” sources feed that narrative with the implication that “experts” say it isn’t true.  Some just pretend that it’s too complicated—requiring “strong coffee” (perhaps “above their pay grade”?) to discern whether Obamacare might actually facilitate taxpayer funding of abortion, thus claiming neutrality on that rather fundamental question. The result is that news coverage of a procedural question that is interesting to constitutional attorneys but not normal humans becomes a platform for media implications that SBA List “lied” about abortion and Obamacare. The problem with the narrative is that SBA List told the truth: Obamacare uses taxpayer funding for abortion. Exhibit A is the Bracy family in Connecticut, a family forced by Obamacare to pay an abortion surcharge used solely for others’ elective surgical abortions. The Bracys are required to pay this surcharge in order to enroll in any plan on the Connecticut exchange and avoid substantial fines under the individual mandate. They aren’t alone. Every Connecticut resident must pay this abortion surcharge to enroll in an exchange plan. And citizens in several other states, including Vermont, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Iowa, Washington, and Hawaii may face the same problem. Others have also explained thoroughly (even in video) the other ways in which Obamacare funds abortion. The brief in support of SBA List that Alliance Defending Freedom filed along with Bioethics Defense Fund and Life Legal Defense Foundation in the portion of SBA List’s case still in the 6th Circuit explains how Obamacare permits taxpayer funds to be used to pay for abortions and abortion-inducing drugs through subsidies for insurance premiums, high-risk pools, community health center funds, and even expanded Medicaid funding for some abortions.  And the claimed restrictions on taxpayer funding of abortion largely hinge on annual reauthorization of the Hyde Amendment, which many of those who claim Obamacare does not fund abortions are also working to eliminate. In short, this was not a case about SBA List’s “right to lie” because SBA List’s statement that Obamacare permits abortion funding with taxpayer dollars is demonstrably and unequivocally true. The question—which should concern every American, no matter their political views—is whether the Constitution permits an incumbent politician to use the machinery of government to censor true but damaging statements from citizens about his voting record. If this was a debate about anything other than abortion (or more specifically about claims being made by a pro-life group), I suspect there would be near unanimity that the answer should be “no.” But if journalists are looking for examples of falsehoods told in abortion debates in electoral campaigns, there are some excellent examples they might report on: A notable politician and a special interest group supporting his candidacy once contended that competing politicians who would cut funding for Planned Parenthood would be eliminating mammograms. The claim was often repeated and just about as often went unchecked by reporters. Empirically speaking, it was hogwash. The federal government confirms that not a single Planned Parenthood entity in the country performs mammograms.
Seven years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was constitutional despite its lack of a health exception—an exception that Planned Parenthood and other abortion advocates said was necessary to protect women’s health in roughly 2,200 instances each year. Abortion advocates argued that, by signing the ban, President George W. Bush was harming these women’s health. The Supreme Court called their bluff, inviting abortionists to file a lawsuit seeking an exemption in any specific case where partial-birth abortion was necessary to protect the mother’s health. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg so believed Planned Parenthood’s claims that she predicted a wave of these lawsuits. Seven years later, not one has been filed, and there is no known instance of the lack of partial-birth abortion affecting a woman’s health. What does that say about the veracity of their claims? Has this experience with evidence chastened the abortion advocates? No. They make the same claims today as states enact laws prohibiting late-term abortions where the unborn child can feel pain. Many reporters play along and warn of this supposed risk to women’s health. No one seems to notice that the same abortion groups that release their legal hounds on any law that touches on abortion have consciously decided to let almost all of these laws prohibiting abortion after 20 weeks remain on the books unchallenged, including the Texas law that was at the center of last summer’s firestorm. There are no stories of women being harmed.  The point is not that the government should punish these abortion advocates or prohibit them from speaking. The First Amendment forbids government from acting as the arbiter of truth on matters of public debate. And that’s exactly the point. SBA List is powerless to vindicate its constitutionally protected freedoms and ensure that the marketplace for debate is free if incumbent politicians can prevent them or anyone else from exposing the truth and then avoid adjudication of this egregious First Amendment violation. SBA List’s victory is one for Americans of all political leanings. But if some refuse to celebrate that win due to their support for abortion, they should know that it’s Planned Parenthood, not SBA List, that is exercising a “right to lie.” Casey Mattox (@caseymattoxadf) is senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, which has filed friend-of-the-court briefs in Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus at both the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.

"152",152,"What They Don’t Tell Women About Chemical Abortions Will Hurt You","Mattes","Bradley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-11-07"," Warning: This article includes graphic descriptions of chemical abortion. The chemical abortion pill, marketed as Mifeprex and referred to as a medication abortion, is the future of the abortion industry. The number of chemical abortions in America has increased dramatically while the overall tally of abortions has declined.  Those who advocate for and provide this abortion drug almost always downplay the excruciating process that awaits unsuspecting women, doing a grave disservice to them. Tammi Morris was no stranger to abortion. She had previously had seven of them, so when an abortion provider told her the chemical abortion process would be “safe, near painless, and private,” she agreed to use it. Shortly after taking the second dose of pills, however, Tammi realized it wouldn’t be anything like what the abortion center staff had described. “They didn’t prepare me for this,” Tammi said. Instead, what she endured was an experience she described as “savage” and “horrific.” She found herself alone, “feeling like I was going to give birth to death.” Profuse bleeding forced Tammi to seek medical intervention. Elizabeth Gillette’s experience with the abortion drug was similarly traumatizing. In her case, the falsehoods exceeded the abortion staff’s mischaracterization of the drug’s effects. Elizabeth told them she was undecided about the abortion and wanted to view the ultrasound. At first, she was rebuffed, but Elizabeth persisted.  A staff member finally showed her a still shot of the monitor, saying, “Do you see? There’s no heartbeat. There’s no movement. Your pregnancy’s not viable.” Elizabeth said the facility had lied to her in an attempt to tip the scale of her uncertainty about the abortion. “No one counseled me. No one told me what the options were.” As for the abortion process, Elizabeth says she was told, “You’ll experience some light cramping. It’ll be like a heavy period. Shouldn’t hurt.” Elizabeth confessed, “I had no idea what was coming. No idea.” The cramping was “deep and very painful. I’ve had three children since then, and it felt like labor.” The physical ordeals of these women were just the beginning of more horrors to come. Common to Tammi and Elizabeth’s experience during their chemical abortions, facilities send women home to abort alone, with no one to shield them from what they will see and feel.  Numerous medical experts understand the added physical and emotional trauma inflicted by chemical abortion. OB-GYN Donna Harrison likened the process, which is four times more likely to require medical intervention afterward than a surgical abortion, to “almost patient abandonment.” She sees the irony in feminists demanding safe, legal abortion while “pushing a chemical coat hanger on women.” During her chemical abortion — really an induced miscarriage — Tammi felt the urge to push and then looked down. What she saw left her devastated. “There was my baby, in a toilet. This wasn’t fetal tissue. This was a formed, recognizable, undeniable baby. My baby.” Through tears, Elizabeth also described coming face to face with her unborn son. “I held him. The doctor promised me that I would feel relieved.” But what Elizabeth described wasn’t relief. Instead she felt an “overwhelming guilt, a sickness inside that I couldn’t put away. Nightmares started shortly after. I stopped eating. I became anorexic. I was later diagnosed with acute post-traumatic stress disorder.” Tammi and Elizabeth then faced the struggle of daily emotional turmoil enveloping their lives as a result of what they had done and seen. “How does a mother who killed her own child in the womb intentionally, how does she grieve outwardly?” Tammi questioned. Elizabeth felt a burning passion to warn other women. When facing a second unexpected pregnancy, she made a video that quickly became popular, encouraging other women to persevere. “Hiding in the silence is just your own personal death sentence. But when you stand up and say enough is enough. This hurt me and it’s hurting women everywhere, it set me free.” “Our society is breeding fear,” Elizabeth said. “We tell our women to go out and get a job and be everything you can be, except being a mom. And that’s a lie.” To her, abortion is “a regret you can’t reconcile. It’s forever.” Grassroots organizations and people who have seen or experienced these devastating effects are making an effort to give a voice to women who have been physically or emotionally harmed by chemical abortion. They’ve created a safe, confidential place women can go to tell their stories about their experience. Sharing can often be therapeutic. The landscape of the abortion debate was altered during the 1980s when women who had experienced abortion and its aftermath came forward to tell their stories. By speaking out, the victims of chemical abortion can spare countless other women and their babies from enduring a similar tragedy.

"153",153,"NYT Op-Ed Deceptively Confuses Preemies With Babies Born Alive After Abortion","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-28"," On Monday, Sen. Ben Sasse’s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act fell short of the 60 votes needed to move the legislation to a floor vote. All 44 of the “nay” votes came from Democrats or supposed independents, including presidential hopefuls Cory Booker, Sherrod Brown, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. While the party of Planned Parenthood needed to kill the bill, voting to withhold medical care from an infant lucky enough to escape the womb alive isn’t the best look for a party hoping to win back the Senate and White House in 2020.  So yesterday saw the liberal media’s launch of a rehabilitation effort for their party.  But how do you prop up a politician who votes to allow newborn babies to die? Easy: With misdirection and prevarication. Misleading, Evasive Media Coverage The New York Times led the charge, publishing Dr. Jen Gunter’s op-ed, “I Didn’t Kill My Baby.” Gunter is an obstetrician and gynecologist who has performed late-term abortions. She lost her son Aidan—one of the triplets she was carrying—when he was born extremely premature at 22 weeks gestation. Gunter’s loss is tragic. But it has nothing to do with abortion. Gunter didn’t have an abortion; her water broke at 22 weeks and three days gestation. Doctors were unable to delay Aidan’s birth, and he died shortly after Gunter delivered him. Physicians apparently succeeded, however, in delaying Gunter’s delivery of her other two babies, because she notes in passing that Aidan’s two siblings survived. Gunter does not provide any details, though, because that would not serve her purpose. Her op-ed seeks to attack the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act by portraying her tragic loss as equivalent to an abortion: “If you are going to accuse me of executing my child, then you need to know exactly what happened. It’s not a pleasant story and the ending is terrible. I wouldn’t blame you for not wanting to read it. But you need to know the truth, because stories like mine are being perverted for political gain.”  No one is talking about stories like Gunter’s. No one is accusing Gunter of executing her son. And try as she might to equate her situation to the focus of the legislation, which concerns abortion survivors, Gunter did not have an abortion. The only one perverting anything for political gain is Gunter! To be clear: The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act speaks only of babies born alive following “an abortion or attempted abortion.” The bill also does not mandate “heroic measures,” or “invasive procedures,” as Gunter implies. It simply requires that health practitioners provide the abortion survivor with the same health care “any other child born alive at the same gestational age” would receive. (The abortion doctor must also immediately transport the baby to a hospital.) Making Sense of Gunter’s Argument In fact, Gunter’s entire op-ed perfectly illustrates the need for, and functioning of, the proposed Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The medical team caring for Gunter and Aidan concluded, in their reasonable and conscientious judgment, that Aidan could not survive and that no further health care was medically necessary. Conversely, the medical team caring for Gunter’s other two premature babies concluded that further medical care was appropriate. The bill merely requires a medical team to treat a survivor of abortion the same as Gunter’s doctors treated her three premature babies. Gunter also makes the incomprehensible claim that the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is “nothing more than a way to warp the reality of perinatal mortality (stillbirth or death within the first week of life) to create confusion about abortion.”  Perinatal mortality is a tragic reality, but it has nothing to do with Sasse’s bill. Any confusion between the two stems solely from Gunter’s attempt to manipulate the sympathy the public feels for her loss.  In her op-ed, Gunter adds another dubious but oft-repeated claim, stating that abortions “at or after 24 weeks of gestation, the time largely accepted as viability, are typically performed because of severe fetal anomalies or fetal anomalies combined with maternal health problems.” But a Congressional Research Service report from April 2018 looked at that question and cited an expert in the field (and an abortion apologist) Dr. Diana Greene Foster, who “believes that abortions for fetal anomaly ‘make up a small minority of later abortion.’” Anecdotally, we also have Beth Vial’s op-ed for Teen Vogue from earlier this month. In “What It Was Like To Get A Later Abortion,” Vial recounted her trip to New Mexico to abort her healthy, viable unborn baby at 28 weeks of gestation. Not quite the typical scenario Gunter would have readers believe, which just goes to show that Vial is too young, too naïve, or too indoctrinated by the “shout your abortion” crowd to realize her story horrifies ordinary Americans. Gunter knows better, which is why she set herself up as the strawman: the suffering, still-mourning mom. But the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act isn’t about Gunter or her son Aidan, or about any of the other moms who bear children only to bury them. The bill is about the Vials of the world, and the vile doctors who attempt to abort viable fetuses—and when they fail, leave the infants to die. All the distortion that is fit to print will not change that reality.

"155",155,"FDA Investigating Mail-Order Abortion Pill Company As Access Grows","Wolfe","Liz",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-10-24"," This week, news outlets like The Daily Beast and Vox reported that an abortion pill ordering service called Aid Access is being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Aid Access is a six-month-old online company started by a Dutch physician named Rebecca Gomperts. They “support women who are not able to access local services” by allowing them to do an online consultation and, if they qualify, receive abortion pills in the mail, provided their pregnancy is at about 9 weeks or younger.  The startup’s site is full of typical jargon: “For many women, girls and trans men it is very difficult to access abortion care because of the cost of abortion, mandatory 24-72 hour waiting periods, the requirement of parental consent for minors, or the fact that clinics have been forced to close completely…Aid Access supports women who cannot otherwise access an abortion and protects their human rights.” Ordering Abortion Pills Online Is Legally Suspect Pill-induced (also called medical) abortions are increasingly sought after, especially in states where the nearest abortion clinic is difficult to get to. They can be obtained up to about 10 weeks’ gestation using a two-drug combination of mifepristone and misoprostol that’s widely deemed safe if administered correctly to women experiencing normal pregnancies (although the two-drug combo can be quite dangerous, for example, to women with ectopic pregnancies, and online services like Aid Access do not require physician supervision for administering the meds). Online pill abortion delivery services are legally suspect in the United States, so Aid Access obtains their pills from pharmacies in India. Thus far, the FDA has not found significant issues with adulteration of the pills. Still, the agency is concerned about the group’s sourcing of their drugs, since mifepristone has been linked to 22 deaths to date. It’s unclear how these deaths occurred and why people aren’t more alarmed by them. Since mifepristone is not legally available over the internet in the United States, Aid Access is potentially violating the law by selling abortifacient pills. The actual act of self-inducing an abortion is also currently illegal in many states, although women are not regularly prosecuted under these laws. These laws are also relatively rare–a Guttmacher study indicates that only about 1 percent of women seeking abortions attempt to self-abort with misoprostol, for example. This might change, though, as online ordering services become more readily available and pill abortions become coveted for allowing discretion.  Regardless of what the FDA finds, every pro-life person should be concerned about the growing shift in easily obtainable abortion pills being shipped en masse from around the world. Aid Access is just the start of what is likely to be a new, macabre trend in the global reproductive “rights” movement. Now, in 2018, killing a fetus can be done in the privacy of one’s own home, with pills sourced easily and quietly from one’s web browser. A life can end and no one has to know except your credit company and search history. Unfortunately, this isn’t really surprising. College activists in California recently tried to lobby their legislature for on-campus abortion pills. On-Campus Abortions At Public Schools In California? Last month, California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed S.B. 320, a bill which would’ve mandated that public colleges and universities in California provide on-campus abortion pills for students. He didn’t do so out of principle, of course. Instead, he justified his decision with a study that showed students have such impressively convenient access to abortion clinics in California’s metropolitan areas that on-campus abortions are unnecessary. There are simply too many options for college students to obtain abortions! But this won’t be the last we hear from pro-choice activists who lamented Brown’s decision, saying, “It is particularly unconscionable that Gov. Jerry Brown chose to turn his back on students’ experiences and instead hide behind bogus claims to deny increased access to abortion. He completely discounted the burden that travel, time, and additional costs can impose on students.”  Democrats of the ‘90s claimed to pursue the “safe, legal, and rare” abortion framework. Now it seems that rare won’t do, safe isn’t necessarily a prerequisite, and legal means not only must the federal government permit it, but must also ensure that each state has clinics dotting each region, as to not impose an undue burden on any woman. And if you’re a college student, “legal” means your abortion pills should be easily picked up on your way back to your dorm from the cafeteria, or else you’ve been burdened. Let’s be clear about what this is: abortion becoming a commonplace part of our society. On one hand, leftist pro-choicers need not fear potential Supreme Court rollbacks of their abortion powers if the free market is providing decently safe alternatives (the jury is still out on whether Aid Access’s alternatives are, in fact, safe). In fact, this might give would-be socialists a taste of the innovation the free market can provide. On the other hand, pro-life libertarians like myself should worry about what this signals about our culture. It’s decently easy to get even pro-choice people on board with the fact that third-trimester abortions are somewhere between indecent and morally reprehensible; but what about first-trimester abortions? Will the day soon come when you can order abortifacients on Amazon Prime? What Does This Say About Our Culture? It doesn’t take much stretching of the imagination to consider a future in which we’re culturally indifferent to first-trimester abortions. Plan B is readily supplied on many college campuses, and its use is broadly accepted (the ethics of which are still hotly contested among Catholics). A Refinery 29 headline from last year read, “What Do We Want? A Plan B Vending Machine! When Do We Want It? Now!” Many abortion moderates draw their ethical lines at viability, or somewhere between 22 and 24 weeks. A Gallup headline from earlier this year read, “Trimesters Still Key to U.S. Abortion Views,” stating that around 60 percent of Americans believe abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy are morally permissible. Interestingly, support for second-trimester abortions is slightly less than half that–only about 28 percent of Americans believe them to be ethically acceptable–and support for third-trimester abortions hovers at a measly 13 percent. That’s good and bad news for pro-lifers. It shows that many people are not firmly entrenched in either camp, and believe there is some point during pregnancy at which a fetus becomes deserving of legal and cultural protection. It also shows that people feel a visceral discomfort with aborting a fetus that looks and seems like a living baby. The bad news, though, is that their discomfort does not extend to the fetus when it’s at an early point of development, during which they can brush it off as a “clump of cells.” This cognitive dissonance is frustrating, and I wonder, as abortion pills become widespread, private alternatives to in-clinic abortions, whether much of our culture will look at them as akin to Plan B. It’s up to pro-lifers to make the continued case that life, even in the first trimester, is worth protecting, and that we should continue to provoke thoughtful discussion on the ethics of abortion among our ideological allies and opponents alike.

"156",156,"Covid-Endangered Women In Poor Countries Need Better Medicine, Not Risky Abortion Drugs","Francis","Christina",NA,"Koren, Elyssa",NA,NA,"2020-07-17"," New research estimates there could be an additional 56,700 maternal deaths in low and middle-income countries due to health-care disruption from COVID-19. In response to this tragic projection, abortion activist groups are pursuing expanded “medication abortion,” the termination of pregnancy typically by way of a two-drug combination and often via “telemedicine.” Euphemistically termed “self-care abortion,” the practice is marketed as the solution to supposedly skyrocketing numbers of unintended pregnancies — an unconfirmed phenomenon the United Nations alleges has reached 7 million worldwide. Yet it is impossible to accurately forecast the indirect toll of the virus, and speculation should in no way legitimize uncharted medical trends.  From a medical standpoint, drug-induced abortion is extremely dangerous. The practice will greatly exacerbate already high maternal death rates in low-resource countries and is a violation of the fundamental human rights possessed by all women. Regardless of their birthplace, all women deserve excellent health care. Not only do drug-induced abortions not improve women’s health, but also they pose significant risks to women in settings with inadequate infrastructure — a divide often heightened in developing countries and that manifests along racial and socioeconomic lines. The World Health Organization is leading the charge on medical abortion as part of its COVID-19 guidance, calling for limited interaction with providers and increased reliance on “self-management.” The WHO’s negligence in recommending highly dangerous interventions without immediate access to medical care is supremely relevant, especially as the United States withdraws from the organization and examines the prospect of self-managed medical abortion on its own soil. Far from what many “experts” assert, medical abortion is far from an antidote to “unsafe abortion.” For instance, a recent report details how the Canadian organization Women on Web provided Sudanese women abortion pills via mail, in response to women seeking abortions from traditional midwives since abortion is illegal. The organization, undeterred by Sudanese law, claims that the drugs carry “very low risk of complications and resemble having an early miscarriage.”  The complication rate for medical abortions is four times higher than for surgical abortions, a devastating statistic that rises the farther along a woman is in her pregnancy. In the best of circumstances, medical abortions pose potentially catastrophic risks, which are sure to be compounded in situations of extreme poverty, as in Sudan and all over the developing world, where Women on Web are active and the practice is taking place, unregulated and illegal. Even in situations where the drugs are administered correctly, hemorrhages are unfortunately a frequent complication. Women may also experience lethal sepsis, or an ectopic pregnancy, which, if not detected by ultrasound — a luxury in developing countries — can lead to rupture and death. Even if offered support via “telemedicine,” what is the likelihood that these women will have readily available access to internat-accessing devices and the internet? A question that also arises is whether the woman, if in need of urgent medical care, can get to a hospital, and once there, receive proper adequate care. For example, only 50 percent of people in Burkina Faso live within two hours of a hospital, an often insurmountable distance as women experiencing obstetric hemorrhage do not have much time. Additionally, most of these facilities do not have adequate surgical and blood transfusion capabilities and low-income countries frequently suffer from severe blood shortages, a significant contributor to maternal mortality already. While medical abortion is considered “safe” during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, women may be unable to pinpoint the timeline of their pregnancy accurately, or may even be motivated to be dishonest if it means they can obtain an abortion. If administered too late, the outcome can be dire.  Furthermore, in developing settings, an incomplete medical abortion regimen is often used (comprising of just Misoprostol) as opposed to the U.s. Food and Drug Administration-approved double regimen (Mifepristone and Misoprostol). The fact that this single drug protocol is banned in the United States due to high rates of incomplete abortion, but is “acceptable” in Africa, constitutes a gross inequality in standard of care. While FDA data on the dangers of medication abortion reveals thousands of adverse events and dozens of deaths, the majority of complications go unreported. As a result of the lobbying efforts of numerous drug companies, under current guidelines the only adverse event that must be reported is death. Internationally, there is no data regarding the number of women seriously harmed or killed due to drug-induced abortion. It’s safe to extrapolate, however, that the numbers can be multiplied exponentially in countries where poverty and lack of resources make it extremely difficult for women to receive the appropriate care that they need. Some may argue that women have the right to pursue medical abortion as long as they can deliver informed consent. But offering medication abortion as the only alternative to “unsafe abortion” does not constitute informed consent, especially when the real risks are hidden from women. They need real options and excellent health care. Handing a woman pills then leaving her to suffer alone through not only an abortion, but also the likely complications, is a form of reproductive violence that no medical professional should sanction — not unlike the “unsafe abortion” it is designed to combat. The international community should commit resources to interventions that are proven to save lives. Evidence shows that basic improvements in emergency services can reduce mortality by almost half. During a time our world is united in suffering through the COVID-19 pandemic, we must remember that women are in dire need of better health care and resources. Women need real options to counter rising maternal mortality with life-saving interventions, not self-administered death.

"157",157,"Abortion Rescue Missions Reach The Moms Sidewalk Counselors Couldn’t","Miller","Monica",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-03-11"," There’s an old adage in the pro-life movement: “If abortion is murder, act like it.” The pithy slogan is meant to provoke people of goodwill to do something to prevent the killing of the unborn.



Lauren Muzyka’s recent article published at The Federalist, “How To Sidewalk Counsel Abortion-Minded Moms Without Going To Prison,” provides a harsh and negative critique of pro-life rescues, comparing them to the counseling method promoted by Sidewalk Advocates for Life, a ministry I laud and support.  



I am uniquely qualified to write a defense of pro-life rescues and rescuers. Since 1978, I have logged thousands of hours sidewalk counseling women out of abortions, and organized and participated in dozens of pro-life rescues, even serving a short jail term just last April for a Red Rose Rescue that took place at a Michigan abortion center in 2022. I understand from experience the value of both methods — sidewalk counseling and abortion rescues — at the places where the deaths of the unborn are scheduled.



What Is an Abortion Rescue?



Beginning in the mid-1970s, the pro-life rescue movement, pioneered by such leaders as John Kavanaugh-O’Keefe and Joan Andrews Bell, active in the anti-war movement, sought to provide a nonviolent defense of the unborn. These rescues involved sitting down or standing in front of the doors to abortion centers. Sometimes pro-lifers would chain themselves to heavy objects to prevent their being taken away.



Operation Rescue, founded in the late 1980s, resulted in the arrest of tens of thousands of pro-lifers and constituted the largest nonviolent civil disobedience movement in American history. All this came to a near halt in 1994 with the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act), which made mere pro-life “sit-in”-type activity a federal crime. Operation Save America, despite the FACE Act, has in recent years conducted these types of rescues. And on Feb. 1, 2024, six pro-lifers were convicted of violating the FACE Act.



In 2017, a new rescue method came into being, namely, Red Rose Rescues. This method blends the best of sidewalk counseling and defense of the unborn. The rescuers are not subject to the FACE Act because Red Rose Rescuers do not physically obstruct anyone or anything. A small group of pro-lifers quietly enter the abortion facility, sit down next to women in the waiting room, and counsel them to choose life. The pro-lifers offer roses to the moms as a sign of life and hope, and even offer them to abortion center staff — and often the women and staff take the roses.

      Their goal is to maintain a peaceful presence in a place where there is no peace — to enter the “dark holes of the poor” as Mother Teresa described her ministry. If women still opt to kill their children, at least a few pro-lifers will stay in the “dark holes” with the unwanted unborn, remaining as a witness to the sanctity of their lives, and this is where the risk of arrest comes in. Muzyka opposes not only the older type of rescue, but criticizes Red Rose Rescues as well.



Last Line of Defense Between Babies and Abortionists



Muzyka claims rescues, of whatever kind, are not effective in saving lives. The sad fact remains, the vast majority of women we attempt to reach on the sidewalk enter the abortion center and their babies are killed. The question then becomes, “What more can we do for those innocents led to the slaughter?” These are the innocents sidewalk counseling failed to save.



Rescues are a response to Proverbs: 24:11: “Rescue those being dragged to death, and those tottering to execution withdraw not.” Every woman who enters the abortion center, with the intent to continue with the abortion, is a woman not counseled or who failed to respond to the sidewalk counselor. Red Rose Rescuers seek to give these women a final chance to turn away. The majority of Red Rose Rescues take place at abortion centers where sidewalk counseling is exceptionally difficult or impossible, at abortion centers surrounded by a huge parking lot. The only effective way to speak to mothers and save their babies is by going onto the private property of the abortion center. And, yes, contrary to Muzyka’s claim, rescues have saved babies from abortion.



Women have taken the roses and left the waiting room. Two women in two Red Rose Rescues told us they decided to keep the baby. An abortion facility office manager in Michigan even testified under oath that 12 women did not go through with their scheduled “procedure.” If 12 women turned away from abortion by sidewalk counseling, this would be considered a huge victory. At least, rescues can give the babies scheduled for death a reprieve and buy more time for their mothers to reconsider the abortion.



Motivated by Conviction, Not Bravado



Muzyka provided a biased caricature of pro-life rescuers. She said they are engaged in “risky bravado”— motivated by the “exciting confrontational approach.” This is so very far from the truth. The pro-life rescuer simply wants to be faithful to Christ who taught, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” and is willing to make the needed sacrifices to put Christ’s words into practice.



Rescuers support, believe in, and do sidewalk counseling just like Muzyka. But they are also responding to God in their conscience, to go that extra step — saying to themselves: “If I were an unborn child about to be aborted, I would want someone to place themselves between me and the murderer’s knife.” Certainly, Muzyka would want someone to do at least that much for her. It is a matter of being consistent with the reality of the injustice of abortion — always seeking to act with peace and nonviolence because we must show the mothers that we love them too.


Matthew Connolly was arrested during a Red Rose Rescue on Dec. 3, 2017, at the Women’s Center abortion facility in Bloomfield, Michigan.

      Witnessing, Even on Trial



Rescuers are hardly tied up in “needless litigation.” Instead, rescuers continue to provide a needed powerful public witness to police officers, bailiffs, judges, jurors, reporters, and all those attending the trial, including abortion center staff. In court, rescuers publically stand up for the innocent unborn, insisting on a “defense of others” — insisting before the system that facilitates their killing, that the unborn are indeed “others” who have a God-given right to exist. Many rescue cases are currently on appeal.



And should the rescuers suffer unjust jail terms, this is a further opportunity to witness to the sanctity of life. Pro-lifers are hardly “removed from ministry.” While incarcerated last year for our 2022 Red Rose Rescue, we counseled two fellow inmates out of abortion. Pro-life ministry continues behind prison walls.



Rescuers have been accused of causing buffer zones to be put in place at abortion centers. Buffer zones are local ordinances that make sidewalk counseling that much more difficult. However, most buffer zones, such as the Chicago ordinance, are the result of sidewalk counseling, not rescues. No one argues sidewalk counseling must cease as a result.



Ten pro-life rescuers are currently in jail and convicted under the FACE Act for their sit-in-type rescue. However, they were also convicted of an additional charge brought by the weaponized Department of Justice: “interference with civil rights.” They will be formally sentenced on May 14 and could face an 11-year prison term. Rather than suffering derision, they deserve our support.



Some ask, “What does a pro-life rescue accomplish?” “Isn’t it all just a waste of time?” Those who are only concerned about the net number of babies saved pose the wrong question. The rescuer performs a further act of sacrificial love for the most unwanted. The question is not how many babies have been saved, but how many babies have been loved.

"158",158,"Study Claims Abortion Restrictions Are Linked To Suicide — But Ignores Crucial Data Showing Otherwise","Kelly","Thomas",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-01-18"," A study claiming abortion restrictions probably cause suicide is extremely flawed.



At the end of the year, JAMA Psychiatry released a study claiming abortion restrictions probably cause suicide. While many academic papers go unread or uncited behind paywalls, this paper was immediately promoted by various media outlets including The Guardian, NBC News, and The Hill.



The study’s results were politically relevant — the authors claimed abortion restrictions raised suicide rates of young women by more than 5 percent. The authors were affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine, and JAMA Psychiatry is one of the world’s most influential psychiatry journals. If relatively weak restrictions from the Roe v. Wade era could cause suicide among young women to rise, how much more would suicide spike as some states imposed actual abortion bans following Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization?



But the paper is extremely flawed. The authors lack the majority of the data they should have, data the authors claim is unavailable from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is in fact available, the pattern of missing data leads to a biased overestimate of suicide rates, and the use of statistical controls was poor.



Drawing Conclusions After Throwing Out Half the Data



The authors’ basic strategy was to look at the suicide rates of young women by state and year and compare them to abortion restrictions across states and years. They find that the presence of laws that impose regulatory burdens on abortion providers is associated with a 5 percent higher suicide rate for young women for the period 1976-2016. They show a similar increase in suicide rates using a weighted index of abortion policy for the period 2006-2017. Because the authors find no relationship between abortion restrictions and suicide among older women nor with motor vehicle deaths, they reason it’s likely that restricting abortion increases suicide among young women who might wish to receive one.



The authors report that a majority of the data they wanted to use in their analysis was missing. The results the authors display in Table 1 in their paper are based upon data from 50 states for 1976-2016. If all the data was available, there would be 2,050 different observations or data points on suicide rates for women ages 20-34 over a year per state. The authors have 1,022 observations. That is about half the relevant observations.



Observations are not randomly missing from collected data. In the online supplemental materials, you can see the suicide rate data these authors have by state and year. Here are the missing observations by year.


Author’s calculations using Table 3 from study’s supplemental material compared to CDC’s Wonder database.Why does data availability plummet? Because, for years after 1989, the CDC suppresses “[s]ub—national statistics representing fewer than ten persons” for privacy reasons.



When the number of suicides for young women in a given state in a year are low, the data is suppressed. When suicides and suicide rates are lower, they are more likely to be missing from the data. All of these low suicide rates are dropped, so conclusions about suicide rates will overstate the real suicide rate.



Anti-abortion laws become more common over time as available data declines, so the authors are disproportionately overstating suicide rates for years with restrictive abortion laws.



Consider Missouri. The authors record Missouri as first enforcing a restrictive abortion law in 1988. Before 1988, the authors have data on Missouri for every year. After 1988, they are missing data for more than half the years their study covers. This overstates suicide rates in Missouri for years in which Missouri had restrictive abortion laws.



Missing Data Can Be Found



But the data for many of these years is not actually missing. I easily obtained them from CDC WONDER, the government database the authors said they used. They claim to only have data for Alabama for two years between 1999 and 2016, yet the CDC provides data on suicide rates for Alabama for all years 1999-2016.



When contacted about the discrepancy, lead author Jonathan Zandberg replied that the researchers first obtained suicide rates for women between 20-24 and then for women between 25-34. If data was missing for either group due to the number of suicides being too low, they threw the whole observation out. This reduces the amount of data available and biases suicide rate measures upwards. Look at this table below, which shows average suicide rates between 1999 and 2016 using the authors’ data versus all data actually available from the CDC and demonstrates their estimates are too high. The more missing observations, the worse the bias. Take the following states, where the authors wildly understate the available data.



The authors are claiming that there is an expected 5 percent increase in suicide rates in states that have restrictive abortion laws. But the upward bias in their recorded suicide rates for some states is multiple times the estimated effect of abortion restrictions on suicide rates. This data cannot demonstrate that abortion restrictions are associated with suicide increases because the bias in their data is so extreme.



Because the authors throw out so much data, there are many states for which the authors literally have no data after 1989, even though such data is available! The study’s authors did not respond to questions about the biased data leading to overstated suicide rates, although they did respond to questions about why so much data was missing. The co-author, Ran Barzilay noted that all studies have limitations. The lead author, Zandberg, quoted the original article’s admission that “we relied on data on annual suicide rates released by the CDC. Accordingly, some data were not available, which could have led to an ascertainment bias.”



Acknowledging the risk of bias does not address the obvious and substantial bias. The data availability was also much less limited than the authors claim.



The missing data and biased data are not the only problems.



Bad Controls for Political Environment



Beyond examining whether there is a link between specific anti-abortion laws and suicide rates, the authors also examine whether there is a relationship between an index of abortion restrictions from 2006-2017 and suicide rates. This approach also suffers from similar data issues — most of the data is missing in a way that exaggerates suicide rates.



Another issue is their approach to controlling for political differences among states. Since conservative states are more likely to restrict abortion, other factors associated with conservative politics could be responsible for the apparent relationship between suicide and abortion restrictions. White Americans are more Republican than average and more suicidal than average. The authors do not control for the percent of the state population that is white, although they do control for the share of the population that is black. (For statistical reasons, it is a bad idea to try to control for every racial/ethnic category simultaneously.)



They try to control for the political environment of different states, but they do so incorrectly. They controlled “for the annual fraction of Republican senators representing the state at the US Senate.” U.S. senators don’t write or enforce state laws. Even as a crude proxy for overall state politics, this approach is bad and would amount to claiming California and Georgia have the same politics because they both lack Republican senators. Likewise, a southern state having two Democratic senators in 1976 implies different politics from a Midwestern state with Democratic senators today.



The authors ignore a huge share of the data. The data they have is biased. The overestimation of suicide rates occurs in years after 1989. Abortion laws were generally stricter after 1989 and more liberal in the immediate period following Roe v. Wade. Suicide rates are most exaggerated in years when abortion restrictions are more common. They fail to control for obvious state-level confounders.



Trustworthy Medical Journals Would Be Valuable



Abortion restrictions may affect suicide rates, but the JAMA Psychiatry paper should convince no one. In fact, the paper should be retracted.



If we have learned anything from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is that it’s valuable when scientific institutions provide balanced and accurate information on issues of public health — even when issues are politically charged. I hope JAMA Psychiatry does better.

"159",159,"All House Democrats But One Vote For Ghastly Abortion Bill","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-27"," On Friday, in a party-line vote, the Democrat-controlled House passed the most extreme abortion bill ever considered at the federal level. The so-called “Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021,” or H.R. 3755, passed the House by a 218-211 vote. Only one Democrat, Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, joined with Republicans to oppose the bill that, if made law, would override hundreds of mainstream and majority-supported state laws, such as parental notification and informed consent requirements. While the abortion-worshipping left portrays H.R. 3755 as a mere codification of Roe v. Wade and its progeny, the bill goes miles beyond current abortion jurisprudence to enshrine a virtually unlimited right to abortion at the federal level and barring virtually all state regulations that relate in any way to abortion.  Current abortion precedent, first established by the Supreme Court in Casey v. Planned Parenthood when a plurality of justices abandoned the “rigid” trimester framework of Roe v. Wade, holds that before the baby can live on its own outside the womb, states may regulate abortions so long as the laws do not impose an “undue burden” on women seeking abortions. Post-viability, the Supreme Court held, states may prohibit abortion so long as they provide for an exception for the life and health of the mother. Whether the Casey standard will survive the Supreme Court’s upcoming term, when the high court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization considers whether states may prohibit pre-viability abortions, is unknown. H.R. 3755, however, seeks not to protect Casey, but to bury it and all other state regulations of abortion. For instance, under Casey’s “undue burden” standard, “the Court said that states could take ‘steps to ensure that [the woman’s] choice is thoughtful and informed, could create structural mechanisms by which the state, or the parent or guardian of a minor expresses profound respect for the life of the unborn, could pass measures designed to persuade a women to choose childbirth over abortion, could pass laws which have ‘the incidental effect of making [abortion] more difficult or expensive to procedure,’ or regulations ‘to further the health or safety of a woman seeking abortion.” Thus, consistent with Casey, states may ban partial-birth abortions, require waiting periods, and mandate the provision of information concerning fetal development and potential health risks. States laws requiring parental consent or notification—with judicial bypass options—have likewise been held constitutional under Casey, as have state health and safety standards governing abortion clinics and medical providers.  H.R. 3755 would strike all of these state laws and more. For instance, by defining in Section 3(3) “health care provider” as a physician or “certified nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, and physician assistant,” state laws requiring physicians to perform abortions will fall. H.R. 3755 would also override many state health and safety provisions, including those regulating staffing and the facilities at which abortions take place. Section 4’s prohibition on the performance of “specific tests or medical procedures” would trump state laws that mandate ultrasounds after the baby can survive on its own. State waiting periods would likewise be trumped by H.R. 3755, as would state parental consent or notification requirements. Another section of H.R. 3755 bans any state law requiring abortion providers to convey supposedly “medically inaccurate information in advance of or during abortion services.” But to the abortion-centric American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, providing information about fetal pain and the psychological risks of abortion is “inaccurate,” making state informed consent laws requiring this information verboten. H.R. 3755 also prohibits states from banning sex-selective abortions. The House then ends the bill with a catch-all provision barring state laws that are “the same as or similar to one more of the limitations or requirements” already prohibited.  Further, even if a state law could survive the mandates of H.R. 3755 in general, the bill provides that a state abortion regulation still fails if “the safety of abortion services or the health of patients” can “be advanced by a less restrictive alternative measure or action.” This proposed “less restrictive alternative” mandate conflicts with the current Casey standard, which merely asks if the regulation creates an undue burden. The bill, however, goes beyond gutting state laws regulating abortions: It also expressly provides that it supersedes all other federal and state laws, including the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. This provision suggests that those with a religious or conscientious objection to assisting with or providing abortions may soon find no legal refuge. The Hyde Amendment that bars federal funding of abortions appears at risk, too, as do prohibitions on coverage for abortions in insurance contracts. H.R. 3755 also guarantees a right to abortion post-viability if a medical professional concludes “continuation of pregnancy” would pose a risk to a woman’s life or health—even though the baby could be safely delivered instead of aborted. And “health” remains undefined, guaranteeing medical providers possess unlimited discretion to determine whether a risk—no matter how insignificant—permits the abortion of a near-term unborn baby. D.C. Democrats may see H.R. 3755 as a winning wedge issue, but the majority of Americans, including many from their own party, will be appalled by the House Democrats’ attempt to force upon the states the most extreme abortion laws in the nation. Most Americans will likewise find the wokeism recited in the bill laughable. For instance, early on H.R. 3755 refers to “people,” as opposed to women. It later explains that “the terms ‘woman’ and ‘women’ are used in this bill to reflect the identity of the majority of people targeted.” The congressional findings and purpose section similarly tosses together a word salad, speaking of “white supremacy,” “reproductive justice,” and “gender oppression” to justify the killing of human beings in utero. Together these provisions provide Republicans a clear chance to speak to middle America about where the real extremism exists on abortion. And it is squarely on the left in the halls of Congress.

"160",160,"Virginia Proves Democrats Want Abortion Until Birth With No Limits","Bateman","Ashley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-03-14"," Gov. Glenn Younkin is the only barricade left to extremist legislation legalizing human killing in Virginia after weeks of contentious debate over legislation encompassing abortion and physician-assisted suicide.



In an otherwise cooperative, bipartisan session, the Democrat majority aggressively stamped out proposed pro-life laws. The majority also resurrected a radical abortion amendment to the Virginia Constitution in week one, advanced physician-assisted suicide, and introduced legislation that would essentially remove liability from abortionists and gender-altering surgeons.



Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the Democrat Party has championed radical anti-life legislation across the country. In seven states plus the District of Columbia, abortion is now unrestricted until birth. Legislators in 18 states have installed special protections for abortion providers, encouraging abortion tourism across state lines. State constitutions are being amended to enshrine abortion at an unparalleled rate in blue states. In his campaign speech last week, Democratic President Joe Biden promised “to take back ‘progress’ and restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.”



“This was not a year when any pro-life bill would receive a fair hearing in Virginia,” said Olivia Gans-Turner, president of Virginia Society for Human Life. “The handful of bills introduced that would have offered reasonable protection to babies who survived an abortion, or would have prevented abortion based on sex or race, were defeated callously and quickly.”



After years of divided chambers, Democrats hold a majority in the House and the Senate following the 2023 election cycle.



“The 2024 General Assembly was a clear example of the fact that elections have consequences,” Turner said. “Having gained a slim majority in both chambers, the new pro-abortion leadership showed their hand early on.”



Abortion Until Birth



The very first bill introduced was an amendment to the Virginia Constitution to enshrine abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, effectively eliminating pro-life laws in the state. The amendment debate was pushed to 2025, but highlights the radical pursuit of unregulated, unlimited killing of the unborn by the legislature’s current majority.



“What it really comes down to is just trying to get everyone honest on what they really believe on this issue,” said Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper. “I’m repeatedly told that all the left wants is just reasonable consideration for women’s reproductive health.”



Democrats continue to market their intentions, but “we don’t legislate intentions,” Frietas said. “I’d like people to actually know what the Democrats want. Every single Democrat in the House would vote yes on [the abortion amendment] if they could today. When it comes to policy, they want abortion up until birth with no exceptions and they want it taxpayer subsidized…That is what the constitutional amendment will do next year.”



Democrats succeeded in passing several bills to protect abortionists from malpractice liabilities. The bills would prevent the state Board of Medicine from taking action against an abortionist who breaks these laws.



“The effect will be to create a special class of treatment to abortionists that no other area of medical activity is afforded,” Turner said. These bills were combined and passed the General Assembly handily on party lines and now await the governor’s action. Turner expects Youngkin to veto the legislation by the April deadline. The assembly then has the opportunity to overturn the governor’s veto with a two-thirds majority vote.



Let Babies Born Alive Die on the Table



Although 60 percent of Americans still strongly oppose the use of tax funds to pay for most abortions, a bill to permanently remove Virginia taxpayers’ obligation to pay for abortions beyond what is required in the federal Hyde Amendment was rejected in the House of Delegates, where pro-abortion Democrats attempted to make a mockery of the patron’s bill, Turner said.



“This seems to be the one industry Democrats don’t want to regulate,” Freitas said.



Since 2020 Freitas has sponsored a Born Alive Act that would require an abortionist to provide reasonable medical care to an infant who survives an abortion. Last year the act passed the Republican-controlled House, but was denied a hearing by the Democrat-majority Senate. This year the legislation was left to die in a Senate subcommittee.



Although rare, documented cases of abortion survival plague the industry. In compelling testimony, Robin Sertell, a saline abortion survivor, spoke in favor of Freitas’s bill. Abortion lobbyists called the woman’s detailed history false, revealing how “irrelevant” they consider survivors, Freitas said.



“To protect women’s choices is not really what they want,” Freitas said. “No matter where you find yourself on the spectrum, from consecration to the Born Alive Act, every Democrat, at least in the House, will not put any restrictions on abortion to birth and will put in no reasonable restrictions if a baby needs help after birth.”



Allowing Doctors to Kill the Sick



The biggest win for the pro-life lobby this session was a vote by lawmakers to delay Senate Bill 280, which would legalize physician-assisted suicide, Turner said. The bill will now be heard in the 2025 session.



The companion bill sponsored by Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, died in the House. The legislation, reintroduced by Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, would remove civil and criminal liability from providers involved in an assisted suicide. In a statement Feb. 5, Virginia’s Catholic bishops called voters to voice their opposition to assisted suicide, saying legalizing it “would place the lives of people with disabilities, people with mental illnesses, the elderly, and those unable to afford healthcare – among others – at heightened risk of deadly harm.”



The bill hinges on a six-month prognosis, but stories of people living six years or more with terminal illness are prolific, said Del. Phil Scott, R-Spotsylvania. Scott championed a bill last year designating March as Trisomy Awareness Month.



“Doctors do not always get it right,” Scott said. “They don’t account for a few things. They don’t account for God. They do not account for the love of family and they do not account for the will of the individual.”



Doctor-facilitated suicide legislation will return next year, Turner said, as Democrats only need a few more votes to pass it into law.



Selling Women’s Bodies



Democrats passed another bill to allow women to accept money to gestate other people’s babies in their wombs, but the governor vetoed it and seven other bills last Friday. In his explanation for vetoing the bill, Youngkin noted the “serious concerns that arise when we allow the increased commercialization and profit-driven commodification of surrogacy.”



“Commercial surrogacy brokers, driven primarily by financial gain, may divert attention from the successful pregnancy, the welfare of the child, and the interests of both the intended parents and the surrogate,” he said.



Youngkin noted that human traffickers exploit surrogacy laws. Although legal representation of both parties in a surrogacy agreement is required, the contract details can be “intricate…which will necessitate negotiating with well-resourced, experienced, and professional brokers, leaving surrogates vulnerable to potential abuses.”



Democrats also killed Scott’s bill to prohibit abortion based on sex or ethnicity, and House Bill 1202, which would have defined as manslaughter the accidental killing of a baby inside his mother’s womb, such as in domestic abuse.



“Democrats are interested in protecting [abortion], with no legal ramifications,” Scott said. “Health care is designed to prolong life, period. That’s what health care is. Abortion is not health care. It ends a life.”

"161",161,"What The Right And Left Should Learn From Tim Murphy’s Abortion Hypocrisy","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-10-12"," Pennsylvania’s Rep. Tim Murphy resigned last week after a text from a woman with whom he had an extramarital affair surfaced during her divorce proceedings. It implied Murphy had pressured her to have an abortion: “And you have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options.” Murphy reportedly texted back the same day: “I get what you say about my March for life messages. I’ve never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced. I told staff don’t write any more. I will.”  It later turned out to be “an unfounded pregnancy scare,” but caused a firestorm of criticism from all sides. The scandal was compounded by reports of appalling treatment of his staffers and culminated in his resignation. Amid the attacks from the Left decrying Murphy as a hypocrite and bully and seeking to smear the entire pro-life movement with his moral corruption, it’s important for pro-lifers to step back and look at the big picture. Critics on the Left are at least right to point out that Murphy’s failure to live up to the values he has espoused should not merely be atomized and swept through the news cycle as a one-off. Important lessons can be drawn from his scandal. Murder Is Worse than Hypocrisy While conservatives can reasonably maintain that Murphy’s disgraceful behavior is not as common in pro-life circles as, say, sexual abuse is in Hollywood, they must admit that Murphy’s greatest failing here was not deceit or hypocrisy, but pressuring a mother to destroy the life he created with her. And this is all too common. The lure of convenience, of protecting one’s life from shame, embarrassment, responsibility, and dramatic change, draws the powerful and the ordinary alike. Abortion makes it possible to at least pretend that a “mistake” can be erased. Far from freeing women to “pursue their dreams,” the legality of abortion exposes them to a temptation that, when indulged, does not pay off in the way they imagine. It might keep their careers on track or reputations intact, but women who abort often find lifelong heartache. The BBC published multiple letters from women describing their abortion stories, and many were filled with guilt and regret. Moreover, their sexual partners and even families are exposed to the same temptation, subjecting pregnant mothers to intense pressure and outright coercion.  “My husband was very upset about it and really wanted me to abort,” wrote one woman. Another wrote her sisters pledged to support her abortion as a teenager and her boyfriend’s father offered to pay for it. Yet another described being forced into an abortion at 16, and another was pressured into an abortion from her “career-oriented” parents. The thought processes that lead to abortion start well before the smooth sales pitch from the consulting nurse at the abortion mill, and Edwards’ text reminds us of that. If Murphy Is a Hypocrite, So Are Most Republicans But much of the commentary on the scandal has focused on the fact that Murphy had just voted with a majority of the House to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortion 20 weeks post-fertilization. The ban and Murphy’s affair are tightly linked: one is founded on pro-family, conservative values, and the other was an abysmal failure to live up to those values. Yet on a moment’s reflection, one should realize that the act of pressuring his girlfriend to abort, though deplorable, did not directly conflict with his vote for the late-term abortion ban. Edwards’ pregnancy was thought to be so early it turned out she was not pregnant at all. Yet the late-term abortion ban is so late that close to 99 of abortions take place before that point in pregnancy. While of course the ban is good, its real-world effects on child destruction would be tiny. In fact, when was the last time Congress voted on anything approaching a bill that would criminalize, or even severely limit access to, first-term or early second-term abortion? Murphy wasn’t being a hypocrite, at least in his actual votes. He was being a moderate.  Whatever the motives, inconsistencies, and personal failings of the representatives who voted for the bill, it is a step in the right direction. If passed, the Pain Capable Act would save lives. For that reason alone, it deserves support. Yet we would be remiss to not consider that such moderate measures as defunding Planned Parenthood (a step myriad Republican candidates for Congress and the president promised) and banning late-term abortions might actually fit Murphy’s ideology. NPR reports that Murphy told the audience at a 2010 Right to Life Convention that “Every child deserves a chance to have a choice at life. Every baby deserves a chance to have a choice at life. And every parent should be supported in their responsibility and commitment to raise that child.” But his text to his former mistress said he “cringed” at the pro-life messages his staff posted, which were much tamer than the above statement. It leaves open the possibility that his actions do, in fact, speak louder than his words. If we judge Murphy by his votes, then perhaps he only thinks very early abortions that are not funded with taxes are morally acceptable? Perhaps those early lives are merely “fetuses,” and not the babies he referred to in his Right to Life speech? Perhaps he does believe that employers have the right to refuse contraception and abortion coverage to employees, but that it’s still ultimately a woman’s choice if she wants to kill her preborn child? Murphy’s actions cast light on the fact that the GOP, far from pushing a “radical anti-abortion agenda” as the Left claims, has a moderate and largely ineffective track record on the abortion issue at the national level. Anti-abortion voters are chronically exasperated with the Republican Party for not pushing hard enough for pro-life measures, much less getting them enacted. To them abortion, like all social issues, is mostly an electoral wedge to drive out the base. The party has a few real fighters for defending the preborn, like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, but for the most part, taxes and business top the GOP list of priorities. Tax reform first. Abolition of the barbaric act of murdering life in the womb? “Not a near-term priority,” GOP Senate whip John Cornyn said when asked about bringing the 20-week ban to the floor. Restricting abortion is an uphill battle on the hill, to be sure. The GOP doesn’t have a filibuster-proof majority to pass this bill in the Senate, but the fact that it isn’t even a priority for a vote and that the GOP is not willing to do anything to put the screws into Democrats the way they do on Republicans when the tables are turned does tell us something about the prevailing mentality of congressional leadership. Murphy’s Hypocrisy Does Not Justify Supporting Abortion Despite Murphy’s pro-life voting record, it is not all that shocking he suggested his mistress terminate her pregnancy. People who give lip service to one moral code and live by another are scattered across all ideological divides. To not ever find one on the pro-life side would be quite extraordinary, given our selfish human natures. But Murphy’s deceit is not an excuse to sweep aside the mountain of evidence for the humanity of the preborn and our duty to protect them. Lying is not worse than murder—not even close. Nor is the pro-life movement a cover for misogyny or to control what women do. Pro-lifers come from both sexes and all walks of life not just to foment the sanctity of human life, but to expose the reality that abortion is not a liberating experience for women. It is terrible for them physically, emotionally, and spiritually. We fight for children and women, which is why Murphy’s scandal is so infuriating and an affront to everything we stand for. The Left asserts that Murphy’s pro-life stance is just a vehicle to control and oppress women, but the irony is that his failure to live up to his pro-life reputation clearly demonstrated exactly that. His suggestion to abort was not just cowardly, it was an assault on mother and child. Murphy isn’t unique. The fallen natures of every one of us are prone to selfish cruelty. Even people who are pro-life find abortion too attractive an option to not at least consider it. In the end, we should take away from Murphy’s moral failing this: our temptation toward cruelty for the sake of convenience is exactly why we must fight in earnest to restrict abortion until it is finally abolished.

"162",162,"No, NYT, The Difference Between Abortion And A Miscarriage Is Not The Mother’s Feelings","Griswold","Kylee",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-08-03"," There’s been an awful lot of talk about miscarriage in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that had nothing to do with it.



As the pro-abortion left clings to its movement in a post-Roe world, two law professors have taken to the New York Times opinion section to ask, “Why Do We Talk About Miscarriage Differently From Abortion?”



It’s an absurd question on its face, with the obvious rejoinder being that we talk differently about miscarriage and abortion for the same reason we talk differently about aneurysms and first-degree murder, consensual sex and rape, or salaried employment and slavery. 



But false equivalencies aside, the writers’ answer to the question is worth exploring because it illuminates how abortion proponents think about women, the tragedy of miscarriage, the realities of abortion, and the value — or not — of human life.



No Blurry Lines Here



They begin with a false premise, which they never support except with tired and debunked talking points about mifepristone, that abortion and miscarriage are commensurate. “The line between abortion and pregnancy loss has always been blurry,” write Greer Donley and Jill Wieber Lens, later adding: “Pregnancy loss and abortion have more in common than many people realize. The physical experiences are often virtually identical.”



According to these writers, the pro-life movement is to blame for our culture perceiving miscarriage and abortion so differently by drawing “a cultural bright line” between the two terms and pushing “dueling narratives of ‘bad’ mothers who voluntarily cause fetal death versus ‘good’ mothers who grieve unpreventable pregnancy loss.” The right learned to “weaponize” the grief of miscarriage, Donley and Wieber Lens claim, painting unborn children as people, portraying abortion as heartless, and leading people to draw a distinction between it and miscarriage. 



They lament, however, that the pro-abortion crowd has only broadened this chasm between miscarriage and abortion by dehumanizing children in utero, which they frame as “minimizing focus on the fetus.” The pro-abortion crowd was afraid of “a slippery slope that would undermine abortion rights,” Donley and Wieber Lens say, adding that “this same fear led the movement to avoid the topic of pregnancy loss or to refer to a fetus or embryo as ‘a clump of cells.’ Any concession of fetal value could be used to chip away at abortion rights, the thinking went.”



“This minimization [of the fetus] can be jarring to women who believe they lost their child in utero,” the law professors warn — a massive understatement for mothers who have miscarried. An expectant mom learning that the child once seen sucking her thumb on a sonogram is now lifeless while hearing the left refer to the unborn at the same gestational age as a “clump of cells” is more than “jarring,” it’s cruel and heartwrenching.



‘Attached’ to a Lie



But Donley and Wieber Lens are here to make things right. After all, there are alliances to be forged. If the pro-abortion left is to succeed in convincing Americans that post-Roe abortion bans are a threat to women who miscarry, they must — with the help of the media — persuade those Americans that intentionally taking the life of a child and tragically losing the life of a child are one and the same. 



So it’s here that they get to their main argument, and their operative word is “attachment.” By the logic of these two law professors, the left can acknowledge “the loss in pregnancy loss” (emphasis theirs) without loosening their grip on their abortion obsession. It’s OK to concede that some mothers get “attached to their children in utero and that attachment has value,” they say, and it’s important to validate this attachment because challenging it makes abortion apologists appear heartless.



Ignore for a moment the authors’ Freudian slip of calling wanted human lives in utero “children”  — and their very wrong assumption that their perceived heartlessness is a result of their ignoring miscarrying mothers’ fetal attachment rather than their support for dismembering innocent life in the womb — because it’s here that they get to the punchline:



“But attachment is entirely subjective — it develops for different people at different rates, depending on their circumstances. And crucially, it may never develop. … If we ground fetal value in the pregnant woman’s attachment, and commit to defending her conception of the pregnancy, we can recognize loss without threatening abortion rights.” (emphasis added)



In other words, a woman’s attachment to the separate human life inside her is what confers value upon that second life. Unborn babies have no value of their own accord. Their worth is entirely determined by whether anyone is attached to them. 



The Obvious Answer



There are a few huge problems with this. First and most obviously, this does nothing to actually solve the pro-abortion left’s optics problem. Communicating to women that their babies are worthless — unless a mother feels otherwise — does little to assuage perceptions of heartlessness.



Second, “attachment” isn’t how we assign value to any other human life. Most U.S. citizens probably aren’t particularly attached to aspiring migrants south of our border, or to the suffering civilians of Ukraine, or to a drug-addicted homeless person they’ve never met. We care about their fate not because of some attachment to them — either our own or someone else’s — but because they’re human beings, and vulnerable ones at that, much like the unborn.



Which leads to the third and most important condemnation of the authors’ phony attachment conception: All human beings — of every age, demographic, and location — possess inherent value. I believe, as Scripture teaches, that each person is made imago Dei, or in the “image of God.” That’s one of the reasons for the intrinsic heaviness of death; as image-bearers, we were created as eternal beings, with death being a bitter result of our sin-stained world. But even if you aren’t a person of faith, the innate value of human beings is obvious in natural law, including both nature and reason. It’s evident in even flawed concepts of justice, in our propensity to celebrate birthdays or existence and to honor the dead, in our desire to see wrongdoers punished for hurting even people we’ve never met, and in our efforts to find cures for cancer, among untold other proofs.



Abortion’s fiercest advocates are grasping at straws — and unrelated tragedies such as miscarriage — to cling to a barbaric practice. It shouldn’t need to be said, but the reason “we talk about miscarriage differently from abortion” has nothing to do with “attachment.” It’s because it’s perfectly normal to talk about things that are completely different completely differently.

"163",163,"Four Senate Republicans Want To Make Taxpayers Pay For Abortions","Jacobs","Christopher",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-01-25"," In the same week as the March for Life and the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, congressional Republicans are presenting strikingly different messages on the issue. While the House of Representatives on Tuesday approved legislation (H.R. 7) that would prohibit federal funding of abortions, with all House Republicans present voting for the bill, on Monday four Republican senators introduced a bill that would allow direct taxpayer funding of abortions. That legislation, the Patient Freedom Act (the PFA, Senate Bill 191), introduced by senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Susan Collins (R-ME), would go further than Obamacare in funding abortion coverage. Whereas Obamacare provides federal funding for insurance plans that cover abortion, the Patient Freedom Act would allow for direct federal funding of abortion procedures themselves.  The PFA (text here, and a summary here) gives states a choice of three options regarding the health care system within their borders. They can: Keep the regime created by Obamacare in place (i.e., the individual and employer mandates, subsidies, etc.), albeit funded at 95 percent of current levels;
Create a new insurance regime, funded by a rather complicated allotment formula—the allotment would equal 95 percent of the funding a state would have received under Obamacare, distributed directly to individuals through new Roth Health Savings Accounts (HSAs); or
Reject Obamacare entirely—and give up all federal funds associated with it. The text of the legislation indicates a clear bias towards option two. If a state does not choose any of the three options, that state will automatically be placed in the second. This Bill Would Repeal Abortion Restrictions If a state chooses the second option, most of the provisions of Title I of Obamacare would not apply. That repeal would include the individual and employer mandates, and some (but not all) of the federal benefit mandates included in Obamacare. Crucially, for states that select the second option (or the third, for that matter), the PFA would repeal Section 1303 of Obamacare, which imposes some restrictions on federal funding of abortion plans. Section 1303 permits states to prohibit abortion coverage on their insurance exchanges, and requires insurers to set up a segregation mechanism intended to keep federal insurance subsidies separate from funds that pay for abortion procedures.  Pro-life groups have attacked the Section 1303 “restrictions” as an accounting sham because money is fungible, and therefore the segregation scheme meaningless. Further, a September 2014 Government Accountability Office report noted that many insurers had not even followed the segregation regime. However, Obamacare made an attempt, albeit a largely meaningless one, to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. By contrast, the PFA makes no such attempt to do so. Follow the Money Because the PFA itself includes no restrictions on taxpayer funding of abortion, it’s critical to examine the source of funding for the new state-based allotments. While the Hyde Amendment prohibits federal funding of abortion, it does so only for appropriations provided through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ spending bill. Other agencies covered through other spending bills must explicitly prohibit funding of abortion coverage, otherwise federal funding of abortion would be permitted—and potentially required by courts as a necessary medical service. The Patient Freedom Act includes only one new appropriation, for a population health initiative created by Section 103(c) of the bill. Therefore, the bill relies on Obamacare’s existing funding stream—the insurance subsidies provided in the form of refundable tax credits—to finance the allotments to individuals’ Roth HSAs. Because that funding stream goes through the Department of the Treasury via the Internal Revenue Code, the Hyde Amendment restrictions do not apply—meaning that federal funds can, and will, finance abortion coverage.  The legislation the House passed on Tuesday (H.R. 7) included an explicit ban on using Obamacare subsidies to fund abortion, or plans that cover abortion. (The ban is in Section 201(a) of the bill.) Because the Patient Freedom Act uses the exact same funding stream to finance its allotments, the sponsors needed to include an explicit ban on abortion funding in their legislation. They did not. Direct Funding of Abortion Procedures Not only would the Patient Freedom Act provide federal funds to insurance plans that cover abortion, it would allow individuals to fund their abortions directly with federal funds. The federal allotments would be directly provided (using a state-based formula developed by the Department of Health and Human Services) to eligible individuals using the new Roth Health Savings Account option. Recipients can use Roth HSA funds to fund health insurance premiums, provided those premiums are for plans that meet several federal mandates, or they can use their account to fund “qualified medical expenses.” The definition of “qualified medical expenses”—available at Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code here—includes no prohibition on abortion as a medical expense. Because the Internal Revenue Code is not subject to the Hyde Amendment, that law’s restrictions would not apply. Therefore, individuals could use federal dollars deposited into their Roth HSA to fund abortion procedures. Current law does permit some tax breaks for abortion coverage. The tax code exempts employer-provided health insurance premiums from income and payroll taxes. Because some employer plans cover abortion, individuals receive a tax benefit for abortion coverage. Likewise, individuals can currently use their HSA funds to pay for abortions, given the definition of “qualified medical expenses.” However, in both those cases, individuals and employers are using their own money to fund abortion procedures, and receiving a tax break from the federal government for doing so. By contrast, the Patient Freedom Act goes further, allowing the direct use of the federal government’s money to cover abortions, and plans that cover abortions. That is a significant expansion of federal abortion funding that exceeds anything in Obamacare. And it’s a strikingly odd message for the senators to send on a week when many conservatives are focusing on protecting innocent life, not using taxpayer funds to destroy it.

"164",164,"New Study Highlights Why At-Home Abortions Are Dangerous To Women","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-09-13"," The last year saw a new trend in abortion advocacy: Promoting DIY abortions. Several women’s (and fashion!) magazines hyped illegal black-market chemical abortions—a dangerous fad, as I have detailed. Regardless, abortion experts also took up the mantle, with one of the leaders in the field, Dr. Grossman, co-authoring an article in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology laying out a research agenda to move the sale of abortion pills (Mifeprex and misoprostol) over-the-counter. In an op-ed for The Guardian, Grossman explained his research explores “Whether the drugs used in medication abortion meet the criteria of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for over-the-counter sale?” His conclusion? “The answer is a qualified yes, although more research is needed.”  In promoting DIY abortions, both the fashionistas and the physicians stress the supposed safety of chemical abortions and the presumption that “women are smart, sentient beings who can follow directions, take medication as prescribed, and seek care when needed.” Of course, the first assumption—that a chemical abortion is safe—ignores the life-destroying impact of the drugs on the baby in utero. But now a just-published study in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology refutes, albeit inadvertently, the second proposition, establishing instead that nearly 20 percent of women undergoing a chemical abortion ignore the explicit directions their abortion provider gave. I say “inadvertently” because that was neither the objective nor the intent of the research study. Rather, authors Ushama D. Upadhyay and Karen R. Meckstroth sought to examine the relationship between the distance traveled for an abortion and whether women who sought follow-up care returned to the original abortion provider or to an emergency room. Many Women Don’t Follow Doctor’s Orders In this study, the team culled California Medicaid records and discovered that of the women who sought medical treatment following an abortion, those who traveled 100 miles or more for an abortion had higher odds of seeking follow-up care at an emergency room than women who lived within 25 miles of the abortion provider. The authors also determined that the median cost for follow-up treatment at an emergency room exceeded the median cost of treatment at the original clinic by $405. Leftist outlets, such as HuffPost, seized on this research to bemoan the lack of abortion providers, warning: “When Abortion Clinics Close, Healthcare Costs Go Up.” No doubt it is cheaper for California (which pays for elective abortions for poor women through its state-funded Medicaid program, Medi-Cal) if abortion clinics are plentiful. It is also less expensive for the state to pay abortionists to kill the babies in utero than to pay doctors to deliver the babies and for medical care for the next 18 years. Yet, given that only 3 percent of the women in the study sought follow-up care in emergency rooms, and some of those women may have had true emergencies, the total savings would seem minimal.  But this study is nonetheless informative for a different reason. The data underlying its research exposed a reality denied (or downplayed) by DIY abortion proponents: Women undergoing a chemical abortion do not follow directions, even when given by a physician, and even when the patient promised to do so in a signed “patient agreement.” The authors sidestepped these details, though, and those unfamiliar with the protocol for chemical abortion might not have noticed this important discovery, so here are the facts. The 14-Day Post-Procedure Appointment The study reviewed data from Medicaid claims of women in the Medi-Cal program for the years 2011 and 2012. That data, and specifically the coding, allowed the authors to determine the number of women who underwent a chemical abortion and whether they later returned to their abortion provider or an emergency room for follow-up treatment. Significantly, during 2011 and 2012, the label for Mifeprex provided: Patients should be fully advised of the treatment procedure and its effects. Patients should be given a copy of the Medication Guide and the PATIENT AGREEMENT. (Additional copies of the Medication Guide and the PATIENT AGREEMENT are available by contacting Danco Laboratories at 1-877-4 Early Option) (1-877-432-7596). Patients should be advised to review both the Medication Guide and the PATIENT AGREEMENT, and should be given the opportunity to discuss them and obtain answers to any questions they may have. Each patient must understand:
– the necessity of completing the treatment schedule, including a follow-up visit approximately 14 days after taking The FDA-approved label reiterated this point a second time: “Day 14: Post-Treatment Examination. Patients will return for a follow-up visit approximately 14 days after the administration of Mifeprex. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred.” The medication guide the FDA required to be given to and reviewed with the patient likewise stated: “About Day 14 at your provider’s office: This follow-up visit is very important. You must return to the provider about 14 days after you have taken Mifeprex to be sure you are well and that you are not pregnant.”  The FDA also mandated that doctors require patients to sign a patient agreement form, in which patients committed to returning for a follow-up visit in 14 days. Specifically, the form stated: “I must return to my provider’s office in about 2 weeks (about Day 14) after I take Mifeprex to be sure that my pregnancy has ended and that I am well.” A second time, the form reiterated the patient’s commitment to “do the following – return to my provider’s office about 14 days after beginning treatment to be sure that my pregnancy has ended and that I am well.” Yet even with these clear and repetitive directives, only 81 percent of women undergoing chemical abortions followed through with their commitment to attend the “very important” follow-up visit. That means one in five women did not. Here’s the data from the study: Among all abortions, 4 percent of chemical abortions were followed by an emergency room visit and 77 percent were followed by a visit to the original abortion site. As the study’s authors noted, this data is solid: “a strength of the study is that it used data from a complete system with virtually no loss to follow-up, and thus we can reasonably expect that all follow-up visits, regardless of source of care, were captured.” Nonetheless, nowhere in their article did the authors highlight the fact that nearly 20 percent of women undergoing a chemical abortion ignored the label instructions, their doctor’s directive, and their own commitment in the signed patient agreement to return for a follow-up appointment. Instead, the authors merely stated in passing that “[p]atients having a medication abortion are routinely advised to return for follow-up to rule out continuing pregnancies.” And “[a]s of March 2016, the label for medication abortion no longer recommends a follow-up visit.” These two fleeting references downplay the explicit directions given to women to return for a “very important” follow-up visit in about two weeks. If nearly one in five women ignore such explicit “very important” directions given by their doctor, it is foolhardy to imagine all or even nearly all will follow the directions accompanying DIY abortions. These results should thus give pause to those promoting illegal DIY abortions and over-the-counter availability of Mifeprex. That is, if they want to avoid sending more girls and young women to the emergency room—or worse, the morgue.

"165",165,"California Moves To Force Public Universities To Administer Abortion Pills","Hawkins","Kristan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-02-09"," A move is underway to transform California public universities from institutions dedicated to educating and empowering the nation’s next generation of leaders into abortion vendors. The California state assembly is now considering SB 320, a measure that would mandate that all California state-funded universities administer RU-486, a drug designed to induce abortion, on their campuses. The idea is to have schools partner with mega-abortion providers so that students at risk from a lonely and potentially dangerous abortion can access them from their dorm rooms. Parents and students should be very worried about this aggressive attempt to reconfigure student health centers from places of healing to abortion franchises in business with detached abortion mega-providers who reap the reward without the risk. And the risks can be grave.  The FDA reports that such drug-induced abortions have led to cases of extreme bleeding, infection and incomplete abortions requiring a surgery, and even to the death of mothers. The drugs are especially dangerous to women who are later in pregnancy or are experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, both conditions which must be determined by an ultrasound (using equipment not usually found in a college health center.) And that is before we add in the emotional experience of waiting alone in a bathroom to see the pre-born infant pass into a toilet. Writing about her chemical abortion, former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson talked about her horrific encounter with an abortion that lasted for 8 weeks and began minutes after taking the drug. “Ten minutes later, I started to feel pain in my abdomen unlike anything I had ever experienced,” she wrote. “Then the blood came. It was gushing out of me. I couldn’t wear a pad … nothing was able to absorb the amount of blood I was losing. The only thing I could do was sit on the toilet. I sat there for hours … bleeding, throwing up into the bathroom trashcan, crying and sweating. I used to watch shows about childbirth. I would see these women in labor and they would be covered in sweat. I would always think, ‘Gosh, do they keep it hot in the delivery room, or what?’ But at that moment, sitting on the toilet, I knew it wasn’t from heat … it was from pain.” Writing about his pain as a father, Monty Patterson recalls the day his 18-year-old daughter Holly died in a San Francisco area hospital from Septic Shock due to endomyometritis (uterus-related blood infection) caused by a drug-induced abortion. He learned about RU-486 at his daughter’s bedside, when “the doctor came in and briskly explained, ‘We are doing everything we can for her, but she might not make it. These things sometimes happen as a result of the pill.’  “I was completely baffled,” he wrote. “‘What, the birth control pill?’ I asked. ‘No, the abortion pill,’ the doctor replied.” The family later learned that Holly had called the Planned Parenthood clinic hotline to complain about severe cramping, and was told to take a prescribed Tylenol-Codeine painkiller. “After Holly’s funeral, I learned that she had relied on information from the internet in addition to the advice she had received from her abortion provider (Planned Parenthood) about the risks of medical abortion,” her father wrote. And therein lies the problem. In handing out potentially deadly drugs to students who don’t have a frame of reference for how much pain is too much and how much blood loss is dangerous, California contemplates becoming the bellwether state in experimenting with young lives. This is not merely a California initiative. Students travel from all over the world to be educated in the state’s finest institutions, and the bill’s sponsor describes this as “a model across the country, for every state.”  Taxpayers, parents and students might ask, who benefits from such a risk? A look at the bill’s language provides a clue. In the bill, sponsored by state Sen. Connie M. Leyva (D-Chino) who brags about the support her measure has from Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and the abortion industry et al, we find that the abortion industry can infiltrate the program … for a fee. The bill would empower the Treasurer of a Medication Abortion Implementation Fund to “hire appropriate individuals or contract with an external organization or organizations to provide consultation to each public university student health center to establish plans and budgets for implementation of abortion by medication techniques. (And) Hire appropriate individuals or contract with external organizations to create and provide appropriate trainings for staff of each public university student health center.” The billion-dollar abortion industry could get a cut as they counsel college and university health centers on how to become abortion vendors. And we have not even begun to consider other risks. As I’ve written before, such life-ending drugs have been used by abusers and estranged partners to end the lives of wanted children, when drugs were slipped to women without their consent. No language in the bill restricts the use of taxpayer dollars or student fees to fund campus abortions, and no need for such a dangerous precedent is apparent. In fact, a recent study showed that all University of California or California State University campuses are within an average of 5.97 miles of a medical abortion provider. However, if abortion advocates consider abortion providers inaccessible at 6 miles, what kind of attention is being given to emergency care should a woman experience a dangerous complication? CSU officials have talked with the media, expressing concerns that such a mandate “would impose severe costs for liability insurance, safety improvements, medical training and round-the-clock phone support for medical emergencies.” “Currently our CSU health centers offer basic health services, however, the administration of medications still requires a level of expertise that our health center staff may not have,” said Toni Molle a spokeswoman for the CSU chancellor’s office, in an interview with the Associated Press. Given that the stakes are life and death, health center staff should not be tasked with such deadly drugs. Across California, more than 90 Students for Life groups are now mobilizing on their campuses hosting displays, demonstrating, petitioning, and speaking at community and church events in opposition of SB320. They will continue to demand elected officials protect women’s lives and health by keeping abortion drugs off their campuses.

"166",166,"Contrary To Claims Of Pro-Abortion Hysterics, Red States Have Little Power To Curb Abortion Drug Use","Reid","Ken",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-26"," Now that the Supreme Court has returned abortion control to the states, and thus the voters, the next political battle will be over access to abortion drugs, which now constitute 54 percent of all terminated pregnancies in the United States today.



According to the Wall Street Journal, two medications — mifepristone and misoprostol — are typically used in a chemical abortion regimen. A single dose of mifepristone (Brand name: Mifeprex) is followed by a regimen of misoprostol (Brand name: Cytotec), depending on the number of weeks into the pregnancy. Reproductive health experts contend the drugs are safe and have efficacy rates of 95 percent if administered at 10 weeks of pregnancy or earlier.



Costs for a chemical abortion vary by state but range from $350 for a remote telehealth consultation to $750 for an in-person consultation, the Journal stated. Most health insurance plans pay for these drugs, and Medicaid would if the abortion is needed in the case of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother.



The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Mifeprex in 2000 and its use has grown steadily vs. surgical abortions. According to data from the pro-abortion Alan Guttmacher Institute, chemical abortions account for more than half of all abortions today compared to just 36 percent in 2017. The drug is only approved for use up to 10 weeks, but because the FDA doesn’t regulate medical practice, doctors could conceivably assume the risk and prescribe it beyond 10 weeks.



On Dec. 16, 2021, the FDA removed the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone and expanded the distribution to certified pharmacies and certified clinicians. This change allows for the distribution of abortion drugs by mail in states that do not restrict telehealth for chemical abortions. Despite the change to the in-person requirement, prescribers are still required to be certified by the manufacturers.



In response to the Dobbs decision, allowing states to regulate abortion, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill making mail-order abortion pills illegal in the state, and Louisiana’s governor signed into law a bill that outlawed out-of-state providers from mailing abortion pills, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $75,000 fine, effective Aug. 1.  South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential GOP presidential candidate in 2024, signed a bill restricting chemical abortions via telemedicine.



According to the Guttmacher Institute, at least “19 states require the clinician providing a medication abortion to be physically present when the medication is administered, thereby prohibiting the use of telemedicine to prescribe medication for abortion.” Seven such requirements were passed just last year, along with six new laws banning the mailing of abortion pills, according to The New York Times.



Can States Override the FDA?



However, two legal restraints on the states will likely make it difficult for them to curtail abortion drug prescribing, including mail-order bans.



The first is the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 gives Congress the power “to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.” Over the past 80 years, the Supreme Court has substantially curtailed the ability of states to regulate interstate commerce.



The second is FDA preemption. Because Congress designated the FDA with the power to review and approve applications for drugs, devices, and medical products, states cannot impose restrictions of their own.



U.S Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement the day the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, that “States may not ban Mifepristone based on disagreement with the FDA’s expert judgment about its safety and efficacy.” He vowed to go to court to protect chemical abortions, and one can assume the pharmaceutical industry will, too.



States have not been successful in banning or curtailing other FDA-approved drugs, notably in California last year, which tried to ban the practice of generic drug makers accepting payments to hold off on the marketing of lower-cost prescription medicines, and in Massachusetts in 2014, when the state tried to prohibit an abuse-resistant opioid drug.



As a result, efforts by a number of states to curtail abortion in wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade might not make a significant difference. 



For example, newly elected Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, is seeking legislation to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest, and to protect the life of the mother. However, only 3 percent of abortions in Virginia in 2019 (latest data available) occurred after 15 weeks- fewer than 400. Without passing any laws addressing chemical abortions, most abortions in Virginia will proceed as usual. 



Much has been reported about 13 states having “trigger laws;” essentially laws that banned or curtailed abortion pre-Roe that remained on the books, and which then became law when Dobbs was decided. Of those states, only in Missouri would a majority of abortions become illegal, according to CDC data. 



Ohio and Texas have enacted restrictions on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. However, CDC data indicates that if abortions prior to 10 weeks are induced by Mifeprex/Misoprostol, some 62 percent would continue in Ohio and 80 percent in Texas due to the drugs’ availability.



Additionally, 26 states are likely not to stiffen abortion laws so surgical abortions will remain available to women who wish to travel to abort unborn children.



The left is in hysteria about the Dobbs ruling, hoping it will boost Democratic turnout for candidates facing certain defeat this fall due to the eroding economy. But a closer look at what laws the red states are actually passing shows that many abortions will continue, as many states are going to great lengths to accommodate exemptions.



Had pro-abortion extremists not contested Mississippi’s 15-week ban, Roe v. Wade might be intact today.

"167",167,"It’s Time To Put Pro-Abortion Lawmakers On The Defensive: Whose Lives Are Worth Protecting?","Roberts","Kevin",NA,"Anderson, Jessica",NA,NA,"2022-09-29"," It’s been three months since the Supreme Court corrected the grievous mistake of Roe v. Wade and stated that there is no right to abort a child enshrined in the Constitution. And yet we still don’t know where some current or prospective members of Congress stand on this vital issue.



For the first time in 50 years, the Dobbs decision gives the defenders of life a chance to roll back the extreme policy positions of pro-abortion advocates. 



Thanks to the unprecedented leak of the draft opinion, both sides learned in May that Roe v. Wade was headed to the ash heap of history. The left instantly mobilized to picket the homes of justices and rallied around a bill to codify nationwide abortion on demand until birth.



Since then, dozens of churches and pregnancy resource centers have been vandalized and torched across the country. An armed pro-abortion radical on a mission to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh was even apprehended just outside his home. And last week an 84-year-old pro-life volunteer was shot in the back while going door-to-door to talk about an abortion-related ballot measure. 



The pro-abortion left, seemingly impervious to irony, claims there will be “blood on the hands” of those who seek even the most modest of protections for unborn life. With lots of help from corporate media, academia, and major medical associations — and with a huge spending advantage on this issue ($34 million to $1.1 million by some counts) — this preposterous message has gotten traction. 



President Biden’s failed fiscal, economic, and inflation policies rightly belong center stage in this midterm election. But conservatives must not allow the left to define the debate on the most profound question of all: whose lives are worthy of protection? After all, overturning Roe was never the end goal of the life moment; it was a necessary step. Our goal was and remains the protection of innocent unborn children and their mothers. Today, pro-abortion forces control Congress and the White House. Now is the time to put them on the defensive.



Sen. Lindsey Graham recently tried to refocus attention on the humanity of children who can feel excruciating pain from abortion by introducing the Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act. The left predictably attacked it as being an extreme national ban, even though it covers only around 5 percent of abortions, even though it includes rape, incest, and life of the mother exceptions, and even though the bill allows abortions later in a pregnancy than most of Europe. 



Do pro-abortion advocates agree that abortion should be legal at any time for any reason right through the moment of birth? Former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam introduced many to the concept in 2019 when he responded to a question about late-term abortion by saying, “The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.”



More recently, five bodies of full-term babies were recovered from a D.C. abortion facility’s “medical waste” bins, showing evidence of either partial-birth abortion or having been born alive after an abortion and left to die (or worse).



People like Kermit Gosnell, America’s most prolific serial killer, thrived in the pre-Dobbs world of anything goes abortion. The sad truth is that places like D.C., New York, and California, have only fortified their abortion on demand, up until birth, no questions asked regime. The risk of infanticide and extreme abortion policies being quietly tolerated in these radical states is too real to ignore and cries out for a federal solution even as conservatives are doing what they can to advance protections for life at the state level.



Sen. Ben Sasse and Rep. Ann Wagner have introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would outlaw infanticide at the federal level and they have 45 and 206 co-sponsors in the Senate and House, respectively.



Of course, prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion, ending sex-selective abortion, gestational protections, and stopping the interstate flood of dangerous abortion pills through the mail must all be pursued as well. Still, nothing beats the question that must be asked of every member of Congress: Are you for or against outlawing post-birth abortions and infanticide?



At the Heritage Foundation, we acknowledge the reality that life begins at conception. We will never stop fighting until every unborn child is protected. We will work with conservatives to prohibit taxpayer funding of abortion, end sex-selective abortion, protect babies who can feel pain, stop the interstate flood of dangerous abortion pills through the mail, and more.



Where every current and prospective member of Congress stands on these commonsense protections for life is important. The American public has a right to know if they side with a majority of Americans or if they will continue to defend the indefensible.

A mom living states away made that plea after hearing my early-April radio interview discussing a lower court’s ruling that put the distribution of the abortion pill on hold. With the Supreme Court’s Friday decision that while challenges to the Food and Drug Administration’s regulations proceed, the abortion pill must remain available by mail and without the FDA’s original safety precautions, the country needs to hear her story.



I’ll call her “Jenny,” for while she wanted her story shared, she does not want her identity known. She messaged me after hearing me summarize federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s opinion — one that’s driving abortion activists crazy because the Trump appointee had dared to call unborn humans, “unborn humans.” 



During the interview, I stressed that while decades of rhetoric hid the reality of abortion, the plain-talking opinion brought home the truth. The judge detailed how the abortion pill combination worked: first starving the unborn human and then causing the mother to deliver her dead baby, often at home in her toilet. Kacsmaryk continued without euphemistic gloss to shield the sensibilities of Americans, speaking of the woman who was “surprised and saddened to see that her aborted baby ‘had a head, hands, and legs’ with ‘[d]efined fingers and toes.’” 



“I was struck because what you were describing happened to me,” Jenny wrote, sharing in vivid detail the events of more than two decades ago.



In Jenny’s Words



(The following is a story quoted from Jenny herself, edited lightly only for length and clarity. It contains sensitive content about the aftermath of abortion.)



I was a second-year law student, living with my then-boyfriend (now husband). I was very liberal and a good feminist influenced by second-wave feminism. I found out I was pregnant just before Christmas. I wanted to keep the baby, but I was persuaded by family and my husband that it would interfere with my ability to finish law school and future career prospects. My husband was also terrified of letting his parents down and having a baby out of wedlock, which is something his parents always warned him about when he was young.  



After Christmas, I called my GYN’s office, and without seeing me or speaking to me, the doctor asked the receptionist to give me the name and phone number of an abortionist. I made an appointment with him and was told it would cost $500. I had no idea what was going on or what I was doing. I was just making the calls and showed up.



My now-husband and I showed up for the appointment, mere days before New Year’s Eve. The abortionist was very direct and to the point. He gave me a transvaginal ultrasound, pointed at the screen, and said, “Here is the pregnancy.” 



He then asked me if I wanted an abortion, and I said yes. He told me to roll over on the table, and he gave me an injection in my right hip. He told me this shot would make the heart stop beating. He then wrote me a prescription and told me to get it filled, take the pills, and insert them in my vagina in a few days, and that I would have cramping like a period and some light bleeding. He then said to make an appointment for another ultrasound to make sure it was clear.



I don’t know if I was in shock or not thinking things through. But it never occurred to me that I would be expelling an actual baby in my apartment. I was not prepared for what happened. Neither was my husband. I inserted the pills on Sunday, Jan. 2, 2000. My husband’s brother played college football and they were in a bowl game that day, so we sat on the couch and watched the game. 



I started having intense cramping. At one point I went to the toilet, and a baby came out. It looked exactly like the pictures of seven- to 9-week-old babies you see in photos. It was rounded. There was a black eye. My husband fished it out of the toilet and held the dead baby in his hand. I remember looking at it and wondering what it was. 



But I also knew what it was. I remember going completely numb. I did not ask to hold the baby. I just stared at it. My husband looked at me, and I think he was in shock too. He put the baby in the toilet and flushed it. 



I have never forgiven myself.



I went to the doctor a couple of days later and the ultrasound was clear.



The next semester of school started for both of us. We decided to get married right away. I did not want to be in the situation again of not being married and getting pregnant. We were married by the fall. I think the wedding planning and law school kept me busy and kept me from thinking about what I had done.



We now have three children, but I still cry myself to sleep thinking of that baby. Nobody prepared me for what happened that day. Nobody even told me what would happen that day. I mourn that baby. I regret what I did with everything in me. 



I kept being a liberal. I kept voting for Democrats and telling people I supported abortions. But something happened when I had my daughter in 2008. I started to realize the lies that were told to me. I started to realize I was an experiment for feminism. I realized I had been used by people with an agenda. 



Hearing you talk about people being unprepared for having an abortion at home really hit me. It’s true. It’s the first time I heard someone acknowledge what happened and understand how horrifying and traumatic it was. 



I was lucky and didn’t have to go to the emergency room. But I also wonder what would have happened if I had needed to. I was so unprepared for what was happening, I am not sure I would have realized I needed medical attention. Everything had been so casual and nonchalant. I did not grasp the seriousness of what I was doing. If I had started bleeding, I don’t think I would have thought I needed help. This sounds crazy to me now, but this is the cognitive dissonance I was experiencing.



I never went back to the GYN who referred me to the abortionist — my sister did and had two babies delivered by her. I couldn’t stand even hearing her name when my sister mentioned her. I can’t even remember it; it’s as if my brain won’t let me think of that phone call. 



On the other hand, I will never forget the abortionist. His name, his office, his matter-of-fact way of telling me what he was doing, but also his complete avoidance of telling me what was happening. I read that he died. He was also a big abortion guy. I had no idea at the time. I also didn’t realize at the time that what he did was not even approved. 



I now have three children, including a teenage daughter. I have not told her what happened. She and her brothers have no idea. I don’t even mark this pregnancy on doctors’ forms. I am not even sure if there is a record anywhere that I did what I did.



— “Jenny”



The Truth About Chemical Abortion



Jenny’s shot-pill chemical abortion pre-dated the FDA’s approval of the abortion pill combination and relied on off-label uses of drugs authorized for other purposes. But both methods kill unborn humans and leave the mother to deliver her now-dead baby at home. 



Since then, the FDA has approved the abortion pill combination and over the years removed many of the safeguards for women that even Jenny’s abortionist employed when using off-label drugs. No longer is an ultrasound required to ensure the pregnancy is properly dated and is not ectopic; use of the abortion pill combination when experiencing an ectopic pregnancy can be fatal for the mother. In fact, the FDA no longer requires a doctor to examine a woman or even be the one to prescribe the abortion pill. Nor is any follow-up appointment required.



The FDA also extended the approved use of the abortion pill to 10-weeks gestation. But with no ultrasound or even medical exam required, and with misdating of pregnancies common, use extends much beyond the first trimester. Thus the situation one woman recounted, as Kacsmaryk summarized in his opinion: “The abortionist misdated the baby’s gestational age as six weeks, resulting in the at-home delivery of a ‘lifeless, fully formed baby in the toilet,’ later determined to be around 30-36 weeks old.” 



While litigation continues over the FDA’s approval of the abortion drug and the federal agency’s later removal of the various safeguards, women will continue to have on-demand chemical abortions. But abortion by pill-popping is still abortion, and it kills an unborn human child.



As Jenny painfully recounted, she may not have faced that fact at the time, but she did and will for the rest of her life. Now she wants you to know the truth before you make the same mistake she did. But she also wants you to know that when it comes to motherhood, you can do it — and for everyone surrounding a woman who thinks she can’t, assure her she can and help her every step of the way.

"170",170,"YouTube Slaps Dehumanizing Pro-Abortion ‘Context’ Onto Pro-Life Videos","Corso","Sophia",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-10-13"," Google-owned YouTube has been flexing its censorship muscles against conservative voices for a while, but the Big Tech company’s tactics just got even worse: Now, tacked onto the posts of pro-lifers, YouTube is directing users to pro-abortion information. This means that life-affirming videos — such as those that tell the truth about the grisly details of abortion, share deeply held Catholic beliefs on the sanctity of life, and discuss alternatives to abortion, such as the life-saving pregnancy centers Democrats have slandered — will now have links slapped onto their videos that direct viewers to the pro-abortion talking points they’re advocating against. YouTube is following its predictable partisan pattern, using the cover of “misinformation” and “context” to dehumanize unborn human lives.  YouTube’s purported “context” accompanying the videos reads “abortion health information,” with a definition from the National Library of Medicine (NLM): “An abortion is a procedure to end a pregnancy. It uses medicine or surgery to remove the embryo or fetus and placenta from the uterus. The procedure is done by a licensed healthcare professional.” And though YouTube hides behind the cover of medical “experts” at the NLM, like it did when it censored Covid-19 dissenters, it’s notable that NLM is just another hub of progressive federal government bureaucrats within the National Institutes of Health that plugs abortion and has reportedly published thousands of papers on “racism and medicine.” YouTube’s “context” disclaimer also includes a link to the NLM’s abortion informational page, which suggests ways to abort a child: “medication abortion” or “procedural abortion.” The former is a chemically induced abortion in the first trimester, during which time babies’ limbs, skeletons, and major organs are fully developing, their hearts are beating strong, and they can taste and feel pain. In this type of abortion, the mother takes a pill that blocks nourishment and blood from the unborn baby, which kills it. The mother then takes a second pill to cause contractions and severe cramping and bleeding, leading to the delivery of her dead child. “Procedural abortion” after the first trimester entails a dilation and evacuation abortion (D&E), in which an abortionist dilates the mother’s cervix and then uses a suction tube and sopher clamp to kill the unborn child by ripping its body apart limb by limb. The National Library of Medicine page linked by YouTube describes this in wholly dehumanizing terms, describing the dismemberment abortion as “a procedure to remove the pregnancy from the uterus.” Under the “Learn More” section of this NLM abortion information webpage, it includes links to pages such as “Abortion Care,” “Ending a Pregnancy,” and “Know Your Rights: Reproductive Health Care,” but no pro-life pages or post-abortion testimonies discussing the horrific realities of abortion, such as this Live Action video to which YouTube attached its abortion-sanitizing “context.”  Live Action “Adding these disclaimers is clear political bias on the part of YouTube against pro-life groups and messaging,” policy analyst Clare Morell told the Catholic News Agency. “Rather than allowing for free speech and debate in today’s modern public square, YouTube is preferring one side and position over the other by adding these disclaimers. And attempting to prejudice viewers against the pro-life position.” This is certainly not the first time Big Tech has attempted to choke out pro-life perspectives. In August, after pressure from House Democrats, Google announced it would change its search results “to distinguish pro-life pregnancy centers from abortion clinics in search results for people dealing with crisis pregnancies.” In other words, Google would ensure that women exploring abortion online wouldn’t stumble on a wholistic women’s pregnancy center that would give them a different choice.

"171",171,"After Ralph Northam, The ‘Bodily Autonomy’ Argument For Abortion Is Shot","Enriquez","Lauren",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-11"," My body, my choice! has long been the rallying cry of the abortion movement. In recent years, advocates made a more concerted effort to substantiate the sound bite by pushing a philosophical argument for abortion they called the “bodily autonomy” (or bodily “integrity”) argument. The argument goes like this: The highest moral good is to have autonomy over one’s own body. This autonomy includes the right to kill the body of a preborn child attached to and reliant on my body. Therefore, abortion is moral.  Bodily autonomy is the abortion dogma pushed from the top down by groups like Planned Parenthood. The abortion giant released an actual manifesto on bodily autonomy last year, which reads, in part: “We believe your body is your own. If it is not, you cannot be truly free or equal… We are building a world where everyone has the freedom and opportunity to control their own bodies and their own futures…” And it’s working. A quick search for the term “bodily autonomy” on Twitter yields countless examples of the term being used in defense of abortion every day. The argument departs from classical personal autonomy beliefs by subsuming within it a right to kill another person’s body. Adherents to this argument cannot cogently explain why, if bodily autonomy is the highest good (trumping the inherent human right to life itself), it can be withheld from the body of the preborn child. The argument becomes almost comical when, to circumvent this problem, abortion apologists are reduced to characterizing the preborn child as an unjust aggressor who somehow forced his way into his mother’s body against her will and now maliciously uses her in parasitic fashion (see virtually any Twitter debate with a bodily autonomy proponent).  In the face of indisputable science and technology proving that the child in the womb is a unique and human being, abortion advocates can no longer have recourse to arguing that the child in the womb is “not really human.” Therefore, the pro-life position that the right to life belongs to all humans and is the basis upon which all other rights are predicated usually meets an insistence that the child’s right to life is subjugated to the mother’s bodily autonomy. But this version of bodily autonomy, however flawed, is the only foundation left upon which to argue that killing that separate, innocent human being is morally justified. The new national debate over the legality and morality of infanticide may have just unraveled what was left of the bodily autonomy argument. First, the abortion industry’s most powerful ally—the Democrat Party—has spearheaded legislation that would allow abortion until the point of birth (which is now legal in eight states and the District of Columbia), and sanction infanticide when a so-called unwanted child emerged from her mother’s body. This is exactly what happened recently in Virginia, where Del. Kathy Tran argued for HB 2491, the Repeal Act. The failed bill would have permitted abortion up to birth and, as the American people learned, would allow for infanticide after the child was born. When asked by Del. Todd Gilbert whether her bill would allow abortion while a mother was in active labor at full term, Tran responded: “My bill would allow that, yes.” Virginia’s governor, Ralph Northam, coolly and candidly explained on camera that, under Tran’s bill, live babies could be delivered and made comfortable before a “discussion” ensued between the mother and doctor as to the baby’s fate.  The nation predictably exploded in outrage after Tran’s and Northam’s respective revelations, taking to social media and op-ed pages across the country to express disbelief and shock. Nevertheless, both Tran and Northam, bolstered by the public solidarity of their Democratic Party, dug in their heels and insisted their views were not outside the mainstream of abortion thought. They actually went so far as to paint themselves as victims of Republican extremism. To save the bodily autonomy argument—which, keep in mind, is the only argument the abortion industry has left—this would have been the moment for groups like the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the National Abortion Federation, and other leading abortion groups and their allies to draw a line in the sand. If bodily autonomy is the foundation upon which the right to abortion is built, there is no justification by extension for infanticide. The umbilical cord is severed. The child killed in infanticide is no longer inside of or attached to her mother. But from the abortion industry, we have heard silence. Complete, utter, deafening silence. The few peeps we heard came from the abortion lobby’s media allies, and those have only been to deny the actual verbiage of Tran’s and Northam’s statements, gaslighting their movement and the American people into thinking that they didn’t hear what they heard (see here, here, and here for examples). There never was a sound argument for killing innocent human beings in abortion. And there never will be. But whatever stronghold the abortion movement had on its single remaining line of defense—the bodily autonomy argument—has now been lost. Instead, their silent complicity confirms what we have all known in the pro-life movement for half a century: The abortion industry is faithful to one thing, and that is the license to kill children at any stage and for whatever reason they can get away with.

"172",172,"5 Most Shocking Abortion Policies Biden-Harris Openly Support","Chalk","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-20"," Asked about abortion rights during the Oct. 7 vice-presidential debate, Democratic Party candidate Sen. Kamala Harris declared: “I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump and the vice president, Michael Pence.” In turn, Pence accused Joe Biden and Harris of supporting “taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth,” a claim NPR labeled untrue. Yet the Democratic Party is indeed unabashedly pro-abortion, promoting policies to ensure abortions may be sex- and race-selective and taxpayer-paid, occur in the last month of pregnancy, and are done even by medical practitioners who conscientiously oppose them. Democrats also seek to limit pregnancy-center alternatives. They are, quite simply, the abortion party.  1. Democrats Support Aborting Babies Based on Race, Sex, or Disability Democrats have consistently opposed legislation that seeks to limit abortions that are based on race, sex, or disabilities such as Down syndrome. When Oklahoma in February 2019 considered HB 1396, which would have prohibited abortion after the sex of the fetus is known, its only two opponents on the state legislature’s Public Health Committee were Democrats. TThe Democratic Party has a long history of opposition to such measures. When the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012 considered the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, which would have prohibited abortions because of the father’s race or the unborn child’s sex, Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the bill. When a similar bill was codified in Arizona in 2011, it did so with the support of only two Democratic representatives out of a total 24 in the state’s legislature. Democrats opposed a similar bill in North Dakota in 2013. Currently, 10 states ban abortions for reason of sex selection at some point in pregnancy, three states prohibit abortions for reasons of race, and three states prohibit abortions when the fetus might have a genetic anomaly. Harris aims to reverse such bans, endorsing the Women’s Health Protection Act. She declared that “states that have a history of passing legislation that is designed to prevent or limit a woman’s access to reproductive health care” would be subject to review and approval by the Department of Justice. “Until we determine that they are constitutional, they will not take effect,” Harris said.  2. Democrats Support Taxpayer-Funded Abortions Biden once supported the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of Medicaid dollars for abortion in most cases. Yet in June 2019, following significant criticism for this stance, Biden reversed his opinion and now opposes the amendment, a position shared by most Democrats — this, even though hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have gone to abortionists. Without Hyde, it would be hundreds of millions more. Harris has stated her desire to overturn Hyde, while Biden has promised to restore federal funding to Planned Parenthood. During the primary, when asked by the Washington Post, “Should federal law require all private insurance plans to cover abortion?” most of the Democratic presidential candidates answered yes. Biden declined to answer that question. Harris has received a 100 percent rating from the pro-choice organization NARAL and has been labeled “one of Planned Parenthood’s most vocal supporters,” so one can only presume she also would answer in the affirmative. 3. Democrats Oppose Conscientious Objections for Pro-Life Medical Professionals In 2019, Democrats in the House of Representatives submitted the Medicare for America Act (H.R. 2452), a new national health insurance program that clearly states conscience protections would not apply to any medical professional under any circumstance. It states, in part: “Health care providers and institutions are prohibited from denying covered individuals access to covered benefits and services because of their religious objections.” Medical providers have sought to force medical professionals to participate in abortions, evidenced in such recent cases as a 2019 case in Vermont or Cathy Cenzon-DeCarlo v. The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York in 2013. Democrats have nearly uniformly opposed the Abortion Nondiscrimination Act, the Health Care Conscience Rights Act, and other similar proposals to protect the right of medical professionals not to participate in abortions. NARAL, which at this point is basically an extension of the Democratic Party, explicitly rejects conscientious objector laws regarding abortion.  As attorney and theologian Kenneth Craycraft explains in a recent First Things article, as a U.S. senator Harris introduced the “Do No Harm Act,” which aimed to coerce religious individuals and organizations to engage in activities that directly violate their firmly held religious beliefs. This would include health-care-related activities tied to abortion, which explains why it received strong support from pro-abortion groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood. 4. Democrats Oppose Pregnancy Center Alternatives Although crisis pregnancy centers have persuaded many prospective parents to avoid procuring an abortion, the Democratic Party has consistently attacked crisis pregnancy centers. In April 2019, Democrats criticized attempts to fund crisis pregnancy centers. “The shift of funding toward [crisis pregnancy centers] that will not offer patients direct access to a broad range of contraceptive care and counseling is alarming,” wrote Reps. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., and Diana DeGette, D-Colo. A 2015 blog post on Democrats.org claimed that crisis pregnancy centers “have zero understanding of what women’s health care is.” Craycraft notes that Harris in 2015 was an “enthusiastic advocate of California’s so-called Reproductive FACT Act,” which forced pregnancy centers to inform clients where they could obtain free abortions, as well as to advertise abortion clinics. She even claimed to have “co-sponsored” the FACT Act. 5. Democrats Support Late-Term Abortion Methods In a recent Federalist article, I noted that some leftists portray the dismembering and murdering of in-utero humans as “banal,” akin to getting an annual flu shot. Democrats have supported abortion in all of its ghastly forms. Senate Democrats (with the exceptions of Bob Casey, Doug Jones, and Joe Manchin) in February blocked a pair of Republican-sponsored bills that would have banned late-term abortions. Kathy Tran, a Democratic representative to the Virginia legislature, during a January 2019 discussion of her bill that sought to repeal certain state restrictions on abortion, said her bill would allow for an abortion to occur when a woman is in labor and about to give birth (she later said she “misspoke”). During a subsequent interview, Virginia’s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam said that in the case of a birth of a child with “severe deformities,” the infant would be “resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired.” Democratic support for late-term abortions includes Harris. Even fact-checker Snopes acknowledged that the vice-presidential candidate “has advocated for policies that allow for late-term abortions, primarily when the mother’s life is at risk.” Moreover, if Harris truly is the future of the Democratic Party, this will be a future marked by ever-more extreme pro-abortion policies. Harris has voted against legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and in support of late-term abortions. In 2019 and 2020, she voted to refuse protections for babies born alive after an abortion. She has recently promised to codify Roe v. Wade, which would keep it in place even if the Supreme Court overturns it. Pro-choice advocates like to drape abortion in libertarian language of freedom for individuals to control their bodies. Harris, for example, attempted a “gotcha” during Brett Kavanaugh’s judicial confirmation hearing by asking if he was aware of any laws that restricted male bodies. Of course, many laws restrict what both men and women can do with their bodies if it involves harming others. Americans cannot pump their body full of alcohol and get behind the wheel of a vehicle nor use their bodies to beat their fellow citizens into unconsciousness. This same principle should apply to abortion: Women have a unique ability to carry and feed human life within their bodies. When they decide to “terminate a pregnancy,” they decide in favor of irreversibly harming another person. The exact geographic location of that child, who has just as much a right to live as the mother, is irrelevant.

"175",175,"10 Years After The FBI Found Abortionist Kermit Gosnell’s House Of Horrors, It Could Still Happen Again","Bartkowiak","Dan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-01-19"," A grand jury report released ten years ago introduced the world to Kermit Gosnell, an abortionist from West Philadelphia who killed born-alive babies, employed teens with no medical experience as anesthesiologists, and crushed countless lives for more than 30 years. For years, government officials and others turned a blind eye to Gosnell’s “House of Horrors.” While some progress has been made in the last 10 years on reducing such atrocities, the conditions that allowed Gosnell to operate his house of horrors are still largely present. The discovery of his case has largely not led to desperately needed changes.  We Can’t Forget the Charismatic Sociopath On Jan. 19, 2011, members of a Pennsylvania court of common pleas grand jury released a scathing 261-page report on the grotesque details of an abortionist “who killed babies and endangered women.” This so-called doctor, Gosnell, was accused of a host of crimes, including the murder of born-alive babies. For more than three decades, Gosnell ran an abortion business called the Women’s Medical Society. He had built a reputation across the East Coast as a late-term abortionist. According to staff members, the number of abortion procedures Gosnell performed on women well past 24 weeks of gestation, Pennsylvania’s legal limit, is too many to count. Many of these “unwanted babies” were killed not by the abortion procedure, but by the backs of their necks being snipped with scissors after being born alive. Along with Gosnell, nine of his employees were arrested, including staffers who had no medical experience but were making diagnoses and assisting late-term abortion procedures. A 15-year-old with no training was administering anesthesia, which resulted in at least one woman’s death. Gosnell’s abortion practice — described as a “baby charnel house” — was only discovered by accident. The FBI raided Gosnell’s office based on tips he was illegally selling Oxycontin. Gosnell was a drug dealer by day and a late-term abortionist by night; he made $10,000-$15,000 a night on abortions. He became a millionaire from killing babies and fueling the opioid crisis.  Astonishingly, Gosnell considered himself innocent. He rejected a plea deal and elected to go to court. After five weeks of testimony, the jury found Gosnell guilty of three counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison without parole plus an additional 30 years. See No Evil So many people could have stopped Gosnell and his heinous acts but didn’t, including the Pennsylvania Department of Health, the Department of State, local hospitals, Planned Parenthood, and the National Abortion Federation. “Gosnell didn’t operate out of a back alley,” stated David Altrogge, a filmmaker who interviewed Gosnell for a documentary entitled “3801 Lancaster” (the address of Gosnell’s clinic). “His clinic was on a busy street in West Philadelphia, just a stone’s throw away from Drexel University. And the raid in 2010 wasn’t the first time that authorities had heard about Gosnell. According to the grand jury’s report, authorities looked the other way for more than 20 years.” State officials “sporadically inspected and approved” Gosnell’s clinic between 1978 and 1993. Under Gov. Tom Ridge’s administration, a new unwritten protocol was instituted that eliminated inspections, as they were perceived to create a barrier to obtaining an abortion. As a result, the next time state inspectors went to Gosnell’s clinic was more than 17 years later.  The grand jury report was released around the same time Tom Corbett was sworn in as Pennsylvania’s next governor. Corbett took action by firing six state employees immediately along with eight additional employees who needed a lengthier dismissal process. These included Secretary of the Department of State Basil Merenda, Deputy Secretary to the Department of Health Stacy Mitchell, and chief counsel for the Department of Health Christine Dutton. In defending the state’s decision not to investigate after women died at Gosnell’s clinic, Dutton said, “People die.” No further action was taken against state employees linked to Gosnell who had since retired, such as Department of Health inspector Janice Staloski, who approved Gosnell’s clinic after her 1992 inspection and declined to investigate Gosnell after Karnamaya Mongar died from a botched abortion in 2009. Staloski spent 35 years as a state employee, ending her career in March 2011. Gosnell was only charged with eight murders because of the lack of existing records, but self-reported more than 40,000 abortions through 2009. One Big Change The Gosnell grand jury, a group of people who covered “a spectrum of personal beliefs about the morality of abortion,” gave 15 recommendations, one of which became law after nearly a year-long debate in the Pennsylvania state legislature: Classifying abortion clinics as ambulatory surgical facilities. Page 249 of the grand jury report shares this recommendation: The regulations for Pennsylvania’s ambulatory surgical facilities — which run over 30 pages — provide a comprehensive set of rules and procedures to assure overall quality of care at such facilities. The effect of the Department of Health’s reluctance to treat abortion clinics as ASFs was to accord patients of those facilities far less protection than patients seeking, for example, liposuction or a colonoscopy. … Those clinics, unlike abortion facilities, must implement measures for infection control. They must use sterile linens. They must keep premises and equipment clean and free of vermin, insects, rodents, and litter. The regulations devote three pages to anesthesia protocols. … Gosnell’s facility fell far below the basic, minimum standards of care that any patient having a surgical procedure should expect to receive. There is no justification for denying abortion patients the protections available to every other patient of an ambulatory surgical facility, and no reason to exempt abortion clinics from meeting these standards. Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry fought this recommendation tooth and nail, decrying these standards as “dangerous” and “unnecessary.” Thankfully, the General Assembly saw past the abortion lobby, passed the upgraded regulations and the newly-elected Corbett signed the bill into state law. When other states began to take similar actions, lawsuits and court decisions began to halt progress. In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Texas state law that mandated abortion clinics follow ambulatory surgical facility standards. Planned Parenthood and the abortion lobby had screamed that it placed undue burdens on women. Sadly, the Supreme Court agreed: ‘This Supreme Court decision [striking down the Texas law] makes it clear our country hasn’t learned what happens when we make women’s access to abortion a higher priority than women’s safety,’ shared [film maker David] Altrogge. ‘It’s only a matter of time before our nation has another abortion clinic disaster like we had in Philadelphia.’ Experience has shown that the Pennsylvania regulations can work. Two abortion clinics were forced to close upon the law taking effect in 2012, both owned by infamous late-term abortionist Steven Brigham. In 2017, with no OB/GYN or registered nurse on staff, the Hillcrest Women’s Medical Center in Harrisburg failed its state inspection and had its license revoked. Truly, everyone in Pennsylvania should be glad these common-sense regulations are now in place. Ugly Realities The grand jury report summarized Gosnell’s case by pointing to the “disdain for the lives and health of mothers and infants.” Yet today, the same sort of disdain for human life is still happening in Pennsylvania — at one of the state’s top universities. In 2020, the University of Pittsburgh published research on humanized mouse models — a process that included grafting the scalps of aborted babies at 18-20 weeks in pregnancy onto the backs of rats. The first image in the study, funded by taxpayers through the National Institute of Health, shows multiple “human skin appendages.” The study also used other parts of aborted babies, including livers and spleens. Magee-Women’s Hospital, which performs between 500-700 abortions every year, the most for any hospital in Pennsylvania, supplies the aborted babies used by the University of Pittsburgh. While Gosnell took aborted babies for profit and kept parts of their bodies in jars, the University of Pittsburgh uses Planned Parenthood staff it employs to take aborted babies for science and graft parts of their bodies onto rats. If this isn’t disturbing enough, Pennsylvania is also witnessing an increase in women being harmed by abortion procedures. Beyond a woman’s emotional toll from having an abortion, data from 2019 shows triple the number of Pennsylvania’s women having complications from chemical (medical) abortions compared to 2017. That’s triple the number of women ending up in the hospital with parts of their aborted baby still inside them or excessive bleeding due to their chemical abortion. A primary risk with chemical abortions is a miscalculation of the gestational age of the baby. Pennsylvania lawmakers acted to limit this risk by recently voting to end the use of telemedicine for abortions. It was vetoed, however, by pro-abortion Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf. Sadly, it’s evidence of profits and party politics over women’s health and safety. Ten years later, most of the conditions that allowed for such a monster Gosnell have not changed. That’s largely thanks to Pennsylvania Democrats, who are presiding over an increase in botched abortions while claiming to be part of a party that cares about women and children.

"176",176,"7 Things I Learned At The Women’s Convention About Feminists And Abortion","Johnson","Abby",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-11-07"," I attended the Women’s Convention in Detroit. This conference was sponsored solely by progressive organizations, including premiere sponsor Planned Parenthood, my former employer. I chose to attend because wherever there are pro-choice voices, there ought to also be a pro-life voice. While I am a pro-life woman, I am also a woman who is concerned about rights for the disabled, maternity leave, the death penalty, health care, domestic violence, breastfeeding rights, etc. While I am a single-issue voter, I certainly don’t live a single-issue existence. Many causes affect my family and me, and I intend to be a voice for those as well. However, nothing should take more precedence than innocent death, and that’s exactly what abortion is: the death of innocent life.  Abortion was a big focus of the women’s convention, but so was racism, a lack of diversity, and an obsession with women’s genitalia. Here’s what I saw. 1. The Abortion Industry Is More Brazen Than Ever Even in the eight years since I have been away from the abortion industry, things have changed. When I worked for Planned Parenthood, our mantra was to keep abortion “Safe, Legal, and Rare.” That is not the case anymore. Now, it is all about access, no matter the consequence. No matter if women are harmed. No matter if clinics are dirty. Access. No matter what. We attended the “Planned Parenthood track” over the weekend, and learned a few things. First, Planned Parenthood is totally done using the word “choice.” They explained that by saying “choice,” we are assuming that one of the choices could be wrong. Huh? Anyway, now they are using the word “decision.” They feel that sounds much more positive and somehow helps to eliminate abortion stigma. They talked nonstop about eliminating abortion stigma. They want abortion to be normal. In one panel we attended, a post-abortive woman (times six) and clinic worker at the Houston Women’s Center named Kenya Martin stated that “Abortion should be no different than having a tooth pulled.” She even said women should throw “abortion parties” the day they have an abortion and rent “party buses” to celebrate their “decision.” Yes, she really said that.  The abortion industry is no longer hiding behind their “family planning” services. They are super proud of the abortions they commit. One woman in a panel, who worked for Planned Parenthood, even said Planned Parenthood should stop saying abortion is “only 3 percent of their services.” She said Planned Parenthood shouldn’t try to hide that the “majority of what they do in the clinics is to provide abortions.” Another thing I learned: these women are super honest about what the abortion industry is all about when they think no pro-lifers are around. 2. These Women Are Still Really Hung Up on Their Privates I’m sorry to repeat the crudities, but seriously, it’s getting ridiculous. One of the sessions was entitled, “Not all pussies are pink and not all women have pussies.” Women were walking around their handmade pink “p-ssy hats.” Rose McGowan said during her general session speech that her “p-ssy grabs back.” I don’t want to know what she has going on down there if that is a reality. These women have no idea what being a woman is all about. They have reduced themselves to a body part and nothing more. By the way, don’t forget that you can identify as a woman and have a penis. They reminded us of this over and over again, as with every speaker introduction they would announce the pronouns the speaker preferred. “Hi, my name is Mary, and my pronouns are she and her.” But wait, why the emphasis on the p-ssy hats if you don’t even have to have what they’re depicting to be a woman? The vulgarity all around this conference was enough to make even this former secular feminist blush. I wish they understood that being a woman encompasses who we are. We are mothers. We are nurturers. We are not vaginas. We are innately feminine. We are whole beings, not simply parts.  3. White Guilt Ran Rampant Basically, they want you to understand that if you are white woman, you are wrong—about everything. And you need to feel guilty about being white. You should feel very, very sorry about it. This racial division at the conference was very interesting to watch. The Women’s Convention had an app with a newsfeed that updated throughout the conference. Any conference attendee could post. I saw a few comments from women saying that they didn’t appreciate feeling like “being white was wrong.” I understood their point. After all, one of the sessions was called “Confronting White Womanhood.” Hardly any white women had a chance to speak at this conference, even though the overwhelming majority of attendees were white women. This conference talked about unity, but nothing was more divisive than the constant attacks on white people. Their conference attendees noticed. There was quite a bit of contention over this issue among the participants. It seemed that the Women’s Convention only wanted to focus on women of color, but collect ticket sales money from white women. Not to mention that one of their premiere sponsors, Planned Parenthood, is run by a—gasp—white woman. I guess elevating some white women to places of power is okay with them, as long as they encourage abortion. Did I mention the disproportionate amount of abortions in the black community? Well, let’s not talk about that. That may make them look racist or something. 4. Secular Feminists Are Terrified of Pro-life Feminists Presenters said multiple times, “There is no place for anti-choice beliefs in the feminist movement.” They are genuinely scared of pro-life feminists. They are scared of the momentum pro-life feminists have gained in the past few years. To dispel that fear, they pounded that line over and over again throughout the weekend. To them, being able to kill women in the womb is totally pro-woman. Being able to exploit women’s fears of not being strong enough to be a parent is empowering. But pro-choice feminists know nothing of women’s empowerment. “Oh, you are pregnant and in school? Well, there’s no way you are strong enough to finish your educational goals and be a mother. We will capitalize on your fear, make you feel weak, and give you an abortion.” Or maybe, “Oh, your boyfriend just left you and you are pregnant? Well, there’s no way you are strong enough to be a single mother. Let’s just get this abortion taken care of so we can keep convincing you just how weak you are.” Pro-life feminists refuse to choose. We can be mothers and have careers. We can finish our education with children in tow. Is it a challenge? Yep. But women are made for challenges. We are strong enough to handle the challenges presented to us. It’s what we were made to do. Pro-life feminists believe in women and their ability. Pro-choice feminists only see women as weak and something to be exploited. This conference only convinced me that pro-life feminists must hold onto our movement with every fiber of our being. We are winning women to our side because we capitalize on women’s strength—and that terrifies them. 5. The Least Diverse Conference I’ve Ever Attended One of the things I love the most about our annual Pro-life Women’s Conference is the diversity we have there every year. We don’t all believe the same things, but we all stand against the senseless taking of life in the womb. We have Democrats for Life in a booth next to Susan B. Anthony List. We have Family Research Council in a booth down from Pro-life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians. We have religious-profile groups working with secular pro-lifers. We are a movement of differences, diversity, and unity. This Women’s Convention was not. The only groups represented were there to push pro-abortion beliefs. No other beliefs on abortion were to be had. In fact, I had a pro-choice woman scream in my face and take my picture once she recognized who I was. I hadn’t tried to hide it. I registered under my name, with my work email address. I even wrote the organization I was involved with, And Then There Were None. Yes, they want to hear voices, but only voices that agree with their own. 6. They Want to Run Your State The political panels we heard made clear that the pro-choice movement has one political objective: They want pro-choice women to run in every gubernatorial race across the country. I think they have caught on to the reality that the power lies with the state. It’s time to pay attention, pro-lifers. They are coming for your state to push their anti-family, anti-life positions. It’s not because they care about your state. It’s not even because they care about politics. It’s because they want to insert their voices in all places, including our government. They want to overturn every pro-life law on the books. We must be vigilant in opposing their politics. We have worked far too hard to have unqualified activists overturning what we have done. 7. The Pro-Choice Movement Knows Nothing about Pregnancy Medical Centers I actually laughed out loud when I heard a woman on a Planned Parenthood panel state that “pregnancy centers receive millions of dollars from the federal government.” Really? I don’t know what pregnancy centers she is referring to. Certainly none I know or have ever worked with. Pregnancy centers operate almost solely on private donations. They may receive a few grants here and there, but “millions” of dollars in federal money? Oh, no, you are certainly confused. You must be thinking of Planned Parenthood. They are the ones who receive millions of dollars, more than half a billion, to be exact, from the federal government. The abortion lobby runs around calling these centers “fake clinics,” which is hysterical because many have more levels of accreditation than any Planned Parenthood center. In fact, many pregnancy centers go through rigorous state and national accreditation programs. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood goes through none of them. If you ask if their centers are accredited, they will tell you they are “self-accredited.” That means a group of people from their own Planned Parenthood affiliate comes into a couple of centers, looks around, and gives a stamp of “Planned Parenthood accreditation.” So, let me be clear: A group of Planned Parenthood employees enter a Planned Parenthood facility and give themselves a pat on a back and a faux accreditation. Nothing fishy about that at all. Meanwhile, these pregnancy medical clinics are out providing real, accredited medical care by medical professionals. But sure, they are fake clinics. If anything is a fake clinic, it is Planned Parenthood. They never have physicians even step on site unless they are there to perform abortions. In the eight years I worked at Planned Parenthood, our medical director never once graced us with his presence. Eight years with no direct medical supervision. Overall, I am glad I attended the Women’s Convention. We did have a lot of good conversations with women who would whisper to us, “I’m pro-life, too.” But being a pro-life woman at this convention was not welcome. They claim to care about the voices of all women, but that is far from true. They are only interested in creating an echo chamber—one that chants abortion slogans until they ring in your ear like a loud gong.

"177",177,"The 20-Week, Pain-Capable Abortion Bill Reveals Uncomfortable Truths About Both Parties","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-10-13"," Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a major bill to ban the gruesome practice of aborting a child at 20 weeks and beyond, followed by the Senate’s introduction of a similar bill two days later. Bearing a jarringly descriptive title, this marks the third go-round since 2013 for the “Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act” at the national level and could have the immediate effect of sparing the lives of 10,000 babies who are aborted at 20 weeks and beyond in the United States every year. But although the bill enjoys wide support among voters across demographic and party lines—the 20-week mark has already been adopted in 16 states— it’s also highly unlikely to ever reach the Senate floor for a vote. In fact, even though President Donald Trump has pledged to sign it into law if it reaches his desk, the bill may not even reach the Senate floor for debate.  That’s not cynicism talking, it’s the bill’s Republican sponsors, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (KY). In an article published Thursday, Politico summed up the conundrum for the GOP’s Senate leadership. In short, for the bill to stand a chance of landing on Trump’s desk, Senate Republicans would likely need to remove the filibuster rule and move ahead with a simple majority of votes, rather than holding out for the 60-vote threshold that’s currently in place. Fearful that Democrats could regain power in the Senate—as well as the House and Oval Office—and push through future legislation of their own, Republican leaders are urging pro-life constituents to wait for a more opportune time, with Graham assuring voters the bill’s “time will come.” Meanwhile, GOP leaders also seem unwilling to—at the very least—force Democrats to filibuster in defense of an absolutist position on abortion that squares better with North Korea and China than the land between New York City and Los Angeles. Inhumane Callousness on the Left Although the bill arrived all but dead to the Senate, abortion enthusiasts on the Left reacted with the sort of understated grace and winsomeness we’ve come to expect from those who see ending a child’s life through abortion as an intrinsic good. When Graham first introduced the Senate version on October 5, abortion lobbyist group NARAL Pro-Choice America sent out an email featuring the tragically ironic headline, “They’re DEAD SET on an abortion ban,” with text indicting GOP lawmakers for introducing the bill in the wake of Hurricane Maria and the murderous rampage in Las Vegas.  The timing of a bill that will rescue 10,000 preborn babies a year is unseemly, says NARAL, since people in Puerto Rico are doing without electricity while others are mourning the loss of loved ones murdered in Las Vegas. Saving lives will need to wait until a proper time, when no lives are in danger. Nor was this non sequitur relegated to the fundraising lists of NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and their ilk. When the bill passed the House on October 3, The New York Times gave a platform to pro-abortion dissenters on the Left—including New York Rep. Louise Slaughter—who said they voted against protecting pain-capable unborn children from abortion because “barring automatic weapons was a better way to save lives.” While it’s no surprise to find leftists in politics and the mainstream media linking gun deaths to abortion—two subjects on which they are the most adrift from the rest of the country—it is a bit shocking to see the Times call for “a better way to save lives” than capping abortion at 20 weeks. If the flaw with outlawing abortion at 20 weeks (with broad exceptions for the mother’s health and life as defined by Roe v. Wade’s companion case, Doe v. Bolton) is that it’s an imperfect way to save lives, doesn’t that concede that actual lives are at stake in abortion?  Yet even though they recognize—at least implicitly—that abortion ends the life of a child, all but three Democrats in the House were so beholden to their party’s platform calling for no limits on abortion that they voted against the pain-capable bill. Far more than any issue, abortion is the Left’s north star, which they will follow even if that means forcing Catholic nuns to foot the bill for abortifacients and cudgeling pro-life pregnancy centers into advertising the taxpayer-funded killing of unborn children. Excessive Caution on the Right What is far more disheartening than the abortion-enslaved Democrats’ incessant caterwauling, however, is the inability of GOP leaders—including but not limited to McConnell and Graham—to commit themselves to legislation that will directly save lives from abortion. Cowed to the threat of a Democratic filibuster, these GOP leaders, although well-intentioned, urge their constituents to continue waiting until a more opportune time to protect fully developed children in the womb. Rather than forcing Democrats to explain why they are willing to shut down the government to abort babies even at a time they can and do survive outside the womb, Republicans are giving their colleagues a free pass under the simple threat of a filibuster. Remember Wendy Davis, the Texas state senator who made a name for herself in 2013 by donning pink shoes and filibustering a Texas bill that introduced gurney-width hallways and hospital admitting requirements to abortion clinics? Not only did the bill pass over her incessant shrieking, she was demolished in a bid for the Texas governorship the following year. While the U.S. Supreme Court eventually struck down Texas’ 2013 legislation in its 2016 Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt decision, Davis was forever exposed as a pro-abortion extremist meme with very little to offer beyond a lifetime supply of praise from—and of—the nation’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood. Make no mistake, the GOP has plenty of tools at its disposal short of nuking the filibuster entirely, including a bevy of available rule changes to the filibuster itself. Unlike many choices in politics, this one’s not “binary.” The main question is whether Republicans on Capitol Hill are ready to show the courage to match their convictions, absorb the slander that’s sure to come pouring from the media, and insist that no government action can or should be undertaken while—at the very least—viable babies are being legally aborted in this nation. ‘The Time Is Always Ripe to Do Right’ In his “Letter from the Birmingham Jail,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. rebuked white Christian leaders who voiced ideological agreement with his civil rights campaign yet refused to join him in peaceful action, instead openly denouncing his nonviolent protests throughout the South. The inaction of these men, whom King considered his brothers, was a far more difficult pill to swallow than the outright racism and bigotry he suffered daily. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice… Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection. As he appealed to his white brothers in the faith, King pushed against what he saw as their misguided belief that waiting for a more suitable time was the luxury of the non-oppressed. “The time is always ripe to do right,” King wrote. There’s very little question that pro-life leaders in the Senate like McConnell and Graham share the same aims as the voters who put them into office. They, like those they stand alongside at national demonstrations like the annual March for Life in Washington DC, want to see as many lives as possible spared from abortion. I’ve seen this desire firsthand each time I’ve visited congressional offices with mothers who chose life for their babies because of hands-on help from pro-life pregnancy centers, medical clinics, and maternity homes. I’ve witnessed the distinct joy and gratitude these leaders and their staff exude when they hold a child who was snatched from the jaws of the billion-dollar abortion industry. For these children, there was no time to wait. Now was the time to do what was right. Now is the time to intervene to save a life, to start healing wounds from a past abortion, to spread a passion for every child from the moment of conception. Now is the time to come alongside a mother captured by the pernicious lie that she must choose between her child and her own success. Now that the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is on the table for the Senate, will they do right while the time is ripe?

"178",178,"‘Holiday Candles’ Can’t Change The Fact That Abortion Isn’t ‘Magical’","Bateman","Ashley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-12-16"," In Texas, the abortion agenda is losing ground. Although the Supreme Court overturned state abortion limits in 2016, a cut in state funding for Planned Parenthood has resulted in widespread panic amongst abortion supporters as the number of abortion facilities in the state drops each year.
This holiday season, the Texas Equal Access Fund, an organization that helps pay for abortions in the northern part of the state, has moved far outside of the realm of reasonable marketing, advertising “Abortion is Magical” holiday party favors.

The holidays certainly are magical, but not for those suffering the mental, emotional, and physical effects of an abortion. According to a study published late last year by the National Institutes of Health, data can be interpreted by both sides of the aisle for skewed perspectives, but ultimately and undeniably “abortion is consistently associated with elevated rates of mental illness,” “the abortion experience directly contributes to mental health problems for at least some women,” and “research in the field cannot adequately measure the extent of impact of abortion on women’s mental illness.”
So yes, the impact exists, and it could be far more in-depth than we can quantify. Abortion-specific post-traumatic stress disorder rising rates of depression have been found in post-abortive women after two years later. Because of these findings, psychiatrist Nada L Stotland, former president of the American Psychiatric Association, well-known for her criticism of the existence of abortion’s negative impacts on mothers, turned to recommended screening women who are considering abortion for potential counseling needs.
Keep in mind a majority of this data was collected on women who fell in the parameters of first- and second-trimester abortions, which occur before the age of viability, when a baby can survive with the assistance of medical technology outside the womb. In recent years though, states have pushed the limits for abortion restrictions. Abortion is now legal in all 50 states and in some extreme cases, allowable until birth.
As of December 1, 25 states allow abortion until the unborn infant’s age of viability, 24 weeks, although technological advancements are proving babies even younger than that age can survive with medical assistance, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The effects of late-term abortion on mothers are likely to be even stronger long-term.
Virginia’s new law is the most heinous of the new late-term abortion laws. In that state, no ban exists until the 25-week mark and recently elected lawmakers have promised to extend that number up until birth in the coming General Assembly this January, while introducing laws to remove basic educational and safety measures from abortion procedures in the state, mimicking New York’s Reproductive Health Act passed last year.
Yet in truth, the physical ramifications of abortion are serious and can be life-threatening to the mother. Complications of abortions include: heavy bleeding, infection, damage to the cervix, scarring of the uterine lining, damage to internal organs, and death—as “magical” for women as all that sounds.
The March for Life organization responded to TEA in typical class-act fashion: “We’d like to extend an invitation to Texas Equal Access to the 2020 March for Life where they will hear about the beauty of life and how being pro-life is pro-woman, as well as hear the testimonies of women and men who regret having been involved in abortion,” the group wrote on Twitter.
Women who seek an abortion commonly seek information and education regarding risks. TEA’s thoughtless post highlights the abortion movement’s disrespect of and disregard for those women who are suffering on the other side of their abortions.

"179",179,"As Roe Hangs In The Balance, An Ugly Class Blindspot Distorts Abortion Discourse","Jashinsky","Emily",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-05-04"," The political establishment’s class blindspot is on full display in conversations about abortion, and the discourse on Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked draft opinion in the Dobbs case is no exception to this rule. Support for abortion increases with income and education levels. Pollsters use many questions to gauge public opinion on abortion—from support for Roe to support by trimester to general morality—but wealthier Americans tend to be more supportive across the board. 



The left is correct that wealthy women in a post-Roe world will be able to get abortions with greater ease than women in lower income brackets: they can afford travel, childcare, and time away from work more easily. But as a demographic, they’re also more supportive of abortion, so the argument that overturning Roe is an attack on the working class is not sound.



It’s true, as The New York Times wrote in 2019, that “[w]omen getting abortions today are far more likely to be poor than those who had the procedure done 20 years ago.” The Times also notes, “About half of women who had an abortion in 2014 were below the poverty line, with another quarter very close to poverty.”



But Gallup data from 2021 found that respondents asked whether abortion was “morally wrong,” “morally acceptable,” or “depend[ent] on the situation” were more supportive as yearly household income increased. This tracks with education level as well, as you can see in the screenshot below. 



Above the $100,000 income threshold, 63 percent of people said abortion was morally acceptable and 32 percent said morally wrong. Below the $40,000 threshold, those numbers were almost reversed. Only 38 percent of respondents said it was morally acceptable while 55 percent said it was morally wrong. This pattern is consistent among Gallup’s recent research on the question.




Support for abortion increases with education and income. It's true wealthy women in a post-Roe world will have more access to abortion than poorer women, but it's also true the poorest Americans are much more likely to believe abortion is morally wrong.Gallup data from 2021. pic.twitter.com/ZBx1EeQ5eh— Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky) May 3, 2022
On Roe in particular, data like this 2020 survey from The New York Times show a similar pattern on education level. While respondents of every education level support Roe in much higher numbers than they oppose it, support decreased alongside educational attainment while opposition increased.

The abortion rate has declined since the Supreme Court decided Roe in 1973. Some observers attribute this to heightened advancements in and availabilities of contraception, red-state laws intended to prevent abortion, and the decline in premarital sex among teenagers. Evidence suggests the share of low-income women obtaining abortions is rising as this rate declines. 



“It’s people who don’t have access to health care, access to contraception, who, when facing an unintended pregnancy, don’t have the resources to have another child,” a researcher at the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute told the New York Times. 



Since Roe, abortion access has fueled the decline in social capital among working-class Americans. Janet Yellen, of all people, co-authored a paper for Brookings back in 1996 that made this point about the connection between abortion and out-of-wedlock births: 



In the late 1960s and very early 1970s (well before Roe v. Wade in January 1973) many major states, including New York and California, liberalized their abortion laws. At about the same time it became easier for unmarried people to get contraceptives. In July 1970 the Massachusetts law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people was declared unconstitutional. We have found that this sudden increase in the availability of both abortion and contraception we call it a reproductive technology shock–is deeply implicated in the increase in out-of-wedlock births. Although many observers expected liberalized abortion and contraception to lead to fewer out-of-wedlock births, the opposite happened–because of the erosion in the custom of shotgun marriages.



When America normalized abortion, the theory goes, it normalized different child-rearing arrangements as well. The Yellen paper continued:



Women who were willing to get an abortion or who reliably used contraception no longer found it necessary to condition sexual relations on a promise of marriage in the event of pregnancy. But women who wanted children, who objected to abortion for moral or religious reasons, or who were unreliable in their use of contraception found themselves pressured to participate in premarital sexual relations without being able to exact a promise of marriage in case of pregnancy. These women feared, correctly, that if they refused sexual relations, they risked losing their partners. Sexual activity without commitment was increasingly expected in premarital relationships.



Couples engaging in premarital sex when abortion is readily available are more cavalier about its ability to generate life. If more women are having more premarital sex, more babies will be created out of wedlock. Some of them will be killed in the womb. Some of them will be born to single mothers, and single motherhood will increase. This is a tangled web of variables, to be sure, but the broader point is that normalized abortion upended sexual dynamics in America— and in ways that rippled across society with unexpected effects, especially for less affluent Americans. 



Recall what Betty Friedan herself wondered on the 20th anniversary of “The Feminine Mystique” in a rambling New York Times essay on the class dynamics at stake. “Will the married be the new elite and those living alone the underclass?” she wrote, after noting the recent “100 percent increase in single-parent households, nine out of 10 of which are headed by women.”



“I’m worried now about the new polarizations hinted at by recent polls, cutting across the gender gap, as sharp differences emerge between the married and the unmarried, those with children and with none, the young and the old, the ones with jobs and the unemployed,” Friedan wrote.



When the political class carries on as though support for Roe translates into broad public support for abortion, their class blindspot is showing. The same is true when they characterize the pro-life position—that abortion is immoral—as extremism. That’s simply not the case and Americans outside elite bubbles know it. As they continue forcing their norms on the public, working-class women and children are disproportionately suffering the trauma of abortion.

"181",181,"Abortion Comedy Is A Complete Flop Because It’s Not At All Funny","Lewis","Brenna",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-10-08"," Norm Macdonald, the legendary stand-up comedian who recently passed away, made an astute observation about comedy in a 2009 interview: “There’s a difference between a clap and a laugh. A laugh is involuntary, but the crowd is in complete control when they’re clapping. They’re saying, ‘We agree with what you’re saying; proceed!’” Others have referred to this as “clapter,” referring to the same disingenuous response to an unfunny woke joke. A number of outspoken pro-abortion comedians would do well to learn the difference between laughter and clapter. Instead, the nation’s staunchest advocates, promoters, and sellers of abortion are doubling down on their attempt to make abortion funny.  Several pro-abortion groups, most notably NARAL Pro-Choice America and Abortion Access Front, have recently embarked on campaigns to make “abortion comedy.” In a recent article for McClatchy DC, the abortion group admitted that pro-abortion digital efforts are losing to pro-life ones in educating and winning people over. They even confessed that people were using “pro-life language” in their own focus groups. To combat the effectiveness of pro-life media, NARAL decided to enlist comedians as the voices of pro-abortion advertising in places like podcasts and YouTube videos. The pro-life crowd wasn’t the only one to deem this silly; NARAL shared with McClatchy that 11 of their state affiliates are considering breaking with the national organization over this plan. Abortion Access Front, a ragtag activism group formed by a co-creator of “The Daily Show,” plans to host in-person comedy shows and other types of entertainment events about abortion, but it seems they need to do more research on their audience. According to Gallup, 49 percent of Americans identify as pro-life, 47 percent identify as pro-choice, and the rest don’t know how they feel about the issue. Vox found in 2015 that 39 percent of respondents in interviews on the issue refused to pick a side. In fact, many abortion-leaning people choose the middle, believing that abortion should always be a hard decision.  But NARAL and Abortion Access Front don’t need to check the work of pollsters to determine that abortion comedy is a bad idea; it’s clear by their ratings that all their woke jokes, not just the abortion ones, flop a lot more often than they fly. Take Samantha Bee, one of late night’s unfunniest leading ladies. In response to South Dakota’s recent chemical abortion restriction, Bee monologued her distaste and included such sentiments as, “It’s weird that he’s pro-life because with a face like that, I would want to be dead,” and, “You can’t be pro-birth if you look like you broke out of a cloning pod before you finished” (both referring to Mark Miller, general counsel for South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem). But the ratings clap back just as hard. On a standard cable night this summer, “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee” brought in half the number of viewers as a show called “Dr. Pimple Popper.” Bee’s Hollywood abortion pal and “Hunger Games” star Elizabeth Banks was christened by the Center for Reproductive Rights in 2019 to head their new Creative Council – a $2 million enterprise to cram abortion into entertainment wherever it will fit. Her 2020 film “Mrs. America” drug the late pro-life activist Phyllis Schlafly through the mud (and earned Banks a 68 percent audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes). Busy Philipps, who frequents pro-abortion rallies and legislative activities, also had her talk show “Busy Tonight” canceled by E! after less than a year.  The pro-life crowd is doing something different altogether: talking to people, face to face, and asking them honest questions, something Vice News recently reported as “deeply sophisticated.” Last October, the pro-life group Students for Life of America had 17,180 online conversations and a conversion (mind changed) rate of 19 percent through Digital Conversion Quizzes geared towards changing public perception of Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The following month, there were 99,440 minds changed and an average conversion rate of 19.6 percent during the entire digital campaign leading up to the November election. Note the key difference between methods; where NARAL and Hollywood elites try to bully through the wealthy and famous, it’s the little pro-lifers who have no such notoriety who are winning with grassroots activism and a message of genuine love and service. Abortion is a tragedy, not a comedy, and almost everyone outside of Hollywood knows that fact. Abortion simply is not, and never will be, funny.

"182",182,"Watching ‘Gosnell’ Shattered My Agnosticism On Abortion","Mill","Adam",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-10-31"," If you haven’t seen the movie “Gosnell,” it is required viewing for Americans like me who avoided the abortion issue because I lacked the moral courage to really think about it and form my own opinion. The movie works very hard to avoid smothering an important philosophical question with scenes of gore. In fact, it depicts real and nuanced questions that go well beyond our abortion debate that seems stuck in impasse. “Gosnell” is not about an abortion doctor committing “murder” by aborting fetuses––the movie is about a doctor killing delivered babies who breathe, move, and sometimes even cry before abortionist Kermit Gosnell used a pair of scissors to “snip” their spinal cord. Be outraged and shocked by that. But hold your outrage long enough to confront how Gosnell defends his actions, because that’s the real crux of the issue.  The Horrifying Truth of the Gosnell Case Gosnell had assistants prepare his patients by inducing labor. Sometimes he would arrive too late to complete the abortion before the fetus became a living, breathing, crying baby. The government charged him with murder because he nevertheless “completed” his procedures on such babies. Gosnell’s defense at trial was to point to the arbitrary legal line between what he did and what the law sanctioned. His attorney argued that even if he had followed proper procedures in a sterile clinic using the most advanced medical equipment to terminate pregnancies, the fundamental moral character of what he was doing wouldn’t change. Although Gosnell’s technique sometimes resulted in birthing the child before terminating it, he argued that, from a medical point of view, it’s sometimes more dangerous to the woman to do the procedure while the child is still inside the woman. So, to Gosnell’s way of thinking, birthing the baby sometimes improves abortion’s health outcome for the mother. You might now be tempted to stop reading this as you retreat into a pre-formed position on abortion. Don’t. This is the moral no-man’s land that hasn’t been rationally discussed since the political screaming started in the early 1970s, during the oral arguments for Roe v. Wade. At the end of Gosnell’s procedure, he considers it a success if the woman is no longer pregnant and there is no baby. Is it really murder outside the womb, but legal when a doctor completes the procedure inside?  Tell yourself what you need to hear, Gosnell might say. He assumes correctly that most of us lack the moral courage to hold him accountable. Inside the womb, the procedure is legal so long as the fetus has not advanced to an arbitrary stage of development. So who decides if a fetus is too advanced to abort? “I do,” Gosnell responded. Is that the right answer? Should an individual doctor be drawing the critical line between legal abortion and murder? Is this moral question better settled in the Supreme Court? Surely it’s not up to non-doctors and non-judges to intervene on the question of if and when the termination of a pregnancy crosses the line from helping a woman with an unwanted pregnancy into murder. After seeing Gosnell sneer at the line, I see the urgency of public participation in the question. If it is left up to the advocates for unfettered abortion rights, would there be any line at all? Recently, we’ve heard people speaking out against political violence with assurance that the ballot box is the proper place to resolve our great conflicts in the United States. Yet the Roe v. Wade decision seems to have permanently excluded abortion from the normal political process in which moral judgments can be debated, tested, and evolved according to the state of medical science and public morality. This is, in part, why the Kavanaugh confirmation process was so ugly.  Impulses to influence the debate manifest in such detestable ways in the absence of a democratic process. Are we satisfied with the outcome when judges establish an immutable moral distinction between abortion and murder? If you answered “Yes,” I ask that you watch the movie to listen to how Gosnell drew that line. What Counts as Murder In Our Legal System? Civilization has wrestled with the question of defining murder since the beginning. Is physician-assisted suicide murder? Is it murder to withhold care at a nursing home? When can murder be excused based on insanity or mental incompetence, as we have termed it? What about self-defense? What about failing to warn or assist another who is in danger? The nuances of the exceptions and exclusions to murder laws are resolved in the legislatures of our 50 states by elected representatives after taking input from scientists, doctors, clergy, and stakeholders within the community. Unfortunately, “Gosnell” shattered my sheltered agnosticism over abortion. When the sounds of crying baby can be heard in an abortion clinic, I am forced to admit that abortion stalks the edges of the definition of murder. Where will the line between abortion and murder be drawn if we leave it to bumper stickers and profit-seeking doctors like Gosnell to draw that line? We employ representative democracy to pass the laws that define what is murder, and we have an urgent responsibility to participate in the same process to define what is not. As noted by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in her dissent in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., the original rationale for Roe v. Wade rested upon the state of medical science at the time of the decision. Modern science, she opined, has made the trimester or “three-stage” approach the court adopted in Roe a “completely unworkable method of accommodating the conflicting personal rights and compelling state interests that are involved in the abortion context.” O’Connor further noted that improvements in the safety of later-term abortions, combined with advancements in the care of premature babies, have “blurred” the bright moral line originally set forth in Roe. The moral question of abortion, she wrote, requires that the state “continuously and conscientiously study contemporary medical and scientific literature in order” to maintain the balance between the woman’s interests in choice and the state’s interest in protecting life. The court, she reasoned, was not the right place to be constantly re-calibrating this balance when it lacks “the resources available to those bodies entrusted with making legislative choices,” nor is the Supreme Court, “competent to make these inquiries and to revise these standards every time the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) or similar group revises its views about what is and what is not appropriate medical procedure in this area.” O’Connor further noted, “Medical technology is changing, and this change will necessitate [the Supreme Court’s] continued functioning as the Nation’s ex officio medical board, with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.” The Abortion Debate Has Been Unable To Evolve The biggest problem with the abortion debate is that it stopped being a debate a long time ago. If abortion is to be legal in any form, Americans must know that the line separating abortion from murder is in the right place and is being vigorously policed. As O’Connor pointed out, a 46-year-old decision by now-dead justices is the wrong way to draw a line that should have evolved with the state of science and public morality. So again, who decides if a fetus is too advanced to abort? A nurse in Gosnell’s clinic reported feeling a newborn tug on her finger before the doctor “completed” the procedure. We can and should agree that abortionists should not be making that distinction, and that there has to be a line. No matter how zealous an advocate for reproductive rights you might be, you have to agree on a line. The line needs to be established according to the best science and moral judgments as expressed by the great engine of compromise of our democracy. It’s time to set aside Roe and return the question to the moral accountability of the democratic process. Abortion rights advocates should refrain from refusing to acknowledge or accommodate any discussion or update to this line, because Gosnell proved one thing beyond refutation: at some point it’s not abortion, it’s murder.

Here’s How To Be Ready","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-11-07"," Abortion up until birth, the erosion of parental rights, and a whole host of other horrors are enshrined in the Ohio Constitution after a majority of voters agreed to pass Issue 1 on Tuesday.



Thanks to the activists who poured millions of dollars into deceiving voters about what “every individual has a right” to ending life in the womb and other “reproductive decisions” really means, Issue 1 will fundamentally and permanently change the way Ohio operates.



Ohio is a red state with a Republican legislature, governor, and attorney general that would never agree to sign off on unlimited abortion for all. The passage of the state’s latest sweeping constitutional amendment was only possible because outside groups like the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and other leftist organizations used the state’s ballot measure process to circumvent those elected officials.



If Ohio, one of the reddest states on paper, can succumb to the scheming of abortion activists, then no Republican state is safe. Here’s how pro-lifers everywhere should protect their states from the people who want to turn their hometowns into the abortion industry’s next boomtowns. 



Tell the Truth Starting Now



It’s important that voters in every state, not just those threatened by imminent abortion amendments, understand that Democrats want to legalize killing unborn babies throughout all nine months of gestation.



A majority of U.S. adults reject that position. Yet, many Americans do not equate Democrats’ euphemistic calls for “reproductive rights” free-for-alls with late-term abortions because pollsters and abortion advocates twist the language. 



Ohio’s example proves this. In the weeks leading up to the Issue 1 vote, a majority of Ohioans claimed to view unlimited abortion through birth as unfavorable. Their votes to amend the state constitution to allow for unlimited abortion suggest they did not understand the issue at hand. 



Everyone, not just pro-lifers, should be acquainted with the fact that Americans don’t care for abortion beyond the first trimester long before a ballot proposal forces them to.



Fortify the Constitutional Amendment Process Early



Republican-controlled states should consider reevaluating the merits of their constitutional amendment process long before they think they will become targets. Once national donors, Democrats, and corporate media get wind of the attempt to secure the ballot measure portion of their elections, it’s hard to stop the left’s deception and lies from tainting any attempts at reform. 



Republicans in Ohio tried to tighten up their ballot proposal standards by asking voters to raise the simple majority threshold to a 60 percent supermajority a few months before the Nov. 7 vote but it was too late. By the time the state’s special election rolled around in August, abortion activists had successfully taken control of the narrative.  



Local Ohio papers, corporate media outlets, and the groups touting the pro-abortion and gender ideology proposal smeared the GOP government for committing to “elevating the standards.” Planned Parenthood activist Lauren Blauvelt, who is also chair of an Ohio pro-abortion group, went so far as to accuse lawmakers of “working overtime to dismantle democracy as we know it.”  



The issue that proposed raising the vote threshold for amendment passage was defeated 57 percent to 43 percent.  



Fight for Clear Language



If an unlimited abortion constitutional amendment does make it onto a red state’s ballot, pro-lifers everywhere should insist on clear language.



Ohio’s deliberately vague proposal, as The New York Times admitted (albeit way too late into the election cycle), left even the most staunch of abortion activists scratching their heads. It also opened the door for all sorts of legal abuses.



Issue 1’s undefined terms such as “individual” and “reproductive decisions” will inevitably be exploited to justify a multitude of harmful decisions for men, women, and children alike. Similarly, the section that supposedly lets the legislature restrict abortion after “fetal viability” allows the subjective judgment of a doctor to override those restrictions, so long as he deems the abortion necessary for a woman’s “health,” a term that isn’t limited to physical health and could be interpreted by a pro-abortion doctor as vague emotional well-being.



Fighting for less “confusing” language, even if it means facing a court challenge. is worth it. Even if the appeal fails, it gives pro-life groups more fodder to call out abortion activists’ deception. 



Watch for Weed 



Single-issue voters don’t usually care to show up on odd election years but marijuana historically brings people to the polls in masses. Republicans who want to protect their states should be wary of any push, especially from the left, to use the “cannabis coattails” to goad voters into making a rash decision about enshrining abortion up until birth in the state constitution. 



Leftists who wanted Issue 1 in Ohio to get extra attention even in an off-year were more than happy to welcome a ballot measure about weed as Issue 2 because it brought more publicity, money, and young voters to the voting booth. Their efforts were rewarded with high turnout.



Support a Federal 15-Week Abortion Limit



A national ban on abortions beyond 15 weeks, when unborn babies already have heartbeats and pain receptors, would save Republicans in blue or purple states the uphill battle over pro-life legislation. It would also act as a deterrent against abortion activists who try to abuse state systems to advance abortion for all. 



The likelihood that the currently Democrat-controlled Senate or even the Republican-controlled House would throw their weight behind a 15-week limit is slim but that shouldn’t stop pro-lifers from championing the popularity and effectiveness of such restrictions.

"185",185,"Stop Calling My Miscarriage An Abortion","Muster","Klara",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-03-29"," I didn’t want to talk about the pain of losing my baby, but after seeing how corporate media recently portrayed “19 Kids and Counting” star Jessa Duggar Seewald’s miscarriage as an abortion, I feel I must.



Jessa shared that over Christmas, she and her husband, Ben, had suffered a miscarriage. Her body hadn’t realized the baby’s heart had stopped, so a couple of weeks after, Jessa had a common procedure that is also used for elective abortion and is called dilation and curettage (D&C). Her baby had already died by no choice of her own.



I lost my baby to miscarriage four months ago and, like Jessa, needed a D&C to safeguard my health. Corporate and social media, as well as people I’ve talked with, insist I had an abortion, which makes me feel livid and broken-hearted. 



I’ve had enough of misinformation on abortion and miscarriages since the overturn of Roe v. Wade. The purposeful lies about the realities of abortion by the press and pro-abortion advocates are truly astounding.



A Simple Definition



I have been utterly appalled at this narrative that Jessa had an abortion. The medical definition of abortion is the expulsion of pregnancy tissue, and this can happen spontaneously or deliberately. The colloquial definition, however, is different. The first result on Google states that abortion is “The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy,” which is exactly what almost everyone means when they declare they’ve had an abortion.



Yet now the media are twisting it to cover a miscarriage, which is incredibly insulting to those of us who have actually had a miscarriage, not an abortion where we chose to end the life of our baby.



Abortion is such an ugly and disgusting word and incites trauma for so many. Abortion is trauma to the body, to the psyche, and to everyone it touches. Abortion is synonymous with pain.



I adamantly oppose abortion and the violence that is perpetrated against women and their children. I also adamantly oppose women dying without life-saving medical care.



Our Miscarriage



Last fall, my husband and I found out we were expecting after more than nine months of trying. Our child was loved, prayed for, and longed for. The moment we saw our baby on the screen at six-and-a-half weeks was one of the happiest of our lives. We saw our sweet baby’s heartbeat, calculated our due date, and planned how we’d tell our families: Thanksgiving celebrations were coming up and we couldn’t wait to share with them. 



We went back to my OB-GYN in early December for our 10-week appointment and instead of seeing more photos, we were met with confirmation of any parent’s worst fears: Our baby was no longer with us. My husband, doctor, and I frantically searched the screen for any semblance of life from our child. There was none. I went to the hospital for an additional ultrasound to confirm our nightmare, praying and sobbing through it all. The doctor confirmed our baby wasn’t coming home in July.



Eight days later, just under three weeks from the last day our child was alive, I had a D&C procedure, as my body still hadn’t processed the heartbreak we had been hit with. The procedure is vital to the health of many women following a miscarriage. 



I would not wish this procedure on anyone. I bled for 15 days post-op, and I could barely leave my bed due to grief and physical pain. My medical bills totaled more than $18,000. If my D&C had been viewed as an abortion, my local abortion facility would have charged me only $800.



I was supported by family and friends who showed an immense outpouring of love and support through the loss of our child, Jordan Blake. We were prayed over, had meals delivered and help with our laundry, and were allowed the space and grace to mourn our child.



Ugly Comparisons



But others weren’t so gracious. When sharing the loss of Jordan, I was met with comparisons to elective abortions in-person and online. The insinuation that our child was no more than mere medical waste left resentment and wounds. D&Cs of a dead child are in no way the same as the violent realities of abortion that purposefully end the life of a child on the altar of convenience and “choice.” 



Even though we had love and support, that is not the reality for everyone. If anyone reading this has experienced the loss of a child and needed a D&C, yet it was compared to an abortion, I am so incredibly sorry. Your child is loved. I celebrate with you the life of your child and join you in the grief of your loss.



Our miscarriages were not abortions, and the love of our children is not lost. Our children are forever part of our lives and families. I didn’t have an abortion. Jessa didn’t have an abortion. We had miscarriages — and to call them anything other than that is the weaponization of the semantics of abortion for political purposes. It is frankly disgusting.

"187",187,"Democrats Are Lying About Amy Coney Barrett’s Abortion Record","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-09-29"," Even before President Trump officially named Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, the left began assailing the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals judge and Notre Dame Law School professor. The vilest attacks involved the mother-of-seven’s two adopted children. Those attempting to scuttle Barrett’s confirmation by questioning the circumstances of those adoptions will soon be silenced, however, by more savvy leftists who recognize the risk of backlash is too great. Instead, the more mainstream Democrats will present their objections to Barrett’s appointment as tethered to her judicial rulings, especially in the area of abortion.  Here, the left also just can’t seem to stick to the facts: Rather than level with Americans that they fear the conservative Barrett will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and thereby return abortion policy to the states, opponents of the Seventh Circuit judge are lying about her judicial record. Twitter pundits and personalities began peddling these falsehoods on Friday, claiming Barrett “has ruled twice in favor of upholding restrictions to abortion access.”   Within minutes of President Donald Trump’s Rose Garden introduction of Barrett on Saturday, an email blitz from the National Abortion Federation, the self-anointed “professional association of abortion providers,” proclaimed Barret a threat to “our basic rights and freedoms, including abortion access.” The press release by the association’s president and CEO, “The Very Reverend Katherine Ragsdale,” then pushed hard on this theme, claiming Barrett has “vot[ed] twice in her three short years as a federal appellate judge, in favor of abortion restrictions, both times in dissent.” This claim is blatantly false.  Coney Barrett has never voted “in favor of abortion restrictions.” As we shall soon see, had Barrett voted to uphold the abortion restrictions at issue, there would be strong public support for the decisions. Even the phraseology is wrong: A judge doesn’t vote “in favor of abortion restriction.” State and federal legislators do. What a judge does (or should do) is assess the constitutionality of the statute. Even then, Barrett has never sat on a case challenging the constitutionality of an abortion restriction. Rather, what she has done is vote for “en banc” review of two panel decisions rendered by other judges on the Seventh Circuit. What Were the Cases? In one case, Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, a three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit declared two provisions of the Indiana code regulating abortions unconstitutional and then upheld a lower court’s injunction barring enforcement of the provisions. One provision at issue in the case banned abortions procured solely on the basis of the unborn baby’s sex, race, ethnicity, or disabilities, while the other portion of the challenged law required aborted remains to be disposed of by burial or cremation. While Barrett dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, voting for the full court to rehear a case is not a vote on the underlying merits. As for her vote being in the “dissent,” that merely meant a majority of the judges decided not to rehear the case.  Given that the Supreme Court later reversed the Seventh Circuit’s panel decision and upheld the fetal disposal portion of the law, however, Barrett’s view that the full court should reconsider the issue seems solid. (The Supreme Court declined to review the merits of Indiana’s ban on sex, race, ethnicity, or disability-based abortions, as no other court of appeals had yet to address that question, and the high court typically waits for a split in the circuits to consider a question.) The second case, also captioned Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky v. Box, (Box being Kristina Box, the commissioner of the Indiana State Department of Health), likewise involved a challenge to an Indiana law regulating abortions. The law at issue in this second case required parental notification of a minor’s intent to undergo an abortion, absent a judicial decision that it was in the child’s “best interest” for her parents not to be notified. Again, a panel of the Seventh Circuit declared the law unconstitutional and entered an injunction barring its enforcement. Judge Michael Kanne dissented from the panel decision, and a vote to go en banc was called but failed, leaving the panel decision intact. Kanne dissented from the denial to rehear the case en banc, and Barrett, along with three other colleagues, joined that dissent. The dissent, however, addressed solely the decision to rehear the case and not the merits of the abortion legislation. In fact, the dissent made clear the issue of concern was not the abortion regulation, but procedure and federalism. “This case implicates an important and recurring issue of federalism,” Kanne wrote. “Under what circumstances, and with what evidence, may a state be prevented from enforcing its laws before it goes into effect? … Given the existing unsettled status of pre-enforcement challenges in the abortion context,” the longtime federal judge wrote, “I believe this issue should be decided by our full court. Preventing a state statute from taking effect is a judicial act of extraordinary gravity in our federal structure.” While the full Seventh Circuit did not rehear the case, the Supreme Court later vacated the panel decision, sending it back for the judges to decide the issue anew following the high court’s guidance in June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo concerning the undue burden analysis. Amy Coney Barrett Is No Extremist Not only is the abortion lobby’s claim that Barrett voted to strike down abortion restrictions in two cases false, but the Supreme Court’s subsequent rulings also vindicate her view that the issues warranted further consideration by the full court. Another equally important pushback is needed: The attacks on Barrett fail to identify the “abortion restrictions” at issue and purposely so, to create the impression she is an extremist. Laws requiring parental notification and banning sex-based abortions receive widespread support, however. Mandating the cremation or burial of fetal remains does not strike moderate Americans as unreasonable, especially after the discovery of thousands of aborted fetal remains hoarded by the now-deceased abortionist George Klopfer. Of course, the bottom line for abortion apologists is that there should be no restrictions on abortion — even those supported by a majority of Americans. Given that reality, stay tuned for the next false charge likely in the pipeline: that with Barrett on the Supreme Court, Roe v. Wade will be reversed and abortion will be illegal. Unfortunately, no matter how many times that canard is challenged, the message just doesn’t seem to get through: Overturning Roe v. Wade will not make abortion illegal. Maybe, what we need is a new messenger — say, a law professor. ","https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/29/democrats-are-lying-about-amy-coney-barretts-abortion-record/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"188",188,"‘Codify Roe’ Is Biden’s Euphemism For Democrats’ Atrocious Aim: Unregulated Abortion Anywhere, Anytime","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-10-04"," With midterms just a month away, plain-speaking Joe Biden took to Twitter late Sunday to spread some malarkey about abortion.



“My dad used to say, ‘Joey, don’t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative,’” the master of Biden’s Twitter domain said. “And here’s the deal: Democrats want to codify Roe. Republicans want a national ban on abortion. The choice is clear.”






While some Democrats may want to codify the Roe-Casey law of abortion, and while some Republicans may desire a national ban on abortion, the current political scene tells a vastly different story — one in which Democrats demand an unfettered state constitutional right to abortion that far exceeds what Roe and Casey held that the U.S. Constitution guaranteed. Abortion on demand, at any time, for any reason, without informed consent or parental notification, without the safety and medical licensing regulations currently governing in most states, and paid for by taxpayers — this is the push presently underway in several states by mainstream Democrats.



Michigan best exemplifies this reality, with Democrats in this Midwestern state pushing a two-prong approach to achieve that end goal. First, Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer petitioned the Michigan Supreme Court to declare that the state constitution includes a right to abortion. But as a fail-safe, Democrats put abortion on the ballot for this November’s election, asking Michiganders to vote to amend the state constitution to expressly declare a right to so-called “reproductive freedom” — an implicit acknowledgment that Michigan’s constitution does not currently address abortion.



The proposed constitutional amendment would declare that “every individual has a fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which entails the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management, and infertility care.” The amendment would further prevent the state legislature from passing any law affecting the broadly defined “reproductive freedom,” absent “a compelling state interest.” 



This “compelling state interest” standard, also known as “strict scrutiny,” far surpasses the standard that governed under Roe-Casey, but that reality is hard to convey in soundbites, given the legal nuance “standards of review” inject into discussions of constitutional law. Constitutional scholar Elizabeth Kirk, who currently serves as a research associate at the Catholic University of America’s Columbus School of Law and the director of the Center For Law and The Human Person, explained the significance of the “strict” “compelling state interest” standard of review when she testified in support of Kansas’s Value Them Both constitutional amendment before the state’s Senate Judiciary Committee and House Federal and State Affairs Committee. 



Kirk’s testimony is a must-read for anyone who seeks to understand the extreme abortion regime Democrats seek to install on Americans through a “strict scrutiny” standard cemented in state constitutions by amendment or judicial intervention. And as Kirk detailed in her testimony, in states where the courts have discovered a so-called state constitutional right to abortion and applied that “strict scrutiny” standard, courts have struck down laws that the public overwhelmingly supports. 



For instance, state courts in Alaska, Florida, Tennessee, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have all struck down legislation requiring parental notification or consent based on the respective states’ constitutions. Iowa and Tennessee laws establishing waiting periods and/or informed consent also failed in court based on state constitutional challenges. 



In Montana, the law requiring physicians to perform abortions succumbed to a constitutional challenge, and courts in Alaska, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New Jersey have compelled such funding based on their interpretation of the states’ constitutions. In Kansas, notwithstanding the fact that the overwhelming majority of Americans — and nearly all other countries in the world — oppose second- and third-trimester abortions, the Kansas Supreme Court held that the state legislature’s ban on one type of second-trimester abortion, live dismemberment abortions (those in which human beings are killed by being ripped apart limb by limb), violated the state constitution. 



If a state constitutional right to abortion exists, as Michigan Democrats claim with Whitmer insisting so in her court filings, or if the Democrats’ abortion amendment passes, then abortion regulations will be impossible to enact. This will be true no matter how widely supported those regulations are, such as late-term abortion bans, parental notification laws, and even health and safety standards. And it will be true no matter how many Michiganders support the proposed legislation and no matter how many legislators the people elect to advance their preferred policies on abortion.



Democrats hide this reality by using the legalese of “compelling state interest” and pushing dishonest soundbites, such as those Biden peddled in his recent tweet. And no wonder: The media will not expose their extreme views on abortion and, as the failure of the referendum on Kansas’s Value Them Both constitutional amendment shows, the tactic works.



But contrary to Biden’s claim, Democrats are not seeking to “codify” abortion law as it existed prior to Dobbs overturning Roe and Casey. Today’s mainstream Democrats seek to cement an extreme regime of abortion on demand, for any reason, at any time, and paid for by taxpayers, in the states’ constitutions.



It is understandable then, that Biden doesn’t want Democrats’ abortion stance compared to the Almighty!

Fudging The Facts



In Ohio, proponents of Issue 1 are working overtime to sell their extremist ballot measure, which would give the abortion industry a free pass to end unborn lives and trample on parents’ rights, as protecting the state’s abortion status quo before the rest of voters head to the polls on Nov. 7. The outside abortion activists who penned the constitutional amendment “don’t want you to know how barbaric it is” which is why they rely on undefined terms and loopholes such as the subjective judgment of a doctor to advance their abortion goals.



In Virginia, the ACLU, the same leftist organization that authored the deliberately vague ballot measure in Ohio, announced one week before Election Day that it would spend $1 million “on direct mail, digital ads, and volunteer outreach to highlight candidates’ positions on abortion in five Senate districts and six House districts.” Abortion may not be on the ballot in Virginia like it is in Ohio, but it has become the focal point in the state’s legislative races.



The ACLU’s advertisements are just some of the many campaign commercials fearmongering that Virginia Republicans, if they manage to pull ahead in the currently Democrat-controlled Senate and keep their majority in the House of Delegates, will “ban abortion” with no exceptions.



Currently, no state in the U.S. has or plans to make abortion illegal without medical or other loopholes, yet that lie was repeated by individual candidates without scrutiny for months leading up to Nov. 7.



Democrat delegate candidate Joshua Cole, who is trying to win back the delegate seat he lost in 2021, launched an ad just a few weeks before Election Day asserting his rival Lee Peters is one of many Virginia Republicans who want to “ban abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest.”



The 30-second video features a woman, allegedly a doctor, who claims “women will die” if abortion is limited in Virginia.





Democrat Senate candidate Joel Griffin released a similar video in September alleging that his Republican opponent Tara Durant endorses “letting Virginia force a 10-year-old rape victim to carry to term.”



Griffin also claimed that Durant says, “Doctors who disagree with her laws should be in jail.” The bill he cited to back this allegation actually leveled a penalty against doctors who refuse care for babies born alive during botched abortions.



“Tara Durant is extreme, terrifying, too much,” the women in the video allege. “We cannot elect Tara Durant.”

As if those lies weren’t enough, one ad from Reproductive Freedom for All insists that Republican politicians “keep losing elections for pushing abortion bans,” a claim that was disproven by a wave of GOP gubernatorial and congressional victories during the 2022 midterms.




A ban is a ban, and Republicans will pass one into law in Virginia if given the chance.Our new ad sets the record straight: their goal is to ban abortion. pic.twitter.com/CyoIKBRJOy— Reproductive Freedom for All (@reproforall) November 3, 2023
Losers Lie



Democrats all across the nation feel compelled to lie about their political opponents when it comes to abortion because their desire to legalize killing babies through all nine months of pregnancy is not a winning issue with voters.



Not only do a majority of Americans say they support a 15-week abortion limit, but 51 percent of Virginians say they support abortion law like the one Democrats and their ad coordinators claim will wreak havoc on the state and “reproductive rights.” In Ohio, less than one-fourth of voters support the unlimited abortion that would be enshrined in the state constitution if Issue One passes.



Democrats have repeatedly failed to make gains on abortion in several key races because their abortion radicalism is widely unpopular. The only chance the left has at replacing Americans’ current feelings about abortion with their abortion through all nine months agenda is by distorting the reality of Republicans’ position on unborn life.



Their mission is aided by corporate media, which also uses twisted language and more lies to convince the population that unborn babies are just clumps of cells that don’t have heartbeats and won’t feel pain.



Deception gained Democrats some ground in Kansas, where outside groups infiltrated the ballot measure process to circumvent elected Republicans’ objections to unlimited abortion. Unless Republicans and the pro-life movement effectively cut through these lies, they will continue to proliferate and may, as in Ohio, even threaten to permanently alter the state’s governing document.

"191",191,"State-Level Abortion Losses Are No Reason To Shy Away From Pro-Life Messaging","Linton","Paul",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-09-11"," At a closed-door meeting last week, Sen. Mitch McConnell and other Republican senators were briefed on a new study encouraging them to move away from “pro-life” language as potentially alienating voters in the wake of Dobbs. This report was a direct response to a string of defeats the pro-life movement has experienced at the ballot box over the past year, mainly on proposals to amend state constitutions.  



Proposals to neutralize the state constitution as a source of abortion rights were rejected by voters in Kansas and Kentucky, while, in California, Michigan, and Vermont, voters approved proposals to add so-called abortion rights to their state constitutions. The outcomes in California and Vermont were not surprising and, in any event, neither state was likely to regulate, much less prohibit, abortion. But the outcomes in Kansas, Kentucky, and, particularly, Michigan were very disappointing. The vote in Michigan effectively overturned 50 years of successful pro-life advocacy in the state, wiping out not only the pre-Roe law prohibiting abortion but a broad spectrum of post-Roe laws regulating abortion. 



All of these results call for reflection by the pro-life movement. Reflection, not despondency, for all great social movements take time and often experience defeats on the way to ultimate victory. After all, it took almost 60 years for the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) to overrule Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and ban segregation in public schools, and almost 50 years to persuade the Supreme Court, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) to overrule Roe v. Wade (1973). Overruling Roe was the indispensable step — but only the first — toward restoring legal protection for unborn children. And, with respect to the issue of state ballot proposals, something else is called for in addition to reflection, and that is perspective.



What must be recognized at the outset is that it is not possible for advocates of legal abortion to “run the table,” so to speak, with citizen initiatives seeking to constitutionalize abortion “rights,” thereby bypassing conservative legislatures and nullifying pro-life legislation. More than two-thirds of the states allow their state constitutions to be amended only by a measure proposed by the state legislature, while less than one-third also allow amendments to be proposed by a citizen initiative. 



Of the 25 states that have laws on the books prohibiting abortion through part or all of pregnancy, only nine allow citizen initiatives to be used to amend their state constitutions. And of those nine states, citizen initiatives to constitutionalize abortion rights have been proposed in six states — Arizona, Florida (which requires approval of 60 percent of the votes cast for an amendment), Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and South Dakota (to date, only the Missouri and Ohio measures have qualified for the ballot). No such initiative has (yet) been undertaken in Arkansas, North Dakota, or Oklahoma. There is, in sum, a very limited number of states in which a citizen initiative constitutionalizing a right to abortion could be pursued, and even fewer in which such a measure would likely be proposed, qualify for the ballot, and be approved by the voters. 



Some political perspective is also in order. It must be acknowledged that on the same day Michigan voters approved a citizen initiative to constitutionalize abortion rights, they also (barely) turned over control of the state legislature to Democrats. But the outcome of ballot measures is not necessarily a reliable proxy for predicting elections to public office. 



For example, in Montana, on the same day voters rejected a legislatively-sponsored, pro-life ballot measure (a statute, not a state constitutional amendment), they also decided to retain the Republicans in control of their legislature. Apart from Michigan, Republicans lost control of only two other legislative chambers — the Minnesota Senate and the Pennsylvania House — in contests that had no apparent relationship to any proposed or pending abortion legislation. 



Republicans kept control of every other legislative chamber they had controlled before the election (57 of 88 chambers for which elections were held in 2022), including those legislatures that, prior to the election, had enacted laws prohibiting abortion. All 12 incumbent, pro-life, Republican governors (including several who had signed bills prohibiting abortion) were reelected, and a pro-life candidate (Sarah Huckabee Sanders) was elected governor of Arkansas. And although Republicans lost control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court earlier this year, they won control of the North Carolina Supreme Court last November. 



Since Dobbs, no state supreme court has recognized a broad right to abortion, while five state supreme courts have either held that their state constitution does not protect a right to abortion (Idaho and South Carolina) or protects such a right only under narrow circumstances (Indiana, North Dakota, and Oklahoma). And, shortly before Dobbs was decided, the Iowa Supreme Court overruled its earlier decision recognizing a state constitutional right to abortion (and the Florida Supreme Court is expected to do so, as well). 



Finally, since the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade last year, 11 states enacted (or re-enacted) laws prohibiting abortion. All but two of those laws (Indiana and West Virginia) were enacted after the midterm elections and after the pro-life defeats on state constitutional amendments in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Vermont. 



Given that we had a legal regime of abortion on demand for almost 50 years, it should not surprise anyone that it will take time to persuade the public that abortion is a moral and social evil that must be addressed by appropriate legislation. But with half of the states already providing at least some measure of protection (and 18 of those 25 state laws prohibit abortion throughout pregnancy), pro-life advocates and conservatives have achieved a good start toward that goal. 



In light of these accomplishments since Dobbs, conservatives should not be reluctant to debate the issue or defend extending legal protection to the most defenseless of us all: unborn children.

"192",192,"New York’s New Law Isn’t Abortion Extremism, It’s Abortion Consistency","Riley","Sam",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-27"," Infanticide and late-term abortion are easily criticized as barbaric, and abortion supporters are determined to give us every opportunity to do so. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Del. Kathy Tran, and Gov. Ralph Northam have been one-upping each other to be the most supportive of killing the oldest babies. But by only showing outrage with abortion when it’s on 6-pound babies, conservatives are displaying ageism of their own. It’s been a long time since this level of outrage at abortion has been sustained––the buzz around New York and Virginia’s new laws is only now starting to die down after nearly a month. It’s been re-upped by all but three Democrat senators voting against a U.S. Senate bill to require medical care for babies who survive an abortion. But it shouldn’t take Democrats embracing infanticide for us to become outraged.  Ageism should, of course, be expected from the left. They’re quite open about their lethal discrimination against the young and small. However, even more troubling is the somewhat ignorant bigotry coming from the right, people who ought to know better. Needless to say, ripping a third-trimester baby apart is thoroughly grotesque and evil, but the thought of sucking an any-size child out of the womb at a force 20 times that of the average household vacuum cleaner ought to fill us with the same level of rage and dismay. Abortion Is Inherently Extreme If the headlines tell us anything, New York just crossed the line into “extremism,” but what exactly is extremist about late-term abortion when considering the political left’s underlying philosophical dogmatism? Nothing. Embracing 40-week abortions is simply a consistent application of their values. They have long maintained that one is awarded rights by virtue of his development. When one abortion supporter draws the line at a heartbeat, another draws it at viability, and yet another draws it at sentience, by what possible standard can anyone decry one as wrong or qualitatively worse than the other? If we operate on a human rights spectrum, there is no philosophical or moral grounds to decry New York but applaud a conservative state like Alabama. Both have submitted to the Supreme Court’s self-appointed authority to legalize murder, and they apply equally arbitrary standards for determining which humans are legal persons. The tendency to be more angry at the killing of babies who look more like us is understandable. That’s part of the human condition, and something our reform-minded predecessors have lost blood, sweat, and tears to correct. But to treat the killing of 8-month-old babies differently than the killing of 2-month-old babies is the definition of ageism. It’s incoherent discrimination.  In our haste to denounce New York and Virginia’s advocacy for 40-week abortions and infanticide, we have adopted rhetoric that betrays our case. When we call late-term abortion “extreme,” we imply that there is a more moderate abortion position, something more palatable for a just society. But can we really believe that abortion is ever more acceptable? Sure, a later abortion might involve more blood and gore, but it’s unreasonable and immoral to say that filling a bucket with blood is worse than filling a cup or a petri dish with it in the process of killing an innocent human being. We must realize a fundamental truth: late-term abortion is not “extremism.” Abortion is extremism. Fighting fire with fire makes sense, but fighting ageism with ageism does not. We wouldn’t fight racism with racism. The pot calling the kettle a less-valuable-than-white but still-shouldn’t-be-enslaved black is hardly a defensible position. Value spectrums are not only nonsensical, they’re immoral. Abraham Lincoln said it best. You say A. is white, and B. is black. It is color, then; the lighter, having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man you meet, with a fairer skin than your own.
You do not mean color exactly? You mean the whites are intellectually the superiors of the blacks, and, therefore have the right to enslave them? Take care again. By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man you meet, with an intellect superior to your own.
But, say you, it is a question of interest; and, if you can make it your interest; you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if he can make it his interest, he has the right to enslave you. Abortion Is Tyranny of the Old Over the Young In terms of abortion, one could say: You say A. is old, and B. is young. It is age, then; the older having the right to kill the younger? Take care, by this rule you are to be killed by the first person you meet, with further development than your own. You do not mean age exactly? You mean the born are more self-aware than the preborn, and, therefore have the right to kill them? Take care again. By this rule, you are to be killed by the first person you meet, with greater self-awareness than you have.  But, say you, it is a question of bodily autonomy; and, if you can make it about your bodily autonomy; you have the right to kill another. Very well. And if someone makes it an issue of their personal freedom and autonomy, she has the right to kill you. Unsurprisingly, a culture that has swallowed secular materialism hook, line, and sinker simply has no grounds for moral outrage. If there is no God, we are ultimately left to a society dependent on power and emotion alone. If good and right are individually subjective, why, then, it’s perfectly acceptable for some to decide there’s nothing wrong with killing a defenseless human. Christianity, on the other hand, has a very good reason for telling you that it’s wrong to rip apart a little baby at any stage: we are made in the Imago Dei or the Image of God. To murder a human being at any stage not only does a horrible injustice to a child made by God, but it blasphemes God by lying about him. If we are his representatives, and we murder, we are in effect calling God a murderer. But to a materialistic culture, drawing lines based on one’s preference of age, sex, or race can’t be considered immoral, because we are all blobs of cells to the materialist. The only difference between you and a two-week-old baby in that paradigm is that one has more atoms. When we call late-term abortion extreme, we have dropped the deadly poison of relativism into the collective punchbowl, and everyone dies in this particularly stupid battle of wits. Killing human beings is never moderate. It is always extremism. So be angry that New York aborts small babies, but be angrier that New York and your entire country allows the abortion of any babies.

"193",193,"Trump’s Mixed Messaging On Abortion And IVF Plays Right Into Democrats’ Electoral Strategy","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-04-08"," The Republican once hailed as the most successful pro-life president in American history made clear on Monday that he is softening his position on abortion and beefing up his support for in vitro fertilization ahead of the 2024 general election. 



Former President Donald Trump has a history of criticizing heartbeat bills when they come from his political rivals, misrepresenting the Supreme Court’s landmark Dobbs v. Jackson decision, and wrongfully blaming Republicans’ 2022 midterm losses on their unapologetically pro-life positions. His recent declaration on “abortion rights” only further confirms that his once-celebrated pro-life track record doesn’t meet voters’ demands of a Republican president. 



What Trump Gets Right



Most of Trump’s roughly four-and-a-half-minute video statement is littered with cons, but let’s start with the pros of his message. Trump opened his short speech with a passionate call for “strong, thriving, and healthy American families.” 



“The Republican Party should always be on the side of the miracle of life and the side of mothers, fathers, and their beautiful babies,” Trump said. 



The GOP leader is right that prioritizing preborn life and families is good for children, parents, and society. To be on the side of the miracle of life, however, you have to be against ending it — something Trump’s abortion and IVF positions entail. 



Trump did not address this contradiction in his video. Instead, he championed the end of Roe v. Wade as one of his biggest presidential victories and celebrated his role in nominating the justices who decided the Dobbs v. Jackson decision.



“I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal scholars, both sides, wanted and, in fact, demanded be ended. Roe v. Wade — they wanted it ended.”



To his credit, Trump also seems to grasp what many other Republican candidates have failed to, which is that Democrats, not Republicans, are the extremists when it comes to abortion.



“It must be remembered that the Democrats are the radical ones on this position because they support abortion up to and even beyond the ninth month,” Trump said. “The concept of having an abortion in the later months and even execution after birth — and that’s exactly what it is, the baby is born, the baby is executed after birth — is unacceptable. And almost everyone agrees with that.”



Unfortunately for pro-life Republicans, not even Trump’s “rights” on the abortion debate can fix his current wrongs. 



What Trump Gets Wrong



In a clear attempt to absolve his campaign of what bad-faith actors have told Republican politicians is a Dobbs disconnect, Trump came out of the gate on Monday incredibly soft on abortion. 



He began by touting IVF, a procedure that often hinges on the destruction of embryonic life, as something Republicans and pro-life conservatives should celebrate. 



“We want to make it easier for mothers and families to have babies, not harder. That includes supporting the availability of fertility treatments by IVF in every state in America,” Trump said. “Like the overwhelming majority of Americans, including the vast majority of Republicans, conservatives, Christians, and pro-life Americans, I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby. What could be more beautiful or better than that?”



Babies are beautiful and should be cherished despite the circumstances of their conception. But that doesn’t mean the multibillion-dollar fertility industry gets a free pass to serially manufacture embryos only to doom a majority of them to death or life in a freezer.



Trump’s celebration of a knee-jerk Alabama law that effectively rids fertility facilities in the state of any accountability, criminally or civilly, does exactly that. His call for the creation of children by whatever outsourced reproductive means necessary in every state also guarantees that innocent embryos, commissioned by people who could afford to fund their creation, will be subject to genetic testing, premature disposal, and other unethical practices such as surrogacy. 



As pro-lifers have warned ever since the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision deeming embryos to be unborn children under the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, the practices associated with assisted reproductive technology such as IVF are no better than abortion if they sustain the deliberate death of an unborn child. 



This is lost on Trump, who seems to think that touting IVF would soften the blow of his abortion declaration. Trump seems to think that because he nominated some of the justices who decided Dobbs v. Jackson, his title as the most successful pro-life president is permanently protected. He’s wrong. The moment the former president used the term “abortion rights,” he conceded the fight to Democrats, who are desperate to hijack the debates about life in the womb to fit their goals.



Then in the same breath that Trump called out Democrats’ radical and unpopular abortion-until-birth agenda, he said he supported states determining “by vote or legislation or perhaps both” what happens to unborn babies.



“And whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” Trump declared.



Leaving abortion “up to the states” means Trump is giving Democrats and abortion giants a free pass to target Republican strongholds with deliberately deceptive ballot measures that promise uninhibited abortion through all nine months of pregnancy. 



“Saying the issue is ‘back to the states’ cedes the national debate to the Democrats who are working relentlessly to enact legislation mandating abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy. If successful, they will wipe out states’ rights,” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in her response statement. 



It already happened in Kansas and Ohio, and now other red states with strong pro-life laws such as Florida, Nebraska, and Missouri are susceptible to takeovers by out-of-state activists seeking to permanently enshrine unlimited abortion in state constitutions.



[RELATED: State-Level Abortion Losses Are No Reason To Shy Away From Pro-Life Messaging]



Trump said that “this is all about the will of the people,” but if that were the case, why are life-protecting laws under threat and red states becoming havens for abortions — especially considering Americans’ overwhelming opposition to Democrats’ abortion-on-demand plans?



“You must follow your heart or, in many cases, your religion or your faith. Do what’s right for your family, and do what’s right for yourself. Do what’s right for your children. Do what’s right for our country, and vote — so important to vote,” Trump said, ignoring the fact that what pro-abortion Democrats wrongly deem to be “right for themselves” is diametrically opposed to what’s right for children, families, and the country. 



Trump repeated this belief that Americans must “trust their hearts” several times. Yet the moment Americans sacrifice the sanctity of life, either in a cryogenic freezer or in the womb, for the selfish desires of adults, they’ve chosen wrong. 



It’s true that, in Trump’s words, our nation is in “decline” and “failing.” The solution, however, isn’t to hand more power over to the Constitution-hating, anti-democracy Democrats because Trump is afraid a pro-life message will alienate voters. To fortify voters’ defenses against the infiltration of leftist radicalism, Republicans must choose their words carefully and affirm the majority of Americans’ desire to limit abortion to at least the first trimester — not just on the state level but also nationally.

"194",194,"Biden Admin Sneaks Pro-Abortion Policy Into Pregnant Workers Fairness Act","Vought","Mary",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-09-01"," How can Washington bureaucrats take a law that could prevent abortions and turn it into an instrument to encourage them? When the pro-abortion Biden administration is writing the regulations, that’s how. At least, that’s a possible outcome regarding the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA).



That law, passed as an amendment to last year’s omnibus spending bill, gave pregnant women common-sense rights in the workplace. Similar to the process outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, the PWFA requires most employers to make reasonable accommodations for their workers’ pregnancies, so long as those accommodations do not create an undue burden on the business.



The law will give pregnant workers the right to, for instance, take more frequent bathroom breaks or carry water with them at their job site. The measure seems like a common-sense, pro-family measure, one that both sides of the partisan divide can support as a way to make life a little easier for pregnant workers and, in so doing, perhaps discourage some from considering abortion as an option. That is until the Biden administration got involved.



When the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently released proposed rules implementing the PWFA, it included abortion as one of the “related medical conditions” covered by the act. If the proposal gets finalized and abortion becomes subject to the PWFA, most employers will have to give their workers leave to obtain an abortion or abortion-related services.



Indeed, while there has been a great deal of attention paid to the Biden administration’s abortion tourism policy for the military — and Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s fight against it — it appears Washington bureaucrats are now poised to push something similar on the entire American workforce, effectively by executive fiat.



Worse yet, this “abortion vacation” mandate could also apply to religious organizations and entities. During consideration of the PWFA in Congress last December, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., offered a one-paragraph amendment that would have exempted religious entities from any PWFA provision violating their faith. Despite the common-sense nature of this provision, 53 senators voted the amendment down. Now, the EEOC’s proposed rule has officially put religious liberty in jeopardy for countless churches and religious groups.



This new proposed regulation comes despite the fact that the PWFA’s sponsors have stated the bill had nothing to do with abortion. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., said on the Senate floor last December that under the measure, “the EEOC could not — could not — issue any regulation that requires abortion leave, nor does the act permit the EEOC to require employers to provide abortions in violation of state law.”



Even though the lead Democratic co-sponsor of the bill explicitly stated that it provided no such authority to the EEOC to require abortion leave, the commission put out a proposal that would do precisely that. For all their talk of protecting “our democracy,” the left never misses an opportunity to use the powers of government to make unilateral policy decisions when they decide it is in our best interest. As it has on so many other occasions, the Biden administration went out of its way to curry favor with the radical left — in this case, Planned Parenthood and its like-minded cronies, who want to insert abortion into every issue and conversation.



This is, of course, all part of a pattern for the Biden administration, which has spared no effort to ingratiate itself with the radical abortion lobby over the past two years. In addition to using taxpayer dollars for service members’ abortion travel, the Biden administration has also been fighting to put abortion pills in retail pharmacies to allow dangerous, at-home, do-it-yourself procedures. So it should come as no surprise that the executive branch now wants to force more radical abortion policies on American workers through the bureaucratic “interpretation” of a law meant to help pregnant mothers and babies in the workplace.



That such a proposed policy would come about as a result of the federal bureaucracy rather than be debated, deliberated, and passed into law by the American people’s representatives in Congress should come as no small surprise either. Despite all of its genuflection to the likes of Planned Parenthood and others, the radically pro-abortion Biden administration has yet to reconcile itself to the reality that very few Americans are anywhere near as radical as they are on the subject. For example, a 2021 AP-NORC poll found that 65 percent percent of Americans believe abortion should be illegal in the second trimester, and 80 percent said it should be illegal in the third trimester. A more recent 2023 Marist poll showed similar results, with nearly two-thirds of Americans saying that “abortion should only be allowed, at most, within the first three months during pregnancy.”



One can only imagine what those polling numbers would look like if the same sample of people were asked whether a law intended to help pregnant mothers in the workplace should be contorted by a group of politically driven bureaucrats to force employers to provide abortion vacations.



Supporting pregnant workers does not have to become entangled with abortion or undermine the religious liberty of church-based organizations. The Biden administration should rethink its ideological approach to this issue, and the EEOC should withdraw this misguided portion of its proposed rules implementing the PWFA.

"195",195,"California Considers Bill To Make Public Universities Offer Students Abortion Pills","Wolfe","Liz",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-08-31"," California is on its way to becoming the first state to mandate that public colleges make abortion pills available to students. SB 320, which is the first bill of its kind, passed the state senate last year, and the state house plans to vote on the bill by the end of the month. Activists herald this likely victory as progress. “[Abortion] is a good thing,” recently-graduated activist Adiba Khan told Bustle. “Anything that allows you to make a better decision about your own life, we consider to be a good thing.” From a libertarian perspective, I certainly agree that protecting autonomy from state intrusion is worth celebrating. But is abortion?  “This movement is about de-stigmatizing abortion,” Khan added, echoing her earlier praise for the procedure. She’s right that offering easy-to-obtain abortion pills (like Mifepristone and Misoprostol) at student health clinics across the state would remove barriers to access, thus creating more abortions. So SB 320 would destigmatize abortion. But maybe abortion carries a stigma it has deserved. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reports that every month, approximately 500 students venture off campus to receive the abortion pill at University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) schools. These abortions — done earlier in the pregnancy, but markedly different than the Plan B pill — are called medical abortions or chemical abortions, compared to surgical abortions (like D&C, or dilation and curettage, procedures), which are the main option available later in pregnancy. These appointments aren’t always easy to arrange for college students. “On average, a student seeking abortion in California will have to wait one week for the next available appointment at the facility closest to their campus — and that’s assuming they can make it to the appointment,” said the ACLU. As one might expect, burdens of arranging transportation and payment fall on everyone, but disproportionately impact the poor. Per ACLU data, two-thirds of UC students do not have a car. About 51 percent of students across both university systems qualify as low-income.  To make matters worse, in the ACLU’s eyes, only 15 percent of abortion clinics within close proximity of California public universities offer abortion appointments on weekends, meaning the school and work schedules of students are often affected. Since chemical abortions can only be done up until about week 10, time is of the essence — shifting schedules, arranging access to a car, budgeting for an Uber, and dealing with one-week average appointment wait times mean that a woman’s ability to have a chemical abortion might be jeopardized by the time she sorts complex logistics out. But these activists, in spite of their good feminist bona fides and talking points about increased autonomy, miss that abortion has a stigma for a reason. Pro-choicers continuously reframe abortion in shallow language devoid of meaning. It’s about a woman’s choice, they say. It’s about removing barriers. Or, be proud because abortion is a good thing. Most organs begin to form at about five weeks of gestation. They’re completely formed by about week 12. At week 10, the fetus can respond to touch. By week 14, you can tell whether the fetus is a male or female, and the fetus can hear your voice. By week 16, distinct eyebrows and eyelashes have formed, and the face is taking distinct shape. This isn’t to say that life is defined as when eyelashes form, or that women should be harassed, rounded up and handily punished, or made pariahs due to past decisions. That doesn’t seem feasible or loving. That’s no solution to the thousands of unwanted babies that are born every year, or the thousands of unwanted fetuses aborted by mothers in situations of desperation.  But when you look at fetal development, it’s a fact that there is a human body forming. Abortion is stigmatized because the idea of vacuuming a vulnerable developing life out of the womb, which biologically intended to keep the fetus safe, just feels wrong. Same goes for forcing the uterus to expel the fetus by means of a pill. Abortion is stigmatized because we have no clear societal or scientific consensus on when life begins. For many of us, it’s not as simple as drawing the line at conception or birth. For example, many people (even ostensibly pro-choice people) concede that aborting a fetus at 36 weeks, when it is viable outside the womb, doesn’t feel quite right. Until we find some sort of better litmus test for what constitutes human life and what doesn’t, we should err on the safe side of keeping innocent beings out of harm’s way. This isn’t to say we can’t have a meaningful discussion about whether a woman’s preferences can trump the needs of her fetus, who relies on her body for sustenance and support. We can discern whether, in some situations (like rape and incest, which are broadly agreed upon as okay situations in which one can abort by pro-lifers and pro-choicers), the psychological damage done to the mother trumps the value of letting the fetus continue to develop. We should have these discussions. There’s no need to pretend, though, that this is only about access and rights. It’s not as if pro-lifers don’t care about rights; we care about the rights of (what we see as) an innocent human life. Many states morally condone ending the life of a developing baby after organs and fingers and eyelashes have developed. We care about protecting these beings, and weighing their rights against the rights of the mother, who chose to have sex — barring rape exceptions — knowing pregnancy could be the outcome. If initiatives like California’s are passed, abortion will become a little more blasé. This is exactly what activists want, because it makes this decision one of sisterhood and solidarity, one where autonomy must be fought for and protected on the front lines, as they free their wombs from the clutches of the patriarchy. This is preferable, perhaps, to recognizing what abortion actually is — a grim decision that involves the taking of a half-developed baby’s life, sometimes out of mere convenience, other times out of desperation and a perceived lack of options. It’s no wonder they want abortion pills on every campus. ","https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/31/california-to-become-first-state-to-mandate-abortion-access-for-students/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"196",196,"If The Supreme Court Overturns Roe, The United States Will Still Have Looser Abortion Laws Than Europe","O'Shea","Michael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-06-21"," Last week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unsurprisingly weighed in on the abortion case that is on everyone’s mind and displayed her usual tenuous grasp of the truth. “Ireland, Italy, Mexico has had legislative initiatives to expand a woman’s right to choose — very Catholic countries,” she stated. Hers is, sadly, a narrative that seems common on both sides of the Atlantic. Recently a Swedish colleague told me abortion is a major topic in Sweden right now. He wasn’t talking about abortion laws in Sweden — that isn’t on the agenda of any major political party right now. Swedes are frequently discussing abortion laws in the United States in light of the much-anticipated Supreme Court ruling Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization this month.  Most of these conversations contain a touch of perplexity, as the Swedes take for granted that the United States already has particularly draconian abortion laws. “How could this be,” the narrative goes, “since it is already practically impossible for a woman to get an abortion in America?” My unusually informed colleague explained his own perplexity, as abortion is legal until 18 weeks in Sweden. But, surprising to him, in many parts of the United States abortion law is actually allowed much later than that. I must admit my own ignorance of this fact represented a mirror image of the Scandinavians’. I assumed full-term, perhaps even partial-birth, abortions were completely legal in the Nordic welfare state. My ignorance might be partially forgiven since the European Union Parliament voted 364-154 (with 37 abstentions) in favor of condemning the expected U.S. court decision. Never mind that the parliament has no competence to consider abortion laws, let alone any legal developments in the United States. U.S. Abortion Laws Will Remain Radical Upon further research, I felt comfortable asserting what I had suspected, and what so many Europeans seem not to realize: no matter how the justices rule in this case, the United States will continue to have looser abortion laws than virtually all of Europe. Thus, even if the worst fears of the pro-abortion lobby are realized, American abortion laws will remain radical within the Western world. What does it say, then, that the possibility of such an outcome warrants, in some quarters, threats against justices and harassment (if not worse) of their children at school? Or the resignation of many Americans that we will witness widespread unrest, if not outright violence, this summer? I submit that it proves this uproar is primarily about ideology, not choice, or health, or any of the other political rhetoric frequently associated with that side of this issue.  If this were simply an argument over a woman’s basic rights, as the argument goes, one might think the European landscape would be satisfactory to the aggrieved parties. Notoriously laissez-faire Netherlands is the most permissive on the continent, with abortions allowed until 24 weeks. France’s limit is 14 weeks. Sweden’s fellow Scandinavian countries Denmark, Finland, and Norway allow abortions until 12 weeks, as does Germany. Even Hungary, which spends 6 percent of GDP on family policies and has enshrined the right to life from the moment of conception in its constitution, allows abortion until 12 weeks. By contrast, perennial red state Alaska, for example, is one of seven states that has no term limits on the practice, and one of eight that allows it in the third trimester or beyond. Self-professed leftist Bill Maher even opined on the topic this spring. “If you are pro-choice,” he stated on his show “Real Time,” “you would like it a lot less in Germany and Italy and France and Spain and Switzerland. Did you know that? I didn’t know that.” Not Creating a Financial Barrier Inevitably the pro-abortion argument reverts at this point to access to the practice for low-income women, as 13 states are set to ban it if the Supreme Court decision rules accordingly. This is disingenuous. Contrary to popular belief, abortions are usually not free or even low-cost at facilities like Planned Parenthood.  According to the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, the average cost of an abortion at 10 weeks of pregnancy was more than $500 in 2014. Depending on the length of gestation, location of the facility, and insurance factors, the cost can easily surpass $1,000. In 2015, virtually all of the 157,000 abortions covered by Medicaid were conducted in states that contribute funds specifically for the practice (in other words, states that are already pro-abortion). A bus ticket from, say, New Orleans (Louisiana would be the only state to be surrounded by other states in which abortion is illegal if the 13 state laws come into effect) to Mobile or Pensacola is a comparatively unrealistic barrier to “access.” Thus, not all that much is likely to change in wake of the Dobbs case, as abortions were already especially expensive for low-income women in the states in question, and a woman pregnant at 40 weeks will still be able to cross into states like New Jersey or Oregon for what amounts to medieval butchery. This all offers the next piece of evidence that this was never about women, or health, or rights. It has always been about the exercise of power and the quest to destroy all that is sacred, including the home, the family, and life itself. To my friends in Sweden and other parts of Europe — sadly, you are wrong about the state of abortion in America. To my fellow pro-lifers — we have a lot of work ahead of us, no matter how the court rules. Abortion is alive and well in America and will remain that way for the foreseeable future; and our opponents consider even the harassment of schoolchildren fair game in this moral conflict. This is the civil rights issue of our century. Let us not mistake a victorious battle (assuming it happens) for triumph in that war.

"198",198,"Yes, Outlawing The Barbarism Of Abortion Was Always The Goal","Purnell","Elle",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-09-15"," With Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham’s introduction on Tuesday of a ban on killing children in the womb after 15 weeks of pregnancy (with strictly enumerated exceptions), pro-abortion leftists are feigning shock and horror at Republicans’ supposed reversal from the pro-federalism arguments that accompanied the Supreme Court’s return of abortion law to state legislatures in its Dobbs v. Jackson decision this past summer.



“It was never about states’ rights,” Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell huffed.



“Democrats have repeatedly warned voters that Republicans will pursue a national abortion ban. Lindsey Graham is proving them right,” MSNBC boasted, as if pro-life hopes to eliminate the moral stain of abortion were some big secret.



“For the hard right, this has never been about states’ rights,” said Democrat Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “No, for MAGA Republicans, this has always been about making abortion illegal everywhere.”



“These Republicans cheered abortion policy going to states. They are also sponsoring a federal ban,” headlined a Glenn Kessler article in The Washington Post. “This would seem to be a direct contradiction to the idea that states could chart their own course,” he added.



“Republicans aren’t even trying to hide it,” hand-wrung failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.



It’s either disingenuous, constitutionally illiterate, or both for Democrats to claim that a Republican push to ban some or all abortions at the federal level is out of line with the pro-life movement’s goal of the past 50 years. Of course we aren’t hiding it, Hillary. We’ve been calling for a stop to the barbaric practice of abortion for decades, and the partial victory that Dobbs delivered isn’t going to make us slow down.



Overturning Roe Was Never the End



It was a brainless misreading of the conservative celebration over Dobbs to think the pro-life consensus was a satisfied, hands-off-the-wheel declaration that “abortion decisions are back in the hands of the states like they should be,” as one operations director for an abortion facility put it.



Yes, we lauded Dobbs for lifting the federal ban on protecting life at the state level. And we pointed out the obvious inconsistency of pro-abortion leftists claiming this return of federalism and lawmaking authority to elected state leaders was somehow a massive abuse of the Supreme Court’s power. 



The court had unjustly and unconstitutionally appointed itself the arbiter of abortion law in 1973, and the willful relinquishment of that power is clearly not judicial overreach. To claim it was is obvious fearmongering.



To Schumer’s point, the fight against abortion (much less Graham’s middle-of-the-road 15-week ban) is no radical far-right agenda item. Republicans have been advancing similar and more pro-life bills at the state level for years, far before the “MAGA” term Schumer uses so derisively was coined. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a 20-week abortion ban nearly a decade ago. 



One of the only reasons Republicans weren’t passing more abortion bans sooner was the unconstitutional hurdle called Roe. Additionally, nearly every country in the European Union has more restrictive abortion laws than Graham’s proposed 15-week ban, and polls find more support than opposition for bans on abortion after 15 weeks among Americans.



A Federal Abortion Ban Is Perfectly Constitutional



It’s equally ignorant to claim that a federal protection of human life in the womb is an abuse of constitutional powers, to the level of the Supreme Court’s abusive Roe decision or otherwise. Unlike a president with no legislative authority using student loan “forgiveness” to buy votes or waging a political war on American energy or siccing the FBI on political enemies, protecting the lives of citizens is one of the responsibilities and powers of government. It’s why we have criminal laws against murder, why we have a military, and one of the rights to which we understand the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection. 



Laws protecting life do sometimes limit the actions of others — murder laws restrict the actions of murderers — but there’s no legitimate movement advocating for killers’ “freedom to choose” to kill. Unlike the Supreme Court’s abuse of power in its Roe decision, a federal abortion ban done right is perfectly constitutional and even arguably called for by the Constitution and its guaranteed liberties.



Besides the obvious disregard for the protection of human life in the Supreme Court’s Roe decision, there were two constitutional problems with that decision’s mandate that would not be present in a congressionally approved abortion ban.



First, Congress is a lawmaking entity, while the court is not. The justices in Roe arbitrarily decided to set the viability standard (about 24 weeks) as the law of the land on abortion, and barred elected representatives of the people from protecting life at earlier stages. 



Yet the court is tasked solely with deciding questions of constitutionality (i.e., whether a constitutional right to abortion or right to life exists), not writing statutes (i.e., abortions are or aren’t allowed in these circumstances after this many weeks). Legislatures, on the other hand — state or national — are tasked with precisely the latter. 



Second, there has never been any constitutional barrier to the government further recognizing and defending constitutionally protected freedoms, such as the right to life. (On the other hand, there is something — namely, our constitutional system — prohibiting federal infringement on those rights.) 



Congress’s extension of constitutional freedoms to emancipated slaves via the 14th and 15th Amendments was not an abuse of power, but a correction of its abuse. For Congress to use its lawmaking authority to extend constitutional protections to those who always should have had them is not overreach but governance. A federal law protecting the unborn from being killed for the crime of being unwanted would do just that.

"200",200,"Abortion Zealots and the GOP’s Empty Playbook","Hasson","Mary",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013-11-12"," When it comes to women and abortion, the GOP hasn’t a clue. Ken Cuccinelli had barely conceded the Virginia Governor’s race to Democrat Terry McAuliffe before pundits pronounced the lesson learned: Cucinnelli’s defeat in Virginia, and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey, prove that the Republicans’ winning strategy in 2014 and beyond will be to avoid the “hot button social issues such as abortion, contraception, and gay marriage.”  That’s what Christie did, the thinking goes, and it worked. Cuccinelli, on the other hand, “came to the party nomination as a hero to an ideological fringe,” said Mark Rozell, a George Mason University professor and political analyst, and failed to “overcome a socially conservative record.” Labeled an anti-abortion zealot, Cuccinelli played the villain in Terry McAuliffe’s fear-mongering commercials that warned of a Republican campaign to outlaw contraception and deny women’s rights. The commercials worked: Cuccinelli lost big time among unmarried women (67% to 25%) and abortion supporters (58% to 30%), although he did win married women (50% to 41%). For some Republicans, the take-away is clear. As former Virginia Congressman Tom Davis put it, Republicans can win elections only if their candidates “handle” the abortion issue “appropriately.” It’s an easy, and rather lazy, conclusion. And it betrays little understanding of either abortion zealots or women voters.  It’s been a year and a half since the Democrats launched their ‘War on Women’ rhetoric and the Republican Party is still fumbling around trying to figure out how to counter it (short of jettisoning the pro-life position, although some quarters surely favor that approach). In the wake of Christie’s victory—and Cuccinelli’s defeat—the Republican establishment seems eager to believe that they can avoid the abortion issue entirely. If Republicans don’t bait the left with Tea Party candidates from the “ideological fringe,” then surely all the reasonable Democrats in the pro-abortion camp will play nice and quit running those ominous—and very effective—‘War on Women’ commercials. It’s a serious miscalculation. In their disdain for the Tea Party, establishment Republicans fail to see the need to counter the abortion zealots on the left—the same abortion rights groups that rained cash down into Virginia to secure McAuliffe’s win. Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice together spent $1.675 million to defeat Cuccinelli, who received only $22,530 from pro-life groups. Christie, on the other hand, was not targeted by expensive ‘War on Women’ ads only because his race was already won, not because he is more palatable to the pro-abortion zealots. Christie’s pro-choice challenger received paltry sums from Planned Parenthood, Emily’s List, and other abortion rights advocates because she was a sure loser.  Governor Christie is broadly pro-life and repeatedly vetoed state funding for Planned Parenthood. Do Republicans seriously think that Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice, and the like will table the ‘War on Women’ ads in a contest between Chris Christie and Hillary Clinton? Not a chance. The abortion-rights zealots know no middle ground. No Republican who votes pro-life—on anything—will escape the ‘War on Women’ rhetoric, no matter how ‘nuanced’ he or she is in opposing abortion. Not even Chris Christie. Unless the GOP plans to run up the white flag of surrender on the abortion issue, and nominate only pro-choice politicians acceptable to Planned Parenthood and NARAL, it needs an effective strategy to counter the Democrats’ abortion zealotry. And that’s the real problem: the GOP establishment has an empty playbook when it comes to women, especially unmarried women, and the issue of abortion. It has no strategic response to ‘War on Women’ attack ads, except for pointless ads that picture male candidates surrounded by women, as if to say, ‘See. I actually like women and they like me.’ Has the Republican Party done the research to find an effective counterpoint? Has it listened to women, especially unmarried working class women, to learn what kinds of messages resonate with their self-interest, their real life worries? (Pause for a second: this isn’t pandering. It’s basic sales. It’s not about “us.” It’s about “them.” Stop talking about GOP policies and the “why” behind them and start talking about the real-life benefits to voters from those policies.) Has the GOP sought to understand—and speak to—the interplay between economic desperation and women’s attitudes towards abortion and free contraception? Or is the automatic assumption that the ‘single women’ demographic is a bunch of Sandra Fluke clones? (By the way, Sandra, how “free” is contraception if a woman’s monthly premium spikes $300 a month under Obamacare?) Maybe we should take a few lessons from the Democrat playbook. Back in May 2012, the Democrat research team found that disengaged, unmarried female voters reacted to ‘War on Women’ messaging with “blank stares.” The idea that Republicans were hostile to women did not resonate at all with these outside-the-Beltway women. But the Democrats learned quickly that ‘War on Women’ rhetoric would engage (and enrage) these voters if Democrats paired it with pocketbook messaging (Republicans say insurers get to “charg[e] women higher rates than men”) or with specific “intrusive,” “anti-women” legislative proposals (such as the infamous vaginal ultrasound bill). The take-away for Democrats is that women see reproductive issues not in isolation, but through the twin lenses of economics and personal respect, magnified by the fear factor. Democrats gin up hostility towards Republicans by scaring women into thinking that Republican policies will deprive women of ‘resources’ that they (mistakenly) believe will save them from economic disaster. Similarly, Democrat research in September 2012 showed that Democrat-leaning, unmarried women responded favorably when Mitt Romney talked about the economic squeeze on the middle class and when he argued that his policies would bring more jobs and a better future. Again, Democratic strategists identified “women’s health care and equity” as “totally framed by economic issues.” Republican actions to defund Planned Parenthood draw the ire of unmarried women less because of Sandra-Fluke-entitlement feelings and more because these women perceive that “if you limit a woman’s health care then you limit her economic status.” The GOP can speak to those concerns—if it understands them. In 2012, Republicans lost this demographic, partly because GOP candidates failed to convey genuine empathy for women’s specific vulnerabilities. Republicans proved unable to allay the financial fears of unmarried women or to communicate the tangible economic benefits of Republican policies. And women who perceived Republican contempt for women and working Americans in Mitt Romney’s “47%” comment wrote Republicans off entirely. (Cuccinelli’s supposed comparison between rats and immigrants similarly killed his chances with Hispanics.) The Republicans must face facts: the abortion zealots are on the other side and they’ve twisted Republican positions to create an unanswered, winning narrative. The GOP playbook is likely to remain empty when it comes to women voters and issues like abortion unless the GOP takes some serious steps to prove it’s not congenitally tone-deaf to women’s concerns. That means doing a better job of listening to women, treating them with respect, and proposing solutions in concrete, personal language—while holding fast to fundamental principles like the right to life. The next election cycle is almost here. The GOP needs to face the zealots courageously and work hard to add some winning plays to the GOP’s disturbingly empty playbook on women and abortion. Chris Christie—and the rest of the field—are going to need them. Mary Rice Hasson, J.D., is a Fellow in Catholic Studies at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C.

"201",201,"Federal Judge Says FDA Wrongfully Approved Abortion Pill","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-04-07"," A federal judge in Texas ruled Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not use proper means to approve the pill responsible for more than half of the nation’s abortions. As a result, mifepristone will be suspended from the FDA’s list of approved drugs to initiate chemical abortions.



“Chemical abortion is only the status quo insofar as Defendants’ unlawful actions and their delay in responding to Plaintiffs’ petitions have made it so,” the judge wrote. “The fact that injunctive relief could upset this ‘status quo’ is therefore an insufficient basis to deny injunctive relief.” 



For more than two decades, pro-life doctors have repeatedly asked the FDA via citizen petition to repeal its approval of chemical abortion drugs because “the agency violated federal laws by approving these drugs and ignoring the substantial evidence that these drugs harm women and girls.” Despite the FDA’s legal requirement to address these concerns, the agency repeatedly stonewalled petitioners’ requests for years. 



Now, 23 years after the FDA rubber-stamped mifepristone, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk decided this week from the Amarillo, Texas federal courthouse that the FDA chose politics over safety in endorsing the widespread use of abortion pills. 



“To begin, FDA ‘entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem’ by omitting any evaluation of the psychological effects of the drug or an evaluation of the long term medical consequences of the drug,” Kacsmaryk wrote.



The Biden administration has seven days to appeal the decision to the State Court of Appeals for Fifth Circuit before the ruling is enforced. Meanwhile, a Washington judge issued a contradicting injunction on Friday evening claiming to prohibit the FDA from changing the abortion pills’ approval status. 



In November, Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a coalition of five pro-life medical associations and institutions, along with doctors Shaun Jester, Regina Frost-Clark, Tyler Johnson, and George Delgado formally alleged in a federal lawsuit that in 2000 the FDA wrongfully used accelerated drug approval authority to endorse abortion pills that can cause dangerous complications. Accelerated drug approval authority is a process largely used to fast track treatments of serious or life-threatening illnesses. The coalition’s pleas for injunction were supported by more than a dozen friends of the court briefs from several pro-life organizations, 67 members of Congress, and 22 states.



Approval of abortion pill mifepristone was only possible, the plaintiffs argued, because the FDA characterized pregnancy as an “illness” and the drugs that cause infant and sometimes mother fatalities as “meaningful therapeutic benefit.” There was no scientific evidence to back that classification.



The FDA is legally tasked with studying the effects of drugs before greenlighting them. When it came to the complications chemical abortion inducers can have on babies, adolescent girls, and women, plaintiffs say the regulatory agency turned a blind eye. 



New polling found 75 percent of Americans think the FDA should have performed studies focused on girls under the age of 18 before approving chemical abortion for minors. Instead, the agency doubled down on its dishonesty, something 56 percent of Americans find untrustworthy, according to a March poll conducted by CRC Research for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.  



In 2016, the FDA expanded when girls and women could take the pill, changed its dosing, reduced the required number of doctor visits to obtain the drug, allowed more people than licensed doctors to prescribe the pill, and eradicated reporting standards for non-fatal complications from the pills. 



Mere months after pro-lifers filed their lawsuit, the FDA quietly modified its already debated regulation to accommodate the White House’s post-Roe activism and open the door for the nation’s pharmacies to become abortion pill dispensaries. Prior to that decision, mifepristone could only be obtained via clinic, doctor, or mail order, a lockdown-era provision the Biden administration made permanent in 2021.  



“The FDA never studied the safety of the drug regimen and disregarded clear evidence that the pills cause life-threatening complications. As a result of ignoring the science, women and girls became victims of the FDA’s reckless agenda-driven approval,” said Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Erik Baptist, who is representing the pro-life groups, during a Thursday press conference. 



Abortion Pills Were Never Safe



Contrary to what courthouse protestors, the FDA, and CNN claim about the “safety” of abortion pills, mifepristone is responsible for a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits. One longitudinal study revealed that in at least 17 states with taxpayer-funded abortion, many of which have relaxed chemical abortion laws, emergency room visits within 30 days following chemical abortions grew to nearly 34 percent of all ER visits as of 2015. 



The same study concluded “chemical abortion is consistently and progressively associated with more postabortion ER visit morbidity than surgical abortion” and the risks have increase  year after year. Most studies don’t cover the emotional toll chemical abortions often have on women either. 



Already, corporate media outlets like Slate and politicians like Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., are calling on the Biden administration, the FDA, and members of the public to ignore the Trump appointee’s ruling. 



Dr. Ingrid Skop, a senior fellow and director of medical affairs for Charlotte Lozier Institute, told The Federalist that pro-abortion activists are going one step further by promoting the use of one part of the chemical abortion drug regimen by itself.



Misoprostol, the stomach ulcer drug often prescribed with mifepristone to aid abortion, will remain on the market but is not approved by the FDA for abortions because “no company has sent the FDA scientific proof that misoprostol is safe and effective for these uses.” Not only is the ulcer drug even less regulated by FDA than mifepristone, but Skop said it is linked to far more complications when used for chemical abortion alone.  



“Nearly one out of four women who take misoprostol are going to need surgery. So it’s even going to get worse going from one out of 20 [post-mifepristone] to one out of five or one out of four,” Skop said.

"202",202,"Abortion CEOs Say Ending Lives For Profit Is ‘Just No Fun Anymore’","Rogness","Becky",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-12-20"," “Get out of bed, Betty.” That’s what the Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky CEO, Betty Cockrum, now tells herself every morning. She tells the left-leaning student newspaper at Indiana University, “You got to talk to yourself to even get out of bed right now, and we do.”
I think it’s safe to say the mood of the abortion industry is total misery. Cockrum says, “When your fellow CEOs say, ‘It’s just no fun anymore. It just gets harder by the day,’ that’s tough.”
What I’d like to know is, what was “fun?” Was killing 58 million innocent boys and girls since the Supreme Court legalized abortion “fun?” Was making billions off the mothers who thought their lives would go back to normal after an abortion “fun?” When was abortion ever fun?
Planned Parenthood and its allies are in a post-election hangover. They’re “really stressed” about Donald Trump in the White House. But it wouldn’t have mattered who won the election. Hillary may have bought them a little more time of state-sanctioned favor, but abortion is on its way out. Certainly, it can’t happen fast enough—not for the approximately 3,000 little boys and girls who are losing their lives today. But abortion is on the decline.
Abortion Is Declining, Especially Among Young People
Last month, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that annual abortions in the U.S. dropped by 5 percent from the previous year. The abortion rate hasn’t been lower since before the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973.
In Indiana, where Planned Parenthood’s Cockrum oversees the state’s largest abortion business, abortions have steadily declined for seven consecutive years. Abortions there are less than half of the all-time high number of 16,505 in 1980. But still in 2015, Planned Parenthood’s Indiana abortion facilities ended the lives of 5,234 children.
Pro-life laws are passing at a record pace. According to pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, states passed almost as many pro-life laws in the past five years as they had in the previous 15 years combined. Indiana governor and Vice President-Elect Mike Pence signed his own fair share of pro-life bills into law.
Abortion is losing its favor in the court of public opinion, especially among millennials—and even the abortion industry knows it.
“The biggest challenge reproduction rights advocates face is the generational gap,” a Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Vice President admitted.
This Work Won’t Be ‘Fun’ Ever Again
The abortion industry is in a slump. Sorry, Betty, but it’s never going to be “fun” again. The good news I can offer to those in the abortion industry who can hardly get out of bed in the morning, is that they don’t have to stay in an industry that fights for the death of innocents.
Dr. Bernard Nathanson, who co-founded NARAL and aborted 75,000 children, left the industry and became a pro-life advocate. Dr. Anthony Levatino did 1,200 abortions before recognizing the humanity of the unborn. He now changes hearts and minds by explaining what happens in an abortion procedure. Former Planned Parenthood director, Abby Johnson, has helped hundreds of abortion workers leave the industry with her ministry, And Then There Were None.
As we approach Christmas, Christians remember the Christ child who was hated, even as a baby. (Remember the mass infanticide in Bethlehem?) While the world is filled with hate, let us on the pro-life side respond with love.
In this time of Advent, as we prepare for Christmas, I have my own phrase I’m telling myself each morning: “Get out of bed, Becky, and pray for Betty.”
Join me in praying for the CEOs of the abortion industry and all abortion workers. May their cloud of misery turn to joy when they realize they don’t have to keep fighting for death. May they one day get out of bed each morning and fight for every child to safely get out of the womb.

As the Supreme Court deliberates on the right to life in Dobbs v. Jackson, the pro-abortion crowd is getting more and more defensive — and some of the most vicious attacks are from those who claim to be in the church.



Last September, the House of Representatives considered a bill to effectively solidify the national “right” to abortion access, which San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone called something “one would expect from a devout Satanist, not a devout Catholic.” He added: “This proposed legislation is nothing short of child sacrifice.” 



Naturally, the pro-abortion crowd didn’t take kindly to this admittedly provocative language, eliciting comments from, among others, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (a lifelong professed Catholic). But based on how many pro-abortionists talk about abortion, perhaps Cordileone isn’t far off.



Murder As a Sacrament



In a Feb. 5 article in The Washington Post, Rev. Kaeley McEvoy at Westmoreland Congregational United Church of Christ in Bethesda, Md., discussed her thinking on abortion. When she and her boyfriend got pregnant together, the very first place they went was a cathedral to pray — but not for grace to persevere through an unplanned pregnancy. No, McEvoy actually called a doctor’s office while inside the place of worship to schedule an abortion. When other visitors to the cathedral tried to enter a small chapel where McEvoy was on the phone, the boyfriend turned them away, declaring: “Something holy is happening here.”



Among the pro-abortion crowd, abortion is increasingly no longer described as a necessary evil, but holy. The Post suggested McEvoy views it as a “social and theological good.” In a November sermon, McEvoy told her congregation that she “never felt more known and heard and loved by God than when I entered the doors of a Planned Parenthood.” At a January event addressing a group of abortion access activists meeting in a D.C. church, she reiterated: “Something holy is happening here, friends.”



McEvoy is not alone among clerics in this sentiment about abortion. Presbyterian minister Rebecca Todd Peters in an October USA Today op-ed wrote: “I did not make my abortion decisions despite my Christian identity and faith, but rather because of it.” Rabbi Rachael Pass in a September article claimed her abortion during rabbinical school was a “blessing” and a “sacred choice.” Everything about her experience, Pass observed, from “the timing of the accidental conception to the decision and procedure itself was brimming with my Jewish practice, learning and living.”



Abortionists: Abortion Is ‘Sacred’



Similar language can be found in less explicitly religious fora. A December article by Rae Guerra-Lorenzo on the Planned Parenthood website asserted that “abortion is sacred,” because women’s “reproductive health” is sacred. “I am here because of abortion—someone down the line of ancestors knew when it was and wasn’t time for expanding their family,” she continued. “My own children are here because of abortion.” 



An article at the libertarian Ayn Rand Institute called abortion a “secular sanctity,” and explains that abortion “allows women to protect what’s sacred about life.”



It is a curious, if rhetorically clever, reversal on the oft-quoted pro-life lines that “every child is a blessing” and that “every human life is sacred.” It is not the conception of human life and bringing that baby into the world that is a sacred blessing, they say, but the elimination of that organism in the womb that is the truly holy act. 



Wrapping abortion in the language of faith — and sometimes even specific religious traditions — would seem to suggest that such persons view it as an actual manifestation of their religious belief. “As people of faith, we abort,” they seem to say.



The Religious Language of Child Sacrifice



In that respect, we can better appreciate Cordileone’s comments, which orient us to the ubiquity of religiously motivated child sacrifice across much of the ancient world. Ancient sources including Cleitarchus, Porphyry, Philo of Byblos, and the Book of Kings describe the Canaanite groups of the Levant regularly performing child sacrifice in attempts to placate various divinities. 



Their cousins the Carthaginian civilization — defeated and destroyed by Rome during the Punic Wars — sacrificed children as offerings to their gods. The Quran also mentions pagan Arabians sacrificing their children to pagan gods.



Nor was this practice limited to the civilizations of the Mediterranean basin. The Aztecs of present-day Mexico sacrificed thousands of people, including many children, to the god Huitzilopochtli in their capital at Tenochtitlan in order to bring good weather for their seasonal crops. An archeological site in Peru recently uncovered 140 children ritually sacrificed in what appears to be a single ceremony — the historical event occurred around 1450 A.D. and involved ripping the children’s hearts out. Ritual killings of children still occur in Uganda today.



Undoubtedly the practitioners of ritual child sacrifice across practically every human continent believed their act to be a holy one. The child must die, they believed, for the survival of their society: a sacred rite for the wellbeing of mothers, fathers, and the broader civilization.



Of course, the vast majority of the pro-abortion camp does not believe the organism inside the mother’s womb is a human life — it is only a “chia seed-size embryo,” as feminist columnist Monica Hesse recently called it, or “a clump of cells,” as they often tell us. Most who promote and procure abortions have not yet descended into actually using the bodies of the unborn in religious rituals to appease their gods — although fetal tissue research, used as it is for the secular, utilitarian gods of “science” and “progress,” gets us pretty close.



But the language of the pro-abortion movement, especially among those who wear clerical garb and use religious honorifics, should give us pause. Even if they cloak that life in the womb with the language of “embryo,” “cells” and “fetus,” it is quite another thing to label its destruction holy and sacred. 



It is, after all, life, a living organism. Something living and growing is destroyed for the sake, so they say, of the mother’s life and wellbeing. A sacrifice is made, which, its advocates say, is cause for celebration. But that is not a holy thing. It is horrific.

Jackson ruling, which handed decisions about abortion back to the states and thus voters, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Friday that pushes his taxpayer-funded, abortion-on-demand agenda to the top of his administration’s priority list.



The order will funnel federal time, resources, and funds, mostly through the Department of Health and Human Services, to shield existing abortion clinics, promote unlimited abortion, and circumvent Republican state laws to help send women to abortion appointments in other states.



“What we’re witnessing wasn’t a constitutional judgment. It was an exercise in raw political power,” Biden said.



In addition to casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, Biden called Dobbs “extreme” and claimed the Republican-nominated justices who made up the majority lied about the ruling being “a decision driven by history.”



Polling suggests that at least 44 percent of Americans — a plurality — prefer for abortion issues to be dealt with at the state level, yet Biden is using his executive power to implement pro-abortion radicalism through the federal government under the guise of ensuring that “Americans have access to reliable and accurate information about their rights and access to care.” 



It’s unclear how exactly the Biden administration defines “reliable and accurate information,” but if congressional Democrats get their way, that information will deliberately exclude pregnancy centers that work around the clock to assist women and children but have been smeared as “fake clinics.” Some Democrats have even demanded they be shut down. Meanwhile, Biden and his administration were silent on the firebombings at dozens of pregnancy centers around the nation.

Despite demands from progressives such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to open abortion facilities on federal lands, the Biden administration declined to implement the practice, which could have “dangerous ramifications.” Instead, Biden plans to use Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to increase the promotion of contraception including some problematic birth controls and harmful abortion pills and said he wants the Department of Justice to do “everything in their power” to protect women seeking abortions and abortion facilities. 



Biden previously signaled he would not accept the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision. Less than 24 hours after the draft opinion was leaked in May, Biden threatened to use his executive authority to reject the end of Roe v. Wade. Despite Democrats’ history of defending poor rulings from the high court as the “law of the land,” Biden pledged to use his Gender Policy Council and White House Counsel’s Office to counter “the continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights” by the Supreme Court.



When the court officially released the final Dobbs decision, Biden called on Americans to vote for pro-abortion politicians who will give Democrats in Congress the leverage they need to snatch the abortion issue back from states and voters to the federal level. He repeated the same plea to circumvent “extreme Republican governors” and “Republican extremists in the Congress” on Friday during his remarks about the new executive order. 



“This is the fastest route available. I’m just stating a basic fundamental notion. The fastest way to restore Roe is to pass a national law codifying Roe, which I will sign immediately upon its passage on my desk,” Biden said, shortly before he repeated an unconfirmed and dubious story about a 10-year-old girl who was denied an abortion.



Several pro-life organizations condemned Biden’s remarks and his executive order. “It is tragic that this administration is using its power to push for more and more painful abortions which harm women and take innocent lives. Of particular concern is the administration’s effort to push chemical abortion which carries significant health risks to women, even more than surgical abortion. Our nation today faces significant challenges, not enough abortion is not one of them,” March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a statement.



“Long gone is the Democratic Party of ‘safe, legal, and rare.’ President Biden has once again caved to the extreme abortion lobby, determined to put the full weight of the federal government behind promoting abortion,” said SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser. “Democrats will stop at nothing to promote their agenda of abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, paid for by the taxpayers — including dangerous mail-order abortion drugs — even if it means gutting the long-standing filibuster, increasing the size of the Supreme Court, or putting abortionists in tents in national parks.”

"205",205,"Abortion Supporters Are No Longer Lying About Their Cruelty","Stanton","Glenn","T.",NA,NA,NA,"2021-01-08"," It used to be a well-worn talking point that abortion was a necessary tragedy, certainly not something to celebrate. That appears to have changed, and dramatically. Say what you will about their sincerity when the “safe, legal, and rare” crowd said it, but at least it was a glimmer of humility and recognition of what abortion produces: a dead child and unspeakable pain for the mother that never truly goes away. That has all changed.  This was demonstrated just days after Christmas in an interview the Washington Post conducted with Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood. The Post tried to downplay the organization’s reputation as the record-breaking, single largest abortion provider in America by asking McGill Johnson to confirm that abortion is merely “a very small part” of what Planned Parenthood does. The abortion leader would have none of it, however, objecting, “I think when we say, ‘It’s a small part of what we do,’ what we’re doing is stigmatizing it,” adding, “We are a proud abortion provider” because “abortion is health care.” That, of course, is the current talking point. “Necessary evil” stigmatized abortion too. The abortion crowd is done with all that. This shift was also tragically exemplified last week when Argentina became the first large Latin American nation to legalize abortion for any reason. Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Chile will soon follow Argentina’s lead. The abortion lobby knows this and the wild celebration at the news was as chilling as it was euphoric.    What is it exactly that these young people think they are cheering? Do they not appreciate that the so-called “right to choose” always comes at the life of a child? Or do they understand that all too well?  It’s bone-chilling, utterly macabre, and reminiscent of what took place in January 2019 when the New York State Senate legalized abortion up to the moment of birth to celebratory cheers throughout the statehouse and Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for One World Trade Center to be joyously illuminated in pink. This is the soul of international abortion politics now and it is a U.S. export of Planned Parenthood. Argentina’s many pro-life politicians report the international money and financial pressures at play to sway their colleagues in a pro-abortion direction there was deafening. But other equally disturbing images have emerged from the abortion camp’s latest victory. It comes from an Argentinian television news show where Viviana Canosa, Argentina News 9’s main anchor, relays the story. The image itself needs no translation. It tells you more than you want to know about the utter soullessness of abortion politics. https://youtu.be/NJr3IwH-f3U?t=90  Canosa was doing a segment on a significant pro-life rally in Buenos Aires, the Festival of Two Lives, leading up to their abortion vote in the Senate last week. She explains: I want to share with you — especially you politicians who weren’t there — that it was thrilling. I want to tell you that there were many young people there. There were many humble people there, both humble of spirit and humble in economic status. It was beautiful. She then adds, “But I want to jump into this with the photo of this young girl. There she is.”  She clarifies this photo was taken, not at the pro-life gathering where babies and their mothers were celebrated, but at the “Green Diaper March” where abortion advocates dressed in green, waving green triangle diapers, as seen in the first video above. A young girl, perhaps 10 years old, stands with her foot firmly on the back of a face-down baby doll. No one seems alarmed. Yet imagine the outrage if that doll had been a puppy.  This news anchor provided a beautiful reflection on the picture from a strong woman’s perspective. Canosa describes what came to her mind when she saw this picture of this young girl was what she would have been dreaming about at that time in her life. She expounds: You know, we didn’t know if we would be mothers or wanted to be mothers, but we used to play with dolls. We put them to bed, we gave them something to eat and cared for them. We role-played mom & dad with our girl friends: ‘Hey can you keep care of my baby? I’m going off to work!’ That was our childhood.  And this photo is disturbing to me.  It is the antithesis of what I experienced in the [pro-life] March of Two Lives this weekend. Then, in a very poignant moment, Canosa the newscaster, as a woman and mother, responds directly to the little girl and her caregivers: If I could, I’d run to this girl to sweep her up and hug her and hold her to my chest and give her a huge hug. This doesn’t correspond to her nature. There’s nothing in a girl’s heart that would make her do this. Something’s wrong here. That girl must have parents, grandparents … and I ask of you, ‘Please care for this girl!’ I ask you as a mother.  Canosa so beautifully isolates what should be obvious here, which is, unfortunately, not so obvious today. Where did those women in that first video learn that a new law allowing you to end your child’s life is something to cheer about as if you were at some teen-idol concert? That crowd would not cheer that wildly had the eradication of cancer from the planet just been announced. Something is deeply wrong there with such callousness. And it puts that little girl’s blind and horrific actions in total perspective. Where did this little girl learn this behavior? Who and what taught her that was a virtuous thing to do? She certainly didn’t dream it up on her own. She imbibed it from the adults around her. This should horrify even the most ardent pro-abortion advocate. As the anchor says, such an action is not in any little girl’s nature, but contrary to all nature. Indeed, such things must be taught, as everything in her female body is naturally directed toward life, protection, and care. That is what makes this image so startling. It presents this fact in stunning, real-life fashion over and against the otherwise innocence of childhood. Did anyone at that rally correct the girl? Someone brought that doll to the march that day, but for what purpose? It perfectly demonstrates the truth of Leonard Cohen’s prophetically dark song “The Future,” in which he sings, Destroy another fetus now
We don’t like children anyhow
I’ve seen the future, baby: It is murder It’s worth asking how the pro-abortion movement in the United States and abroad has become so inhumanely cruel. The darker truth, however, is that it may simply be shedding its false veneer to reveal the evil that was always there.

"206",206,"The Fight Over Abortion Is Now Total War","Marcus","David",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-05-15"," Since the day that Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, abortion has been a hot button political topic in the United States. But while it is an emotional issue that has always had inflamed rhetoric surrounding it, over the past 46 years, the abortion question has existed in a kind of stalemate or détente. Very little, including the polling numbers on how many people are pro-choice or pro-life, has changed.
On the right, given the composition of the Supreme Court during that time, and the unlikelihood of Roe being overturned, it has been mostly a fight around the edges of the issue. Pro-lifers have sought to cap abortions at early periods in pregnancy, or advocated for parental notification, but there was no clear path to actually making all abortions illegal.
On the left, secure as they also once were in Roe, the attitude for most of that time had been that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. Abortion was not something to be celebrated, but rather a sad and dire thing only to be used in extreme and necessary circumstances.
Today, none of this is true anymore. Pro-lifers for the first time feel that it is possible that the Supreme Court could overturn Roe and allow states to ban abortion, and for abortion advocates, it has been become something to celebrate, to shout, and to be considered an unfettered good.
As a result of these changes, we have seen bills from both sides in state legislatures that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. In New York, state lawmakers passed a bill that would allow for abortion up to birth, and arguably, make allowances for finishing the job if a botched abortion produces a live baby. Meanwhile, Virginia lawmakers floated a similar bill that was then defeated.
Meanwhile, in Georgia, a new law would effectively ban abortion after as little as six weeks and, in Alabama, legislation was passed this week that would basically ban abortion entirely (though it has yet to be signed by Governor Kay Ivey). The détente which has held for 50 years is gone and the fight over abortion has become a total war. What has always been a testy battle in American politics is poised to become very ugly, very fast.
Because it seemed for so long like nothing would ever really change much regarding abortion, the underlying question of whether it is the taking of a human life has been somewhat academic. By granting constitutional protection to abortion, the Court made it a moot point if abortion is murder, because it is first and foremost a right. But should that change, either under the current Court or perhaps a future Court with more Trump-appointed justices, the entire battlefield will shift and that central question will be front and center.
Pro-abortion forces have made it perfectly clear how they plan to respond to this. With flat-out denials that a fetus is a human being at all, with increasingly less restrictive abortion laws, and with campaigns that encourage this choice for women as liberating and empowering. There are no important voices on the current left or in the Democratic Party who will challenge any of this. It will be a united front dedicating to expanding abortion access and abortion itself as widely as possible.
For Republicans and other conservatives, the situation is more fraught. There are, after all, some on the right who support access to abortion, and as a political matter, many in the GOP may well be scared about how such strict measures as Alabama’s will play with suburban women voters, viewed as essential in the presidential and congressional elections of 2020.
But in order to be effective, pro-life forces must not be too tame. They must not seek middle ground with abortion advocates who have no interest in compromise. Instead, they must finally and once and for all stake their claim that abortion is the killing of a child and must be treated as such. The pro-life movement doesn’t need gimmicks and costumes; it just needs the truth, that killing babies is wrong.
It can be scary to suddenly have the opportunity to achieve something once thought impossible, and it may be that the current Court is disinclined to overturn Roe, but for the first time, it does seem possible. Saving millions of innocent lives is not some far away dream, but a tangible and real opportunity.
For the pro-life movement, now is the time to speak with a unified voice, to make it known that life is better than death, to make it known that innocent lives will be protected, and to make it clear that this is a war we are ready to fight and ready to win.

"207",207,"It Makes No Sense For Gun Banners To Support Abortion","Carmichael","Ellen",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-10-20"," Two weeks ago, an OB-GYN in West Bloomfield, Michigan, struck a special-needs child with his car. When police obtained his vehicle’s “black box” to examine recorded data from the accident, they discovered that Michael Arthur Roth was hoarding human tissue, likely from dead babies, in 14 plastic containers in his trunk. Law enforcement are now investigating whether Roth was performing illegal abortions in the homes of his patients and at his own residence. Liberals have long argued that keeping the practice legal would prevent women from terminating their pregnancies in unsafe conditions. But, as this case in Michigan shows, there are still abortionists willing to perform the procedure illegally, even if that means having to ride around with dead babies in the trunk of their cars to hide them from the authorities.  These so-called “women’s health” warriors would likely claim that if more abortion facilities were available, fewer women would seek Roth’s services. But West Bloomfield already has an abortion clinic, and the township is located less than 30 miles away from Detroit, which also features numerous abortion providers, including a Planned Parenthood facility. Atrocities Are Isolated Incidents When It’s Abortion As stories like Roth’s emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that this is a practice rooted not in women’s health, but instead, in murder. Abortion advocates would likely contend, as they have so many times before, that this case is but an outlier among the sterling, professional facilities that are typical of the industry, but their position is becoming increasingly untenable. The media and abortion rights advocates cry that each disgusting example doesn’t reflect the industry as a whole. What about Kermit Gosnell’s abortion factory, where babies were left flailing half-alive and women were fighting for their lives? We were told it would be illogical to assign the horrors of his practice to the outstanding providers of “women’s health” around the country. Or what about the videos showing Planned Parenthood executives bragging about buying luxury cars by selling the tissue of aborted babies? Planned Parenthood responded by first attacking the video producer, then proudly proclaiming they were offering a needed service, and then asserting this behavior was not the norm at their organization (and, after several months, ultimately promising to stop making a profit off selling baby parts).  The media and abortion rights advocates cry that each disgusting example doesn’t reflect the industry as a whole. They insist these cases prove why we need more abortion clinics and more abortion providers who can safely offer these services that many women so obviously want. Not So With Guns There are 270 million guns in America today. With each infrequent instance of gun violence, gun-control zealots demand we outlaw firearms or at least significantly restrict the rights of lawful gun owners. Despite the fact that shootings have declined over the past two decades, activists need little motivation to call for regulations they claim are reasonable efforts to save lives. They argue that mass shootings, no matter how rare they might be within the larger context of gun ownership, define the use of guns in the United States. With each abortion case, Americans are told that, unlike gun ownership, these atrocities should be viewed as exceptions to the rule. By comparison, there are fewer than 1,800 abortion providers in America, but there are countless examples of this murderous enterprise subverting the law or ignoring medical ethics. This includes, but is not limited to: neglecting patients; failing to provide adequate care for babies surviving botched abortions; refusing to obtain parental consent for minor children seeking procedures; failing to report known cases of rape, incest, and pedophilia; and selling baby parts for profit. With each case, Americans are told that, unlike gun ownership, these atrocities should be viewed as exceptions to the rule. But what should cause more societal concern: something that happens at an alarming frequency among a small population (abortion providers) or something that happens at an ever-decreasing, infrequent rate among a massive population (gun owners)?  Those calling for gun control are likely ideological siblings of those who resist any restrictions on abortion. While they whine that the country must “do something” about gun violence, they don’t want to “do something” about murderous events that happen at a much higher frequency with the practice of abortion. Fine, Let’s Do Something About Violence When pro-life Americans ask for reasonable regulations—clean facilities, doctors maintaining admitting privileges at local hospitals to protect the mother or baby if an abortion goes wrong, parental consent for minor children seeking abortion, limits that would be on par with the rest of the civilized world (outlawing abortions after the first trimester)—liberals accuse them of trying to restrict women’s rights and sending females back to the pre-suffrage era. These are the same people who mock gun-rights supporters who see any violation of their Second Amendment rights as a step toward taking away their guns. That’s because abortion advocates believe that even the most modest regulations of this industry would lead to lawmakers ultimately outlawing the practice. Funny enough, these are the same people who mock gun-rights supporters who see any violation of their Second Amendment rights as a step toward taking away their guns altogether. While gun control proponents perpetuate the erroneous notion that mass shootings characterize lawful gun ownership, abortion advocates willfully fail to acknowledge the statistical reality of atrocities actually defining their industry. The repeated call of progressives to “do something” about violence caused by individuals using firearms is simply not extended to thwarting the violence caused by individuals robbing human beings of their right to life through abortion. Before those on the Left start hurling rocks through their glass abattoirs at lawful gun owners, maybe they should consider “doing something” about those purported outliers who so clearly define their slavish and unquestioning devotion to the unbridled practice of abortion.

"208",208,"Activists Are Forcing Democrats To Admit How Radical The Party Has Become On Abortion","Jacobs","Christopher",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-03-20"," Nearly two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leftists are saying the quiet parts out loud about abortion. And believe it or not, the media are actually covering them saying so.



Two recent stories in Politico (of all places) have highlighted increasingly radical rhetoric, coupled with an unwillingness to tolerate dissent. While the left’s positions may make Joe Biden look moderate, they should make ordinary Americans feel morally and politically uncomfortable.



Abortion on Demand



The first story examined the State of the Union address to highlight Biden’s emphasis on “access” to abortion in circumstances such as medical emergencies. “That has left [progressive] activists and elected officials dismayed by what they see as a harmful divide between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ abortions that threatens to undermine a core tenet of the abortion-rights movement: that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be between a patient and their doctor.”



The next paragraph quoted the CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health: “The President is part and parcel of the culture of stigma and shame that surrounds abortion care. … Privileging certain stories allows us to ‘other’ people.” Politico also quoted another pro-abortion activist who co-leads the group Patient Forward: “We do not see this as a harmless approach because of all the ways it promotes stigma.”



In other words, to the left, any abortion is a “good” abortion.



Lest anyone consider conservatives inaccurate for pointing out that the left supports abortion on demand, Eloisa Lopez, the head of Pro-Choice Arizona, said the following:




A lot of people are disillusioned with the two-party system in general and Biden in particular. … What we want is not what most politicians want to promote and talk about, which is unrestricted abortion care. To not capitalize on the current momentum and to just settle for the Roe standard is upsetting to a lot of us. (Emphasis mine.)




Leftist politicians do want unrestricted abortion care — they just don’t necessarily want to “promote and talk about” it, as Lopez pointed out. Perhaps the most strikingly cynical example of abortion rhetoric came from Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., running this year for Michigan’s open Senate seat. Slotkin essentially told Politico she has moderated her rhetoric, not because she doesn’t believe in abortion on demand, but because she has to win over the votes of people who disagree with her:




I’ve had women tell me the reason they support a right to choose is because of cases of rape and incest and the very common experience of miscarriage. … Is that the only reason why people ever get an abortion? No. But if I’m trying to get women in my state the right to have an abortion, I need the help of women who consider themselves pro-life.




And the Democrats’ march to the left on abortion hasn’t remained confined to Washington.



Ideological Litmus Test



The day after the Politico story on Biden’s rhetoric appeared, the same publication published a feature article about the abortion debate in the nation’s heartland. It spotlighted how in Nebraska — previously home to pro-life Democrat officials like Sens. Bob Kerrey and Ben Nelson — the party has turned sharply left on abortion.



Politico highlighted the case of state Sen. Mike McDonell, a Democrat whose strong Roman Catholic beliefs informed his pro-life values. The state Democrat Party recently censured McDonell for his pro-life stance, coupled with his opposition to the left’s transgender agenda.



In an interview, state party Chair Jane Kleeb admitted that support for abortion had become a de facto litmus test for Democrats: “We need our elected Democrats to protect women’s reproductive rights, period. … There’s no more squishy middle in that, and I think that has changed in the last four years. … When he [McDonell] got elected four years ago, we did not have the Supreme Court decision” in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe and sent the abortion issue back to the states.



Ken Riter, a leftist activist in Omaha, went even further in adding woke litmus tests for Democrat politicians. He expressed little interest in voting for a Democrat like McDonell for mayor of Omaha because, “I think Democrats should send a message that if you’re not going to support our key constituencies — women and gay people and especially trans people right now — why should we support you?”



There you have it. A party that claims to want “choice,” but ostracizes those who think differently on the issue of protecting innocent human life. So much for the party of tolerance.

"209",209,"Three Ways Obamacare Forces Americans To Fund Big Abortion","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-09-23"," The Government Accountability Office confirmed September 16 that Obamacare is funding abortions with taxpayer dollars. This shouldn’t surprise anyone. In fact, it’s so unsurprising that more than two years ago my Alliance Defending Freedom colleagues (the creative types—not the attorneys) put together this video foreshadowing the GAO report.
In at least three distinct ways Obamacare is forcing taxpayers—and in some cases unwitting policyholders (maybe you)—to pay for others’ abortions, steering untold millions of dollars toward Planned Parenthood and other abortion dealers, who have and are likewise spending millions to elect President Obama and his political allies.
One: Direct Purchase
First, the GAO concluded that more than 1,000 Obamacare health insurance plans nationwide are eligible for taxpayer subsidies despite including elective abortion coverage. In Washington’s exchange, for example, the entire premium—including the portion covering elective abortions—are paid for by (your and my) federal taxpayer dollars. This is no small thing. The so-called “Cornhusker Kickback” brought magic vote number to 60 for the narrow passage of Obamacare in the Senate. But another “promise” to Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson supposedly required that those who wanted an abortion-inclusive plan would pay for an add-on via a separate fee segregated from taxpayer dollars.
In truth, this was always an accounting gimmick and would not prevent taxpayer subsidies of abortions. Whether through incompetence or willful blow-off of the law, even this gimmick is being ignored. It was always admitted that taxpayers were subsidizing some “excepted” abortions. But now the GAO has confirmed that you are also paying for elective abortions.
Second: Buy to Find Out What’s In It
Second, the GAO confirmed what many already know—it is virtually impossible to find out whether the plans you are seeking even include elective abortion. Exchanges and even individual insurers have varying approaches to informing or not informing individuals which plans cover abortion. When you buy a plan, you just don’t know. Unfortunately, this confusion is difficult to correct because it is built into the law itself. As footnote 15 of the GAO report explains, while you might find out other plan details earlier, Obamacare specifically permits insurers not to provide information about abortion coverage until “the time of enrollment”—the point when you actually make your first payment. Shoppers have to buy their plan to find out if abortion is in it.
This is particularly troubling because an individual who belatedly discovers after payment that their plan includes elective abortion will be forced to pay a separate fee—undisclosed to them in their bill and to be collected in a separate account—that can only be used to pay for others’ abortions. Only the most careful policy holders, who review every detail of every document, even after enrollment, might discover that they are even enrolled in an abortion-covering plan. But your taxpayer dollars are subsidizing these plans and your own plan may be personally collecting an additional fee from you—undisclosed on your bill—used expressly to pay for others’ abortions.
Three: Through State Exchanges
Third, the GAO confirmed that in five states—Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, and Hawaii—every Obamacare exchange plan includes elective abortion and thus collects a separate fee from every enrollee to pay for others’ elective abortions. Obamacare threatens substantial fines if the citizens of those states do not purchase a compliant health insurance plan, but to secure those plans and avoid those fines the citizens of these states must pay an undisclosed surcharge used to pay for others’ abortions.
Alliance Defending Freedom represents the Bracy family in Connecticut challenging this abortion surcharge mandate and its violation of their conscience. And we are interested in speaking with anyone else in these five states who have purchased or need to purchase an exchange plan and object to being forced to pay this abortion surcharge.
Planned Parenthood Makes Bank
The gross violations of conscience and the administrations’ false promises about this law aren’t the whole story.
All told, the taxpayer subsidies and the intentional confusion of abortion coverage in Obamacare plans, funding these dedicated abortion pools through abortion surcharges, stands to net Planned Parenthood substantial revenue. Planned Parenthood has positioned itself as the abortion industry leader, increasing its share of the total abortion market every year for the last three decades. It commits more than 330,000 abortions per year at an average of $468 per abortion for approximately $150 million in abortion revenues annually, 38 percent of its health center revenue.
Taxpayer subsidies and abortion surcharge pools are to Planned Parenthood what ethanol subsidies are to corn farmers or the Export-Import Bank is to Boeing. Add its half billion in annual taxpayer funding and you can begin to see why this billion dollar abortion giant would be so keenly interested in a healthcare law that we were told would not pay for abortions, and in the politicians who keep those revenues coming. In that light, the tens of millions it has spent in recent elections is a prudent business investment. Its friends and allies secure in power, they return the favor.
Planned Parenthood has bragged that it worked to “help shape and pass the Affordable Care Act.” The GAO report provides strong evidence that Planned Parenthood’s work was productive.

It’s Great” for In These Times and Hanna Rosin’s “Abortion is Great” for Slate, have generated a great deal of scorn from the pro-life community. The derision is appropriate; the “abortion as social good” argument cruelly sidesteps the humanity of the unborn. Yet, I’d like to argue, this emerging pro-choice strategy may be the best option they have.  Guard the Golden Forceps Imagine abortion politics as a giant game of capture the flag, but instead the pro-choice side is guarding a golden forceps. There’s a buffer around the forceps provided by a tall fence: Roe v. Wade. Pro-lifers have made different amounts of progress toward the target in different places: In a few places, they’ve largely abandoned the field; in many others, they’ve set up camp just outside the fence; and in the most weakly-defended regions, they’ve (arguably) established forward positions inside the buffer zone. Skirmishes are happening not off in the wilderness, but right at the Roe v. Wade frontier. In most places, though, skirmishes are happening not off in the wilderness, but right at the Roe v. Wade frontier. This is not what pro-choicers expected, let alone hoped for, in the wake of the discovery of a constitutional right to abortion. The “Supreme Court Settles Abortion Issue” New York Times headline is apocryphal, but the sentiment it expresses is not: Roe was supposed to remove abortion from the contentious realm of politics. That we now continue to dispute its borders is, to any pro-choicer with a proper sense of history, an acute disappointment. It’s not surprising there are people trying to scale the Roe fence. Surely the pro-choice movement expected the zealous always to be clamoring at the gates. What must be dispiriting to pro-choicers is not only how many now identify with the pro-life cause, but how indifferent the public is to their attempts to annex the Roe buffer zone. People Don’t Fight for a Necessary Evil The prospect of a pro-life movement constantly and fearlessly testing the limits of Roe is hateful to any serious pro-choicer who believes the right to abortion should be robust and uncontroversial. But this future is exactly what the defensive rhetoric of abortion as necessary evil promises. Average people will not be willing to push back the pro-life barbarians-at-the-gates in the name of a “necessary evil.” They need a more impressive banner to fly.  Now that almost everybody has seen an advanced ultrasound image, it can no longer be held by serious people that abortion does not end a life. This is a good time to pause to consider why so many people now identify as pro-life or, at the very least, are ambivalent about what Roe has wrought. There are many intertwining threads to this story, including of course the outstanding and tireless work of pro-life advocates, but for our purposes one stands out above the rest: the advancement of the technology of medical imaging. Several weeks ago my wife underwent an unscheduled ultrasound after a mild scare early in pregnancy. In a moment of great relief, at less than eight weeks we could see our second child’s heartbeat. As recently as my early college years less than a decade ago, students could with a straight face parrot the old lines about the unborn as “clumps of cells” or, worse, “more like a tumor than a person.” Now that almost everybody has seen an advanced ultrasound image, at least on television if not in person, it can no longer be held by serious people that abortion does not end a life. Any attempt to restore the Roe­-era unscientific view of unborn life would be an exercise in Big Lie-style propaganda that the pro-choice movement cannot realistically execute. The pro-choice movement can’t turn the clock back on science; it must instead work within the new reality that people widely understand that abortion ends a human life. The only move, then, that can possibly reverse pro-life gains is to roll the hard six: They must convince their fellow Americans that legal abortion is an outstanding social good that outweighs the lives of the unborn. This is the project of Pollitt, Doyle, and Rosin, and it represents the only hope for substantial pro-choice gains. People Are Willing to Do Evil in the Name of Social Good Before we scoff, remember this: It is a commonplace for people and societies to accept the manifestly unjust in the service of an apparently greater social good. And this isn’t just the result of Communism or Nazism or some other exotic –ism that is distant from us in place and time. In the early twentieth century, Americans accepted the forced sterilization of the “unfit” for the greater good of our society. In the early twenty-first century we accept the mass incarceration of the marginalized (including, until just a month ago in California, their sterilization) for just the same reason.  We indulge either in an unrealistically rosy vision of human nature or in a kind of conservative Whig history—in which the eugenic mindset happily fades from consciousness as part of human progress—if we think the “abortion as social good” gambit is doomed. As Michael Brendan Dougherty put it in The Week: All the ingredients still exist for a more explicit return to eugenics in our culture and politics: inequality, fear, detestation of the other. But if it comes back, it is unlikely to come in the explicitly racialist terms of the biodiversity-obsessed right. Liberal societies have the antibodies against that.
Instead, it will come to us in terms of ‘quality of life,’ and ‘health and safety.’ We will be urged that every child deserves the best society can grant, and stigmatize those for whom ‘the world is a difficult place.’ And thereby we legitimize the destruction of those who would merely “live” in society rather than thrive in it. As Dougherty points out, we would be foolish to forget the words of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that Roe was motivated at least in part by the desire to diminish “populations we don’t want to have too many of,” and more foolish still to forget that the recent runaway bestseller “Freakonomics” dabbled with the concept of abortion-as-crime-control. Pro-Choice Supporters Target the Moral High Ground Further, I have argued recently that innovations in the definition of marriage and assisted reproductive technologies are encouraging us to view children as the objects rather than the subjects of rights, as consumer goods rather than persons. The extension of the logic of the market to human persons themselves—especially the vulnerable and invisible (to the naked eye)—threatens to make their value and dignity contingent rather than inherent. The stage is set for sacrificing them for a greater good, whether that good is modern women’s lib or, more likely, delicately-phrased social hygiene. Our contempt must be ordered toward marginalizing the idea that the taking of innocent life can ever be justified by a greater good. So Pollitt and Doyle and Rosin are correct: The pro-choice movement’s best hope for total victory rather than perpetual stalemate is to attempt to reclaim the moral high ground—to assert without shame that legal abortion is necessary for essential social goods to flourish. Pro-lifers should react to this emerging strategy with contempt because it is contemptible. But it is contemptible primarily in its substance, not in its political wisdom. Our contempt must be ordered not just toward marginalizing particular commentators, but toward marginalizing the idea that the taking of innocent life can ever be justified by a greater good. This is not a new idea, and it is not unrealistic that it will catch on once again. Yes, “abortion as a social good” is a sign of increasing pro-choice desperation. But this may be the last chance for at least a generation to rally enough people to repel pro-lifers from the borders of Roe. As such, we must take it seriously and challenge it on its despicable merits, always making the case that has brought us to this siege of the golden forceps to begin with: All life is precious, its dignity inherent, its value incommensurable, its beauty unparalleled.

"211",211,"Left Using Illegal Immigrant To Push U.S.-Sponsored Abortions For Non-Citizens","Hawkins","Kristan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-10-18"," The story of a pregnant teenager, an illegal alien, has captured attention as the American Civil Liberties Union and abortion industry argue the United States should open its doors to all seeking abortion. Naturally, they believe that U.S. taxpayers ultimately should pay for it. At issue is whether the United States will expand its mission to ending the lives of preborn infants for all those who travel here illegally, whether the United States should become the home base of International Abortion Inc.  The Central American teen illegally entered the United States through Texas, where state officials placed her in a private facility contracted by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. According to reports, the girl said she sought an abortion because she was worried her parents might abuse her if they found out she was pregnant. Because Texas law requires either parental or judicial signoff for an underage girl seeking an abortion, attorneys intervened to get a judge’s permission. However, Texas officials refused to allow the girl to be taken from state care to an abortion facility. Instead, they arranged for the young girl to talk with pregnancy care center volunteers to let her know her options were more than the death of her unborn child. Do Foreigners Have a Right to U.S. Abortions? Courageously, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton weighed in on the case in an amicus brief, noting “(n)o federal court has ever declared that unlawfully-present aliens with no substantial ties to this country have a constitutional right to abortion on demand. The Court should decline to break that new ground.” The establishment of some of universal right to abortion would add a whole new income stream for the abortion industry and new taxpayer burden, even before we consider the morality of becoming a destination for worldwide abortion. Attorneys general of Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Carolina joined Paxton in opposing this unprecedented expansion of abortion.  Lost in this conflict is a discussion of how best to help this young girl. A real person behind the headlines needs care and guidance, not abortion. It’s a tragedy that the abortion industry will use this young girl to try and create a “safe haven” for abortion in the United States rather than trying to empower her future and the future of her unborn child. The ACLU is not only seizing on this opportunity to push for expanded abortion access, it also wants to add the girl to a current lawsuit against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, even though they are not the caretakers for the teenager. Faith-based organizations are, however, on the forefront of care for immigrants. Rather than embracing this long-term partnership between people of faith and immigrants in need, the ACLU wants to strip organizations like the Catholic bishops of federal funding for refugee and immigrant aid because they refuse to allow refugees and immigrants in their care to procure abortions due to church teaching on abortion. It is of course this respect for the dignity of human life that informs both the church’s role in resettling refugees and immigrants and its role in opposing abortion. The Ultimate Goal: An International Jane Roe Fundamentally, the ACLU and the lucrative abortion industry want to turn this teenager into an international Jane Roe, to create new court-mandated Roe v. Wade of sorts, requiring that U.S. taxpayers and governments facilitate the abortions of all who happen to be in the United States  ​Now, the billion-dollar abortion industry could donate their “services” or fundraise to pay for international abortions. Instead, their consistent push is to “show them the money.” While they are fundraising from this case, claiming some monies will go to the girl, in fact, a so-called “right” to abortion for illegal aliens will result in major bills for U.S. taxpayers on behalf of non-citizens. As Paxton wrote in his brief: “Granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction would create a right to abortion for anyone on Earth who entered the United States illegally, no matter how briefly. And with that right, countless others undoubtedly would follow.” There are many great reasons to immigrate to the United States, but abortion should not be one of them. Shame on the ACLU and abortion industry for putting the future of a teenager in a virtual tug-of-war in court as a ploy to get their hands on even more money.

"212",212,"How To Close Abortion Facilities From The Inside Out","Johnson","Abby",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-01-11"," When former abortion workers speak out in public about what they did in their clinics, what they saw happening, and the disrespect consistently shown women, hearts and mind change, and abortion facilities close.
The abortion facility in Texas where I worked for eight years closed after enough workers like me left. They closed because I finally spoke out against the terrible things I saw, the deceit I participated in, and the unsanitary practices common to many abortion facilities.
Forty-nine abortion facilities closed in 2017, according to a new report of an annual survey of abortion facilities. This is on top of the news that the Department of Justice has launched an investigation into Planned Parenthood’s illegal sales of baby body parts. According to a Rasmussen poll, 46 percent of voters support this investigation of the nation’s largest abortion provider.
Two of Planned Parenthood’s business partners have also closed after they were found to have illegally profited from the sale of body parts of aborted babies. They were fined an astounding $7.8 million.
These changes to the abortion industry are coming from the inside out. It’s my theory that one of the big reasons clinics have shut down—and will continue to shut down—is that former abortion workers have spoken out about their experiences in public and worked to testify against their former employers.
It was because of two former abortion workers that Planned Parenthood in Delaware was temporarily shut down. The women went to authorities with evidence of dirty equipment and “bloody drainage” left on operating tables between women having abortions. It was disgusting.
Earlier this year, I released several inspection reports from Whole Woman’s Health abortion clinic, which operates facilities in Texas, Maryland, Minnesota, and Illinois. Their name is on the U.S. Supreme Court case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, which exempts abortion facilities from conforming to commonsense medical guidelines like other outpatient facilities must adhere to.
Why did they bring their case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court? Because their abortion facilities would have closed otherwise, since they had been cited for things like failing to properly disinfect and sterilize instruments that were used from woman to woman and failure to provide a safe and sanitary environment. Products of conception were being examined and contaminated instruments were being washed in the same room, and rusty suction machines were likely to “cause infection.”
The testimony of former abortion workers can help persuade lawmakers to create fair laws that protect women from dirty abortion facilities. Their testimony can educate the public about what really happens behind the closed doors of Planned Parenthood. Their testimony can influence legislation and ultimately create a culture where abortion is unthinkable.
Since 2012, my ministry has helped more than 400 abortion workers leave their jobs. “Emotionally intense” is the mood my wonderful client managers experience daily, because they are helping workers who have seen terrible things and have reached a point where they cannot go back into their employers. We help these workers to find other jobs, to find healing, and if they desire, to tell their stories.
We believe this is how abortion facilities will ultimately close: because these workers’ stories will be heard, public opinion will change, and there will be no more workers left. Abortion will become unthinkable.

					

  Abby Johnson is a former Planned Parenthood manager who now runs And Then There Were None, which helps abortion workers leave their jobs. She is also the author of “Unplanned.”

"214",214,"Abortion Pills Are So Dangerous To Women, The FDA Should Yank Them From The Market","Rose","Lila",NA,"Aultman, Kathi",NA,NA,"2020-08-18"," Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the abortion pill Mifeprex in 2000, this lethal drug has been used to kill nearly 4 million American children and has resulted in at least 24 maternal deaths. Now, under the guise of mitigating exposure to COVID-19, the abortion lobby has successfully blocked the FDA from enforcing its minimal requirements designed to ensure that this drug does not also kill or injure the women who ingest it. The abortion industry wants these FDA requirements, called REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) permanently dropped. An Obama-appointed judge’s decision on July 13 to enjoin the FDA from enforcing REMS was a strategic step toward making the abortion pill available over the counter or online.  Unlike the “morning-after pill,” Mifeprex was designed with the singular purpose of killing a developing child after pregnancy has been confirmed. The abortion pill is used to cause a “chemical” or “medication” abortion and is taken under a regimen consisting of two FDA-approved drugs: mifepristone (Mifeprex) and misoprostol. Until recently, the use of misoprostol for abortion was considered “off-label.” How the Pill Works According to protocol, the pregnant woman first takes one 200-milligram tablet of Mifeprex orally. Mifeprex kills the developing child by blocking the critical pregnancy hormone progesterone. As the uterine lining degenerates from lack of progesterone, the preborn child dies from lack of oxygen and other essential nutrients. If a woman changes her mind about going through with the abortion after taking Mifeprex, but prior to taking the misoprostol, she can take progesterone to counteract the effects of Mifeprex. Time is of the essence in these cases to save the baby’s life. A recent study of babies rescued by this method found no increase in birth defects. If the woman seeks to complete the abortion-pill regimen, she will take four 200-milligram tablets of misoprostol buccally (placed in her cheek), 24 to 48 hours after taking Mifeprex. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin designed to treat stomach ulcers.  It is used to cause uterine cramping and contractions, artificially inducing labor and heavy bleeding to expel the child from her body. Misoprostol thus induces symptoms normally associated with miscarriage. Any experienced OB/GYN can attest to the life-threatening bleeding and other complications associated with miscarriage. The FDA permits the abortion pill’s use during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, extended from seven weeks by the Obama administration in 2016. A baby grows rapidly in the first 10 weeks. The human heartbeat can first be detected about three weeks after fertilization. In the following weeks, eyes develop and brain activity can be recorded. By 10 weeks of gestation, the embryo is an inch and a quarter long, all vital organs are in place, and teeth begin to harden and connect to the jawbone. This Drug Is Deadly The normal side-effects of this abortion pill range from serious to deadly. Heavy bleeding can turn into hemorrhaging, which can be fatal. A woman can also retain parts of her baby or placenta after the abortion process, causing serious or fatal infections. Holly Patterson had just turned 18 when she took Mifeprex. Four days into her abortion process, Holly called the abortion facility that administered the drugs, complaining of severe pain. She was told to take a painkiller and go to the emergency department if her symptoms worsened — and they did.  At the emergency department, doctors gave her narcotic pain medication and sent her home, where her pain continued. Seven days into the abortion process, Holly went back to the hospital, where she died of Clostridium sordellii toxic shock syndrome. This drug is so dangerous that the REMS only permits it to be dispensed in “healthcare settings” such as “clinics, medical offices, and hospitals.” Prescribers must be approved after signing a Prescriber Agreement guaranteeing they are capable of accurately dating the pregnancy and diagnosing dangerous ectopic pregnancies. Prescribers must further agree to provide or arrange for “surgical intervention” in case of failure or complications. The REMS also requires that each woman sign a Patient Agreement and receive extensive written disclosures about the drug regimen’s side-effects. The woman must attest: “If I need a surgical procedure because the medicines did not end my pregnancy or to stop heavy bleeding, my healthcare provider has told me whether they will do the procedure or refer me to another healthcare provider who will.” Pull the Pill from Market Given the quantity and nature of the adverse events reported to the FDA since 2000, it is unconscionable that the FDA has not pulled Mifeprex off the market. The abortion lobby now seeks to expand access to this lethal drug by using the federal courts, and convincing judges with no medical training to circumvent the FDA’s oversight. Prescribing the abortion pill entirely by telemedicine poses additional health risks to women. First, life-threatening ectopic pregnancies will surely be missed. Second, there will be no way to confirm a woman’s pregnancy dates unless a pelvic ultrasound is ordered, which defeats the purpose of allowing these drugs to be prescribed by telemedicine in the first place. Women are often wrong about their dates, and without the requirement for an in-person exam or ultrasound, women may inadvertently — or purposefully — request this regimen beyond 10 weeks of pregnancy. Taking this regimen beyond 10 weeks can result in disastrous consequences for women and their babies. The abortion pill is explicitly designed and prescribed to destroy preborn children and thus will never be “safe” for women or the preborn children it is designed to kill. In the abortion industry’s ruthless pursuit of profit, it treats the lives of millions of unborn babies and dozens of women as collateral damage. The abortion industry will not take its foot off the accelerator voluntarily. We insist the FDA exercise its authority to classify the abortion pill as an “imminent hazard to the public health” that poses a “significant threat of danger” and remove this lethal drug from the U.S. market.

"215",215,"Is Planned Parenthood Illegally Performing Partial-Birth Abortions, Or Did It Lie?","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-10-29"," When the Supreme Court upheld the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2007, abortionists who had been insisting partial-birth abortions were necessary to protect women’s health instantly stopped doing them. At least, that’s what we are supposed to believe. But the recent videos released by the Center for Medical Progress indicate that Planned Parenthood abortionists, at least, may still be engaging in this horrific practice of partially delivering and destroying an unborn child—specifically for the purpose of obtaining human organs for sale. That would be illegal. The real alternative to Planned Parenthood having violated the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act (PBABA), however, isn’t that Planned Parenthood is blameless. It’s that Planned Parenthood and its allies in the abortion industry lied to the public and to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Lying to the Supreme Court In fall 2006, the Supreme Court considered PBABA’s constitutionality. The law lacked any “health” exception, but exempts the mythical case in which a partial-birth abortion is necessary to save the mother’s life. Congress heard evidence and determined there were no cases where partial-birth abortion was medically necessary. It also knew abortionists would turn any “health” exception into an unlimited partial-birth abortion license. Abortionists argued that approximately 2,200 partial-birth abortions per year (roughly six per day) were necessary—that particular method—for health reasons. That’s a small fraction of the more than 1 million abortions performed annually (nearly 3,000 per day). But the abortion industry fought to maintain this particularly gruesome method, insisting it was a medically necessary “last resort.” But in April 2007 the Supreme Court held in Gonzales v. Carhart that the law was facially constitutional. The 5-4 decision allowed the restriction on this particularly gruesome abortion method to go into effect. Let’s assume the rhetoric of Planned Parenthood and its allies is true, that another abortion method could not be used in those cases. That would mean the PBABA has prevented nearly 19,000 of the most gruesome and dehumanizing abortions since the Supreme Court upheld it. Are Partial-Birth Abortions Ever Necessary? But there was a catch in the Supreme Court’s decision. The court called the abortion industry’s bluff. It invited any abortionist or woman to show a court why this partial-birth abortion method really was necessary (as claimed) in one of those 2,200-per-year instances and thereby obtain an injunction against the law, allowing a partial-birth abortion in that situation. Justice Ginsburg wrote in dissent:  If there is anything at all redemptive to be said of today’s opinion, it is that the Court is not willing to foreclose entirely a constitutional challenge to the Act. ‘The Act is open,’ the Court states, ‘to a proper as-applied challenge in a discrete case.’ … One may anticipate that such a preenforcement challenge will be mounted swiftly, to ward off serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women whose health would be endangered by the intact D&E prohibition. Indeed. If those asserted harms to women’s health were based in reality one might expect that either the same plaintiffs in the Gonzales case and its companions or others would have sought such an injunction. Eight years later, no such complaint has ever been filed by any plaintiff. More Third Amendment complaints have been filed in that same eight-year period than the partial-birth-abortion ban challenges the court invited. I have previously argued there are only three possible reasons why these anticipated as-applied challenges have never materialized. (1) By incredible fortune, the threats to women’s health that formerly made partial-birth abortion necessary ceased on April 18, 2007. That’s the cessationist argument. (2) Women are harmed by their lack of available partial-birth abortion, just as abortionists warned, but Planned Parenthood and its allies lack the resources to file the invited lawsuits. This is unlikely, given Planned Parenthood’s litigious nature and its $765 million in excess revenues over the last decade. Or (3) the claim that partial-birth abortions were necessary to protect women’s health was a lie. There is reason to buy stock in the “lie” thesis. The Fourth Option: Breaking the Law But I may have overlooked a fourth option. The Center for Medical Progress videos force us to consider the possibility that Planned Parenthood and others in the abortion industry have never sought an as-applied exemption from PBABA because it’s easier just to violate that law. Another Planned Parenthood abortionist in Texas describes a method that sounds very much like the definition of a partial-birth abortion. In earlier videos, Planned Parenthood senior executives indicated a willingness to change abortion methods in ways that sounded very much like partial-birth abortions to obtain the human organs they wanted. Planned Parenthood Senior Medical Director Deborah Nucatola even said PBABA was “up to interpretation,” and that some abortionists would use a certain protocol to ensure it wouldn’t appear they had intended a partial-birth abortion. In the most recent video, another Planned Parenthood abortionist in Texas describes converting 18- to 20-week pregnancies to breech in order to obtain better organ samples, in a method that sounds very much like the definition of a partial-birth abortion.  As investigations of Planned Parenthood continue, Congress and states should be particularly attentive to the possibility that Planned Parenthood is regularly violating the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Even if proof of those violations is elusive, we still deserve answers about whether Planned Parenthood and its allies lied to the courts and the public in arguing against the law. If Planned Parenthood and other abortion businesses suddenly stopped using the partial-birth abortion method in 2007 despite telling courts and the public this method was necessary for women’s health, where are their actual examples of harm to women? Were they lying then, or are they violating the law now?

"216",216,"Propagandizing Abortion To Kids Only Embarrasses Abortion Supporters","Dyer","Patrick",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-01-07"," Open dialogue is everything in society. It spotlights issues our nation can’t come to terms with, and is necessary to move forward. But how can we really progress on certain issues like abortion when the conversation gets muddled? That’s something I pondered when I came across a video this week with Amelia Bonow, activist and co-founder of #ShoutYourAbortion. After Congress reconsidered Planned Parenthood’s federal funding in 2015, Bonow took to Facebook to publicly share her experience of having an abortion, sparking the #ShoutYourAbortion movement almost immediately. From dozens of online posts to a recent book, #ShoutYourAbortion has now fully entered the public arena of dialogue.  Yet while its professed goal is to eliminate all stigmas around all abortions, and while we should have transparency about this topic, it’s difficult not to sense something else brewing beneath the surface. Last week, the YouTube channel HiHo Kids published a video called “Kids Meet Someone Who’s Had an Abortion,” in which Bonow speaks openly about her abortion to a group of kids. I’m not against young people openly discussing or debating difficult topics. That kind of exposure could be good for them if handled in the right way, but that’s not what this video sets out to do. On the surface, it’s easy to call this video propaganda, so I will. “Kids Meet Someone Who’s Had an Abortion” is shameless propaganda for the pro-abortion crowd. As Bonow talks about how she had an abortion because her partner decided not to wear a condom, the kids simply listen, ask her questions, and give her their full support. One boy (wearing a bowtie) at least gives more thoughtful responses instead of completely agreeing with Bonow. When she asks if he thinks abortion is wrong, the boy replies, “If you’re being reckless.” Bonow’s counter-argument? “I just don’t agree.”  Cut to the next kid, who praises her. Later on, one of the girls calls the all-caps ABORTION tattoo on Bonow’s bottom lip “rad.” It doesn’t stop there. Bonow then describes her abortion as “suck[ing] the pregnancy out” and feeling “relieved” when she was no longer pregnant. Upon first viewing, I saw this as a disturbing display of an adult’s complete abdication of personal responsibility and an even more disturbing showcase of apathy. To say nothing about how Bonow and HiHo Kids use children as tools for pro-abortion propaganda, Bonow’s language and attitude surrounding this issue are infantile. She co-founded an entire social media movement designed explicitly to bring abortion into a more serious light in our national discourse and simultaneously compares the procedure to being at “a crappy dentist appointment.” Isn’t that what cheapens the debate? If you believe so strongly in bringing women’s stories to the forefront, why would you treat your own experience with such childishness? It’s attitudes like this that make the dialogue about abortion so difficult to have in the first place. Say whatever you want about the pro-life side, but pro-lifers at the very least treat abortion with the significance it needs. How you lead a movement is just as important as the movement itself.  When I re-watched the video, however, it revealed in a brief moment (most likely unintentionally) the core issue with the #ShoutYourAbortion movement. About halfway through, one of the girls says Bonow’s decision is ultimately “up to [her],” to which Bonow replies, “I feel supported by that.” Now, you would think that someone who is apparently proud of having an abortion wouldn’t need the vocal support of a random child, so why does she desperately seek for it here? #ShoutYourAbortion is not really about ending the public shaming of women who’ve had abortions. It’s not about what’s the right legislation about women’s reproductive rights. It’s not even about confronting a topic people are too afraid to confront. It’s about women seeking validation for a choice they can’t reconcile with, and Bonow is the perfect representation of that. She retreats into detachment and immaturity because she can’t face the reality of her situation. #ShoutYourAbortion is not a spotlight for a much-needed conversation but a mask for much deeper problems. Now, cards on the table, I don’t believe government should have a role in the cycle of reproduction, meaning I don’t believe we should criminalize women for having abortions, nor should we subsidize them. Giving the state any control over reproduction is a power we shouldn’t be willing to hand over. In fact, I’ll also say that #ShoutYourAbortion does deserve some credit for providing a platform to women who’ve had abortions in emergency situations like rape or threats to the life of the mother. Those women should be heard first. But regardless of my own opinions, it’s disheartening how our culture continuously refuses to treat the topic of abortion with the seriousness it needs. The tragedy of #ShoutYourAbortion is that it only perpetuates that problem. Abortion is not a tattoo to show off to your friends. It’s not a flag to wave around with pride. It’s certainly never a choice made lightly. Abortion, no matter the reason, is a tragedy, and despite what Bonow claimed in her original Facebook post, tragedies don’t make you “happy.” That’s what really deserves the spotlight.

In a final vote on Feb. 23, Republican delegates voted down a rule change to resurrect the radical “Right to Abortion” Amendment, proposed by House Democrats earlier in the 2023 session. 



The amendment would have sanctioned the killing of the unborn in the Virginia Constitution, legalized abortion up to and during birth, made possible taxpayer-funded abortion, and inhibited the passage of future laws to protect the unborn.



The amendment itself never mentions abortion or women at all, instead defining a “fundamental right to reproductive freedom” as being inherent in every “individual.”



As seen in a candid 2022 Senate bill, however, the amendment would have legalized disturbing procedures to kill and extract a full-term baby from a woman’s body. These techniques include “electrical vacuum aspiration,” “intact dilation and extraction” (or partial-birth abortion), and “intrafetal injection” of poisonous chemicals.



That bill would have given abortionists license to choose an alternative method of killing through a provision of “Method not listed” with almost no limitations. The so-called Right to Abortion Amendment would have made unborn babies vulnerable to these assaults up until birth. Advocates made no apologies for their gruesome stance. 



It was a week of “hysteria, manipulation and lies,” said Virginia Society for Human Life President Olivia Gans-Turner.



Democrat delegates declared that Republicans supported the death of mothers by removing access to abortion on demand. They claimed Republicans wanted to enter a woman’s “bedroom” by enacting laws to protect unborn babies.



Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, testified that Republicans sought to “control” women’s bodies. 



Meanwhile, Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, referred to the pro-abortion argument as “manipulative and misleading” because it aims “to hide just how extreme this [amendment] proposal is.” In her Feb. 22 testimony, she noted the “offensive” testimony from Democrats who favored the amendment. They consistently refused to use the word “baby” in making their arguments, and “infant, child, and mother haven’t received much notice either,” she said.



“Let us be honest and direct about exactly what this proposed amendment to our constitution would do,” Byron said: 




It would remove all restrictions on abortion including the parental notification requirement and prohibitions on taxpayer funded abortions. It would allow abortion on demand up to and including the moment of birth. That makes it violently more extreme than Roe, which at least acknowledged the child was entitled to protections in the third trimester of pregnancy. The amendment being offered offers no such protections. That is the most extreme position on abortion anyone can take.




Republicans on the House Courts of Justice Subcommittee killed the amendment on Feb. 17in a partisan 5-3 vote, but pro-abortion delegates attempted to force a second vote on the legislation by a rule change, which would have brought back the amendment that failed to clear committee earlier in the session.



Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, organized the required five days of testimony to bring the amendment to a second vote on the floor before the session came to a close. Republicans stopped the rule change, eliminating the possibility of a new vote on the amendment in a 50-45 vote along party lines.



Limitless Abortion



Current Virginia law prohibits abortion in the third trimester with limited exceptions. According to a recent poll by The Wason Center, most Virginians do not want women and the unborn to suffer more abortions.



But Democrats continue to unabashedly argue for increased, nearly limitless abortion in the commonwealth. And they are not primarily concerned with the health of mothers, as shown in their effort to discard human rights laws for abortion survivors. During the 2023 regular session, Democrats also voted down bills to provide for the publication of a free, informational website that would list assistance options for mothers and require doctors to obtain written, informed consent from a woman before an abortion.



Elections and the Future of Abortion



In Virginia, two successive General Assemblies, with House elections between them, must pass a constitutional amendment for it to go to the voters as a ballot referendum. In Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont, right-to-abortion amendments to the states’ constitutions have blocked or stripped pro-life legislation, Gans-Turner said.



“This is a hive mentality, and it is deadly,” Gans-Turner said. “The only successful way for us to block it is to ensure we have a strong pro-life majority in both chambers.” 



This November, all 140 seats in the Virginia legislature will be up for a vote. 



“Pro-abortion proponents in the legislature this session reminded us how important it is to have in place at least leadership who respects human life,” said Del. Dave LaRock, R-Loudoun. “The general public does not agree with very late-term abortion, but if voters don’t get in the game we will be ruled by people who make decisions that are not reflective of our people

"218",218,"Magazines Like Teen Vogue Hard-Sell Abortion To Fill The Pockets Of Big Companies","Ellen Browder","Sue",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-02-28"," When I watched this powerful video by an independent-minded high school girl named Autumn, I longed to reach across our digital divide and give her a great big hug. She is 16. I am old enough to be her grandmother. Yet when it comes to women’s issues, she and I think alike. In a well-reasoned, passionate appeal for justice, Autumn protests an offensive article recently published by Teen Vogue titled “What to Get a Friend Post-Abortion.” Among the gifts suggested to brighten a post-abortive friend’s day are an “F-U-terus pin,” a Ruth Bader Ginsburg coloring book and a “Girl Power” hat.  “Girl power hat!” Autumn snaps with obvious disdain. “Is this really the time for that? I just ended my baby’s life. Girl power! Are they insinuating that girls who celebrate their abortions understand girl power more than girls who regret them or refuse to have them…To me, abortion seems like the opposite of girl power. It is the most invasive and degrading thing that could happen to a girl. My version of girl power is knowing that I am valuable and precious.” In short, Autumn implies that under the pretext of “empowering” girls, Teen Vogue is, in fact, doing the exact opposite and enslaving post-abortive girls to their pain and their sexually destructive lifestyles. Addressing the magazine, Autumn boldly declares, “Teen Vogue, you should be held accountable for this disgusting and disrespectful article. You trivialize an issue that leaves millions of women struggling every day. Such a blasé approach hurts women who regret their abortions. It minimizes their pain.” Young Feminists, Just Like the Old Feminists Autumn’s disgust with Teen Vogue’s slick editorial content and her passion to correct this injustice remind me very much of words spoken by “Feminist Mystique” author Betty Friedan nearly 50 years ago when she called for feminists of my generation to boycott Cosmopolitan magazine. In the Women’s Strike for Equality on August 26, 1970, Betty urged women across the nation to boycott magazines whose advertising and editorial content were degrading to women and named Cosmopolitan as one of the worst offenders. Although Cosmo’s editor in chief then, Helen Gurley Brown, would have loved for her sex-revolution magazine to be seen as part of the feminist movement, Betty called Cosmo “quite obscene and quite horrible.” As the widely proclaimed “mother of the modern women’s movement,” Betty hoped to broaden and deepen women’s lives. Cosmopolitan’s shallow sex-revolution philosophy narrowed women’s lives to what Betty called “an immature teenage-level sexual fantasy,” promoting “the idea that woman is nothing but a sex object…and there is nothing in life but bed, bed, bed.”  Decrying any view of sexual “freedom” that turns a woman into a sex object as a false freedom that denies a woman’s full personhood, Betty said Cosmopolitan’s editorial content demonstrated “nothing but contempt for women.” Women’s Mags in Cahoots to Push Abortion When they’re purveyors of lifestyles that degrade women, women’s magazines were barriers to women’s true freedom in 1970, and they’re still barriers to women’s freedom today. Unfortunately, the pro-abortion bias Autumn detests in Teen Vogue extends far beyond that particular magazine. Many women’s magazines are in cahoots to promote abortion to women, and they have been for decades. In 1986, when legal abortion was under heavy attack and I was still freelancing for Cosmo, Gurley Brown sent out a slew of invitations to women’s magazine editors inviting them to have lunch with her and Kate Michelman, then the executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League (now NARAL Pro-Choice America). According to Helen’s biographer Jennifer Scanlon, editors came to the meeting from Good Housekeeping, Redbook, Harper’s, Elle, Savvy, Family Circle, Ladies’ Home Journal, Glamour, Self, Parents, and the now-defunct New Woman (where I was a contributing editor). Ms. and Mademoiselle also sent representatives. Helen spoke at the meeting, and the editors agreed to run pro-abortion articles in their March 1987 issues. Among the articles that appeared in Cosmopolitan that month were: “Abortion: Your Right Under Attack,” “Choice: Separating Myth from Fact,” “My Illegal Abortion,” and an article on why eight famous women were pro-choice.  So let’s plainly state exactly what happened here. Editors from at least a dozen powerful women’s magazines—a virtual army of opinion makers—got together for lunch one day in New York City and colluded to solicit and publish articles designed to hard-sell abortion to American women. Was this a form of free speech in action, an example of independent journalists honestly trying to serve women’s best interests and the public’s right to know? No. It was a deliberate attempt by a handful of elite women to shape political policy in our democracy—not through a free, open exchange of ideas, but through what amounted to a carefully crafted pro-abortion propaganda campaign. The Spin Sisters Haven’t Stopped That was in 1987. In the 1990s, while I was a contributing editor at New Woman magazine, I wrote a number of pro-abortion articles (but, of course, no anti-abortion stories). One was a scathing attack on the appointment of conservative, pro-life U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Another was an excerpt from a book I worked on, warning women that their “right to choose” was in serious jeopardy. A third was a heart-wrenching but favorable story about a Michigan woman who, after infertility treatment, found herself pregnant with six babies and aborted three. In 2003, Myrna Blyth, who was editor-in-chief of Ladies’ Home Journal from 1981 to 2002, wrote a book exposing those women she called the “Spin Sisters,” whom she described as “members of the female elite media, a Girls’ Club of editors, producers, print and television journalists with similar attitudes and opinions who influence the way millions of American women think and feel about their lives, their world, and themselves.” Blyth described abortion as “the binding pledge of their sorority,” the one issue “on which there can never be any equivocation or discussion. Listening to them chatter at an editorial meeting or over cocktails, one learns that, according to these experienced politicians, abortion is unquestionably the most important issue for all women in America…To keep the support of the Spin Sisters, politicians may not stray even a hair from the Planned Parenthood position, and probably neither can the writer in the cubicle next door…” As one of those writers (not in a cubicle but freelancing from home), I know she was right. If anything, since the presidential election women’s magazine editors are even more determined to sell abortion to women and girls. After Students for Life of America posted Autumn’s video testimony online, NewsBusters checked out Teen Vogue to see how many other times the magazine had promoted abortion. The results were astonishing. NewsBusters found that Teen Vogue has promoted abortion to teens a whopping 63 times in 2017 alone. Yes, you read that right: 63 times in less than two months. Follow the Big Money But who’s behind all this? One the one hand, a kind of blind “group think” is responsible. I know because I was once one of the blind. But, on the other hand, let’s be frank: it’s the advertisers. If you think powerful, multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical companies have no control over magazines’ editorial content, think again. If you think powerful, multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical companies have no control over magazines’ editorial content, think again. In 1969 (the year after I graduated from journalism school), feminist Barbara Seaman published “The Doctors’ Case Against the Pill,” in which she documented more than 50 potential side effects of the birth-control pill, from blood clots and breast cancer to irritability and depression. Seaman’s revelations sparked a U.S. Senate hearing, in which angry, disruptive young women repeatedly demanded to know why female patients weren’t testifying and why there was no pill for men. As a result of the hearings, drug companies were forced to place a health warning on oral contraceptives, the first information insert on any prescription drug. Seaman, a freelance writer, was subsequently blacklisted from women’s magazines by powerful pharmaceutical companies, which refused to advertise in publications that carried her articles. Magazines that would reportedly no longer publish Seaman’s work included Ladies’ Home Journal, Family Circle, Omni, and Hadassah. Such is the power of advertising dollars. Why are marketers of magazines that target young women so pro-abortion and so anti-motherhood? Think about it for a while, and you’ll figure it out. If a woman has a baby and begins to find her happiness in love for another—in other words, if she becomes less anxiously self-absorbed—she’ll be less likely to buy all those cosmetics, hair products, beautiful clothes, exotic vacations, contraceptives, abortion pills, and other products that keep women’s magazines in business. A lonely, insecure, unhappy woman who’s restlessly searching for love can be a voracious, impulsive consumer, eager to buy many products in a frantic-but-futile attempt to fill the emptiness she feels inside. You can’t sell the joyful bond of love between a mother and her baby the way you can sell deodorant. So what should feminists of goodwill do who want stop all this? We need to take a lesson from the history books and hit exploitive magazines like Teen Vogue where it will hurt them the most: in their pocketbooks. Tell friends to cancel their subscriptions. Spread the word about their editorial practices through Facebook and Twitter. Send this article and Autumn’s video to every woman you know. Damage their bottom line. That’s the only way we’ll be able to stop women’s magazines like Teen Vogue from trying to deceive other 16-year-old girls who aren’t as free and clear-sighted as Autumn.

"219",219,"The Washington Post Just Proved Abby Johnson’s Point On Abortion As A ‘Horror Show’","Osburn","Madeline",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-08-27"," After former Planned Parenthood employee Abby Johnson spoke the truth about the abortion industry at the Republican National Convention Tuesday night, corporate media immediately went into attack mode, setting out to poke holes in her speech, all while affirming the message Johnson intended to send: The only way to defend abortion is to deny it.
The story Johnson shared on the RNC stage was one of denial, and how she ignored the reality of abortion until she witnessed it for herself. Only after seeing what violence in the womb really looks like, even smells like, Johnson said, did she realize what she had been a part of.
“For most people who consider themselves pro-life, abortion is abstract. They can’t conceive of the barbarity,” Johnson said. “For me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like, what it smells like. I’ve been the perpetrator … to these babies … to these women.”
The next day, Washington Post Style Columnist Monica Hesse set out to disprove Johnson’s claims, only to illustrate them perfectly. “As a reporter covering women’s health care, I’ve witnessed at least 20. My friends have had them,” Hesse writes, laying out her abortion bona fides. She says Johnson had to use “dramatic terms” to tell her story, and could only “describe abortion as a horror show because the alternative would have been too banal to achieve the effect she desired.”
If Johnson’s description of an abortion procedure seemed “dramatic” or akin to a “horror show,” that’s because that’s what an abortion is. The reality is, abortion is a violent act. It ends in the loss of life. To describe it as “banal,” as Hesse does, is more of an exaggeration or a misrepresentation than any of the rhetoric Johnson used.
Hesse continues:
As for one of her other seemingly horrifying claims, that doctors piece together fetal remains to make sure the abortion is complete — that’s true. But it’s not some ghoulish jigsaw puzzle done on a lark. It’s because an incomplete abortion could be dangerous to a patient’s health, and abortion doctors care about women’s lives.
Johnson didn’t have to describe a routine part of the abortion procedure as a “ghoulish jigsaw puzzle,” to conjure up that image in mind of her audience. Hesse came up with that image herself after hearing Johnson laying out the facts. Johnson was simply describing what Planned Parenthood locations call “Products of Conception” rooms, “where infant corpses are pieced back together to ensure no extra body parts remain in the mothers.” That may be a horrifying statement to many, but it’s not a dramatization of what happens during an abortion. It’s reality, as Hesse even admits herself.
The bigger problem for Hesse, and for other media outlets who rushed to run pro-abortion interference with their fact checks, is that their euphemisms of “women’s rights” and “reproductive justice” appear thin and feeble when the pro-life argument is spelled out like it was in Johnson’s speech. What does one say to dispute the description of “an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction”?
Even feminist and abortion advocate Camille Paglia admits, “the pro-life position, whether or not it is based on religious orthodoxy, is more ethically highly evolved than my own tenet of unconstrained access to abortion on demand,” adding that “pro-choice Democrats have been arguing from cold expedience, they have thus far been unable to make an effective ethical case for the right to abortion.”
So instead of trying to make an honest, ethical case for the right to abortion, they deny facts about what an abortion really is. Just like Johnson did, until she couldn’t.

"220",220,"The Reason Democrats Voted Against Care For Babies Who Survive Abortion Is Worse Than You Think","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-03-08"," Conservative commentator and pro-life advocate Ben Shapiro said, in a recent podcast episode, that he’s stumped about why Democrats voted overwhelmingly against passage of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. “I’ve literally been trying all night and this morning…I’ve been trying to find why exactly Democrats object to this bill,” he said. “What in the world does women’s health have to do with a baby that’s born alive?” he asked with regard to Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s tweet on the bill. “That’s fully crazy.”  Shapiro’s focus is on how propaganda from abortion advocates doesn’t match up with reality. While this is important to point out, he seems to be taking them at their word, as if what they say is what they truly believe. But this arc of thought will fly right over the truth, because abortion propaganda was always meant to obscure the reality of abortion, not justify it. All Abortions Are Elective To get to the real rationale behind the abortion entitlement, one must first consider the fact that there is legitimately no medical reason, ever, to have an abortion. There are reasons to separate the baby from the mother through early delivery, and those early deliveries sometimes result in the baby’s death, but “women’s health” is never a legitimate medical reason to deliberately kill a preborn baby. This means all abortions are elective. All of them. As I wrote recently at The Federalist: [The abortion entitlement] was never about a woman’s right to ‘choose what to do with her own body,’ or even about her ability to use lethal force against an ‘intruder’ in her body. As Zupan noted, ‘If this was about bodily autonomy there’d be some concern about viable babies.’ Yet there is zero distinction under Vermont law between a 6-week post-conception baby and a 40-week post-conception baby.
…The resistance of Democrats to the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, as well as Virginia Gov. Northam’s now-infamous comments about would-be aborted babies born alive, is further evidence that ‘the party of science’ wants to guarantee women the right to kill their own children simply because they are unwanted, not that they want to guarantee their access to ‘health care.’ Abortion is a pregnant woman employing lethal means to terminate her responsibilities as a mother. It is not an effort to protect “women’s autonomy” or “women’s health.” This is the entitlement leftists are cowing the rest of their party into supporting unconditionally.  Again, if a mother is dangerously ill because of her pregnancy, the baby can be delivered. If a mother can’t bear the responsibility of parenting, she can carry her baby to term then allow her to be adopted. Gestating a baby is not a violation of autonomy, but a natural possible outcome of sex, an act between autonomous and consenting individuals. The only time one can say pregnancy violates autonomy is if a woman becomes pregnant by rape––but even then, the child is innocent in the matter. As a human being, he is endowed by his Creator with a right to not be murdered, and that natural right supersedes the loss of autonomy for nine months. Moreover, abortions in cases of rape are estimated to constitute about 0.54 percent of all abortions and can’t be used to justify the other 99.46 percent of abortions that leftists staunchly support. Given that the standard pro-abortion propaganda bears maybe a 0.5 percent resemblance to reality, why did Democrats vote overwhelmingly against a bill that would require infants born alive after abortion to be treated as any other infant born at that gestational age? Because abortion is the right to destroy one’s own child, and if a woman chose to kill her baby, to the left it would seem a violation of her so-called right to choose for doctors to try to save that baby. Further evidence that this is the real reason can be found in the left’s growing fear of artificial womb technology, which may at some point in the future push back significantly viability outside the natural womb. “My body, my choice,” or the right to not be a “gestational parent,” would no longer automatically conflated with the right to not be “a legal or genetic parent.”  The facade is crumbling, and abortion advocates worry the public might realize that abortion and infanticide are essentially the same. After all, the “magic birth canal” was never a serious belief among true believers in the abortion entitlement. As one newspaper editor said years ago when rebuking a reporter for stating that late-term abortionists “crush skulls and bones,” “As far as I’m concerned, until that thing is born, it is really no different from a kidney; it is part of the woman’s body.” To speak accurately and precisely about what happens in late-term abortions, he said, “is really to distort the issue.” The Tacit Endorsement of Infanticide Make no mistake: getting hung up on what is clearly dissemblance is exactly what spins non-leftists in circles when confronted with the tacit endorsement of infanticide. The left has, until recently, largely upheld this false distinction between a baby in the womb and a baby in the open air to make others more comfortable with the abortion agenda, to give some assurance beyond their word that legal abortion won’t lead to legal infanticide. If “the line” isn’t at birth, where does one draw it? Who can’t be killed? We swallowed this nasty bit of philosophizing and now its purveyors, or the ideological offspring of its purveyors, are shamelessly going back on their word. If we cling to this distinction as if it were meant sincerely, we won’t be able to address our newly unveiled reality. I say “unveiled,” because the idea that unwanted children can be murdered or left to die is thousands of years old. Citizens of ancient Rome would leave an unwanted child out to die by exposure, but crude forms of abortion were in practice, too. They stemmed from the same wicked belief that a parent has the right to kill his offspring, whether due to deformity, uncertain paternity, or even because the child might have been more of a drain on the household than a help. The Twelve Tables of Roman Law contained the command that, “A dreadfully deformed child shall be quickly killed.” Aristotle wrote that, “As to exposing or rearing the children born, let there be a law that no deformed child shall be reared,” and the Stoic philosopher Seneca, too, thought that it was reasonable to drown “weakly” children. Leftists like Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, the Vermont state representatives who just passed the nation’s most permissive abortion law, or Sen. Patty Murray and the other Democrats who voted against protecting aborted infants born alive, are simply carrying on a millennia-long tradition of depriving children of their rights as human beings and image bearers of God. Here’s your answer, Shapiro: In the womb or out, the far left believes it’s the mother’s decision whether to allow her own child, her helpless and dependent flesh-and-blood offspring, to live. Expect to see more obstruction of protections for live infants, because Democrats don’t believe in their own propaganda. They believe something far, far more terrible.

"221",221,"What You Need To Know About Alabama’s New Abortion Ban","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-05-16"," If past media responses to abortion restrictions are any indication, you’re going to see a tremendous amount of misinformation about Alabama’s law that “bans abortion,” which the governor signed Wednesday. You can read House Bill 314 here for yourself. It is short and easy to understand, but here is a summary of the important points that are likely to be hotly contended on social media by people who don’t know what they’re talking about.  1. The Law Defines All Humans as Persons from Conception HB 314, or The Alabama Human Life Protection Act, defines all unborn children as persons. This differentiates it from Georgia’s LIFE Act, which would only afford legal protection to preborn babies whose heartbeat can be detected, usually around the gestational age of six weeks. UNBORN CHILD, CHILD or PERSON. A human being, specifically including an unborn child in utero at any stage of development, regardless of viability. 2. HB 314 Defines Most Conventional Abortions as Felonies HB 314 defines most abortions as class A felonies and attempted abortions as class C felonies. Section 6. (a) An abortion performed in violation of this act is a Class A felony.
(b) An attempted abortion performed in violation of this act is a Class C felony. 3. Many Exceptions Apply Despite banning most abortions from the moment of conception, many exceptions apply under which abortion would be legal, or cases in which the term abortion is defined to exclude certain types of pregnancy termination, such as ectopic pregnancies. These are standard exceptions made in almost all pro-life legislation. The only popular exception not included is the exception for rape and incest. Here are the exemptions.  Abortions women perform on themselves. Women are specifically exempted from prosecution. Section 5. No woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be criminally or civilly liable. One might object that since this statute is written as if an abortion were being performed on the woman by a third party, it must not exempt women from prosecution if they perform the abortion on themselves. However, that is not how courts have interpreted similar statutes in the past. Charges for women who shot themselves in the stomach to kill their preborn children in Florida, Georgia, and Virginia have all been overturned on this principle. Abortion in the case of serious physical risk to the mother. Such risk is defined as “a condition that so complicates her medical condition that it necessitates the termination of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function.” The risk must be attested to by a physician licensed in Alabama. Confirmation of “necessity” in emergency situations could be submitted up to 180 days after the abortion.  Serious mental illness. Abortion may be performed upon confirmation from a psychiatrist that the mother could engage in conduct “resulting in her death or the death of her unborn child.” A psychiatrist exercising “reasonable judgment” must diagnose “a serious mental illness,” and find that “a termination of her pregnancy is medically necessary to avoid the conduct.” (In other words, a medical professional may kill the preborn child…in order to prevent the woman from killing her preborn child. Wrap your head around that one.) No gestational limits are mentioned in the law with regard to any of the exceptions. However, AL Code § 26-22-3 (2013) governing abortions of viable unborn children states that, “No abortion shall be deemed authorized under this paragraph if performed on the basis of a claim or a diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which would result in her death or in substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” This suggests abortions under the mental health exception must be done before viability as long as that regulation is determined to not be “in conflict with or antagonistic to this act.” Termination of preborn babies with “lethal anomalies” (who will die before, during, or shortly after birth). The term [abortion] does not include a procedure or act…to terminate the pregnancy of a woman when the unborn child has a lethal anomaly. Removal of ectopic pregnancies. The term does not include a procedure or act to terminate the pregnancy of a woman with an ectopic pregnancy. Removal of a dead unborn child. The term does not include these activities if done with the intent to… remove a dead unborn child. Abortion as defined in HB 314 also excludes any efforts to “deliver the unborn child prematurely to avoid a serious health risk to the unborn child’s mother, or to preserve the health of her unborn child.” 4. The Law Depends on Overturning SCOTUS Precedent HB 314 is not a nullification law, meaning the state of Alabama will adhere to any court rulings striking down the whole law or parts of it. The law states, “If this act is challenged and enjoined pending a final judicial decision, the existing statutes and regulations that regulate or recognize abortion shall remain in effect during that time.” Given the virtual inevitability that any related court ruling will follow Roe/Casey/Doe precedents, this law is highly unlikely to ever take effect. The authors of the bill point to the “self-evident truth” that “all men are created equal,” as found in our Declaration of Independence, as evidence this law is moral and necessary. The bill was introduced, however, with the understanding that the pre-existing abortion ban in Alabama “has remained unenforceable as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and its progeny.” While media will play up outrage and controversy over “radical” state efforts to restrict legal abortion, the truth is that neither a ban from conception or a ban at the age of detectable fetal heartbeat, or anything remotely as restrictive, will take effect under the status quo. For abortion to be restricted to any significant extent, one of three things must happen: the Supreme Court must overturn its own abortion precedent, a constitutional amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states, or states must decide to nullify the Supreme Court’s ruling and adhere to the plain meaning of the U.S. Constitution, the supreme law of the land.

“If we’re going to ban abortion,” Mace said during the Fox interview, “what are we doing about” issues such as promoting access to birth control (which is a toxic group 1 carcinogen), improving the foster care system and adoption services, promoting women’s health care in rural areas, and restricting Americans’ Second Amendment rights. “There are a lot of things that we can do to protect life and not alienate the independent voter,” she added.



Here, Mace is repeating the textbook “pro-birth” talking point the left uses to accuse pro-lifers of only caring about people up until birth, just because conservatives don’t support leftist policies like expanding the welfare state. 



In parroting the “pro-birth” attack, both Democrats and Mace ignore the fundamental issue. While adoption and the foster care system are important, they are separate from abortion. Mace’s dislike of her colleagues’ stances on gun control does not invalidate the fact that abortion ends the lives of unborn children. It does not dismiss the reality that abortion relies heavily on evil dehumanization tactics used against, for example, black people during American slavery. 



Possible room for improvement on some of the issues Mace mentioned doesn’t change the fact that unborn children at 20 weeks of gestation have a heartbeat, brain waves, pain receptors, and functioning organs. Nor does it negate the need for change in the dozens of states that allow for abortion up to or even after 22 weeks (despite the youngest surviving preemie being born at 21 weeks) and the six states and the District of Columbia that allow a child to be aborted up until birth.



2. Suggesting Dobbs Wasn’t a Win 



“We have not learned our lesson from the midterm election. We went [from] mildly pro-choice to being a vast majority of voters being pro-choice after Roe v. Wade. It changed the entire electoral environment in ‘22,” said Mace, insinuating that the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision hurt Republicans. To be clear, the Dobbs v. Jackson decision is the biggest and most consequential victory conservatives have arguably ever had. Since the Dobbs decision, 5,377 unborn babies have been saved every month.



Moreover, there is no concrete evidence that abortion was the main factor for Republicans’ underwhelming midterms performance. As The Federalist’s John Davidson reported, “Republicans who didn’t shy away from talking about abortion after Dobbs, and who signed into law abortion legislation earlier this year without flinching or apologizing, did really well…” 



3. Making Exceptions to Life



“We need to find a middle ground on this issue,” said Mace during her “Fox News Sunday” interview, “and I have a great pro-life voting record, but some of the stances we take and especially when it comes to rape and incest, protecting the life of the mother, it’s so extreme that middle, independent voters, right of center, left of center, they cannot support us.”



Pro-lifers have proven time and time again that intentionally killing an unborn baby is never necessary when the life of the mother is threatened. And victims of rape and incest are only further victimized and traumatized by abortion. 



Abortion is responding to violence with violence, and instead of punishing the perpetrator, it punishes an innocent child. If Mace truly believed in the humanity of unborn children, she wouldn’t suggest that the circumstances of their conception invalidate their value and personhood. 



4. Trusting the FDA and Suggesting the Agency Ignore a Judge’s Ruling



Mace joined Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley in criticizing Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s ruling that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wrongfully approved the abortion pill. Mace encouraged the federal agency to ignore Kacsmaryk and she dismissed his decision because he’s an “unelected judge.” 



It’s unclear if Mace is aware that the FDA is made up of entirely unelected bureaucrats. It’s also puzzling why Mace is so confident in the FDA. Mace has publicly stated she was injured by the Covid vaccine, a drug which — like the abortion pill — had its approval expedited by the FDA.



As Kacsmaryk pointed out in his opinion, the FDA would only have been able to approve the abortion pill by falsely characterizing pregnancy as an “illness.” And for the last two decades, the FDA has been lifting restrictions on the lethal drug, which is responsible for a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits. 



5. Feeling ‘Attacked’ Because Pro-Lifers Are Holding Her Accountable 



Mace has not been very good at taking criticism. After the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America nonprofit called out Mace for her anti-life rhetoric and gave her a mediocre pro-life rating, she falsely accused the organization of criticizing her for her stance on birth control. 



“I find it ironic that Susan B. Anthony would attack me,” said Mace. “I’m a victim of rape, I advocate for women who have been raped, and that organization will no longer talk to my office about pro-life legislation because I’m talking about birth control. I mean, some of these groups have gotten so over the top and extreme.”



Mace’s public statements and mixed voting record, not her stance on birth control, are directly responsible for her B rating. SBA Pro-Life America provided details on how Mace voted against a handful of pro-life bills and the organization also condemned her anti-life abortion pill rhetoric. 



“Rep. Mace’s recent comments in favor of the FDA and their mailing of abortion pills directly to girls, without in-person doctor visits, are wildly out of step with the American people,” wrote E.V. Osment, vice president of communications for SBA Pro-Life America. “Americans do not believe the FDA’s claims that mail-order abortion drugs are safe. 63% of Americans oppose mail-order abortion pills, and by a double-digit margin, Americans disagree that the abortion pill has been vetted carefully enough to protect women’s health.”



“It is time for the FDA to be held accountable for fast-tracking a dangerous drug that harms women and girls as well as ending the lives of countless unborn children,” added Osment. “But they will never be held accountable if leaders like Mace encourage them to ignore the law and the science.”

"223",223,"On Abortion, Donald Trump Goes The Way Of Stephen A. Douglas","Daniel Davidson","John",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-04-11"," Former President Donald Trump declared this week that abortion should be left to the states, that there should be no federal abortion legislation because “this is all about the will of the people,” and “whatever they decide must be the law of the land.” He released a video stating his position on Monday and reiterated it later in the week.



By taking this stand, that abortion should not be a federal issue, Trump has not just betrayed his pro-life supporters but taken the side of Stephen A. Douglas over Abraham Lincoln. He has insisted that popular sovereignty, not moral principle, should decide the abortion question, just as Douglas insisted popular sovereignty in the new federal territories must decide the slavery question.



In practice, that means a patchwork of abortion laws across the country, at least for now, ranging from near-complete bans in some red states to unrestricted abortion until birth in some blue states. But it will not stay this way.



As Lincoln understood about slavery back in the 1850s, the eventual political consequences of tolerating abortion in some states will be the acceptance of it in all the states. (We’ve already seen this with the abortion referendums in Kansas and Ohio, with more referendums on the way.) Moral neutrality on abortion — Trump’s “popular sovereignty” approach — will weaken the foundation for legal prohibition and open the way to tolerance and eventually political acceptance.



Because of the first principles at stake here, the logic of America’s antebellum slavery debate applies entirely to the abortion debate of our time. Indeed, the two issues are closer than even most pro-lifers realize. Today’s Democrats view abortion just as antebellum Democrats viewed slavery. They think the constitutional rights of an entire class of people (women) depend for their vindication on the denial of all rights to another class of people (the unborn). This is precisely what southern Democrats believed about blacks and slavery, and why they were so adamantly against emancipation. 



But the two issues are alike in another way as well: They both represent a grave danger to freedom itself and the survival of our republic. In the runup to the Civil War, Lincoln argued over and over that slavery wasn’t just bad for slaves but also bad for free men and ultimately for republican self-government.



The whole issue hinges, in Lincoln’s view, on how we conceive of the right of self-government. Namely, what is its foundation, and what are its limits? Lincoln thought Douglas’ construal of self-government — that one group of men could enslave another, so long as they voted on it — was deeply flawed. He said it amounts to this: “That if any one man, choose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed to object.” 



Such a view of self-government eventually leads to its ruin because it posits every majority as an unlimited sovereign and therefore as a potential tyrant. Part of preserving freedom and self-government, said Lincoln, was recognizing its inherent limits. There are some things not even a majority can impose, like slavery. “When the white man governs himself … and also governs another man, that is more than self-government — that is despotism.”



As most Americans now recognize, Lincoln was right and Douglas was wrong. And like Douglas, Trump is wrong today. Moral neutrality on abortion in our time is like moral neutrality on slavery in Douglas’ time. It might seem politically savvy, a way to thread the needle on a seemingly intractable issue for the sake of building a coalition, but ultimately, it’s a recipe for tyranny and anarchy. If the unborn are Americans who have a right to life, as some states maintain, then that right cannot simply be waived because majorities in other states want to deny them that right.



Obviously, this means abortion must be banned in every state or eventually allowed in every state. Politically, though, that’s an unappealing prospect, which is why Trump’s “let the states decide” approach to abortion probably is the most politically savvy course — for now. It certainly is the most expedient. As my colleague David Harsanyi pointed out, President Biden and his lackeys in the corporate press were reduced to attacking Trump this week not for his moderate position but for his inconsistency. (Never mind the media’s nonchalance about Biden’s own much more dramatic reversals on abortion.)



By taking credit for overturning Roe v. Wade but rejecting any federal restrictions on abortion and letting states decide the question, Trump can direct attention instead to the radical position of Biden and the Democrats, which is far outside the mainstream of American opinion on the issue, and present himself as a moderate, which he is — no pro-lifer seriously believes Trump cares all that much about the abortion issue as such.



But the danger of taking what amounts to a morally neutral or indifferent view of abortion is that it reduces it to just another political issue subject to the whims of the electorate. Abortion is more than that, though. It cuts right to the heart of our understanding of democracy and self-government — which, as Lincoln said, must have limits, or it becomes despotism. If one person can snuff out the life of another, and no third person is allowed to object, then in what sense do we have self-government? Democratic practice, after all, must be rooted in the principle of human equality. There are some things even a majority cannot justly decide to do, and to deny that is to open the way to tyranny.



In the end, Trump’s attempt to thread this needle, to choose the politically savvy route over what is right and just, might well prove to be as savvy as Douglas thought he was being with his retreat to “popular sovereignty” on slavery. But as Douglas found out (and Trump might soon find out) moderation on a question of first principles only goes so far, especially when you’re trying to court people who insist that the rights of an entire class of people must be denied to vindicate the rights of another. Douglas thought he could compromise with the slave power, but instead he set in motion the Civil War. Trump, using the same flawed logic, thinks he can compromise with the pro-abortion power.



He’d be better off following Lincoln, who knew that America could not continue forever divided between slave states and free states, that we would “become all one thing or all the other.”

That’s the modern left’s position on the issue. Democrats are so dug into their extremism that they can’t even support bills that compel “doctors” to keep babies who survive a homicide attempt alive.



Perhaps most American voters don’t care enough. Maybe most voters aren’t even aware of the modern left’s radicalism. The political media might be plagued by partisan mediocrity, but when it comes to abortion, they have demonstrated an unmatched competency in misleading the public.



This week, Donald Trump released a statement contending that the abortion issue should be left to the states and refused to endorse any federal law. Because his position is inconveniently restrained, the Joe Biden campaign was compelled to focus on the former president’s flip-flops on the issue.



And virtually every outlet followed the president’s lead, zeroing in on Trump’s inconsistency. The Washington Post laid out “How Trump’s abortion stance has shifted over the years.” NBC News wrote up a “A timeline of Trump’s many, many positions on abortion.” “Why Trump Will Keep Flip-Flopping on Abortion in 2024,” explains a Time magazine headline. “13 times Trump’s abortion position shifted over the last 25 years,” appeared on CNN. And so on.



Fair enough. Trump is obviously taking a politically expedient position meant to diffuse the issue among independents and moderates. And it’s no great pronouncement to say that Trump isn’t any kind of social conservative. Whatever he believes or doesn’t, the former president worked with pro-life and pro-Constitution groups to put three originalist judges on the court because his constituents wanted him to do it. That court, perhaps the last properly functioning institution in the country, overturned one of the most preposterous and deadly decisions in American history.



Guess what? Biden is also a transactional politician. His goal is to delegitimize the court and Constitution and compel states to accept the Democrats’ maximalist position. 



What no major media outlet, as far as I can tell, even bothered to point out was that Biden has also radically changed his position on abortion, from supporting virtually every restriction in the ’70s and ’80s — including overturning Roe v. Wade and handing the issue back to states — to taking a “middle-of-the-road” approach as vice president to Barack “above my paygrade” Obama, to now supporting abortion without any limits until birth.



Even during the 2020 campaign, Biden was still pro-Hyde Amendment — a law that bans direct government funding for abortion. This position, if we trust polls, is still popular. But it only took two days of criticism from progressives on social media to convince this feckless, weak man to capitulate to the far left and “denounce” the amendment.



“On Abortion, Trump Chose Politics Over Principles,” says The New York Times this week. When Biden had his abrupt reversal on Hyde in 2020, the Times assured readers the candidate had “grappled for decades with his views on abortion rights.”



We all know politicians are only permitted to “evolve” toward a pro-abortion position. It is odd, though, that every time Biden “grapples” with an issue — and he’s wrestled with virtually every one of them — he somehow always ends up precisely in the most politically convenient place. Weird how that works out.



In any event, as a pro-lifer, I find Trump’s milquetoast triangulation on the issue cowardly and completely expected — presidential candidates always moderate their positions for the general election. As a compromise, however, it is well within the norms of American governance. States should be making most of the decisions about how they conduct business.



Yet, Democrats like Bill Kristol claimed Trump’s waffling was “classic authoritarianism,” because they have completely lost the ability, it seems, to say anything else. We often hear the left argue that restricting abortion is an attack on “democracy.” Abortion, mentioned nowhere in the Constitution, is not a right. It is perfectly within our norms — nay, within the constitutional order — to empower voters in states, or even nationally, to decide the issue for themselves.



Anyway, if waffling on abortion is authoritarian, Bill Kristol is Benito Mussolini.



(Trump’s abortion statement, incidentally, came the same day Biden announced a new student loan “forgiveness” plan — ignoring Congress, defying the Supreme Court, breaking millions of private contracts, and unilaterally demanding taxpayers foot the bill. This unconstitutional vote-buying scheme doesn’t seem to bother any of our self-appointed defenders of democracy.)



For both constitutional and practical reasons, I believe the abortion fight is better fought on the state level. But, at the same time, Dobbs does not restrict federal action. And it must be noted that Democrats have zero compunction ramming through national abortion policy. It is difficult to maneuver locally — which, let’s face it, the GOP can barely do as it is — while Democrats work to make maximalist abortion legislation the law of the land.



And we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that even the GOP federal position is far more reasonable than anything Democrats propose. Trump wants to avoid the debate, but Lindsey Graham’s “Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act” would have limited abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy (which is when the vast majority of abortions take place, we are constantly informed) and included exceptions for rape and incest, protections for the woman’s life, and prohibitions from prosecuting women seeking abortions.



Democrats keep calling Graham’s bill a “ban,” when it’s clear it comports with the view of a large swath of voters, who do not believe in complete bans or complete license to kill human beings.



Though you’d never know it from the news.

"225",225,"‘Jane the Virgin’ Decided to Introduce Abortion, And It Was Awful","Olmstead","Gracy",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-25"," I first started watching “Jane the Virgin” after leading actress Gina Rodriguez won one of her first (of many) awards for her role as Jane Villanueva. My Twitter erupted with celebration from fans—male and female, liberal and conservative, religious and secular—who loved the show. Curiosity piqued, I began watching. I soon realized this funny, dramatic, family-centric show was truly unique. It’s not just unique because Jane has decided to remain celibate until marriage. Or because she’s accidentally artificially inseminated at a routine doctor’s visit, and becomes pregnant as a result. It’s not just peculiar because, in the face of this life-shattering event, Jane decides to keep the baby and raise him—shifting her life goals and timelines in order to make room for this new little one. Neither is it just distinctive because Jane, despite her many faults and foibles, is a truly good, kind, loving, thoughtful, moral, responsible individual who believes in living selflessly and supporting her family.  Beyond all these noteworthy aspects, Jane the Virgin has consistently celebrated the family over the individual, love over alienation, interdependency over independence. And that’s pretty strange in today’s Hollywood. But this season, the writers of “Jane the Virgin” decided to do something different. They decided to have Jane’s mother, Xiomara, choose abortion when she becomes pregnant by mistake. Why ‘Jane The Virgin’ Decided to Include Abortion Xiomara’s life circumstances at the time are nearly identical to Jane’s. She is in love with someone besides the baby’s father. She’s on a different life trajectory, with a vision for the future that does not include children. The pregnancy is unexpected, shocking, and frustrating. But Jane chooses life—and her mother does not.  Sadly, I think Hollywood’s more progressive ideology is leaning in here. The fact that Xiomara’s abortion is handled so lightly by romantic interest Rogelio, daughter Jane, and Jane’s new husband Michael makes this clear. To them, this abortion is nothing. They’re more interested in figuring out how to hide it from Xiomara’s mother Alba than they are in considering the larger moral, personal, and emotional implications of the act. There’s no moment in which anyone asks Xiomara, “Are you okay?” No one so much as frowns when the topic comes up in conversation. Xiomara and her supporting cast of characters don’t just talk about the abortion encouragingly—they talk about it lightly, as if it were a head cold to be gotten rid of. When Alba does find out about Xiomara’s abortion, she is incensed. But she isn’t heartbroken. She never refers to a “baby”—indeed, the show is careful to avoid any child-related terminology in relation to Xiomara’s act. Alba fits all the stereotypes a progressive writing about traditional Catholics could hope for: she’s angry, condemnatory, and even throws in a reference to “hell.” But this—this isn’t pro-life. It isn’t pro-family. And it isn’t what “Jane the Virgin” has offered us for the past two seasons.  Is ‘Jane the Virgin’ Trying To Normalize Abortion? In making abortion part of this season, the writers of “Jane the Virgin” have said they are attempting to “normalize” abortion. The show is moving in the same vein as this year’s “Tell My Abortion Story” campaign, and other progressive efforts to mainstream abortion. They are, at least in a sense, aiming to take abortion lightly. Take the moment when Xiomara complains to Rogelio about her mother’s reaction to the abortion. When she says Alba is “trying to make her feel guilty for not feeling guilty,” Rogelio responds with a cheesy smile, an affirmative “you do you,” and a “stay real, bruh.” The lack of gravitas is deeply frustrating—but it’s more than that. The writing is so underwhelming, it feels fake. Nothing about this fits the show’s gentle, thoughtful tone. Perhaps abortion needs to be talked about more on the national stage. Perhaps our shows—even funny, family-centric comedies such as “Jane the Virgin”—need to discuss it, its dynamics and repercussions. But if we are to discuss abortion, we must do so with the understanding that it has consequences. Even progressives must be willing to acknowledge that abortion is serious—not a momentary annoyance or trivial act. (Vanity Fair said “Jane the Virgin” should be the show to discuss abortion because it is “thoughtful” and “subtle.” Sadly, there was nothing thoughtful or subtle about this episode.) Even progressives must acknowledge that abortion impacts the emotional and physical well-being of the mother. For a majority of Americans, abortion is much more than that: it’s the extinguishing of a human life. It’s the extermination of a baby, at its most vulnerable and dependent stage. ‘Guilt’ Is a Bad Word In Today’s Culture As Josh Sabey pointed out in an article about “Jane the Virgin” that he wrote for The Federalist last week, the show has often embraced a more smarmy version of religious absolutes: Even though Alba’s daughter (Jane’s mother) Xiomara was decidedly not a virgin, she still feels like her entire childhood was tainted because her mother made her feel guilty about her choices. Jane agrees. Eventually Alba also admits that imposing her beliefs was hypocritical and wrong. They all agree that virginity is a personal decision—one that’s right for some people and wrong for others.
Similar messages are repeated so often it would be hard to miss. When Jane is deciding whether to pursue her master’s degree three weeks after having a child, she attends a nursing class where the mothers all talk about the different ways they’ve balanced work and motherhood. The teacher tells them all that what they choose doesn’t matter as much as making sure they’re doing what’s right for them individually. When I first read Sabey’s article, I had a swath of rebuttals at the ready. Of course the show doesn’t castigate people who have sex before marriage, I thought. Not only would that never happen in a secular television show—it would not communicate the complex aspects of these sorts of commitments. The show doesn’t portray Jane as the perfect virgin, because none of us are perfect. As a good friend noted about Alba’s own hypocrisy on the virginity issue, “Alba’s hypocrisy wasn’t just harmful projection but she really is trying to be a good person, believing she herself wasn’t, and wants better for them.” Past lightness on the subject of sex seemed to give concessions to pop culture mantras on sexuality and promiscuity, while still enabling Jane to keep her commitment—and fostering a more serious, intentional attitude towards virginity than we often see on television. This Episode Drops What Made ‘Jane the Virgin’ Great But I cannot fault Sabey for his statements on guilt in “Jane the Virgin”—because Xiomara almost iterated them, verbatim, on this week’s episode. Alba “wants to make me feel guilty about not feeling guilty,” she said. She targeted guilt as criminal, as much as or more than the act of aborting her baby. She does not want to acknowledge any moral absolutes, and neither—it turns out—does Alba. What has made “Jane the Virgin” a sparkling, funny, warm show has been its commitment to family—and to all the love, sacrifice, and pain that commitment requires. It’s been a pro-life show in more than just one way. Jane welcomes Mateo into her life, but she also welcomes her former nemesis Petra, baby daddy Rafael, father Rogelio, and a host of other people. Over the course of the past two seasons, Jane has learned to forgive and love; she’s learned to grapple with her fears. But perhaps what’s most saddening about the turn of events represented by this episode is the fact that it will only last one episode. Xiomara’s abortion was a lighthearted head nod to progressives’ dogma on abortion. Any larger hurt—any guilt or fear or regret—associated with that decision was swept under the rug, in the name of tolerance, acceptance, and “choice.” To do differently—to dwell on the moral and personal impact of this decision, even for a moment—would be more in line with what “Jane the Virgin” has offered us thus far. But it would also offend the larger sensibilities of a progressive culture. And so it did not happen.

"226",226,"Resisting Vote On Born-Alive Bill, Democrats Are Desperate To Hide The Truth About Abortion","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-04-04"," Politico is providing cover for Democrats desperately trying to avoid a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which Republicans are trying to bring to a floor vote via a discharge petition. Melanie Zanona writes, “House Republicans on Tuesday launched a long-shot bid to force a vote on anti-abortion legislation — an issue they plan to hammer vulnerable Democrats on even if they can’t secure action on the floor.” She reports a statement from Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) regarding the discharge petition: “Oh, my g-d. They just will not quit. . . I think politically, it’s a really bad move for them, and substantively, it’s a disaster.” The desperation of this statement is almost palpable. Pushing the issue is anything but a bad move for Republicans.  Zanona peppers her report with the usual deflections and falsehoods on abortion, saying abortions “very late in pregnancy” are “rare” and “often performed because of an underlying medical complication.” Obfuscating the core issue of infanticide by exposure, she merely states that Republicans have “seized” on Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s “controversial” comments made “in defense” of a bill making it easier to get late-term abortions “when the health of the mother is at risk.” This purpose of this bill is not to limit the abortion entitlement, however. As freshman Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas put it: What this bill says is during an attempted abortion, and the baby is actually born alive, should the doctor actually save it? Now the next question you might ask is, why are we doing this? Is this a question that actually needs answering? Well no actually, because of policies proposed in Virginia and New York and Vermont, we feel that we actually have to put this into law. We actually have to put into law that a baby born with ten fingers and ten toes and a heartbeat, a baby that is breathing, deserves to live because it has value, because it is a human life. While this bill does not directly threaten the legality of abortion whatsoever, the misinformation should still be addressed, because the truth leads to startlingly ugly conclusion about the motivations of Democrats in opposing the bill—and those do have to do with abortion. It may surprise Zanona to learn that deliberately killing a preborn baby is never medically necessary. When the health or life of either patient is in danger from continuing the pregnancy, the child is delivered and care is administered to both patients according to standard medical practices. Sometimes those babies are too under-developed or too sick to survive, and that is nothing short of a tragedy.  The supposed rarity of late-term abortions is no excuse to reject basic protections for infants born alive after the attempt to kill them in the womb, either. Whether these abortions are committed once a year or a thousand times has exactly nothing to do with the morality of leaving infants, struggling to breathe, to die in utility closets or medical waste bins. It would seem Democrats think some lives are, at the very least, not worth taking the time to protect. But that would be too generous an assumption, since they have spent more energy blocking 25 attempts to bring the bill to the floor and grandstanding about protecting alleged threats to “chip away at abortion rights” than it would take to just vote on the matter. Democrats’ behavior with regard to this bill almost seems too repulsive to comprehend, even for people who take a “moderate” stance on abortion. Yet the left’s reasoning is shockingly straightforward when the facts about abortion are taken into account. As I wrote last time on the subject of born-alive protections: “Abortion is a pregnant woman employing lethal means to terminate her responsibilities as a mother.” A woman’s health is not more adequately served by killing her child than through delivery. And whose autonomy is threatened by caring for an infant born after a botched abortion? If the mother does not want her child, the child becomes a ward of the state and can be adopted.  Is losing one’s “autonomy” for nine months through pregnancy, a well-known potential consequence that almost always results from consensual sex, such a terrible burden that to escape it is worth sacrificing another living human, sacrificing one’s own child? Is pregnancy, that incredible ability to help create and nurture new life, really a form of oppression? The answer for House and Senate Democrats, 81 percent of whom had a 100 percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2017, is apparently yes. But it doesn’t explain why Democrats would oppose protections for abortion-survivors. While autonomy is a convenient argument for abortion, it is not the core motivation behind this entitlement. The only premise from which a rejection of born-alive protections can be mounted is the idea that a woman is entitled to terminate her responsibilities as a parent with lethal, violent force. To allow an infant to survive the attempt to exercise this entitlement, even if they make it outside the womb, is to deny a woman her supposed right to kill her offspring. Abortion is not really about a woman’s bodily autonomy or health. Legal abortion is fundamentally a mother’s entitlement to kill her child. When viewed in this light, one can understand why the left insists the bill is a threat to the abortion entitlement. It’s not just a deflection. They actually believe that abortion is the right to a dead baby. Democrats are desperate to keep this ugly truth a secret, and that is why pro-life Republicans must press this issue as hard as they can.

Whether it’s Roe, Casey, or Monday’s Whole Women’s Health V. Hellerstedt, the rulings are a collection of incoherent assertions tied together with poorly executed insults. Another thing it has going for it is an abortion-enraptured media that loves all abortion and covers up negative stories about the practice. 
The big thing that the abortion movement has against it is that everyone knows killing babies is wrong, no matter how much media-beloved Ruth Bader Ginsburg beats the drum for its eugenical powers.
The creative arts have trouble doing abortion advocacy because of that deeply held universal view that killing innocent, unborn children is not exactly heroic.
Comedians, who are dark people willing to joke about death, can’t even do it well. Here are a few examples.

Yes, an “irreverent and lighthearted” look at killing babies! That sounds delightful. It was just last year that Philip Wegmann wrote up “‘Post Cards from The Vag’: A Tragic Abortion Comedy,” a look at a comedy night about abortion that was utterly heart-rending. 
But these are better than the unwatchable “Daily Show’s” post-SCOTUS ruling tweet:
Celebrate the #SCOTUS ruling! Go knock someone up in Texas!
The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) June 27, 2016
 
Ah, what’s not to love about this comedic genius? Note that it’s directed at men and not at women, since only men can knock up only women. Note that the “joke” only makes sense if the woman is then aborting the child. And since the ruling was about whether Texas clinics should meet basic health and safety standards (SCOTUS says nope!), the joke is that the woman you abandon after impregnating her will have less-safe clinics to meet all her baby-killing needs.
[Insert big Ed McMahon ho-ho-ho laugh here]
Pro-lifers were aghast at the tweet but so were middle-of-the-roaders, leading pro-choice activists to freak out that the tweet wasn’t exactly helpful to the side that advocates unrestricted rights to end the lives of unborn children. So they pushed out another tweet asking viewers to pretend they didn’t understand the first tweet’s clear wording:
Friends, we’re certainly not promoting abortions. Just excited about #SCOTUS reaffirming right to choose.
The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) June 27, 2016
 
Un-hunh. Sure. One might ask the brilliant comedic minds at “The Daily Show” why they wouldn’t be promoting abortions, exactly. Nevermind, they’re scrambling.
But kudos to “The Daily Show” for showing that abortion is something that is caused by men knocking women up without providing them the support and encouragement to gestate human life in the womb. I mean, read as subversive pro-life commentary on the violence and misogyny of abortion, the tweet actually works.
But, of course, that wasn’t the intent of the joke-stealers over at Comedy Central. 
Another good example of abortion comedy going over like a lead balloon came from the enthusiastic, if dull, Zack Ford.

Many people complained about the vile ghoulishness of the tweet. But one and a half cheers for Ford just being honest about how some people really love killing little babies. “Safe, legal, rare”? I think you mean “Gosnell-like, unrestricted, and common,” amiright?

The story, by By Ariana Eunjung Cha, is an absolute hot mess, but apparently by “science” she means “a study authored by abortion activists that says abortion is no biggie.” She does not mean the type of science that tells us human life begins at conception.
Speaking of science and the Washington Post, they once tried to take Marco Rubio to task for the true scientific fact he mentioned about human life beginning at conception. It’s hilarious, but awful, but, again, hilarious, how they responded.
“Marco Rubio demanded people look at the science on abortion. So we did,” they all said. And, um, well, the Washington Post has no idea how babies are made and no idea that human lives begin at conception. Years later, they have still not corrected the piece, authored by Philip Bump, that snottily argues against this scientific fact.
Abortion: Still not funny to tear innocent human life from limb to limb. Never will be. But media idiocy on the topic is good for a morbid chuckle or two.

"228",228,"Pro-Abortion Radicals Are Lying About Red-State Laws To Scare Americans","Cook","Emily",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-08-02"," Following the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, abortion activists and their friends in the media rushed to attack pro-life states, not by defending abortion itself but by deceiving and distracting. Directly talking about abortion means proponents must answer what (or whom) is being aborted. Abortion activists seek to avoid the question entirely and instead scare Americans into supporting their position by conflating abortion with other issues, the most tragic of which is miscarriage. 



Leftists and the corporate media wasted no time in disseminating harmful “information” about the “threat” abortion bans pose to women who suffer miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies. Their propaganda campaign is not about “saving women”; instead, it highlights how they will go to any length necessary to preserve the ability to kill the babies nestled safely within the womb with impunity.



Elective abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by intentionally causing the death of a living unborn child. In a miscarriage, the child passes away naturally. Miscarriage care often involves similar terminology, drugs, and procedures as elective abortions. In a clinical setting, miscarriage is even referred to as a “spontaneous abortion.” They are differentiated, legally and morally, by intent. If a doctor prescribes mifepristone or uses a D&C procedure to treat a miscarriage, the intent is to remove the deceased child’s body. The doctor does not cause the child’s death in a miscarriage. 



The media likes to point to Texas for their scare campaign because Texas, more than any other state, modeled a post-Roe America by enacting the Texas Heartbeat Act, which took effect in 2021. This law bans elective abortion once the preborn child’s heartbeat becomes detectable. However, Texas law is exceptionally clear: Miscarriage treatment does not constitute an abortion.



As stated in the Texas Health and Safety Code, a procedure is legally considered an abortion if it is done “with the intent to cause the death of an unborn child of a woman known to be pregnant.” The definition further clarifies that “[a]n act is not an abortion if the act is done with the intent to … remove a dead, unborn child whose death was caused by spontaneous abortion.” 



This means that if a procedure is done to remove a deceased child who passed away by spontaneous miscarriage, there was no intent to end that child’s life, and it is therefore not defined as an abortion. Additionally, under Texas law, removing an ectopic pregnancy is not considered an abortion. Texas law also does not prohibit removing a living child with the intent to provide treatment to the child or to save a mother’s life, such as in an early induced delivery or a C-section.



Claims that miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy treatments are prohibited in states where elective abortion is banned or restricted are not only legally incorrect but also cause confusion among medical practitioners, policymakers, and pregnant women.



If the unfounded and blatantly false hysteria continues to proliferate, especially with the corporate media as the biggest accomplice, dangerous confusion can occur among pregnant women and physicians. We know the abortion-at-all-costs crowd won’t let a little truth stand in their way of a useful narrative, so pro-lifers and the medical community must fill the gap.



National and state medical associations — from the American Medical Association to the state-specific chapters such as the Texas Medical Association — not only have a powerful lobbying presence in our legislatures but also have a responsibility to release guidelines and clarifications for practitioners when new legislation impacting the practice of medicine goes into effect. Unfortunately, these organizations have not used their vast financial and institutional resources to push back against the false narrative that has spread like wildfire in the pro-abortion media. 



Instead of being silent or adding fuel to the fire, these organizations should pointedly educate the medical providers regarding their respective state laws. State legislatures across the country have anticipated these circumstances and included explicit provisions. Equating tragic situations such as miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies with elective abortion peddled by Planned Parenthood and radical leftists is despicable. 



Miscarriages are incredibly heartbreaking to expectant families. Ectopic pregnancies are tragic and terrifying experiences, catching women and families by surprise, accompanied by very complex feelings. The emotional, physical, and psychological turmoil inherent in such instances deserves to be respected and acknowledged for what it is: an absolute tragedy. 



These tragic situations do not deserve to be the rallying cry of woke leftists who demand abortion on demand for whatever reason, paid for by taxpayers, through all nine months of pregnancy.

"230",230,"Sen. Bill Cassidy Is The Left’s Useful Idiot On Abortion","Jacobs","Christopher",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-09-13"," Every summer, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., helps his colleagues celebrate “Seersucker Day” in the U.S. Senate. Next year, he should think about adding a new accessory to his summer sartorial splendor: a “Kick Me” sign.



That tag accurately describes how Cassidy allowed the professional left to play him like a fiddle in creating a proposed new federal mandate for abortion leave. Cassidy says he objects to the new regulation, but he doth protest too much — because the mandate was in many ways his own doing.



Pregnant Worker Bill



The issue revolves around the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), added as a Cassidy-sponsored amendment to last December’s omnibus spending bill. Supporters of this amendment said it would give pregnant women a right to reasonable accommodations — for instance, more bathroom breaks, or the right to carry water on the job — so they could remain in the workforce during and immediately after their pregnancies.



A twist occurred when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), in releasing proposed rules implementing the legislation, said it would define abortion as part of “pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions” entitled to protection under the new statute.



The regulation makes clear that nothing in the new law requires or prohibits employers from paying for abortion procedures themselves. (The Cassidy amendment, unlike earlier versions of the legislation, made this fact clear.) It also adds that nothing in the law or regulations would require employers to provide paid leave in excess of what they already offer through their existing policies.



However, the proposed regulation would effectively require employers to give their workers leave — paid vacation time if the worker has any available, or unpaid leave if not — for an abortion or treatments or services related to that abortion. Moreover, this requirement would extend to entities and organizations with moral or religious objections to abortion; churches and religiously affiliated entities could raise their beliefs in court, but their religious affiliation would not provide an absolute defense to lawsuits from workers or job applicants seeking abortions.



Obvious Regulatory Outcome



After the EEOC issued its proposed rule, Cassidy’s office put out a press release attacking the abortion language’s inclusion. But on multiple levels, the senator should have seen this coming from a mile away.



First, the Biden administration has perhaps served as the most pro-abortion administration of any in history, pushing for taxpayer funding of abortions in a way that even Barack Obama would not. After two-plus years of pro-abortion policies from this administration, did Cassidy really think abortion would somehow escape the EEOC’s notice when it came to implementing this particular law?



Second, the proposed regulation cites three separate federal court rulings, each from different circuits, as well as report language from the passage of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, to conclude that the federal government considers abortion a “related medical condition” to pregnancy. 



In other words, just as federal courts have held that state Medicaid programs must cover abortions unless they are explicitly prohibited from doing so by the Hyde Amendment (which prohibits federal taxpayer funding of elective abortions), so too was abortion practically guaranteed to fall under the scope of the PWFA if it was not explicitly excluded. And the amendment Cassidy drafted and sponsored did not do that.



Third, consider how groups on the left have described the bill, and the process leading up to it. In May, the group A Better Balance, which has advocated for the PWFA for over a decade, published a book about the experience. They noted that late last year, several senators, including Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., started raising abortion-related objections to the legislation.



A Better Balance stated that the bill passed “thanks to the tireless and shrewd work of our lead sponsors” — Cassidy and Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn. — “and after working in coalition with our partners, as well as many reproductive rights experts and scholars.” The organization went further, talking about “unacceptable poison pill language” and “hostile amendments” offered by Lankford, which the organization fought against on the Senate floor.



What exactly were those “hostile amendments” and “poison pill language”? One was an amendment Lankford offered that would have stated that religious entities did not have to make accommodations that would violate their beliefs. 



This simple principle — don’t force faith-based groups to violate their religion — seems like common sense to most Americans. But to Planned Parenthood and the “reproductive rights experts and scholars” associated with A Better Balance, religious freedom was a “hostile amendment” and a “poison pill.” So too was it to Cassidy, who voted against Lankford’s proposal.



Finally, Cassidy’s own staffers knew this was an issue — yet did nothing about it. A source in the pro-life community told me that Cassidy’s “staff told us prior to the vote that they knew abortion was a problem but they didn’t want to derail the process.” 



Another pro-life source said, “Cassidy wanted the bill passed at any cost,” and therefore wouldn’t insist on any provision — like explicit pro-life protections — that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., then-chair of the Senate Health Committee and a strong abortion supporter, would not accept.



Cassidy Office Deflects Responses



I posed a series of questions to Cassidy’s office about this history.



One of my questions asked how Cassidy approaches the role of the Hyde Amendment currently within the HHS appropriations bill — if it were to be removed, does he believe the language of the bill would still prevent taxpayers from paying for elective abortions, or does he conversely admit the bill is otherwise silent on abortion?



In response, Cassidy spokesman Ty Bofferding reiterated that the EEOC “has gone rogue.” He rejected the premise of my inquiries, claiming that my Hyde Amendment analogy was “a false equivalency,” because spending money was inapposite to whether the EEOC had legal authority to include the abortion language. He referred me to floor statements that both Casey and Cassidy gave last December saying that the PWFA did not touch on abortion.



Pressed for specific answers to several of my other questions, Bofferding declined to respond. And as to Bofferding’s claim that “Senator Cassidy is 100% pro-life” and that his “office worked with the pro-life community to ensure pro-life protections in the legislation,” one of my sources noted that at the time the legislation passed, “it was publicly known pro-life issues still existed and instead of addressing them in the text he chose to give a floor speech with [Sen.] Casey.”



The bottom line: Cassidy had all the leverage he needed to insist on a carve-out for religious organizations, language exempting abortion from the PWFA entirely, or both. Instead, he caved like a cheap suit, because he was worried about “derail[ing] the process.” As a result, employers around the country — to say nothing of the unborn — will pay the consequences.



The Left’s Useful Idiot



Compare Cassidy’s actions to those of one of his Senate colleagues, Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. Whereas Tuberville has placed a blanket hold on all Pentagon nominations in an attempt to get the Department of Defense to unwind its policy of providing “abortion vacations” to service members, Cassidy gave the EEOC all the authority it needed to impose such a requirement on most private-sector employers nationwide. 



And while some may have concerns about the implications of Tuberville’s holds on military readiness, at least he hasn’t behaved in the two-faced manner that Cassidy has, privately admitting concerns with a bill before it is in effect — and then loudly raising objections when those concerns come to fruition.



Cassidy frequently plays these games of footsie with the left. Witness his attempts during the Obamacare “repeal-and-replace” debate six years ago to placate Jimmy Kimmel — only for Kimmel to eventually throw him to the curb. 



Even though there’s no educational value in the second kick of a mule, somehow Cassidy has yet to learn that trying to appease the woke mob by “going along to get along” is a fool’s errand.



The bigger question is why the citizens of Louisiana — many Catholic, and many strongly pro-life — keep electing officials like Bill Cassidy to the Senate. Here’s hoping that if Cassidy hasn’t learned his lesson three years from now, the people of Louisiana kick him to the curb — and out of the Senate.

"231",231,"Sixth Circuit Abortion Case Illustrates Leftist Judges’ Disdain For Laws And Precedent","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-04-12"," On Friday, in a procedural oddity, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals voted to hear the initial appeal in Bristol v. Slatery as a full court, rather than allowing the case to proceed as normal before a three-judge panel. The case involved abortion, and the takeaways are two-fold: The judiciary is just as fractured as the rest of America, and leftist judges are defiantly ignoring Supreme Court and circuit precedent. To understand the significance of the Sixth Circuit’s order on Friday, one needs a basic primer of federal practice. The federal court system is mainly a three-tier system, with cases beginning at the lowest level, called district courts. The middle tier of courts consists of federal appellate courts, of which there are 13, although the Federal Circuit only hears specialized appeals. The 12 other circuits hear appeals from district courts located in the boundaries of the appellate courts as established by Congress.  When a losing party appeals, the case is randomly assigned to a three-judge panel. As one could imagine, the composition of that panel may determine the outcome of the case, for as much as Chief Justice John Roberts protests, there are Republican judges and Democrat judges. That’s unfortunate, because politics and policy judgments belong to legislators, but once originalism is abandoned, judges and justices step into those decisions. After a three-judge panel decides an appeal, the losing party has three options (beyond accepting defeat): He can ask the panel to reconsider its decision, he can ask the full court to rehear the case “en banc,” or he can seek review by the Supreme Court. For “en banc” review to occur, typically a majority of the active judges on the court must vote to rehear the case en banc. (The Ninth Circuit proceeds differently because it has a whopping 29 judges, making en banc review as a full court infeasible.) En banc review is exceedingly rare. Back to the Abortion Case Returning then to Bristol v. Slatery. That case concerns a law passed by the Tennessee legislature in 2015 that requires doctors to provide women who seek an abortion information to ensure informed consent 48 hours before the abortion is performed. Among other things, the information required includes the age of the human being in utero, alternatives to abortion, and the medical risks and benefits of abortion and pregnancy. The law also expressly provided that if a court enjoined the 48-hour waiting period, a 24-hour waiting period would apply. Shortly after Tennessee passed the waiting-period law, a group of abortion providers sued, claiming the law was unconstitutional. The plaintiffs, which consisted of Bristol Regional Women’s Center and three other abortion clinics including Planned Parenthood, did not seek a preliminary injunction to stop the law from going into effect.  So Tennessee’s waiting period law went into effect in July 2015, and for approximately five years it remained in force. Then, following a bench trial, a federal district court judge declared the law unconstitutional. In so ruling, the district court judge applied a balancing test, weighing the benefits of the law against its claimed burdens. After finding the law “provides no appreciable benefit,” but “causes increased wait times, imposes logistical and financial burdens, subjects patients to increased medical risks, and stigmatizes and demeans women,” the trial court held the law unduly burdens abortion and is thus unconstitutional. Tennessee’s attorney general immediately appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears appeals from federal district courts located in Tennessee, Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky. Tennessee also filed a motion for a stay pending appeal, meaning it requested the appellate court allow it to continue enforcing the waiting-period law until the appeal concluded. What the Sixth Circuit Did Then The motion to stay went to a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit, consisting of Karen Nelson Moore, a Bill Clinton appointee, Helene White, a G.W. Bush appointee, and Amul Thapar, a Donald Trump appointee. In a 2-1 decision authored by Moore, the panel denied Tennessee’s motion for a stay, concluding the waiting period law was “likely” unconstitutional.  Judge Thapar wrote a scathing dissent, excoriating his fellow jurists for ignoring Supreme Court precedent upholding waiting periods and noting “no federal appellate court has successfully struck down an abortion waiting period.” Thapar rebuked his colleagues for ignoring the lower court’s application of the wrong standard for judging the constitutionality of abortion laws, namely a balancing test that compared the benefits that flowed from the law to burdens of the waiting period. The proper standard, Judge Thapar noted, was instead the “undue burden” standard established in Casey, which holds that “a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.” In fact, as Thapar noted, the Sixth Circuit had already rejected the balancing test in EMW Women’s Surgical v. Friedlander. Because the lower court applied the improper standard and the Supreme Court in Casey made clear “that abortion waiting periods are reasonably related to legitimate state interests as a matter of law,” Thapar concluded “that Tennessee was likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal.” But, as Thapar also recognized, Moore and White had already concluded to the contrary in a detailed opinion spanning nearly 20 pages, and that decision ignored controlling Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit precedent. So why wait for the majority to repeat the mistake following full briefing on the merits of the appeal? (Remember, the only issue before the panel concerned the propriety of issuing a stay pending the appeal, but that question, in constitutional cases, rests nearly completely on whether the party seeking a stay has a strong likelihood of success on the merits.) Instead, the Case Moved Straight to En Banc Judge Thapar believed, “given the weighty interests involved in this case” and the majority’s blatant disregard for Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit precdent, that waiting for the panel to regurgiate its same flawed reasoning following briefing and oral argument served no purpose, and he called for “correction either by our court or a higher one.” In a lengthy footnote, Thapar highlighted the governing procedural rules, noting “if Tennessee chose to file a petition for initial hearing en banc on the merits, our court could grant it.” That is exactly what occurred, with Tennessee’s attorney general filing a motion for the initial hearing to be before the full court. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday, in a 10-6 vote, granted that motion. It was now Judge Moore’s turn to issue a seething dissent, and she did, accusing her 10 fellow judges of lacking “a principled basis” for hearing the case initially en banc. She then stressed that the decision to proceed en banc “tarnishes this court’s reputation for impartiality and independence,” and wrongly cements in the public’s mind the idea that “certain judges invariably resolve certain cases in certain ways.” For all her high-sounding principles, however, it was Moore’s decision denying the stay that provides proof of leftist knee-jerk decisionmaking from the bench. That Moore could only garner five colleagues to join her in opposing en banc review—an extraordinary and rare event—compared to her ten fellow judges voting to grant the petition speaks volumes to the Sixth Circuit’s concerns about the opinion. Those concerns likely extended much beyond the denial of Tennessee’s motion to pause the enforcement of Tennessee’s waiting period law. Rather, the Sixth Circuit as a court likely found offense—meriting correction—in Judge Moore’s treatment of the controlling circuit precedent of EMW Women’s Surgical Center v. Friedlander. Moore Ignored Her Own Circuit’s Precedent In EMW, a panel of the Sixth Circuit held that the undue burden standard of Casey continues to govern questions concerning the constitutionality of abortion laws. “Under that standard, a law regulating abortion is invalid if it ‘imposes an undue burden on a woman’s ability’ to choose to have an abortion before viability.” The court in EMW expressly rejected the proposition that the undue burden test “requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.” Using such a balancing test first found support in the Supreme Court’s decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. That opinion added a gloss to the Casey standard, noting courts should weigh “the asserted benefits” of the regulations “against the burdens.” But last year in June Medical Services v. Russo, the Supreme Court failed to garner a majority to support the use of a balancing test. Instead, a four-justice plurality found a balancing approach appropriate, while Justice John Roberts, who joined in the holding striking the abortion regulation down, rejected the balancing test. “Nothing about Casey suggested that a weighing of costs and benefits of an abortion regulation was a job for the courts,” Roberts wrote in concurrence. “Instead, “the ‘traditional rule’ that ‘state and federal legislatures [have] wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty’ is ‘consistent with Casey.’” Further, because Roberts found “the discussion of benefits in Whole Woman’s Health []as not necessary to its holding,” he rejected the idea that a balancing test applied. When the Sixth Circuit considered the abortion law at issue in EMW, the panel began by assessing the appropriate standard to apply. Was it the “undue burden” standard of Casey, or did Hellerstedt require a balancing test? The court, in a 2-1 decision, concluded that given Roberts’s concurrence in June Medical, the Casey standard controlled. Accordingly, the EMW court rejected the balancing test. The district court in Bristol, however, wrongly applied the balancing test. But rather than acknowledge that fact and correct the lower court, Judge Moore suggested EMW might be “dicta”—meaning not controlling—and further suggested that Tennessee “may well have overstated the precedential value of EMW.” In the end, Moore concluded whether the court applied the balancing test or the undue balance test was irrelevant, but to the full court, her opinion read, as dissenting Judge Thapar put it, as an “invitation to defy precedent.” Under these circumstances, Moore has no one to blame but herself for the Sixth Circuit removing the appeal from the panel she led. Her complaints and criticism also sound sorely of projection.

"233",233,"If Democrats ‘Codify Roe v. Wade,’ That Would Mean Abortions Until Birth For Any Reason Nationwide","St. Onge","Sarah",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-09-11"," In January 2019, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act. It was hailed as a watershed moment for women’s rights in the state. The NYRHA was meant to “codify Roe,” meaning to bring state laws into accord with the Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade. We’ve heard a lot from Democratic candidates regarding their wish to “codify Roe” on a federal level. Many voters believe codifying Roe would just assure reasonable protections for women facing problematic pregnancies, not realizing Roe is part of two decisions handed down by the Supreme Court.  On the same day Roe was decided, Doe v. Bolton was also handed down, with the court clarifying these were “companion cases.” Companion cases are meant to be read together when determining how a court decision should be interpreted. In large part, codifying Roe means codifying Doe as well. Roe determines how states are permitted to limit abortion, based on the trimester of pregnancy. In the third trimester, a state is permitted to outlaw all abortions except when the health of the mother is involved. This is where Doe comes in. Doe defines what constitutes health. In Doe, the Supreme Court clarifies health as anything “physical, emotional, psychological, familial, [or related to] the woman’s age, relevant to the wellbeing of the patient.” Pro-abortion advocates don’t want you to focus on Doe, because then you’d understand what pro-life advocates mean when they reference “abortion until birth.” Doe classifies “health issues” as situations such as a financial crisis, or single-motherhood. So, essentially, this means anything involving a pregnant woman that may cause a rift in her life.  Codifying Roe means women will have access to abortion if a doctor determines their health is threatened by their financial situation (97 percent of all abortions are currently performed due to the financial status of the woman involved) or their age, regardless of any physically life-threatening situation. It also means with the current push to characterize pregnancy in general as life-threatening to women, pregnancy itself will eventually be considered sufficient reason to gain access to abortion throughout all three trimesters. Within the space of a year after New York enacted the Reproductive Health Act, some local pro-life advocates began noticing women successfully accessing abortions post-viability, meaning after the point the baby’s life could be saved in a NICU. I wrote about one such instance I was personally involved in, here. If Roe is indeed codified, to suppose expanded access won’t happen everywhere is foolish. During the Democrat presidential primaries, Kamala Harris, who is now Democrats’ vice presidential candidate, elaborated on a frightening vision for a country where Roe is the law of the land. Her plan involves creating a “Reproductive Rights Act,” which would require states that have previously been seen as hostile to abortion access to have Department of Justice approval for any laws restricting abortion. Modeled after the Voting Rights Act, Harris’s proposal positions abortion as a civil rights issue. Yet while the Voting Rights Act was created to allow the federal government to enforce provisions detailed in the 15th amendment, there is no right to an abortion in the U.S. Constitution.  Even the Roe decision indicates its legitimacy rests on the idea that the fetus isn’t a person — indeed, if we ever established it is, Roe would be finished. Because there are no provisions allowing women to end the lives of their children, using the Department of Justice to police state laws would be a serious overreach. In New York, unrestricted abortion until babies are 24 weeks along is accessible in many clinics. If Roe were codified at the federal level, the same would be permitted in all states — including those which currently consider themselves pro-life. To pass any law related to abortion care, pro-life states would have to ask permission from the federal government, even if the legislation was written solely to assure women were protected from unsafe conditions. We’ve seen how this turns out in many states, with clinics able to avoid inspections to the point women have died due to unsanitary conditions and the unlicensed workers involved. Beyond 24 weeks of an unborn child’s age, abortion is more difficult to procure in New York, but it’s still legal and as long as a woman can find a willing doctor, she’s going to be able to terminate her pregnancy. As time goes by, more clinics may also be willing to venture into the third trimester because, in addition to “codifying” Roe, New York eliminated abortion from its criminal code — meaning there are no repercussions even if it’s proven a physician provides an abortion to a woman who wasn’t facing a life-threatening ailment. In the space of fewer than two years, we’ve started seeing some women seeking care in hospitals willing to terminate later-gestation pregnancies for non-emergent health reasons. Codifying Roe will expand this type of access to every state, and end any abortion-limiting laws for at least the next decade. While states battle out the constitutionality of restrictions to their laws, abortion advocacy groups and abortion clinics will be able to bypass our votes, supported by an administration whose pen and phone will create a constitutional right to abortion that isn’t in the Constitution and hasn’t gone through our established amendment process. Many pro-life individuals believe they must gather any life-affecting issues under the pro-life umbrella, rightly understanding to truly be a life-affirming person, we must meet those in need beyond the clinic walls. Unlike past elections, however, we potentially face a major shift in expanding abortion access. Never before has a candidate openly stated he or she will essentially bypass the constitutional amendment process to grant one group of people (women) the right to harm another group of people (the unborn) and use the Department of Justice to ensure no one stands in the way. Groups like Planned Parenthood and NARAL already have the mechanisms in place to begin opening clinics in states that have been made virtually abortion-free due to the hard work of pro-life voters and advocates. With leftist politicians guiding the Department of Justice decision-making process regarding abortion laws, we are looking at a confluence of political influence that will have the power to reverse virtually all pro-life gains of the last 40 years with the stroke of a pen. Every election we are told we’re in crisis mode, with each candidate telling us they’re the answer to all of our problems. This year is different. We are at a crossroads, and our choices in both state and federal elections will decide whether Roe and all of its implications will become the law of the land. Make your choice wisely. Millions of lives may depend on you.

"234",234,"Can I Answer A Few Questions about Abortion?","Kaczor","Christopher",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-11-04"," In his recent New York Times op-ed, “Er, Can I Ask a Few Questions About Abortion?” Nicholas Kristof makes a case against Christian pro-lifers. He writes that many Christians “support Trump, despite reservations about him, because their be-all issue is the unborn.” No Christian cares only about abortion as if other issues like religious liberty, taxes, and foreign policy don’t matter. But many Christians hold that abortion can disqualify a candidate. I think most people have issues that are disqualifiers.  Imagine you could vote in the 1852 presidential election. Let’s say you liked the Democratic presidential candidate Franklin Pierce’s policies on trade, his civil service views, and his warm personality. Wouldn’t Pierce’s pro-choice position on slavery disqualify him for your vote? Kristof asks, “Why do so many see fervent opposition to any abortion as a religious dictate when the Bible never directly discusses abortion?” One of the most fundamental messages of the Bible is this: God loves all human beings, and we are called to love all human beings. Loving all human beings includes trying to secure basic human rights for them, including the most foundational right, the right to live. All available scientific evidence points to the fact that the abortion kills a living human being, something the “party of science” ignores. Kristof writes, “The biblical passage most relevant to abortion is perhaps Exodus 21:22: ‘When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined.’ That suggests that the Bible treats a fetal life as less than a human life.”  That suggests no such thing. Let’s say Smith and Jones get into a gun fight, and Jones fires a bullet that misses Smith but kills an innocent third party, Flynn. According to U.S. law, we don’t charge Jones with first-degree murder but with involuntary manslaughter, which has a lesser penalty. It hardly follows that the law holds that Flynn’s life has less value than the victim of a first-degree murder. The passage from Exodus describes a case of manslaughter, not murder. Kristof asks, “In any case, why the obsessive focus on abortion today when Christian thought for most of the last two millenniums was not deeply concerned with the topic?” The suppositions of this question are mistaken. As David Albert Jones makes clear in his book “The Soul of the Embryo: An Enquiry into the Status of the Human Embryo in the Christian Tradition,” all Christians (until the late 20th century) held that abortion was seriously wrong. Kristof is also mistaken that opposition to abortion is an obsessive focus. For example, the Catholic Church opposes abortion, but the church spends enormously more time and energy running hospitals, homeless shelters, schools, and immigrant services in addition to its primary focus on spiritual activities like the Mass and the other sacraments. It is true that “Abortion was legal in the United States up to the point of quickening (the fetal movements felt in the second trimester) until the 19th century, when states began to ban abortion.” The antiquated science of centuries past held that fetal life did not begin until quickening. Evidence now indicates that this view was scientifically mistaken.  For example, on May 4, 2016, Sarah Knapton, the science editor of The Telegraph, reported, “Human embryos have been kept alive in a petri dish for an unprecedented 13 days, allowing scientists to finally see what happens in the mysterious days after implantation in the womb.” A human embryo cannot be kept alive unless the human embryo is alive. Abortion of course happens weeks, if not months, after conception. As abortion defender Judith Jarvis Thomson notes, “By the tenth week, the fetus already has ‘a face, arms and legs, fingers and toes; it has internal organs, and brain activity is detectable.’” Kristof argues, “science also shows that up to half of zygotes never implant and establish a pregnancy, and we don’t mourn those zygotes or establish national commissions to improve zygote survival.” Some women who miscarry do mourn, but many don’t in part because they may not have even realized they were pregnant. We don’t establish national commissions to improve the survival of centenarians, but that hardly shows the oldest among us don’t have basic human rights. Kristof questions, if the aim is to reduce abortions, why not push contraceptives? One answer is that pushing contraception can actually increase unwanted pregnancy. For example, in the Journal of Health Economics, David Paton found “no evidence” that “the provision of family planning reduces either underage conception or abortion rates.” According to Paton, “It is clear that providing more family planning clinics, far from having the effect of reducing conception rates, has actually led to an increase…. The availability of the morning-after pill seems to be encouraging risky behaviour. It appears that if people have access to family planning advice they think they automatically have a lower risk of pregnancy.” Kristof asks, “is it really for outsiders to force the mom to continue with the pregnancy [of a disabled child]?” If you hold that disabled human beings (prenatal or postnatal) have equal basic human rights, then their basic rights should be protected as much as anyone else’s. Moreover, this appeal is a red-herring, or a purposeful distraction from the major issue, because 99 percent of abortions are not about disabled prenatal human beings. Kristof ends with another red-herring that is irrelevant for 99 percent of abortions: abortion to save the life of the mother. The Catholic view, often called double-effect reasoning, is that a doctor can do any medical procedure necessary to save the life of the mother, even if it takes the life of the unborn as a side effect, so long as the death of the unborn is not sought as a means or as an end. For example, a doctor may remove a cancerous uterus of a pregnant woman, accepting as an unfortunate and unintended side-effect the death of the prenatal human being. There is no case in which the doctor needs to intentionally kill a prenatal human being to save the mother’s life. Finally, Kristof accuses pro-life voters of “abortion extremism.” Abolitionists were accused of the same thing. Why not compromise? Let half the country have slaves, and the other half be free. If you don’t want a slave, then don’t own one. But today, politically speaking, Kristof misidentifies the extremism. One major political party holds that abortion should be funded by the government, permitted for any reason whatsoever, without any restriction whatsoever, through all nine months of pregnancy. The other major political party opposes most abortions, but makes exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, and holds that health-care professionals should not be forced to perform abortions against their consciences. Which party is extreme on abortion? ","https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/04/can-i-answer-a-few-questions-about-abortion/",0.9983,0.0017,"male",2012,2012
"235",235,"New York Abortion Activists Spied On Pro-Lifers, Then Lied About Them In Court","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-07-31"," In May 2018, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman resigned from office in disgrace following reports that he had physically assaulted four women. Before his departure, Schneiderman had launched a year-long investigation into peaceful pro-life protestors. He eventually filed suit against 13 individuals in June 2017, alleging violations of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) and the state and city corollaries. Ironically, in a press release announcing the lawsuit, Schneiderman accused the protestors of “threatening, violent, and obstructive behavior” at Choices Women’s Medical Center, a Queens, New York abortion facility.  However, after holding a hearing on the claims, a federal judge found the attorney general’s witnesses were not reliable and “that despite the availability of hundreds of hours of video evidence, the [attorney general] has not cited a single video that corroborates the witness testimony claiming near-weekly violations. Instead, the video evidence contradicts the escorts’ accounts of protestor conduct on specific occasions.” While the decision obviously represents a victory for the defendants, most of whom are members of the Church at the Rock or Grace Baptist Church, the district court’s detailed summary of the facts proves important for another reason: It exposes the lies and tactics abortion activists and politicians rely upon to silence pro-life voices. Government Surveillance of Pro-Life Activists In her 100-plus page order, Judge Carol Bagley Amon, a George H.W. Bush appointee, dispassionately detailed Schneiderman’s efforts to keep the Christian protestors quiet, and why. At a press conference held outside the Choices facility to announce his lawsuit against the protestors, Schneiderman declared this is “not a nation where you can choose your point of view.” In furtherance of these efforts, the attorney general dispatched undercover investigators to Choices, with most of the investigators “pretending to be patients and their companions, and wearing hidden cameras recording video and audio.” But, as Bagley Amon explained, “[d]espite these investigative activities, the [attorney general] did not call any of its investigators as witnesses, and introduced few of the undercover videos as evidence.”  In addition to the undercover investigators, Schneiderman used two of the abortion “escorts”—volunteers who walked abortion clients into the Choice facility—to help gather evidence. The escorts, Pearl Brady and Theresa White, wore recording devices and helped prepare a “protester dossier” that collected personal information about the protestors. White recorded the protestors’ license plate numbers and periodically searched the Internet for information about the protestors. Brady also conducted Internet searches to learn information about the individuals protesting outside Choices and “created and maintained a Facebook account in which she pretended to be ‘Shelly Walker,’ a vocal and fictitious anti-abortion advocate. Brady used this fake account to ‘friend’ some of the protestors on Facebook, gather information about them, and determine whether they posted online any of the photos and videos they took outside Choices.” In Court, Pretend You Don’t Know The Truth Brady also used Facebook to communicate via “group chat” with fellow escort witnesses about how to testify in depositions: “Just remember,” she said, “yes, no, I don’t know, I don’t remember, and I don’t understand the question. Short answers. Don’t elaborate. This is for them to get more information, and it’s our job to give them as little help as possible.” These “directions” led the federal judge to question Brady’s veracity. The attorney general called Brady, White, and several other escorts to testify as witnesses at a hearing held between February 12 and March 6, 2018. The judge found these witnesses’ testimony largely unreliable based on the “inconsistencies between [the witnesses’] descriptions of protestor conduct and the conduct shown in the supporting videos and photographs.” Although the district court generously called the witnesses’ sworn testimony “exaggerated descriptions of protestor misconduct,” “inconsistencies,” or “misremembered specific events,” the truth is the abortion activists lied.  For instance, one escort testified that two protestors “moved into [her],” but when questioned further revealed they had not actually moved “into her” but only close to her. The same escort had also testified in a deposition that the defendants had unlawfully obstructed clients from entering the abortion facility, but admitted after being confronted with a video recording that there was no such obstruction. The district court also reviewed the security videos admitted as evidence and concluded that, contrary to the attorney general’s claim, the videos did not show the protestors obstructing access to Choices. Additionally, a security guard falsely testified that protestors would “shoulder check” clients, but when questioned on cross-examination, he admitted that what he really meant was that someone accidentally bumped into another person. More Doctored and Exaggerated Evidence Beyond the false testimony from the abortion escorts, the attorney general attempted to prove one of the protestors illegally intimidated clients when she filmed women on two occasions. The judge, however, noted that the protestor credibly testified that they “began filming because they had ‘a lot of incidents where the escorts would just surround, surround us ladies, at least those that were giving out literatures, [sic] and they would purposely push us out the way [sic] so, to have something documented, to have it on video just to protect ourselves because it’s going to be, when they call the cops, I want to be able to show the cops we didn’t do anything wrong.” Given the escorts’ propensity to lie, the protestors acted prudently, as well as legally, since they avoided capturing the clients’ faces on video. Nonetheless, Bagley Amon refused to find that the witnesses intentionally lied at the hearing, stating instead “their overstatements of what occurred and who caused it are colored by their views that the protestors are overzealous and that it is the escorts’ mission to shield patients from any interaction with them.” But it wasn’t just the abortion activists’ testimony that was euphemistically “overstated,” it was also forms the abortion facility kept supposedly detailing confrontations with the protestors. The attorney general attempted to admit these forms, which consisted of “Clinic Escort Recaps” and “Protester Experience Questionnaires,” but the judge refused to give that “evidence” any weight, finding the forms were not reliable. For instance, the Clinic Escort Recap forms, which escorts completed during a debriefing inside the abortion facility after the protestors left, purportedly provided an overview of the day’s events and noted any significant incidents. But the details included were false. Bagley Amon illustrated this problem by pointing to one Clinic Escort Recap that stated: “Mary Lou called [the police] at 8:10 after being shoved by Ron and Griepp.” But, as Bagley Amon noted, the escort admitted during the hearing that the men did not “actually shove her,” but just moved toward her very quickly. The attorney general also sought to prove the protestors violated the law by sharing the responses clients provided in “Protester Experience Questionnaires.” These questionnaires asked clients to summarize any interaction with protestors and any efforts to prevent them from entering the abortion facility. The judge refused to consider this evidence because only a sampling of the questionnaires was submitted. Most were destroyed. When asked about the facility’s decision to destroy the forms, the abortion facility’s director of the volunteer escort program lied, claiming she had a system for deciding which questionnaires to keep, before eventually admitting she had no system. Bad Behavior Is a Bad Reason to Respond In Kind? Although the judge refused to call the abortion facility witnesses liars, she nonetheless concluded that their testimony was “insufficiently reliable” to support the attorney general’s accusation that the defendants used force against the escorts and clients. The district court likewise rejected claims that the defendants intentionally harassed the clients, in violation of the access laws. Yet the judge added a word of caution, telling the defendants that her “decision should not embolden the defendants to engage in more aggressive conduct,” noting that some of the protestors’ actions came close to crossing the line. When a client asks to be left alone, voluntarily disengaging is evidence of goodwill. The judge added a practical point that pro-life protestors would be wise to heed: When a client asks to be left alone, voluntarily disengaging is evidence of goodwill. Continuing to hound the women will annoy and not persuade, and not only violates the law but would be contrary to the defendants’ stated objectives. Goodwill and non-confrontational offers of help, however, won’t placate abortion activists, as seen most recently when the Texas-based Whole Woman’s Health abortion facility lobbied the South Bend, Indiana mayor to prevent a pregnancy resource center from locating next door. The nearly 35-year-old Women’s Care Center pledge to prohibiting all protesting on its property and stressed that there has never been an act of violence associated with its organization. Nonetheless, the Democratic major, Pete Buttigieg, vetoed the common council’s rezoning approval necessary for the Women’s Care Center to open. Buttigieg justified his decision based on the same type of evidence Bagley Amon found worthless— abortion facility employees’ self-reported, anecdotal claims of violence. Whole Woman’s Health’s reliance on fake statistics benefitted the abortion provider no more than the New York-based Choice abortion facility’s attempt to silence protestors with false claims of violence. Following the mayor’s veto and the common council’s failure to override the veto, a business owner across the street offered to sell his property (which was properly zoned) to the Women’s Care Center. This location proves even more ideal, because women facing crisis pregnancies will be able to access the pregnancy resource center without crossing paths with the protestors picketing across the street.

"236",236,"NBC’s Kristen Welker Lied Repeatedly About Democrats’ Extreme Abortion Position","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-09-18"," Kristen Welker brazenly and repeatedly lied in a bizarre, conspiracy-laden debate with former President Donald Trump on Sunday. The show was her first time as the permanent host of “Meet The Press,” previously hosted by Democrat activist Chuck Todd.



Welker interrupted her own pre-taped debate with the president to insert her own “fact checks” that were false or were not responsive to actual claims Trump made. For example, she falsely claimed there is no evidence President Biden had pressured Attorney General Merrick Garland to indict his primary political opponent, Trump. In fact, in addition to statements calling for efforts to prevent Trump from running, that pressure campaign was publicly laundered for all the world to see through The New York Times on April 2, 2022, in an article headlined “Garland Faces Growing Pressure as Jan. 6 Investigation Widens.” The article reported that Biden was extremely frustrated by Garland not having indicted Trump and, further, that Biden was telling people he wanted Trump prosecuted. The Times’ White House stenographers said Biden “wanted Mr. Garland to act less like a ponderous judge and more like a prosecutor who is willing to take decisive action.”



Trump noted in a response to Welker that Hunter Biden’s influence-peddling scandal implicates Biden, so Welker interrupted the pre-taped interview to insert a defense of Biden in which she responded to something Trump didn’t say. She claimed there was no evidence Biden personally benefited financially from his family’s influence-peddling scheme. But even if the point was relevant to what had been said, there is evidence — in the form of multiple texts from Hunter Biden claiming he pays his father’s bills. Those messages were found on the laptop Welker previously downplayed and ignored when she moderated a 2020 presidential debate.



Welker also pushed an absolutely insane conspiracy theory held by some activists on the left that Trump had wrestled a Secret Service agent in an armored vehicle on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump seemed taken aback that his debate partner either believed that outlandish story or pretended to believe it. 




WELKER: So you dispute that account?



TRUMP: Dispute it? Who wouldn’t dispute it? She’s — the craziest account I’ve ever heard. You mean that I was in “The Beast,” and she said I was in “The Beast,” and the Secret Service didn’t want — so I took a guy who was like a black belt in karate and grabbed his neck and tried to choke him —



WELKER: What happened —



TRUMP: How ridiculous. 




Welker also complained about the lack of a military crackdown on Jan. 6 rioters and falsely claimed that then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had nothing to do with preparing the Capitol for protests. In fact, security of the Capitol was one of her main jobs as speaker. The House sergeant at arms is the chief law enforcement officer for the site and serves under the speaker. Multiple law enforcement officials have criticized Pelosi for not acting on intelligence regarding the Jan. 6 protest. NPR reported that Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund made six requests of House and Senate security officials for National Guard troops but was denied. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser also discouraged National Guard help.



Shocking Lies About Abortion



But none of that is as bad as Welker’s brazen lies about Democrats’ actual abortion agenda. Much of the interview was devoted to Welker pushing her own pro-abortion talking points. For example, her first question sounded like it could have been written by Planned Parenthood, in which she pushed the false pro-abortion claim that directly and intentionally killing an unborn child in the womb is sometimes medically necessary for women. “So my question for you, Mr. President, is: How is it acceptable in America that women’s lives are at risk, doctors are being forced to turn away patients in need, or risk breaking the law?”




TRUMP: So you have Roe v. Wade, for 52 years, people including Democrats wanted it to go back to states so the states could make the right. Roe v. Wade — I did something that nobody thought was possible, and Roe v. Wade was terminated, was put back to the states. Now, people, pro-lifers, have the right to negotiate for the first time. They had no rights at all, because the radical people on this are really the Democrats that say, after five months, six months, seven months, eight months, nine months, and even after birth you’re allowed to terminate the baby —



WELKER: Mr. President, Democrats aren’t saying that. I just have to, Democrats are not saying that.




Welker lied in her response. In fact, nearly every single elected Democrat supports forcing states to allow unborn children to be killed throughout all nine months of pregnancy. Given a choice of whether to vote for or against legislation requiring states to permit the killing of unborn children up to the moment of birth, nearly all elected Democrats vote enthusiastically for that.



It’s an extreme and radical position, but it’s one they hold, on the record. It is indisputable.



For example, on Feb. 28, 2022, only one Democrat senator voted no on a radical abortion bill. As Alexandra DeSanctis wrote, the bill “is an effort to ‘codify Roe,’ not only declaring abortion a fundamental right — for any reason, throughout all of pregnancy — but also nullifying any state law that prohibits or regulates abortion. The bill would forbid state laws protecting unborn children after they’re old enough to survive outside the womb. It would nullify bans on abortions chosen for discriminatory reasons, such as the unborn child’s sex or diagnosis with a disability. It would prohibit even the most modest regulations such as informed-consent laws, waiting periods, ultrasound requirements, and even safety standards for abortion clinics.”



It passed the Democrat House the previous year with only two Democrats voting against it. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who for some time claimed to be pro-life, voted for the bill. That’s how much Democrats are embracing a radical pro-abortion agenda, contrary to Welker’s lies.



Guy Benson noted that the 2017-2018 Congress voted on a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks, with exceptions. Roughly 97 percent of congressional Democrats voted against it. “Only 7 countries on earth allow barbaric abortions after 20 weeks. This is their official position, as a matter of record,” Benson wrote.



Laws protecting children who have reached 15 weeks’ gestation are popular. Corporate media, however, lie about the extremism of Democrats’ stated position in an effort to help them politically.



When Trump mentioned that in a 2016 debate he had called Hillary Clinton out for her support of abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy, Welker falsely claimed Democrats do not support that. In fact, Clinton struggled to respond precisely because she does believe there should be no protection from abortion for any child for any reason at any point in pregnancy.



When Trump referenced that some Democrats even support having newborn children die, Welker claimed no Democrat supports that. In fact, that was a major issue in 2019 in Virginia. A Democrat delegate in the Virginia legislature named Kathy Tran pushed legislation allowing abortion even when a mother is delivering a baby, to which Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam said in support of the legislation that if such a situation were taking place, the baby would be delivered and allowed to die. 



Welker lied about Democrats’ actual position on abortion at least four times in her debate with Trump. Her panel of analysts to discuss her debate with Trump included Laura Jarrett, the daughter of top Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett, and two other left-wing journalists.



Trump’s Response



Trump’s response to the questions generated quite a bit of anger among supporters of Gov. Ron DeSantis and other pro-lifers — and rightly so. Trump was asked if he supported DeSantis’ signing of a heartbeat bill, passed by the Florida legislature. That bill protects children who have detectable heartbeats from being killed.



“I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake,” Trump said, part of his primary strategy of attacking DeSantis for everything, including his greatest policy achievements. Whether Trump was speaking morally or speaking politically, he was wrong. It is never a terrible thing to protect unborn children from having their lives violently ended. Thousands of babies’ lives have been saved via heartbeat laws. And if by “mistake,” he meant a political miscalculation, he’s wrong there as well.



Govs. Brian Kemp of Georgia, Bill Lee of Tennessee, Mike DeWine of Ohio, and Greg Abbott of Texas also signed abortion bans in the months leading up to their 2022 reelections, and all of them were reelected resoundingly. DeSantis won reelection by nearly 20 points.



When the Supreme Court finally overturned the unconstitutional Roe v. Wade decision, returning abortion law to the people, it meant that state and federal legislatures could once again decide abortion law. States such as California will enact radical pro-abortion laws while other states such as Florida, Ohio, Tennessee, and Georgia will be more in line with the rest of the developed world in allowing some protections for unborn children.



To say it’s a mistake for pro-life states to pass pro-life laws is simply wrong, both morally and politically.



The rest of Trump’s response was mostly about finding some ground between Democrats’ radical support of abortion through the moment of birth and a complete ban. While many pro-lifers want all unborn children and their mothers to be protected from the violence of abortion, there is a political argument for pointing out how radical Democrats’ position is and pushing for a compromise around 15 weeks, an extremely popular position with voters. Trump’s problem is that he seems to be resting on his laurels of being the first United States president to address the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., and having appointed three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs v. Jackson decision. These are admittedly impressive laurels.



Trump’s 2016 election rested in large part on the support he received from pro-life voters. He served them well as president. But he should remember that the pro-life political movement didn’t end with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In many ways, the Dobbs decision merely allowed that movement to begin to fight for state and federal laws that protect unborn children and their mothers. Trump should not take continued pro-life support for granted even as he pushes against a propaganda press and attempts to make known how radical and extreme Democrats are on abortion.

"237",237,"Why Don’t Consumer Protections Apply To The Abortion Industry?","Dusek","Nick",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-07-11"," The argument for consumer protection laws, as the name implies, is that they protect consumers from harmful business practices and hold accountable the businesses that engage in them. We accept, and some even welcome, consumer protection laws in nearly all industries, and as new products and services are created, new regulations follow closely behind. The Left is particularly active in demanding regulations from here to Sunday on myriad market interactions, restricting the ability of individuals to make decisions as they see fit. Yet one industry seems to be immune to consumer protection, and at the Left’s overt insistence: the abortion industry. For abortion, all talk of consumer protection is cast aside to guarantee unrestricted access to medical procedures that threaten the health of the many women who seek them (not to mention its effects on their babies). A recent Texas law requiring “admitting-privileges and the surgical-center requirements” for abortion facilities “place a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion, constitute an undue burden on abortion access, and thus violate the Constitution,” the Supreme Court recently ruled in its 5-3 decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt.  To understand why abortion is the exception to the consumer protections rules, we need to understand what consumer protection law is and how it is applied. Four Basic Consumer Protection Principles Consumer protection law is not a single unified body of law, but rather a series of separate laws governing specific industries, products, and practices. As HG.org, a legal information site, explains, these laws “have come into existence through a series of legal disputes, and have been shaped by the results of those cases.” According to their website, there are four basic consumer “rights” that, although they are not officially codified, are generally acknowledged as the basis for these laws. These are the principles of safety, information, choice, and petition (or “to be heard”). A consumer’s right to safety is probably the most apparent in our everyday lives. Products are constantly being recalled over consumer safety concerns, and although the majority of product recalls are voluntary, companies found to have knowingly neglected a safety issue in one of their products are often held legally responsible in the lawsuits that ensue. If an airbag, instead of cushioning your head and neck in a crash, releases metal shrapnel with deadly force, that product should be recalled. If flour, granola bars, or frozen vegetables are found to contain potentially deadly food-borne bacterial pathogens, those products should be recalled. If a certain types of furniture tend to fall on and kill small children, they should be recalled. As consumers, we expect a reasonable standard of safety in the products and services we purchase, and if there is something unsafe about them, we should know.  That brings us to the next point. The second implied right of consumers, the right to be informed, is important because without adequate information, we can’t make good decisions. One of the most common applications of this right is nutrition facts labeling, which requires listing all ingredients and dietary information on food products. The right to information also underlies many of the consumer protection laws in finance. For example, the Truth In Lending Act requires, among other things, that the terms of a loan or credit card be spelled out in plain language to protect consumers from predatory lending. The third right, the right of consumers to choose, is understood as the right to have multiple choices of the same product, or a lack of market monopolies. The availability of multiple choices increases competition in free markets, which leads to increases in product quality and decreases in price. This right is invoked as the key reason for preventing monopolies from forming in certain industries, and was applied, in a general sense, in a recent court decision where the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Federal Communications Commission in saying that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet traffic as equal—an idea that has come to be known as “net neutrality.” The argument in favor of net neutrality was that allowing ISPs to prioritize certain traffic over others allows them to reduce consumer choice. Lastly, the right to be heard can be rephrased as the right of consumers to seek redress. In other words, if consumers think a certain business or industry is not responding to their concerns about safety, information, and choice, they have a right to be listened to and have their concerns investigated.  Taken together, these implied consumer rights provide the framework for ensuring that businesses act with honesty and integrity. Although the scope of each of these principles can be debated in specific cases and many counterproductive regulations are applied in the name of consumer safety, most of us agree that consumer protections, when applied appropriately, are a good thing. Abortion: Where We Don’t Protect Consumers Consumer rights and protections were at the center of the Hellerstedt, where the court aimed to assess the constitutionality of Texas laws requiring abortion clinics to meet the same facility and hospital admitting requirements as other surgical centers. The court’s majority opinion, as cited above, found that requiring abortion facilities to meet health and safety standards equal to similar outpatient surgical facilities was an “undue burden on abortion access,” and thus violated Supreme Court precedent creating an abortion-allowing right to privacy not found in the U.S. Constitution. In other words, patient safety is a legitimate interest, but is not as important as availability. In holding up access to abortion as the measure of scrutiny for abortion regulations, the court has made it nearly impossible to enact the kind of consumer protections that apply to all other industries. But more than just contradicting the precedents set by countless consumer protections cases, the justices of the majority opinion contradict their own views of constitutional rights. As an example, it is almost impossible to imagine any of the more liberal members of the Supreme Court applying this same reasoning to the Second Amendment, saying that criminal background checks and waiting periods constitute an undue burden on access to firearms, thereby violating the Constitution. In fact, we are constantly hearing that “constitutional rights aren’t absolute” and that “all rights have boundaries”—that is, all rights except for abortion. No, the Supreme Court has made it clear that whatever laws exist to protect consumers from harmful business practices, they don’t apply to abortion, that the women who seek abortion only have a right to access, not safety. Even the right to be heard is discarded, as court completely neglected the testimonies of women the abortion industry has harmed. The Supreme Court decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt demonstrates that, when it comes to abortion, the goal is not to protect women, but to protect a political ideology: “Abortion, on demand and without apology”—or safety.

"238",238,"FDA Aids Biden’s Abortion-For-All Agenda By Letting Pharmacies Sell Dangerous Abortion Pill","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-01-05"," The U.S. Food And Drug Administration endorsed President Joe Biden’s abortion-for-all agenda this week when it expanded permissions for the sale of abortion pills to include retail pharmacies and drugstores. Prior to the FDA’s recent interference, mifepristone could only be obtained via clinic, doctor, or mail order, which the Biden administration made permanent under the guise of the Covid pandemic.  Already, pill-induced abortions account for more than half of them in the United States. Now that the FDA quietly scaled back its regulation of the abortion pill even further to match the Biden administration’s post-Roe activism, that number is only expected to rise as chains such as CVS and Walgreens agree to legally dispense the fatal drug in any state where chemical abortions are legal. “We are working through the registration, necessary training of our pharmacists, as well as evaluating our pharmacy network in terms of where we normally dispense products that have extra FDA requirements and will dispense these consistent with federal and state laws,” Walgreens said in a statement after the FDA announcement. The FDA claims the pills are only approved to end an unborn baby’s life through 10 weeks of gestation. There is, however, no way for the regulatory agency to enforce that rule for women who self-administer the pill without physician oversight and ultrasounds, especially now that patients can obtain prescriptions through telehealth appointments. Now all that’s required to obtain the fatal chemical abortion pills is a video call and a CVS. If activists get their way, abortion pills could soon be available over the counter and obtainable via self-prescription. “Supplying medication abortion with less medical oversight is a dangerous and life-threatening risk due to the inability to accurately confirm gestational age and rule out possible complications without an ultrasound,” Donna Harrison, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement.  Pills like mifepristone are responsible for a more than 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits. And the data shows that, in at least 17 states with taxpayer-funded abortion, many of which have relaxed chemical abortion laws, there is a 22 percent greater risk of general hospital visits within a month of taking an abortion pill. Compared to surgical abortion, pill-induced abortions are 53 percent more likely to cause abortion-related hospital visits. That risk, studies indicate, increases year after year. “Significant morbidity and mortality have occurred following the use of mifepristone as an abortifacient,” a different study, conducted in 2021, concluded. “A pre-abortion ultrasound should be required to rule out ectopic pregnancy and confirm gestational age. The FDA AER system is inadequate and significantly underestimates the adverse events from mifepristone.” The proliferation of the abortion pill, popularized due to the intentional laxness of safety standards and extreme abortion activism of the Obama and Biden administrations, is ripe with not just ethical issues, but legal ones. Already, organizations such as Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, are suing the FDA for improperly approving abortion pills for sale and failing to vet the safety of mifepristone.  “The FDA failed America’s women and girls when it chose politics over science and approved chemical abortion drugs for use in the United States. And it has continued to fail them by repeatedly removing even the most basic precautionary requirements associated with their use,” the lawsuit states.

"239",239,"New York Is Waging Radical Pro-Abortion Lawfare On Peaceful Pro-Lifers","Patel","Bernadette",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-07-27"," Late last month, I was in Nassau County District Court watching two of my friends — one of whom had already been sentenced in federal court just a few days earlier — receive sentences for so-called misconduct. Their official crime was trespassing, and they were ultimately judged guilty by the laws of man and sentenced to jail time. As part of a mission called “Red Rose Rescue,” they had entered “All Women’s Care,” an abortion facility in Manhasset, to hand roses to women imploring them to choose life. 



One of the convicted, Laura Gies, handed her wedding rings to her husband before being escorted to jail for a 60-day sentence, while the other, Father Fidelis, was gently led to his cell. “We love you, Father! You’re a hero!” the crowd shouted while they led him out of the courtroom in chains.



That fateful day, I lost two friends to a corrupt court system that refuses to acknowledge the humanity of the unborn. Shortly after that, I was assaulted in front of multiple cops at a Planned Parenthood as I tried to peacefully hand out pro-life literature to women in crisis pregnancies. And as of last month, our group, Red Rose Rescue, is being sued by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has called us “terrorists” for trying to protect the unborn — defamation we are fighting with a countersuit. 



How did we get here? This is the tale of those of us who try to rescue the unborn through Red Rose Rescue or who simply pray outside abortion facilities through the monthly “Witness for Life” gathering. This is New York in the post-Roe landscape, and we are Gotham’s persecuted pro-lifers.



Gotham’s Radical Pro-Abortion Activists



During a July 2021 Mass, just a few days after the Dobbs decision was released, pro-abortion activists from New York City for Abortion Rights (NYCFAR) were screaming and banging drums like they do every month. The members’ shouts of “Thank God for abortion” could be heard from within the church where we had peacefully gathered to pray.



Despite being the largest gathering to date (there were roughly 200 pro-life “witnesses,” 300 pro-abortion activists, and a massive presence from local police and the Strategic Response Group), that day is a bit of a blur.



As we walked back to our church after completing our rosaries, the pro-abortion activists screamed, “Shame on you,” and lobbed threats toward us. It was our most photographed witness and left an impression on everyone at the prayer vigil. Next month would start a litany of witnesses, culminating in the arrest of seven militant pro-abortion activists.



NYCFAR is a familiar presence in Gotham, having a considerable membership. Members are leftist but vary in ideology, with some being vaguely “progressive” while others have been arrested for eco-terrorism. They greet each as “comrades” and are often well-versed in the works of Marx, Gramsci, Lenin, and other Marxist intellectuals. Like all their idols, they are not bothered by violence. Violence is the means to their end — as Trotsky famously said, “Under all conditions, well-organized violence seems to him the shortest distance between two points.”



In that spirit, my friends have been shoved into walls, cussed out, and egged all in front of police officers. Earlier this month, one demonstrator shined a laser pointer in my eye, causing temporary damage and leaving me $200 poorer because of medical expenses.



The attorney general of New York has done nothing.



Actually, that is not exactly true: Letitia James has decided that the real threat to freedom is pro-lifers and has launched a lawsuit against several of my friends. She has accused them of being domestic terrorists and is on a legal path to enshrine a 30-feet buffer zone between those listed in the lawsuit and any wrongly named “reproductive health” center.



Pro-Life Persecution



I have always known that being pro-life in New York makes me a second-class citizen. My beliefs about the unborn are not respected. If I am injured for pro-life work, it will not be investigated. And virtually no legislature will help the pro-life cause. However, at least before 2019, there was a belief in New York that the legislature would at least attempt to protect free speech and differences of opinion. After the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, something changed. 



The nervous energy of New York’s pro-abortion movement came to one of many boiling points in June of 2021, a month after the Texas heartbeat bill was signed into law and a month before the infamous July witness. Our church’s monthly Brooklyn Witness for Life was attacked by radical pro-abortion extremists. They yelled, cussed, and hit a priest in the face with their signs, breaking his glasses.



We had dealt with this group before and thought it was a one-off attack, but their hostility only increased. They vowed to picket us every month to try to stop us from holding Mass and peacefully praying outside the Brooklyn Planned Parenthood. The saga ended in August 2021 when two of their members were arrested. Nevertheless, the church hosting the Mass was frightened by the violence and threats directed toward them and decided not to host our witness going forward for fear of physical harm to the church and broader parish community.



On Dec. 3, 2021, I was outside the Supreme Court building in D.C. at the Dobbs rally for opening arguments. I was there with hundreds of pro-lifers, praying and praising God, imploring him to end legalized abortion, and hoping that after 50 years, Roe would finally be overturned. Next to us was a smaller but more sinister group of pro-abortion activists, brazenly taking what they claimed were abortion pills on camera. They knew they were losing, so they doubled down on their performative antics.



Jesus said to His disciples, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from Heaven” (Luke 10:18). Over the months in 2021, I saw the pro-aborts fall like lightning from their pinnacle of legalized abortion on demand. It was in May, right after the Dobbs decision was leaked, when their descent started. They surrounded our parish, screaming and yelling. A woman dressed in a Trump mask and a diaper tried to break into our church.



It was disturbing but small potatoes compared to what came next. As more states adopt pro-life measures, the radical pro-abortion fall becomes even more violent, but they know that physical intimidation alone will not work.



Now they are trying to legally persecute us and are mobilizing the power of the state and federal government to achieve their goals.



Pro-Life Resistance in America’s Abortion Capital



New York state is arguably the nation’s abortion capital. Our governor has stockpiled 150,000 abortion pills and is quick to sign any pro-abortion legislation that Planned Parenthood brings to her desk. However, when it comes to reducing crime or slightly reforming zoning to make more affordable housing, she is inept. Gov. Kathy Hochul and her administration are ruthless in their efforts to try to squash our small voice of prayerful witness to the dignity of human life. 



In White Plains in August 2022, a judge sentenced three friends of mine, Father Fidelis, Mathew Connolly, and William Goodman, to a maximum of three months in jail for pro-life activities offending leftist sensibilities.



But it’s not just the state. After the Dobbs decision, the federal government thought we were not suffering as much as we could be and decided to come after us as well. They arrested Father Fidelis and tried him for an outdated and unconstitutional FACE Act violation. His crime was putting a lock on a gate and talking to vulnerable women, offering them assistance and help with any unplanned pregnancy. In any normal context, the worst punishment he would receive would be a fine, but under Merrick Garland’s DOJ, he was given the maximum sentence of six months in federal prison for trying to help vulnerable women in need.



However, we are fighting back. Our countersuit against James for defamation and civil rights violations is an important step. We have also issued appeals for all unjust sentencings that Red Rose Rescuers face. After more than a year, we finally obtained a police blockade to walk down the street to pray.



Letitia James, New York state, and the federal government have made it clear that they do not care about the lives of the unborn. They have made it even clearer that they do not care about the lives and physical safety of pro-lifers who dare to challenge the culture of death. Like Satan trying to tempt and lead all followers of Christ to sin, the state is persecuting us, hoping we will falter in our pro-life beliefs or stop doing pro-life work. I certainly won’t, and neither will my friends.



The persecution is here and will only get more intense, but we will continue to stand for life.

"240",240,"No, Overturning Roe v. Wade Will Not Make Abortion Illegal","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-10-30"," Last week, after the House Judiciary Committee announced its upcoming hearing on H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017, TeenVogue took to its pixels to proclaim: “Republicans Are Trying to Ban Abortion After 6 Weeks of Pregnancy.” As TeenVogue explained, H.R. 490, sponsored by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), would make it a federal crime to knowingly perform an abortion “without determining … whether the fetus has a detectable heartbeat,” “without informing the mother of the results of that determination,” or “after determining . . . that the fetus has a detectable heartbeat.”  The article’s author, Sammy Nickalls, warned that “the GOP is officially aiming to ban abortions …at six weeks, before many women even realize they’re pregnant.” But in the midst of her fevered alarm, Nickalls readily admits H.R. 490 “likely won’t pass in the House and the Senate.” The abortion-rights Left often follows a similar tactic—seeking to frighten pro-choice women into believing that just one more conservative justice and poof, Republicans will force women to undergo pregnancy or resort to back-alley abortions. Of course, the “forced to undergo pregnancy” narrative is ridiculous, as I’ve pointed out before, and which the strained verbiage alone should give away. But equally absurd is the notion that another originalist justice, and a subsequent overturning of Roe v. Wade, will render all, or even most, abortions illegal. Rather, if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, abortion law will merely revert to the constitutionally charged lawmakers: those elected by the people to serve in the legislative branch. Jettisoning Roe v. Wade Won’t Jettison Legislatures Federally, assuming Congress establishes its authority under the commerce clause or another constitutional provision to regulate abortion, legislation will likely only focus on late-term abortions and informed consent laws because, with or without Roe, the House and Senate will continue to boast members from liberal Massachusetts to conservative Texas and every gradation in between. Also with or without Roe, the Heartbeat Protection Act and other similar restrictive provisions will fail to garner the necessary votes to pass Congress.  At the state level, the results will vary, with blue-state legislatures such as California continuing to guarantee abortion on demand and paid for by taxpayers, while the lawmakers of red states such as Texas will likely limit abortion to the first trimester. Herein lies a little secret abortion-rights activists have concealed in their warnings of a post-Roe “reproductive rights” Armageddon: Judges in at least 15 states have already found a state constitutional right to abortion that is actually broader than the right invented in Roe v. Wade. And if there is a state constitutional right to abortion, a state legislature will lack the ability to pass laws prohibiting even the most draconian abortion practices. Abortion Activists Have Laid Judicial Groundwork Further, while most of the states with a constitutionally protected “right” to abortion swing left, such as Oregon, Illinois, and Vermont, pro-choice activists have been silently preparing for the potential overturning of Roe by attempting to establish a state constitutional right to abortion in conservative states by turning to those states’ liberal judicial branches. Kansas is the latest target in this clandestine effort to guarantee a virtually unlimited “right” to abortion, no matter what the populace thinks. So while abortion-rights activists continue to warn of fanatics on the Right, they know full well that the legislative branch would fail in any attempt to pass what they view as extreme laws. But the Left continues to raise the specter of “forced birth” to avoid discussing the merits of mainstream legislation, such as a ban on abortions at 22 weeks of pregnancy.  So why, then, did King present the heartbeat bill if it would never pass? Why not focus instead on a ban on late-term abortions instead of feeding the Left’s apocalyptic narrative of a post-Roe America? While some may view the effort as an attempt to placate the base, I am more inclined to believe it is a matter of principle: Whether or not society will ever support legislation prohibiting abortion’s killing of innocent human beings, it is wrong. The heartbeat bill seeks to preach this principle. The proposed legislation does more. The heartbeat bill also forces the media to momentarily drop the euphemisms the abortion-rights community hides behind and report the facts—that an unborn baby has a heartbeat at six weeks’ gestation. Abortion supporters don’t like it one bit, as seen by Ob-Gyn Dr. Jen Gunter’s plea to the press to “stop calling them ‘heartbeat’ bills and call them ‘fetal pole cardiac activity’ bills.” That is so strange, because when my son was four weeks old in utero, my ob-gyn said “there’s the heartbeat.” Not: “There’s the fetal pole cardiac activity.” But then again, Gunter likely calls the baby a baby too—unless he’s about to be killed. No euphemism or constitutional “right” can alter that truth. ","https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/30/no-overturning-roe-v-wade-will-not-make-abortion-illegal/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"241",241,"Can California Legally Force Pro-Lifers To Point Pregnant Women To Abortion Centers?","Miller","Mark",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-03-14"," When a 21-year old single, pregnant, drug user who we’ll call Julie found herself homeless and with nowhere to turn, her father’s suggestion to abort her preborn child made sense to her. Her father even scheduled an appointment for her with the abortionist. But Julie’s mother stepped in. She knew a local organization called Mary’s Shelter that helped young women in these circumstances. After speaking with the volunteers there, Julie decided to keep her baby and move in to the shelter. She earned her G.E.D. before her baby was even born, got clean, and — as she puts it — found “a light at the end of the tunnel.” All while living with strangers who did not know her before she called them, but understood she needed help.  An organization with the motto “saving lives, two at a time,” did just that. For years, pregnant women with nowhere else to turn have found a helping hand all across the country at facilities like Mary’s Shelter — sometimes called Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs), Pregnancy Resources Centers (PRCs), or Maternity Homes. These facilities, some 2,500 or so across the country, all share the same overarching mission: to put pro-lifers’ money where their mouths are. These facilities demonstrate that pro-lifers care about the child and mother before birth and after. The pro-choice movement fears these organizations because their existence undercuts the abortion hegemony pro-choicers seek. That is why one of the nation’s largest organization of PRCs, the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA), finds itself before the Supreme Court of the United States, preparing to argue its case to the nine justices of the High Court. NIFLA has challenged a California state law designed to coerce the pro-lifers at its facilities to tell pregnant women who ask for help where they can go to abort their preborn children. NIFLA will tell the justices that law violates the First Amendment rights of pro-lifers. NIFLA is right.  This case asks whether the government can require licensed professionals to advertise services the government wishes to promote but the professionals do not. A California law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act (FACT Act), requires clinics “whose primary purpose is providing family planning or pregnancy-related services,” like the facilities described above, to deliver to each client the following message: “California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women.” There is an exception for clinics that actually enroll clients in these “family planning” programs, which means that the law applies only to clinics that oppose the very program — abortion — the government forces them to advertise. The Stated Reason For The Law Does Not Hold Up To Scrutiny The proponents of the law would have it believed that women mistakenly visit PRCs, CPCs, and maternity homes seeking abortions, because these facilities deceive the women about what they do (save lives) and don’t do (end them). But women certainly have no problem finding abortion providers in California. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice institution, reports that in 2014 women obtained 157,350 abortions in California. So the numbers simply betray the proffered reason for the law. Women in California know where to abort the unborn, and they have no problem procuring abortions at the more than 500 facilities in the state that provide them. The reason for the law does not hold up to scrutiny. That’s likely because the reason the government offers for the law is a pretext; the real reason is to force pro-lifers to pay homage to the pro-choice regime. But that reason violates the First Amendment. The First Amendment includes the right not to speak, but the FACT Act takes that right away. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to strike the law down, claiming the law addressed “professional speech” purportedly less worthy of First Amendment protection than other speech, despite the fact that the statute does not implicate professional speech at all. Even if the so-called professional speech doctrine has a place in our constitutional order, the speech at issue here does not fit into it.  Nor is the law defensible like state “informed consent” laws that require abortionists to inform mothers of the medical risks they face with abortion. There, the abortionist has specialized knowledge that the doctor must convey to the patient to obtain that patient’s informed consent to the procedure, just as a doctor would do before any significant medical procedure. Here on the other hand, the staff will not perform a medical procedure on a patient, thus no need for informed consent exists, and no medical justification to require pro-lifers to violate their conscience can be found — as if it ever could. The Reckoning For Pro-Abortion Sentiments Is Approaching 2017 will be remembered as the year of the Reckoning. Women rightfully forced society to come to terms with the way some men took advantage of their power to force women to do their sexual bidding or face reprisal. Those of us who critiqued President Clinton for taking advantage of a young woman in the Oval Office may have questioned what took so long. But, nevertheless, those punished — Harvey Weinstein, Matthew Lauer, and Bill O’Reilly, among others — certainly deserved the cosmic justice they faced in 2017. But there’s another reckoning to come, and the pace of change in modern society suggests it will come soon. By cloaking the termination of human life behind the word “choice,” Planned Parenthood, NOW, NARAL, and the Roe decision have successfully obscured the scientific reality of abortion — just as the powerful men who visited their crimes upon less powerful women obscured the reality of their offenses with their power. The pro-choice movement has used its power to obscure what abortion entails, what abortion does to the most powerless in our society. The great civil libertarian, Nat Hentoff, had it right: “Human life is a continuum — from the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterine lining to birth to death. Setting up divisions of this process to justify abortion — as in Roe v. Wade — is artificial. It’s a denial of biology. Whether in the fourth or 14th week, it is the life of a developing human being that is being killed.” America waking up to the reality of abortion is the reckoning to come. Laws that prohibit partial-birth abortion have moved us towards that reckoning, because they forced society to face the reality of one type of abortion procedure. The recent wave of laws prohibiting dismemberment abortions will advance us further still. And then, when the reckoning finally comes, the law will follow where it should have in Roe. That is what the pro-abortion advocates know, and it is why they now try, with laws like the California FACT Act, to force pro-life advocates, against their will, to instruct women on where to obtain abortions. The pro-abortion rights advocates think if they force pro-lifers to tacitly endorse abortion in this manner, they can stave off the reckoning. If you won’t sing the praises of abortion voluntarily, then we’ll make you sing the tune using the power of the state. Or so the pro-choice legislators in California believe. But the First Amendment does not allow this abuse of state power. I end where I began. Julie now has a four-year-old, because Julie’s mother sent her to Mary’s Shelter, where the staff told her about the beautiful life she had growing inside of her and how she had the choice to make her life better — and to save her own child’s life — if she allowed them to help her. She did. Now imagine a world where those believers in the unconscionable nature of abortion were instead forced to tell Julie where to abort her baby. Or imagine Julie approaching Mary’s Shelter, seeing a sign on the door telling her where to abort her baby, and concluding there was no room at this inn for her or her child. That is the world abortion-rights advocates want. It is a world which rejects free speech in favor of government-compelled speech. It is a world that rejects a culture of life and instead advocates death. But it is not the world our Founding Fathers envisioned when they wrote the First Amendment. As former Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson said in declaring it unconstitutional to force students against their will to salute the flag: “To sustain the compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards the individual’s right to speak his own mind, left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind.” Jackson explained that simply would not do. And so it is here. The Supreme Court should inform California it cannot force pro-lifers to offer fealty to abortion against their will.  The First Amendment does not allow it. A nation that professes to believe in freedom cannot allow it. ","https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/14/can-california-force-pro-lifers-to-point-women-to-abortion-centers/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"242",242,"Kansas Lawmakers Unveil Pro-Life Constitutional Amendment To Undo The Court’s Absurd ‘Right To Abortion’ Decision","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-01-16"," Less than a year after the Kansas Supreme Court declared in a 6-1 decision in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt that the state’s 150-plus-year-old constitution established a fundamental right to abortion, a coalition of pro-life organizations and legislators today announced efforts to undo the court’s decision by amending the Kansas Constitution.
At a Thursday morning press conference, Senate President Susan Wagle, Reps. Susan Humphries and Susan Concannon, and other members of the Kansas Legislature joined representatives from Family Policy Alliance of Kansas, Concerned Women for America of Kansas, Kansas Catholic Conference, and Kansans for Life to unveil the text of the proposed “Value Them Both” constitutional amendment designed to override the Hodes & Nauser decision.
The two-sentenced proposed amendment is simple in structure and meaning:
Because Kansans value both women and children, the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion. To the extent permitted by the United States Constitution, the people through their elected state representatives and state senators may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, in circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother.
For this amendment to take effect, both the Kansas Senate and House must approve the proposed constitutional amendment by two-thirds majority, at which point it will be placed on the ballot for voters to decide on passage based on a majority vote. Whether the amendment will appear on the August primary ballot or the general election ballot in November 2020 will be up to the legislature.
Of course, that is assuming the amendment receives the requisite two-thirds support. Republicans hold enough seats to approve the constitutional amendment, with a 29 to 11 split in the 40-member Kansas Senate and an 84 to 41 advantage in the 125-seat House. Notwithstanding the national platforms of the respective parties, however, pro-abortion and anti-abortion perspectives do not split precisely down the political divide. Brittany Jones, a lawyer with the Family Policy Alliance, agreed, telling The Federalist, “Kansas is really a three-party system, with the ‘moderates’ of each party difficult to predict.”
Lobbying and public outreach on the amendment may also have an effect, with the abortion industry likely spending millions to maintain the victory it achieved in Kansas by executing on its stealth “strategy of using liberal judges in conservatives states to invent a state constitutional right to abortion — both as a failsafe should the United States Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade and as a means of attacking state restrictions on abortion upheld by federal courts.”
Last year, we already saw Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes, “the advocacy and political arm of Planned Parenthood in Kansas,” pushing its narrative that an amendment to the Kansas Constitution would be an assault on “women’s reproductive rights” and “personal and bodily autonomy,” with its Regional Director of Public Policy Rachel Sweet testifying before the Kansas Special Committee on Federal and State Affairs. “It is vital that Kansas legislators realize that they will not be on the right side of history should they allow a vote that could strip rights from Kansas women,” Sweet intoned.
Sweet’s soundbite, though, misrepresents the significance of the amendment, which would merely return the status quo to abortion regulation in Kansas. Without the amendment, “Every reasonable, publicly-supported regulation of the abortion industry may soon be struck down,” Senate President Wagle noted in a press release. That is because, as Jones explained, the Kansas Supreme Court’s “recent ruling removed the legal underpinning for laws that permit regulating abortion,” including such “broadly supported regulations like bans on brutal late-term abortion and taxpayer-funded abortions, parental notification requirements, and clinic safety standards.”
“Value Them Both” thus seeks to restore “to the people of Kansas, through their elected officials, the ability to regulate the abortion industry in a way that protects both women and babies,” the coalition stressed in its press release. But for that to happen, Kansas legislators must first pass the constitutional amendment unveiled today, so voters can weigh in on the question in late summer or fall.
That the abortion industry does not want Kansans to decide the issue is telling. It is also telling that abortion lobbyists seek to downplay the Hodes & Nauser holding, instead of embracing it. For all the talk of “shout your abortion,” when it comes time to vote, the pro-abortion left resorts to obfuscation and euphemism. Let’s hope the anti-abortion right is prepared to expose the truth — both of the Hodes & Nauser decision and the reality of abortion.

Like most Americans opposed to abortion, I felt a revulsion in the story that seemed to require no explanation. But it’s become clear that an explanation is, in fact, required. While some on the left have been deflecting the ethical issue by focusing on legal technicalities, a significant number are defending the practice of tissue sale (or donation) itself. “What’s so wrong,” their argument goes, “with using the body of a fetus who was going to be aborted anyway? Isn’t it better to use it for research and cures? Your real problem isn’t with tissue donation at all,” they conclude, “it’s with abortion.”  For the most part, that last charge is true. The heart of the matter, and the core of my objection, is abortion itself. I admit that pro-choice Americans who support using fetal body parts for research are adopting a logically consistent position. If unborn children have no right to life, they certainly have no right to bodily integrity that should trouble us. In fact (the reasoning consistently goes), this practice could actually be seen as praiseworthy and redemptive: a way for aborting women and doctors to give back by doing their part for science. I understand this argument, but I couldn’t disagree more. A society that accepts the commodification of aborted babies’ body parts isn’t better or more humanitarian than one that merely allows abortion: it’s even more inhumane, more depraved. I would go so far as to say that this is a pivotal moment for Americans grappling with abortion. The Planned Parenthood videos—and the surrounding debate over the use of fetal tissue—have revealed just how closely abortion parallels the last great moral evil enshrined in American law: slavery. And like that immoral institution, very few of us have clean hands. It’s easy to demonize those directly involved in the practice, but if we refuse to acknowledge the reality of what these videos show us about ourselves, we have no right to condemn our 19th century forebears. So—setting aside the question of whether Planned Parenthood’s activities are legal—what exactly is wrong with using aborted children’s bodies for profitable research? I see three key problems.  Problem 1: It Deepens Our Hypocrisy about the Humanity of the Unborn We’ve all heard the line that an unborn child isn’t a person. This is almost the first doctrine in the pro-choice catechism: what you call a “baby” is really just a blob of tissue, a “product of conception.” Abortion is no more morally problematic than clipping your fingernails or removing a cyst. If we refuse to acknowledge the reality of what these videos show us about ourselves, we have no right to condemn our 19th century forebears. Except no one really believes this. Everyone, left and right, knows that a developing fetus is—at the very least—a future human. Our debate centers on the question of when the child attains full human rights. Is it at conception? Viability? Birth? Or even later: when she develops self-awareness? A similar dilemma plagued our 18th and 19th century ancestors. Our early republic clearly denied legal personhood to African slaves, a fact to which Chief Justice Roger Taney appealed in his infamous Dred Scott opinion: “The legislation and histories of the times, and the language used in the Declaration of Independence, show, that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor their descendants, whether they had become free or not, were then acknowledged as a part of the people, nor intended to be included in the general words used in that memorable instrument…They had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.” Note that Taney explicitly states his belief that blacks are excluded from the Declaration’s sweeping proclamations about “all men.” According to Taney’s interpretation of the Founders’ view, blacks aren’t human in the same way that whites are. Still, there was enough obvious personhood in African slaves that the Constitution recognized them as people for the purposes of determining a state’s congressional representation—at 3/5ths the value of a white person. To our shame, this deep hypocrisy about the humanity of African-Americans was embedded in our nation’s legal charter.  These unborn children are human enough to be ‘donors’ of recognizable human organs—but not human enough to enjoy legal personhood. For those trying to create a category of sub-humans, though, the tricky part is where to draw the arbitrary lines. In the same way that we moderns debate the stage at which a child becomes fully human, legislatures of the 19th century grappled with the question of how much white blood entitled someone to legal personhood. The standards varied from state to state, with many states setting the line at one-eighth to one-fourth African ancestry before a person could be owned and sold as property. After the Civil War, when Southern legislatures were busy shoring up racial segregation, the radical “one-drop rule” became more prevalent, under which any amount of African ancestry disqualified you from the privileges enjoyed by whites. In practice, personhood was in the eye of the (white) beholder. If you appeared white, your chance of living as a free citizen was high. One can’t help seeing a similar double standard today: the value of an unborn child’s life is in the eye of the mother. We all refer to the developing child as a “baby” in wanted pregnancies, rightly grieving for unborn children killed by drunk drivers or knife-wielding psychopaths. But when a mother isn’t sure she wants to be pregnant, babies become “products of conception.” They might be pre-human—sub-human—but they’re not fully human. (Maybe three-fifths human?) That’s why the undercover Planned Parenthood videos have been so jarring. In no uncertain terms, these doctors and technicians speak of harvesting hearts and livers, lungs and lower extremities. Recognizable human organs are being carefully extracted and their monetary value discussed. There is no plausibility in the argument that this is a donation of the woman’s tissue; it’s patently obvious that the mother isn’t donating her own liver, heart, lungs, or lower extremities. Clearly, like our ancestors before us, we’ve created a class of sub-humanity. These unborn children are human enough to be “donors” of recognizable human organs—but not human enough to enjoy legal personhood. We can kill them at will and use their bodies how we wish. We own them. Problem 2: It Reveals the Inherent Violence and Cruelty of Abortion I’m old enough to remember when abortion was widely spoken of as a regrettable necessity. (Remember the Clinton campaign’s line about making it “safe, legal, and rare?”) Today, abortion defenders have taken a different tack, portraying the practice not as a necessary evil but as a positive good. Abortion narratives that are unapologetic—even celebratory—are popping up everywhere. On the surface, fetal tissue donation fits that narrative perfectly: abortion becomes a way to advance medicine and help other people’s children thrive. This change in messaging from ‘necessary evil’ to ‘positive good’ exactly mirrors the defense of slavery in the United States. This change in messaging from “necessary evil” to “positive good” exactly mirrors the defense of slavery in the United States. Many early American slaveholders, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, spoke openly about the evil of slavery and the need to see it abolished—fretting only about how it should be done. “But, as it is, we have the wolf by the ear,” wrote Jefferson in 1820, “and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.” In Jefferson’s view (perhaps contrary to Taney’s later interpretation), slavery was a sin against God and nature—but it was necessary for self-preservation. As opposition to slavery grew, however, Southerners circled the wagons, discarding nuance for pro-slavery propaganda. Whereas Jefferson had spoken honestly of a master’s “despotism” and a slave’s “degrading submission,” this editorial in an 1859 newspaper paints a far rosier portrait: The intelligent, christian slave-holder at the South is the best friend of the negro. He does not regard his bonds-men as mere chattel property, but as human beings to whom he owes duties. . . . Here the honest black man is not only protected by the laws and public sentiment, but he is respected by the community as truly as if his skin were white. Here there are ties of genuine friendship and affection between whites and blacks, leading to an interchange of all the comities of life. The slave nurses his master in sickness, and sheds tears of genuine sorrow at his grave. When sick himself, or overtaken by the infirmity of age, he is kindly cared for, and when he dies the whites grieve, not for the loss of so much property, but for the death of a member of the family. This laughably idyllic image found a credulous audience only because the worst abuses—the beatings, the rapes, the heartless breakup of families—happened in private. Slavery kept its ugliest side hidden, and many Americans were too far removed to know better. This is why firsthand accounts from former slaves like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, and Solomon Northup became such an effective part of the abolitionist movement. Their work—together with Harriet Beecher Stowe’s wildly successful Uncle Tom’s Cabin—cut through the fog of pro-slavery propaganda, revealing slavery’s inherent cruelty. It takes a great deal of rationalization to quiet the horror decent people feel when they hear a blow-by-blow description of a slave being whipped to death. Many couldn’t do it. Now it’s not just Planned Parenthood who is to blame for this atrocity: it’s all of us. This is what we’ve allowed in our civilized society. In the same way, Americans across the political spectrum felt a natural revulsion when they heard Dr. Deborah Nucatola describing how “we’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m going to basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.” In the third undercover video, a former technician for StemExpress (someone clearly unfazed by the sight of blood in general) describes her first day on the job, when she fainted after being asked to identify fetal body parts. “Don’t worry, it still happens to a bunch of us,” her colleagues reassured her. “Some of us never get over it.” Planned Parenthood’s defenders have been busy telling us how irrational we are to heed that sick feeling in our stomachs. “This is all perfectly normal,” they assure us. “If you were a medical professional, you’d know how standard and ordinary these procedures are.” And that’s the terrible truth: they’re right. This is normal. It may even be entirely legal—and honestly, doesn’t that make things worse? Because now it’s not just Planned Parenthood who is to blame for this atrocity: it’s all of us. This is what we’ve allowed in our civilized society: tiny humans legally torn to pieces by the thousands, day in and day out. For years we’ve believed the happy propaganda that the abortionist “is the best friend” of women and children alike, saving them from lives of poverty and misery. (Of course, like slaves, the unborn are conveniently unable to speak for themselves.) Like our ancestors, we’ve been shielded from the reality of what happens behind closed doors. If we can see that mask torn away, quiet our horror at the ugly sight, and move on unchanged, we will have proven ourselves more morally calloused than Americans of the 1850s. Problem 3: It Ingrains a Need for Abortion in Our Way of Life Throughout the recent controversy, Planned Parenthood’s most compelling defense has been that fetal tissue research is beneficial for society: a way to find cures and save lives. (I’ll accept for the sake of argument that viable cures are indeed being found and that there’s no abortion-free way to achieve this—although these are far from settled questions.) While this is a sympathetic argument at first glance, in reality it may be the most sinister of all. This line of reasoning presumes that exploiting and commodifying “lower” humans is justified if it contributes to the welfare of “higher” humans. It threatens to make abortion an inextricable part of our everyday lives. And yes, we’ve been here before. This line of reasoning presumes that exploiting and commodifying ‘lower’ humans is justified if it contributes to the welfare of ‘higher’ humans. Historians generally acknowledge that American slavery was on the trajectory to die a natural death until the invention of the cotton gin in 1793. This dramatically increased the profitability of the cotton crop, fueling a need for more slave labor. Southern planters were far from the only benefactors: slavery had suddenly become a key part of the entire nation’s economy. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr., writes: “Understanding both how extraordinarily profitable cotton was and how interconnected and overlapping were the economies of the cotton plantation, the Northern banking industry, New England textile factories and a huge proportion of the economy of Great Britain helps us to understand why it was something of a miracle that slavery was finally abolished in this country at all.” You see, contrary to rumor, early America wasn’t populated by monstrous men who enjoyed evil for its own sake. Like today, it housed ordinary humans beset with selfishness and greed. They saw slavery in terms of its benefits for society—and as long as you weren’t a slave, there were plenty of benefits. In fact, the benefits became so big, so essential to the way of life they had come to expect, that many Americans just couldn’t live without it—even those who acknowledged its evils. Far from merely tolerating slavery, they needed slavery. If aborted fetal tissue is as beneficial and profitable as advertised, I fear the day when modern medical care—a huge part of our lives and economy—becomes so dependent on procuring babies’ bodies that we don’t just tolerate abortion: we need it. I can only imagine how vulnerable women might be subtly pressured to end their pregnancies for the sake of science, especially now that we value children more highly when they’re dead than when they’re alive. And since we’re okay with using the bodies of children who would be aborted anyway, why not ask certain women (perhaps with compensation) to carry their pregnancies further into the second trimester so we can procure better samples? How is this so much more unthinkable than what we’re doing already? Once we’ve accepted the selfish premise that unborn children are sub-human and may be sacrificed and sold for our benefit, there’s a long and gruesome way to go down that road. I can think of no greater privilege in modern America than that of the born over the unborn, and no greater inequality than the legal right of the one to kill the other. Abortion advocates should ask themselves if they’re willing to be the pampered ruling class, enjoying health and wealth—treatments for diseases, lucrative medical jobs, sex without consequences—at the expense of a murdered underclass. There is a lot of talk today about privilege and equality, but I can think of no greater privilege in modern America than that of the born over the unborn, and no greater inequality than the legal right of the one to kill the other. Mother Teresa said it best: “It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so you may live as you wish.” This doesn’t mean that those who favor abortion are monsters; they are all too human. But humans—even those of us who are good neighbors, loving parents, kind friends—are capable of great evil when we allow a moral blind spot to develop unchecked. It happened in early America, and it’s happening now. But it’s not too late to open our eyes and change. As for pro-lifers, we have some soul-searching to do too. One of slavery apologists’ favorite tactics was pointing an accusatory finger at the hardships of free blacks in the North. Similarly, you can hardly discuss abortion today without someone saying, “You pro-lifers don’t really care about children. You won’t do a thing to help them once they’re born.” Both claims are exaggerated, but they do convey a truth: condemning the sins of others isn’t enough. We need to own our part of this national tragedy and be actively involved in relieving the suffering. There are many couples waiting to adopt a newborn (and many more I’ve seen offering to adopt in the wake of this story), but we shouldn’t make the mistake of thinking this is the only way to help. There are pregnancy care centers that could use donations and volunteers, single moms who need help with bills or childcare, mentoring programs for fatherless kids, and local charities giving direct aid to those in poverty. It’s imperative for those of us who are pro-life to offer more than condemnation; we must also offer hope and help. Reducing or ending abortion is never going to be a clean, painless process. There will be costs. But ending slavery was even more complex and costly—and entirely right. It’s tempting to judge ourselves based on the moral tests our ancestors faced, congratulating ourselves on how superior we are to them. But we have the benefit of hindsight in recognizing their evils. The true test of our vision is whether we will see the evils of our own time—and the true test of our goodness is whether we will make them right.

"244",244,"Rape Does Not Justify Abortion","Payne","Daniel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-04-15"," Abortion is becoming a losing issue for the Left. The current crop of congressional Democrats are vehemently opposed to regulating abortion while more than half of Americans believe in enacting at least some restrictions on the right to legally kill unborn children. Since the deck is stacked so strongly against pro-abortion legislation, you’d expect Democrats to back down on the issue, at least a bit. Yet this has not been the case, and in their desperation liberals have in recent months begun highlighting one of the most difficult aspects of the debate, stressing the alleged necessity of abortion in the instances of pregnancy that result from rape.  Using Rape Victims as Political Pawns Last month, liberals snagged an anti-sex trafficking bill in Congress due to a Hyde Amendment-style provision that would have forbade any public funding of abortions for sex-trafficking victims. Democrats, in thrall to a powerful and relentless abortion lobby, claimed that the provision was “snuck in” without their knowledge, and the media gleefully reported this as true. It is Democrats who are perfectly happy to use sex-trafficking victims as ‘political pawns,’ opposing an anti-sex trafficking law to ingratiate themselves to the insatiable abortion lobby. This month, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Access League (NARAL) released a television ad that will run in several states. It accuses several Republican senators of refusing to support the anti-sex trafficking law “unless survivors are denied access to abortion care.” The ad implores viewers to call their senators and “tell [them] it’s wrong to use survivors as political pawns.” This is a false and fraudulent accusation. It is Democrats who are perfectly happy to use sex-trafficking victims as “political pawns,” opposing an anti-sex trafficking law to ingratiate themselves to the insatiable abortion lobby. If liberals in Congress can satisfy the likes of NARAL at the expense of victims of the sex trade, they’ll do so. This is both a personal and a political tragedy: the casualties of sadistic barbarity have become the tools of a group of elected cowards, and the worst and most baffling part is that the cowards will almost certainly be elected again despite their craven gambit. One Crime Doesn’t Legitimize Another Still more tragic is the personal history of Teresa Fedor, a member of the Ohio House of Representatives who recently voiced her opposition to Ohio’s “heartbeat” bill, which would ban abortions upon the detection of the baby’s heartbeat, with no exceptions in cases of incest or rape. Fedor stood up to point out that she had been raped more than three decades ago, had become pregnant, and had subsequently had an abortion. As she told the House:  You don’t respect my reason, my rape, my abortion, and I guarantee you there are other women who should stand up with me and be courageous enough to speak that voice. What you’re doing is so fundamentally inhuman, unconstitutional, and I’ve sat here too long. I dare any one of you to judge me, because there’s only one judge I’m going to face.
I dare you to walk in my shoes. This debate is purely political. I understand your story, but you don’t understand mine. I’m grateful for that freedom. It is a personal decision, and how dare government get into my business. Fedor’s “dare,” of course, is entirely rhetorical, as we cannot walk in her shoes, and furthermore none of us has any desire to, her experience being uniquely awful. Yet her argument is not unassailable. Although her story rightfully elicits a tremendous amount of empathy, and we are surely not to judge her in the same manner as God will, we must not be afraid to point out that she is wrong, and that the choice to abort her child was in fact the wrong one. Both NARAL and Fedor are working from the assumption that one crime unequivocally legitimates another: in this case, that rape justifies executing an unborn human being. When abortion advocates speak of carving out exemptions for rape, they are claiming that a human conceived in rape is necessarily inferior to, and less worthy of life than, a human conceived by consensual sex. Plainly, this cannot be the case. A human being’s intrinsic worth is defined not by the circumstances of his conception but by the essence of his being. Hippolytus in the third century condemned the murder of unborn children who had been conceived “either by a slave or by any paltry fellow, for the sake of [the woman’s] family and excessive wealth.” This is not to say that rape and ignominious adultery are morally equivalent; only that the children that issue from both circumstances are morally equivalent to any other child, and are as deserving of life as any other. Mass Murder Is Not a Private Matter Fedor’s impassioned speech, in other words, is in a certain sense immaterial to the larger matter at hand: the question isn’t whether Fedor had an abortion after being raped, but whether it was wrong for her to do so. If abortion is wrong—and it assuredly is—then so is abortion in cases of rape.  Fedor should not be shamed or castigated for the difficult position she was in decades ago—yet neither should she have our approval or our capitulation. We can most definitely empathize with a rape victim who chooses abortion, but we most definitely do not have to condone her behavior; we can understand why she felt she had to make such a brutal choice without agreeing that it was the right choice to make. Fedor should not be shamed or castigated for the difficult position she was in decades ago—yet neither should she have our approval or our capitulation in this matter. Civilized people do not approve of murdered babies or capitulate in the face of legalized infanticide. The abortion lobby has made great strides in trying to convince the American public that abortion is a matter of “reproductive rights.” This is a fallacy, of course; reproduction has already occurred by the time an abortion takes place, and so the matter is not one of reproduction but destruction. Abortion is a savage, terrible thing, and it should be illegal. The care, compassion, concern and assistance we give to victims of sex trafficking, and victims of rape such as Fedor, cannot obscure the facts of the matter. If the Left wishes to devalue a human life because of the way it was conceived, so be it. But Fedor is wrong: it is not a “personal decision.” It is without a doubt a public matter. The mass murder of innocent people always is. ","https://thefederalist.com/2015/04/15/rape-does-not-justify-abortion/",0.9986,0.0014,"male",2012,2012
"245",245,"The Supreme Court Shouldn’t Return Abortion To The States. It Should Ban Abortion Altogether","Jacobs","Steve",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-06-10"," In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision to reconsider Roe v. Wade this fall, Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel for Americans United for Life and perhaps the most well-known pro-life attorney, proclaimed: The court desperately needs to decentralize the [abortion] issue and send it back to the states … pro-life leaders need to think long and hard about overturning federalism and taking the issue away from the states. Forsythe’s view is consistent with his recent Wall Street Journal article, which advanced the view that “the high court could put questions about gestational limits [for abortion access] back into voters’s hands — where they belong.”  Since America is a constitutional republic and not a direct democracy, Americans don’t vote to decide who deserves the protections guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. Imagine a state with anti-immigrant leaders convincing its citizens to amend state homicide laws so they only apply to victims who are citizens. Unthinkable. Unfortunately, however, this is a matter of debate in the pro-life movement. While some advocate for the use of a states’ rights approach to overturning Roe, others support pushing for protecting the unborn’s right to life. Members of the first camp argue the Supreme Court should merely allow states to craft whichever abortion laws their citizens prefer. The second camp believes the Supreme Court should recognize unborn humans as persons within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, an interpretation amounting to a constitutional mandate requiring states to protect unborn humans with the same homicide laws that protect born humans outside of the womb. Law professor Mary Ziegler describes Forsythe as “a brilliant strategist” and the states’ rights approach as a “savvy argument.” She recently boosted years of speculation that the only difference between the two camps is merely a matter of strategy. This theory suggests people such as Forsythe do not truly believe the legality of abortion should be democratically decided; they solely support the states’s rights approach as a moderate, incremental step on the path to rights for the unborn.  But is the divide genuinely borne out of differences of opinion on timing and strategy? Or, might there be sincere, fundamental differences between those who oppose Roe due to its federalization of America’s abortion laws, and human rights advocates, who oppose abortion because they believe all humans equally deserve constitutional rights? Consider the words of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a proud pro-life Catholic and hero to many in the pro-life movement. In the 1992 case that upheld Roe, he endorsed the states’ rights approach by claiming the Supreme Court “should get out of this area [of abortion law], where we have no right to be, and where we do neither ourselves nor the country any good by remaining.” Years later, during an interview on “60 Minutes,” he rejected the rights of the unborn argument: They say that the Equal Protection Clause requires that you treat a helpless human being that’s still in the womb the way you treat other human beings. I think that’s wrong. I think when the Constitution says that persons are entitled to equal protection of the laws, I think it clearly means walking-around persons. So, if we take Scalia’s views as representative of the states’ rights camp, the argument is not that the life of an unborn child supersedes his or her mother’s right to an abortion. Rather, they argue a state’s right to prevent a woman from having an abortion supersedes that woman’s right to end her child’s life.  Consider the crucial difference. One argument represents the heart of the pro-life cause, which was founded as “the right-to-life movement” by human rights advocates dedicated to defending the right to life of all humans — born or unborn. The other argument leads to the views of pro-life Americans being distorted and cast in terms their opponents often employ: the government has the right to intrude on a woman’s reproductive choices. While Forsythe warned pro-life leaders of the dangers of the unborn rights approach, I want to caution him and other supporters of the states’ rights approach: Their approach is an unnecessary, imprudent gamble, and both science and the U.S. Constitution are on our side. Consider the views of Americans on legal abortion. Only 13 percent of Americans report preferring no abortion restrictions at any point before birth. A recent Marist poll showed 80 percent of Americans want abortion laws that protect the health of a pregnant woman and the life of her unborn child. A YouGov poll conducted in late May of this year even showed that 44 percent of Americans favor Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban while only 31 percent opposed it. Since studies show 93 percent of Americans believe abortion should be restricted after a human’s life begins, our nation can accept the fact the U.S. Constitution guarantees equal protection under the law for all humans, unborn and born. Americans will not accept the reversal of Roe, however, if the messaging they hear is that abortion rights are secondary to the rights of voters. We are not a pro-voters rights movement. We are not a pro-government movement. We are not a pro-federalism movement. We are not even an “anti-abortion” movement, which focuses on opposition to legal abortion rather than the rights of unborn humans. We are a right-to-life movement, and it is high time we live out our principles and unapologetically stand for the rights of those yet not born. The movement’s sole aim is to ensure that the rights of all humans, unborn and born, are legally protected. Let’s start acting like it.

"247",247,"What ‘Gosnell’ Media Censors Don’t Want You To See Is A True-Crime Drama About Abortion","Scheer","Holly",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-10-11"," “Gosnell: The Trial of America’s Biggest Serial Killer” tells the story of Kermit Gosnell from the early stages of the police investigation into his abortion facility through the end of his court trial. Gosnell was an American doctor convicted of murdering babies born alive after abortions, of involuntary manslaughter for the death of a mother following an abortion in his facility, and of several felony counts of late-term abortion. The film debuts across America Oct. 12, 2018, and chronicles the prosecution and police forces who worked to end Gosnell’s macabre abuses of women and children in Philadelphia. The true-crime film is based on a best-selling book written by a husband and wife team, Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinny, with a desire to tell the stories of all of the people hurt by the practices in Gosnell’s facility.  Despite the raging popularity of this genre, and book’s bestseller status, its movie faced significant roadblocks in funding, filming, and distribution, because of ideological opposition to its material—crimes in an abortion facility. First, the Crowdfunding Difficulties The film ran into issues with Kickstarter, a crowdfunding website the filmmakers initially planned to use to fund the movie’s development. The website kept taking down their page with complaints about the subject matter. “Kickstarter tried to censor us—it didn’t work,” said McAleer. Kickstarter objected to phrases the film producers used to describe what Gosnell did, including “thousands of babies stabbed to death.” Kickstarter CEO Yancey Strickler, however, asserted that they would have allowed those words on the campaign. “The creators replied with a spirited defense of the graphic depiction they wanted to include. We decided to bend our rules and give them [a] green light to launch at their convenience,” Strickler said about the wording of the campaign and his willingness to work with the film project.  Since disagreements with the phrasing and timing were delaying the progress with funding the film, however, the team relocated their efforts to IndieGoGo, another crowdfunding site. There the film raised $2.37 million, setting a record for the most money raised in a short time on the site. The the Distribution Problems Even after securing funding and actors willing to deal with the complicated and politically dangerous topics in the movie, its obstacles to production weren’t over. Creating a film is only part of getting it before consumers, and finding a distribution company proved just as difficult as the initial fundraising. Although the film was finished in October 2015 and release initially planned for 2016, it ultimately took another two years to release the film. “Each one [distributor]  would say: ‘Great, important film—just too controversial for us,'” McAleer said in a phone interview. In addition, the judge who had presided over Gosnell’s trial sued them to stop the release, adding additional delays. The lawsuit was settled, allowing the film to continue through the distribution process to its recent release. What So Many People Don’t Want You to See Spoilers below.  I knew Gosnell’s story well before viewing it, so I expected the film to be difficult to watch. It was both easier and harder to watch than a movie focusing on the grim subject of death, crime, and unrepentant evil should be. It’s well-written, beautifully filmed, and very well cast. The movie opens with a woman in Gosnell’s facility taking a cell phone picture of something, later an important part of his trial. It cuts to Detective James Wood and Assistant District Attorney Lexy McGuire right before they are pulled into the case to do a raid on what they think is an illegal prescription drug operation. The pacing is on point as the police, Drug Enforcement Administration, and FBI quickly realize that they’re not dealing with just a drug situation, and struggle to figure out how, or even whether, to proceed with a case certain to be politically full of systematic issues. How do you take on murder in an abortion facility without taking on abortion itself, and how do you take on an African-American abortion doctor without charges of racism? Much of the movie depicts the lawyers’ initial legwork building a careful case and the law enforcement officers digging through disturbing and disgusting conditions. All of this is troubling but very watchable, especially for fans of any sort of procedural drama. The juxtaposition of the seriousness of Gosnell’s crimes with his jovial and soft-spoken demeanor is jarring and off-putting, perhaps best represented by him sitting down to play classical music on his piano as the police execute a search warrant on the premises, uncovering files and evidence of wrongdoing. Far more emotional are the scenes of the grand jury, and later the courtroom. The testimony of Gosnell’s staff — untrained, often teenagers still in high school — who used handmade color-coordinated charts to administer powerful, custom-mixed drugs to patients without any doctor supervision is shocking. The attitude of a Department of Health nurse — who states that she did not investigate the facility because it would interfere with a woman’s right to choose, despite a thick stack of complaints and a large span of years since any onsite inspection had happened — is both depressing and perfectly showcases how politically motivated abortion facility regulations too often are. The courtroom scenes are difficult, but not because they’re gory or salacious. Rather, the film keeps things clean and on the surface appropriate. No overt images are shown, no blood-covered baby bodies like you might expect in a film like this. The filmmakers do have a website with resources, including some of the more important visuals from the trial itself, like the referenced photograph of Baby Boy A. But the emotional weight comes from the testimony itself, taken right from the actual case. When another doctor testifies that she has performed more than 30,000 abortions and never resorted to any of the tactics Gosnell used, it doesn’t make his actions more horrible, because they’ve been horrible all along. Rather, it reminds viewers that, even done cleanly and “safely,” an abortion results in a death. Although the facts of the case have already been well laid out publicly, the movie does a good job of keeping suspense over the verdict high. Gosnell makes you pity the jurors listening to and viewing all of the evidence, but also the prosecution — the law enforcement agents forced to stare evil in its face and wonder if this evil will escape. The line that sticks most in my mind after viewing this is one from McGuire to the District Attorney Dan Molinari on why she wanted to move forward with the case: “There’s nothing that man did illegally for 30 years that protects women or children. And you don’t have to be a pro-life activist to see that.” A Reality Worse Than Fiction It might be tempting to try to dismiss the horror of this case as overblown drama, but the reality is that this is a retelling of actual events, taken from court transcripts and the accounts of people who were there. The paper trail from the raid of the Women’s Medical Society by the DEA, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, The Pennsylvania Department of State, and the Pennsylvania Dangerous Drug Offender Unit lays out the shocking conditions of Gosnell’s facility as they found it. The reports of the investigators to the grand jury described the state of the facilty as “filthy,” “deplorable,” “disgusting,” “very unsanitary, very outdated, horrendous,” and “by far, the worst” of the places they had seen. According to the report, there was blood on the floor, on the chairs, and on the blankets patients sat on. As shown in the movie, women in the facility were sedated by unlicensed staff, working from handmade charts, with expired medication. Investigators compared patient care areas to a “bad gas station bathroom.” Proper inspections of the equipment were also lacking, leaving women who might need resuscitation in dangerous situations vulnerable—women like refugee Karnamaya Monger, who died after Gosnell botched her abortion. In case all of this was not horrifying enough, investigators found the remains of aborted babies stored disrespectfully and unhygienically. Just as the movie showed, in Gosnell’s facility trash bags on the floor, milk jugs, the employee refrigerator, and orange juice containers all contained the remains of dead babies, and a row of jars containing the severed feet cut off of babies occupied a shelf. Gosnell told one of the detectives at this time that 10 to 20 percent of the babies were older than Pennsylvania’s legal age limit of 24 weeks’ gestation—also placing them over viability at the time of their deaths. Monger’s baby was still in the freezer, and 45 babies were removed from Gosnell’s facility, all deceased. This film isn’t only a movie to see if you’re ardently pro-life. This is a movie for anyone interested in crime, in justice, in health care, and in reform. It’s an exercise in looking at what drives human desperation, but also how evil can hide in plain sight, rubber-stamped by those afraid to disturb the status quo, or worried that any oversight could lessen legal rights. It’s a story that needs to be told, and in this telling was well-crafted, walking up to the line of where the viewer would need to turn away then pulling back, allowing the full story to be digested. It’s important to assess how these things can happen in plain sight, in an era of legal abortion, when for so long we’ve been told that it’s keeping abortion legal that keeps women safe. Gosnell’s facility was legal, respected, and terribly unsafe for mothers and babies. If nothing else, this case, this film, and this story should cause people to question who is being served and helped, and who is being hurt by all this. UPDATE: In a further conversation, McAleer told me more about both the film and he and his wife’s motivations in covering the story.Some of the most important and interesting parts of that interview are below. On their motivations for making this movie and how they approached it: “We came at this from a journalistic point of view. It’s not a prolife film. It’s a journalistic film. It’s a fresh look at the story from a true crime angle.” I asked about rumors that the filming process had changed the views of some of cast on abortion, and he told me, “It changed us—myself and Ann. We would have described ourselves before this as neutral on abortion. We now realize what that means. Neutral on abortion means pro-abortion. One of the actresses came up to us at a screening recently and said, ‘This changed me from prochoice to prolife.’ It’s almost just like at the trial. Everyone who was in the trial who was prochoice at the start had their faith in abortion shattered. And they became a lot more—I’m not saying they all became prolife- but they all became very skeptical of the prochoice position.” He told me as well about his feelings on the prolife movement before beginning the project, “I always thought that those pictures were photoshopped. I didn’t trust prolife pictures that I saw. I think that what the strong point of this film is that it’s based on court room testimony. There’s no photoshopping, there’s no political slogans, there’s no grandstanding, everyone has to tell the truth. And when people hear the truth and research it they’ll be going, ‘Oh, I didn’t know that’. Planned Parenthood has done a great job of sowing mistrust of the prolife community. Of saying ‘Don’t trust those people, they’re lying.’ This will show what these abortion people said under oath in court.” I asked him about their main goal for this story and film, “Telling the truth, actually. People can do with that truth whatever they want. But it’s important for them to have the facts first.” I asked about media coverage, and lack thereof, on stories like this, and why he thinks that happens. He responded, “I think most journalists are prochoice. Some of them are abortion zealots and advocates, many of them are casually prochoice. So, they avoid anything that will tell the truth about abortion. You can see that from their failure to cover the trial. I think they want to keep the unpleasant facts hidden because they fear both the law and public opinion.” Finally, I asked what was most important for people to know before they saw this film: “Before they go in, I want them to know that it is not gory, it’s PG-13, it’s a ‘Law and Order’ episode. Don’t be worried about things you might see—there’s nothing to see. Coming out of it, I’d like them to know that it is heavily, heavily, heavily based on trial transcripts. The crazy bits in it that you think we made up are not made up, they’re true.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2018/10/11/gosnell-media-censors-dont-want-see-true-crime-drama-abortion/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"248",248,"Jen Psaki Says ‘No One’ Supports Abortion Until Birth But She And Other Democrats Support Exactly That","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-08-24"," White House press secretary turned MSNBC host Jen Psaki said “no one” backs legislation that allows for abortions throughout all nine months of pregnancy. Yet she and other Democrats have a history of doing just that; it’s why they can’t actually answer what abortion restrictions they would support. 



Psaki, in an attempt to cover for leftists’ long history of demanding abortion at any stage, confidently posted her erroneous claim during the GOP primary debate after several Republicans onstage lamented Democrats’ radical abortion agenda. 



When asked by The Federalist to clarify which abortion restrictions Psaki does support, MSNBC refused to answer. But Psaki’s track record suggests she has no problem boosting policies that make ending unborn life in the womb at any gestational stage a priority. 



During her tenure in the White House, Psaki touted Democrat-led legislation that would have codified abortion until birth in all states, for any woman who could find a doctor to label her baby “a risk to [her] life or health” — which presumably includes “emotional health” and the variety of social or economic preferences that could fall under such a broad umbrella. Another clause in the ill-named “Women’s Health Protection Act” claimed true “reproductive justice” means women can choose to have an abortion “regardless of their circumstances and without interference and discrimination.”



Psaki repeatedly reiterated from the White House press podium that her boss was “deeply committed” to advancing that abortion agenda. 




Pres. Biden is ‘very concerned’ about the Supreme Court allowing Texas’ abortion ban to remain in place, said press secretary Jen Psaki. She added that the ruling is a reminder of ‘how much these rights are at risk.’ pic.twitter.com/CaRtDkP1fC— NowThis Impact (@nowthisimpact) December 10, 2021
When leftist legislators urged their colleagues to ignore the restraints of the filibuster so their radical bill would pass, the Biden administration — including Psaki — cheered them on by promising support for nuking the key Senate procedure “if that is a change that needs to happen” to advance Democrats’ abortion position.




WATCH: Jen Psaki confirms that Biden would ""support"" a change to the Senate filibuster.Biden, 2019: ""Ending the filibuster is a very dangerous thing to do.” pic.twitter.com/9CWsQrTyNO— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 6, 2022
When the bill failed to pass the Senate in 2022, Psaki released an official White House statement condemning the GOP’s opposition to Democrats’ abortion-on-demand wish list. 



“At a time when women’s access to reproductive health care is under increased assault in states across the country, it is extremely disappointing that Senate Republicans blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would strengthen health care access and codify constitutional rights affirmed half a century ago by Roe v. Wade and in subsequent Supreme Court precedent,” Psaki wrote. 



Not only did Psaki personally promote a law that would have allowed for abortion until birth, but she regularly expressed support for blue states and elected officials that adopted the Biden regime’s extremist abortion agenda.



California, Maine, Minnesota, Colorado, New York, Alaska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont all have laws or constitutional amendments that allow abortions throughout gestation — sometimes based on a medical professional’s subjective judgment, sometimes not.



Abortion throughout all nine months isn’t a position that just some Democrat states and politicians hold. Leftist legislators all across the country have made unlimited abortion a hallmark of their legislative agendas. 




LOL Here is 5 Minutes of Democrats Admitting They Support Abortion Until Birth pic.twitter.com/17V1Vnh5CB— Eddie (@ICU1010) August 24, 2023
Despite Democrats’ incessant attempts to normalize taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, a majority of U.S. adults reject Democrats’ radical push to legalize abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy. They think abortion should at least be restricted to the first trimester and more than half say they support a 15-week abortion ban like the one Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced last year.



Only 10 percent of Americans support Democrat demands to legalize abortion up until the moment of birth. 



Psaki can pretend that the extremist positions adopted by her own party don’t exist, but she will never convince Americans that “no one supports abortion up until birth.”

"249",249,"Kansas Abortion Law Fight Exposes ‘Pro-Life’ Democrats As Cowards","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-03-10"," Kansas “pro-life” Democrats appear willing to cave to political pressure rather than vote their supposed conscience. That is the takeaway from the continuing battle at the state house over the proposed “Value Them Both” constitutional amendment that would overturn the Kansas Supreme Court’s extreme abortion decision in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt. The Hodes decision, handed down by the Kansas high court less than a year ago, declared that the state’s 150-year-old constitution includes a “fundamental right to abortion.” Even more devastating to pro-life Kansans, the state Supreme Court, in inventing this new constitutional right, adopted a standard of review more stringent than even the U.S. Supreme Court originally crafted in Roe v. Wade, which was later narrowed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.  The currently controlling Casey standard provides that, prior to an unborn child’s viability outside the womb, a state law cannot impose an “undue burden” on the “right” to abortion, meaning the law must not have the “purpose or effect” of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. But as legal scholar Elizabeth Kirk told a joint Senate-House committee in Kansas considering the amendment, the Supreme Court in Casey also made clear that, under the undue burden test, states could still “‘take steps to ensure that [the woman’s] choice is thoughtful and informed,’ could create structural mechanisms by which the state, or the parent or guardian of a minor, expresses profound respect for life of unborn, could pass measures designed to persuade a woman to choose childbirth over abortion, could pass laws which have ‘the incidental effect of making [abortion] more difficult or expensive to procure,’ or regulations ‘to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion.’” After viability, as Kirk further explained, Casey allows states to prohibit abortion so long as the law maintains an exception “for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.” Hodes Bans Common-Sense Abortion Regulations In contrast, the Kansas court concluded in Hodes that regulations challenged under the Kansas Constitution would be judged by strict scrutiny, meaning, as Kirk testified, that “for an abortion regulation to pass constitutional muster, the state must demonstrate that it has a ‘compelling state interest’ and that the law in question is ‘narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake.’”  Few laws can survive such constitutional muster, Kirk explained. Thus, in Kansas, laws that would be constitutional under the federal “undue burden” standard of Casey could be declared unconstitutional under the stringent strict scrutiny standard adopted by the Kansas Supreme Court. Kirk, whose complete testimony is available here and who offers a must-read synopsis of the law and issue, detailed for the joint committee numerous examples of common-sense abortion regulations that other states applying strict scrutiny have declared unconstitutional: Under strict scrutiny, Alaska has invalidated funding restrictions, parental consent, and parental notification, California has invalidated funding restrictions and parental consent, Florida has struck down parental notice and parental consent, Iowa has struck down a 72-hour waiting period, Massachusetts has invalidated funding restrictions and a parental consent statute, Minnesota has struck down funding restrictions, Montana has invalidated a requirement that only physicians may perform abortions, New Jersey has struck down funding restrictions and parental notice, and Tennessee struck down informed consent and a waiting period. Pro-Lifers Introduce the ‘Value Them Both’ Amendment Recognizing the expansive and extreme scope of the Hodes decision, pro-life advocates promptly presented the state legislature with the Value Them Both Amendment to reverse Hodes and leave lawmaking to the legislature. That amendment provides “to the extent permitted by the constitution of the United States, the people, through their elected state representatives and state senators, may pass laws regarding abortion.” To amend the constitution in Kansas, however, requires both houses to approve the proposed amendment by two-thirds vote, at which point the amendment is placed on the ballot for voters to decide. On Jan. 29, 2019, with a 28-12 margin — with no Democrats voting in the majority — the Senate voted to put the Value Them Both Amendment on the August 2019 ballot. But in the House, the amendment failed to garner the 84 votes needed. The final 80-43 tally included four Republicans voting no and all Democrats voting in lockstep against the amendment.  Several Democrats who refused to support the amendment had previously voted to ban live dismemberment abortions, the actual statute that had spawned the Hodes case in the first place. And other Kansas House Democrat holdouts had voted for other abortion regulations in 2017. Yet none of these Democrats voted in favor of placing the Value Them Both Amendment on the ballot. ‘Pro-Life’ Democrats Tuck Tail and Run Everyone on the ground knows why. But none of the purportedly pro-life Democrats will go public. They are scared. And it appears they value their seat more than they do their sacred duty to protect life. If these pro-life Democrats continue to vote with their abortion-on-demand colleagues, they will have only themselves to blame when Kansas turns into California. How will these pro-life Democrats answer when their liberal state supreme court declares taxpayer-funded abortion constitutionally mandated? What will they tell their constituents? What will they tell their priests, pastors, and rabbis? What will they tell their fellow parishioners who are forced to pay for the killing of innocent human beings? And what will they tell the parents of a young girl, pressured by a boyfriend to abort her child and their grandchild, when the state supreme court strikes the state’s parental consent law, leaving the teen without the guidance and support of the adults who love her more than anyone else in the world? Pro-Life Democrats Must Stand for Value Them Both It’s not too late, though. All it takes is for one courageous representative to vote his or her conscience. While they’re at it, lawmakers should expose the complicity of the politicians owned and controlled by the abortion lobby. Tell the public exactly what is happening. Call a press conference, make it a joint one, and stand with your supposed pro-life peers. Tell Kansans you will be voting for the Value Them Both Amendment. Tell Kansans this amendment will ensure that the common-sense laws passed by the state legislature will remain in effect, that there will be no taxpayer-funded abortions, that teens will have their parents’ guidance, and that abortion facilities will not turn into Gosnell mortuaries. Then tell them you know this is what most Kansans want but that there will soon be a deluge of attack ads, with outside money pouring into the state to convince voters to toss you out. And tell them who threatened to destroy your political careers at the altar of abortion. Name names. Point fingers, and then leave it in the hands of the voters. Tell them you would rather lose your job representing them, the people of Kansas, than your soul. Tell them you’d rather lose your clout and cachet than have Kansans compelled to use their hard-earned money to pay for abortion. Tell them you’d rather lose everything than have one young girl spend the rest of her life devastated by a decision she made when she was scared and alone, when she needed her parents’ guidance. Tell them, ‘I am a pro-life Democrat, and I am proud to defend the weak and defenseless — including the weakest and most defenseless of all, the unborn.’ Tell them you are no longer afraid, because it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world. Pro-life Democrats need to ask themselves: “But for Kansas?” ","https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/10/kansas-abortion-law-fight-exposes-pro-life-democrats-as-cowards/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"250",250,"The Religion Of The Democratic Party Is Abortion And Brunch","Payton","Bre",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-02-15"," We’ve all seen them. Our cars have been blocked due to their foot traffic, our TVs taken over with footage of their chants, our computer screens flooded with images of their signs. These woke millennials spend their weekends carrying messages of #resistance while wearing red capes, pink hats, and T-shirts with catchy hashtags. Their objective is no longer to keep abortion “safe, legal, and rare,” but to shout it, to be proud about it, and to kick and scream if their party does not expel pro-life defectors. Where were they before Donald Trump? They were at brunch — the weekly social event where secular millennials gather over runny eggs and mimosas. (Barf.)  “I did notice that it’s getting to be more of a type of social event,” said Denisha Jones, a repeat protester and an assistant professor at Trinity Washington University, according to an article in The New York Times, with a headline that reads: “Protesting at Lunchtime: Defying Trump Becomes a Washington Lifestyle.” “Folks I normally go to brunch with, we go to protests.” “I spend the majority of my days not meeting my writing deadlines or eating biscuits and gravy with a mimosa chaser and failing the Bechdel test with friends but figuring out what actions we’re going to do,” Jen Doll of The Week writes. “Protests must be brunch now because simple, soulless brunching is no longer acceptable” The party that represents these radicalized brunch-goers has no room for those who believe life begins at conception. They’ve expelled nearly all of its representatives who believe life begins at conception and vote accordingly. In Congress, only two Democrats belong to the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. That’s right, two. And the party is not running a single pro-life Democrat in any of the 91 districts they hope to win over this November. Both of these things are startling given that in 2009, 64 Democrats opposed the Affordable Care Act because they thought it didn’t come with enough restrictions on abortion. Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), one of these Democratic congressmen who broke rank in 2009, has represented the Third District of Illinois since 2005. His seat is in jeopardy now that he’s being challenged in the upcoming primary by Marie Newman, the darling of NARAL Pro-Choice America, EMILY’s List, Gloria Steinem, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.  To say the Democratic Party’s views on abortion are out-of-touch with most Americans is an understatement. Poll after poll has shown that a majority of Americans think late-term abortions should be illegal, with 80 percent saying the procedure should be restricted to at least the first trimester of a pregnancy. The Hyde Amendment, which bars federal tax dollars from funding abortions, is also supported among a majority of Americans, but you wouldn’t know that based on the way the Democratic Party operates. Democrats Have Become Synonymous With Abortion All throughout the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton branded herself as the #AbortionKween by declaring abortion, and taxpayer-funded access to an abortion, a “right.” Her radical position on the issue secured the first-ever presidential endorsement from Planned Parenthood. When asked if she supported any restrictions on abortion, she said that an abortion in the ninth month of a pregnancy ought to be legal. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine — a Catholic Democrat who received an F grade from NARAL for authorizing “Choose Life” license plates, promoting adoption, and supporting abstinence-focused education during his tenure as Virginia governor — had to loudly distance himself from these actions to make himself palatable to the Democratic Party. Kaine declared that while he was still “personally pro-life,” he made it absolutely clear he would not stand in Hillary’s way on abortion. As Federalist publisher Ben Domenech pointed out at the time, Kaine’s decision to backtrack and qualify statements he’s made about life in order to serve alongside Hillary on the Democratic ticket shows how intolerant the party has become towards people who are even “personally pro-life”– whatever that means. At the Democratic National Convention in the summer of 2016, Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America and mother of two, took the stage to brag about the time she aborted her first child. In response, the audience cheered.  Fast-forward to November 2016. Clinton loses the presidential election. She doesn’t just lose a few key battleground states in the Midwest, she loses the overall Catholic vote by 7 points — a demographic former President Obama won in the past two elections. Writing for The New York Times, Thomas Groome explains that she lost the white Catholic vote by 23 points — a loss that’s particularly damning given that Kaine is Catholic. Catholics rejected a ticket with one of their own, due in no small part to Hillary’s radical stance on abortion. “If Democrats want to regain the Catholic vote, they must treat abortion as a moral issue, work for its continued reduction and articulate a more nuanced message than, ‘We support Roe v. Wade,'” Groome, an Irish-Catholic theology professor at Boston College, wrote. He’s right. But the Democratic Party likely won’t listen, because they’re not seeking pro-life voters who adhere to orthodox religions. Instead they sacrifice babies to the god of feminism, confront white women to appease the god of intersectionality, and keep the sabbath holy by partaking in the weekly sacrament of brunch. Abortion Advocates Control the Democratic Party Since Trump’s inauguration last year and the Women’s March that rallied in opposition to the president, a coalition of abortion advocates have become the most vocal faction of the party’s base, with Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and EMILY’s List becoming (even more) influential activist arms of the Democratic Party. Over the past year, Planned Parenthood has encouraged women to dress as handmaidens from the popular Hulu show “The Handmaid’s Tale,” based on a dystopian novel of the same name, and descend upon Washington DC and state capitols in Ohio, Texas, Missouri, and New York to protest health care bills that might upset their multi-million-dollar, taxpayer-funded gravy train. This is perhaps the most absurd example I’ve seen yet. Women dressed in their red capes form a circle in the center of the Wisconsin state capitol in Madison to show how oppressed they will become if evil Republicans have their way. Then POOF, it’s suddenly a dance routine! The women are dressed not as handmaidens, but in pussy hats! Watch.  They took off their Handmaid’s Tale costumes, put on pussy hats and started dancing. pic.twitter.com/YxuGyjCe7a
— Jessie Opoien (@jessieopie) February 14, 2018  It’s not just health care bills that abortion advocates have been protesting. Planned Parenthood and the like are whipping their activists into opposing, or rallying for, policies that have seemingly nothing to do with abortion. In the past six months, I’ve received text alerts from the abortion giant regarding tax reform, health care, Transgender Day of Remembrance and Resilience, hurricane Maria’s devastating effect on Puerto Rico, immigration reform, the DREAM act, and Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals. Most recently, I was encouraged to “break Mike Pence’s heart” by donating to PPAct in his name on Valentine’s Day.  Ah, Mike Pence. The Christian politician progressives frequently mock for things like declining to dine alone with women who are not his wife, or for declaring that he wishes to consign Roe v. Wade to “the ash heap of history.” He’s not the only person of faith who is often under fire, either. Dissenters Will Not Be Tolerated Religious people who uphold the biblical teaching (and scientific finding) that life begins at conception are frequent targets of this secular orthodoxy, not just with mean text alerts, but also with regulatory action. Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services actively sought to punish and even bankrupt The Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns who serve the elderly, and Hobby Lobby, a craft store owned by a Christian family, for refusing to provide abortion-inducing drugs. These actions sent a message: the only religion you are free to participate in without fear of persecution from a Democratic administration is abortion-affirming secularism. In liberal states and cities, pro-lifers still face consequences for refusing to bow before the gods of Planned Parenthood. Support Circle, a chain of Christian crisis pregnancy centers in San Francisco, is embroiled in a lawsuit against the city, which claims it’s illegal if their organization pops up in a search engine window when a woman is searching for abortion clinics. Free speech is for everyone, except pro-lifers. Even existing on the Internet is all too much for the ultra-liberal city, which purports to be a tolerant utopia. As religion-seeded ideas about life, marriage, and family become ickier and ickier to liberals, we are told that Facebook is the new church. Brunch is the new Sunday sacrament. And when it comes to abortion, dissenters will not be tolerated. ","https://thefederalist.com/2018/02/15/religion-democratic-party-abortion-brunch/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"251",251,"Why Infanticide Isn’t A Bridge Too Far For Many Abortion Supporters","Fiene","Hans",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-14"," For the average pro-lifer, watching ostensibly moderate pro-choicers repeatedly adopt a more obviously barbaric stance on abortion is equal parts heartbreaking and confusing. When more radical voices disavowed the suggestion that abortion was something tragic and proclaimed that abortion is an empowering experience that should be available on demand and without exceptions, the “legal, safe, and rare” moderates in public office embraced this evil. Likewise, when candidates have defended a woman’s right to end the life of her nearly full-term child by sucking the brains out of his skull, the two-thirds of self-identified pro-choice Americans who oppose third-trimester abortions appear to have abandoned their opposition at the ballot box. Why weren’t these things abhorrent enough for reluctant abortion advocates to experience a road-to-Damascus conversion and embrace the pro-life cause?  Likewise, as Democrat governors Andrew Cuomo and Ralph Northam now embrace infanticide as the next frontier to conquer in defense of “women’s reproductive rights,” it appears Democrats are once again poised to follow the extremists in their party. Why aren’t they disavowing them? To answer these questions, permit me to share with you an illustration I like to call the Parable of the Burning Building. The Parable of the Burning Building Once upon a time, a man attended a party on the first floor of a skyscraper. Shortly after the party began, another man burst in and told everyone a fire had just started in the next room and the only way to escape was by taking a five-foot drop out the window. But the smell of the smoke wasn’t very strong, and the partygoer didn’t want to roll an ankle in the jump, so he convinced himself that the fire wasn’t real. Instead of escaping, he and his friends took the party up to the second floor, far away from the buzz-killy ramblings of crazy Captain Fire Crier.  A few minutes later, however, Captain Fire Crier told them the fire had spread to the second floor and once again urged everyone to jump out the window, which was now about a 15-foot drop—maybe not enough to kill a person, but definitely enough to break your legs. Even though the partygoer could now smell the smoke and feel the heat, he feared the jump more than the fire, so he ran up to the third floor. Once again, the fire found him, and once again, Captain Fire Crier begged him to jump out the window. But because the drop seemed even more terrifying, the partygoer ran up to the fourth floor. Then the fifth, then the sixth, and so on until he found himself at the top of the building, surrounded by the raging flames that he kept pretending weren’t real because he couldn’t bear to make the jump that stopped being survivable 50 stories earlier. How This Applies to Abortion To apply this parable to the abortion issue, let’s say that you show up to the “reproductive rights” party as a tepid supporter of legalized abortion. You personally oppose abortion, but you don’t want to impose your beliefs on someone else. Likewise, you think the procedure should be limited to the first trimester and shouldn’t be publicly funded. But then your conscience starts accusing you, saying, “Abortion takes an innocent life and the fire of God’s judgment burns against those who won’t defend innocent life, so if you want to escape that judgment, stop supporting abortion and jump out the window of repentance.”  However, if you admit that you were wrong, God might not let you escape the guilt of having supported something immoral. So, in an effort to avoid that risky jump out the window, you try to convince yourself that you don’t need to take it. You insist abortion isn’t immoral. You run up to the second floor and join the rest of the defiant partygoers who are saying “There’s no reason to personally oppose abortion because what we’re dealing with in the first trimester isn’t a human life. It’s just a glob of cells.” But then your conscience pipes up again. “That ‘glob of cells’ has its own human DNA from the moment of conception. It’s not the mother’s body. It’s a unique human life that deserves to be protected. Look at the sonogram. Listen to the heartbeat. Stop defending this barbarity. Repent.” Now you’re starting to feel the heat of God’s wrath on your neck. But because you doubled down on your sin, the jump-out repentance widow is now twice as high and twice as hard, which makes you twice as quick to join the unyielding abortion supporters on the third floor, where you shout, “Fine, it’s a living human organism. But it’s not a person and therefore doesn’t have the right to life.” In response, your conscience screams that “It’s a human but not a person” is the same fallacious distinction used to justify slavery and the Holocaust, so to escape such bad company, you make a philosophical pivot on the fourth floor, saying, “Person or not, a woman’s right to bodily autonomy is greater than some 12-week-old fetus’s right to be born.” “Stop it,” your conscience snarls in response. “Stop defending yourself with perverse logic that also justifies second- and third-trimester abortions.” But that’s exactly what you do on floors five and six. Then you climb even higher by arguing that abortion at any point in pregnancy isn’t just acceptable. It’s merciful. “We’re saving diseased children with little chance of survival from suffering.” Seventh floor. “We’re sparing children with deformities a lifetime of rejection and bigotry.” Eighth floor. “We’re protecting the children of low-income mothers from poverty and hunger.” Ninth floor. “Every child a wanted child.” Tenth floor. Do You Really Want to Keep Climbing? Likewise, the higher you climb, the more the crowd of pro-lifers outside amplifies your conscience as they beg you to join them, which only makes the judgment of God burn hotter. So you climb another flight of stairs every time you try to dismiss the moral superiority of the pro-life cause by demonizing those who support it. “You’re just trying to control women’s bodies.” Eleventh floor. “You’re liars who deceptively edited those videos of Planned Parenthood employees selling fetal brains. You’re snot-nosed, racist twerps who deserve a punch in the face.” Twelve, thirteen. Likewise, when your opponents are undeterred by your ad hominem attacks, you climb another flight every time you seek to punish them for their insolence. When they continue decrying the wickedness of abortion, you make them pay for it with their tax dollars. When they open crisis pregnancy centers aimed at helping women who have chosen life, you force them to advertise abortion clinics. When they try to speak about their cause on college campuses, you ban them. When they try to advertise on social media platforms, you deny them. When they get writing gigs at prestigious publications, you get them fired. Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. And so on and so on, until you find yourself at the top of that skyscraper. Not long ago, you thought abortion was a necessary evil that needed to be permitted but limited to the time before the fetus could feel pain. Now you’re insisting that abortion is a positive good that should be celebrated and available up until birth—or after, if ever a child targeted for termination has the audacity to escape the birth canal alive. Now you can’t oppose the brazen monstrosity of infanticide because you are too terrified to take the plunge that you’re certain stopped being survivable 50 stories earlier. This Parable Applies to All Sorts of Scenarios Of course, the Parable of the Burning Building doesn’t apply only to supporters of abortion. The vicious cycle it describes is one that all of us are wont to embrace, regardless of our preferred sins or political affiliations. By the grace of God, however, many of us in the pro-life movement found our way out of the flames on this issue. And if we want our pro-choice neighbors to escape their own version of the burning building, the best way to help them do so is by pointing them to another parable—a divinely inspired one that Jesus gave us in Luke 15. Immediately after he speaks the words of repentance, his father welcomes him back as a son. In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, a young man despises his father by asking for his inheritance early, only to squander his fortune on prostitutes and reckless living. Unable to stand another day of destitution, however, the young man decides to go home and rehearses the speech he hopes will earn him an occasional crumb from his father’s table. “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,” he says. “I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.” But when he returns home and when his father runs out to greet him, the young man never gets to the second half of his speech. Immediately after he speaks the words of repentance, his father welcomes him back as a son, clothes him in the honor he threw away, and treats his sins as though they never happened. In other words, when that young man jumped out the window of repentance 50 stories up, he fully expected his father to let him break into a thousand pieces on the ground. But he didn’t break a bone because his father caught him. His father was always going to catch him, always going to forgive him, always going to restore him. There’s Someone Underneath the Window With a Net The point of Christ’s parable, of course, is that this father’s love for his son is identical to God’s love for us. God doesn’t want us to be consumed by the fire of his wrath. He wants us to escape it, which is why he sent Jesus to rescue us from the sins that lit that fire. God isn’t going to withhold his mercy from those who didn’t jump early enough. Because of this, when sinners jump out the window of repentance, God isn’t going to withhold his mercy from those who didn’t jump early enough. He’s not going to let those who climbed to the top of the skyscraper shatter into pieces at his feet. He’s going to catch them, cradle them in his hands, and rejoice that the child who once was lost is now found through the blood of Christ. As our pro-choice neighbors flirt with infanticide, this is what they need to know. More than anything, they need to hear us tell them, “I had my own sins, my own defiance, my own 50-story burning skyscraper. But I got out. So can you. “So, yes, voters, you should have stopped voting for pro-choice candidates a long time ago. Yes, politicians, from day one you should have feared the wrath of God more than the wrath of NARAL. But it’s not too late to do that now. It’s not too late to escape condemnation and find peace with the God who has already written out of existence every sin you committed against your most innocent and defenseless neighbors. “So don’t be afraid to take the plunge out the window. Don’t be afraid to jump. Don’t think that your father in heaven wants to watch you splatter on the sidewalk. He doesn’t. He wants to watch you land safely in the hands that have been waiting to catch you from before the foundation of the world. And don’t worry that you’ve doubled down on your sin one too many times. Don’t worry that you’ve climbed too high to survive the fall. Jump and see that the gravity of guilt is no match for the grace of God.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/14/infanticide-isnt-bridge-far-many-abortion-supporters/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"252",252,"The Pro-Abortion ‘Life Of The Mother’ Argument Is A False Flag Operation","Bruchalski","John",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-02-21"," As many states are fighting to codify abortion law, one of the greatest lies spread by the pro-abortion left in America today is that we need to intentionally end the life of an unborn baby in order to save the mother’s life in many of these cases.



Women face many possible illnesses during pregnancy, including premature rupture of membranes, severely high blood pressure, diabetes, hemorrhaging, cancers, and heart disease. As an obstetrician-gynecologist who used to provide abortions early in my training, I know that intentional feticide is never necessary even in the worst-case scenarios.



Take this example. A mother’s amniotic sac breaks prematurely at 14 weeks. While her doctor may offer elective abortion as an option, she does not need it. She and her baby have a better option. Mom and baby can be treated with antibiotics and close observation and even have a good chance of stabilization. If they make it to 22 weeks or more, the baby has a good chance of survival outside the womb.



The medical goal should be to care for both patients and to get them both as far along in the pregnancy as possible as long as the mom and baby are doing well.



But imagine the mother develops an infection before her baby reaches the age of viability. Unfortunately, this means she will have to have a preterm delivery. The doctor must empty the womb by early induction in order to attack the infection — similar to draining an abscess. The unborn baby may not survive because it’s not yet viable outside the womb. But ending the life of the unborn child was never the direct intention in treating the infection.



Dr. Byron Calhoun, a high-risk OB-GYN who serves much of the state of West Virginia and sees these severe cases daily, agrees there is never a need to directly end the life of the unborn child in order to save the mother. “The baby may be delivered prematurely and die from that but it is never necessary to kill the baby to save the mother’s life,” he wrote to me.



In fact, most conditions can be treated without preterm delivery. “The severe preeclamptic may be observed until the mother’s medical condition requires delivery,” he says. “Unless the mother is bleeding to death, severe heart failure, or septic; there is usually time to wait and see if the baby will make it to resuscitation age at 22+ weeks.” 



Chemotherapy for a pregnant mother that tragically results in miscarriage is not an elective abortion. Treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is not an elective abortion. Preterm delivery for an infection is not an elective abortion. These women are and have been thoroughly cared for and treated for their pregnancy complications before, during, and after Roe v. Wade. But abortion advocates want you to think these cases are compromised in post-Roe America and bundled up in the wrongly dubbed “rights” they are fighting for, in order to keep the abortion-on-demand culture alive.



No Advantages to Mother’s Health



There are no advantages for a mother to end her pregnancy by an elective abortion, even in the most life-threatening circumstances. Elective abortions become more dangerous the further along in pregnancy, and that’s when the majority of these health complications arise. Abortions after 24 weeks cause massive fluid shifts, which can push the mom into heart, lung, or kidney failure. If the mother’s life is in immediate danger, a C-section takes one hour. A direct abortion after 24 weeks can take two to three days. The argument cannot be made that an abortion is necessary because it is faster than delivery.    



Dr. Calhoun noted the harm that an elective abortion can have on a woman’s health in the short and long term. When done after 20 weeks particularly, abortions subject women to greater immediate risk of death than childbearing, increase women’s risk of very preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies, and increase women’s risk of adverse mental health outcomes.



Justifying the Cash Cow of Abortion



If intentional feticide is not necessary to save the life of the mother, why do so many pro-abortion medical professionals continue to say it is?



Fifty years of Roe crippled the medical field by making abortion the commonplace solution to disease, personal needs, and conveniences. We have also become more risk-averse as a people and a profession. While pro-abortion advocates argue that first-trimester abortions could prevent the possible complications of pulmonary hypertension, lupus, and kidney disease from developing further along in pregnancy, this unnecessary “solution” is premature and violently attacks the unborn child as if he or she were the cause of the illnesses. The heart of the Hippocratic, healing profession of medicine should be that we hate the disease and love our patients.



Unfortunately, many pro-abortion medical professionals are intentionally creating confusion over medical definitions to justify abortion on demand and to scare voters. I believe they want to reserve the right to perform elective abortions in any circumstance because they worship the cash cow that stems from their patients’ ability to choose death. “Life of the mother” reasoning appears to come from a place of medical concern for women, but it’s really a false flag operation.



This lie — that elective abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother — unnecessarily pits the mother against her child. But mom and baby are on the same team. They are a part of the same family.



We must relearn how to hate the disease, yet love both of our patients in OB-GYN practice.

"253",253,"Biden’s Abortion Extremism Is A Vulnerability Trump Should Expose","Dannenfelser","Marjorie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-05-22"," Former President Trump and President Biden have set a late June date for their first debate of 2024. On the heels of the second anniversary of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision, which returned the right to protect unborn children to the people and their elected representatives, abortion is guaranteed to be front and center as an election issue.



Biden and the Democrats are spending millions of dollars on attack ads centered around abortion. Vice President Harris travels the country as Biden’s abortion czar and campaigned at an abortion center. Failing on everything else, they think this issue is their silver bullet. They even believe it gives them a shot at flipping Florida blue.



Yet the Democrats have a big vulnerability, one that plays right to Donald Trump’s strengths.



Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. put a glaring spotlight on this weakness when he said in an interview that he supported “full-term” abortion. Amid blowback from the Trump campaign and many others, he walked it back, but not before Biden’s camp chimed in, “The president doesn’t support full-term abortions, as he’s made clear many times. He thinks Roe [v. Wade] got it right.”



The debate is a prime opportunity to clarify for voters: Got what right?



Team Biden knows “full-term” abortion is unpopular. Three-quarters of voters would limit abortion by 15 weeks of pregnancy, a point when babies feel pain, at the latest. Yet Biden won’t say what limits, if any, he actually does support. He rarely says the word “abortion” at all.



The media mostly let this artful dodgery slide, but Trump can expose Biden’s extremism and make it front-page news.



Many Americans, if they thought about Roe, thought it placed some kind of limit on abortion. Little did they realize the court also wrote a broad health exception that day that included “all factors — physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age.” Just like that, Roe allowed for painful second- and third-trimester abortions for any reason. To this day, the United States is one of eight countries — alongside China and Vietnam — with no federal limits at any point in pregnancy.



Even the abortion industry concedes most late-term abortions aren’t for medical reasons. One late-term abortionist in business for 50 years brazenly admits carrying out more than one abortion just because someone wanted a boy instead of a girl, or vice versa. In his view, every pregnancy is a health risk that justifies abortion — even as late as 22, 25, or 30 weeks.



Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood’s Missouri branch, testified to Congress in 2019 that her “practice includes [abortion] through the point of viability and … that could be at any point” or no point. In suburbs like College Park, Maryland, and Beverly Hills, California, abortion businesses continue seeking to open “all-trimester” facilities after Dobbs.



So what exactly does Biden think Roe “got right” — discriminatory sex-selection abortions? Partial-birth abortions (federally outlawed in 2003, but members of his cabinet ignore that)? Live dismemberment of babies old enough to undergo life-saving surgery in the womb and receive anesthesia for pain? How many weeks is too late? He never specifies. Neither does Harris, who had several chances in a network interview to name her specific limit and repeatedly declined.



If Biden were only trying to resurrect Roe, that would be bad enough. But it’s worse. Biden backs the so-called Women’s Health Protection Act (an Orwellian title) and urged Congress to “put it on my desk, so I can sign it into law.” This bill would overturn commonsense protections for babies and women in every state and force all-trimester abortion on the whole nation.



Even fellow Democrat Joe Manchin called him out: “They’re trying to make people believe that this is the same thing as codifying Roe v. Wade. And I want you to know, it’s not. This is not the same. It expands abortion.”



Moreover, Biden and other pro-abortion Democrats like Nancy Pelosi have made clear that, upon taking complete control in Washington, they will destroy the Senate filibuster to impose their agenda. This is one of the longstanding checks and balances that allow the minority party to at least have a voice and not be trampled entirely. They’re that radical.



Kennedy may have had his eyes opened on the inhumane reality of late-term abortion in America. Let’s hope so. His latest evolution supports limits at viability, while his own running mate would prefer 15-18 weeks. But he is unlikely to qualify for the debate. Most likely, it will be Trump and Biden, mano a mano.



One of the most powerful moves Trump can make is to hold Biden’s feet to the fire on where he draws the line on abortion (at any time up to and including the birth of the child) and contrast Biden’s position with support for a reasonable minimum standard with exceptions as he has in the past. Biden shouldn’t struggle to answer the question, “What are your exceptions?” — if indeed he has any.

"254",254,"New York’s Barbaric Abortion Law Should Prompt Doctors To Stand For Life","Xu","Kenny",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-01"," According to Gallup, 87 percent of Americans believe abortion should be strictly illegal in the last three months of a pregnancy. Among this extraordinarily large share of Americans is a fair share of New York doctors. So what happens when the New York state legislature passes a law that makes it a “fundamental right” for patients to receive a third-trimester abortion? That’s exactly what happened last week, when New York redefined a legal “person” as someone who has already been born, and gave patients extensive license to request doctors perform late-term abortions for them.  For doctors who share the opinion with the vast majority of Americans that third-trimester abortions should be illegal, the passage of this law can only be extremely upsetting. What if a patient––or worse, a pro-choice advocacy organization on behalf of a patient––walks up to them and demands they perform a procedure on them that they deem horrific and murderous?  What do they do when every move they make with regard to this issue will be recorded and watched by the rest of America? Three issues could emerge from the impending fight in New York State between pro-choice advocacy groups and conscientious doctors. Doctors Left to Fend for Themselves We hire doctors to save lives, not play political games. But the New York abortion law will shine the (probably unwanted) national political spotlight on medical professionals like never before. According to Bill S2796, a health care practitioner may perform a third-trimester abortion when he or she believes that an abortion is necessary “to protect the patient’s life or health.” The law specifically states it is the doctor who is ultimately responsible for advising the patient to abort or not abort her child, while leaving extremely little and vague guidance as to how a doctor should make this gut-wrenching decision.  After all, “health” is a suspicious reason to request a third-trimester abortion. A study by the Guttmacher Institute (a pro-choice think tank) in 2013 revealed that out of 272 women surveyed who had received an abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, none of them received it for any kind of clinical endangerment to the health of the mother.  I want to clear something up so that there is absolutely no doubt. 
I’m a Board Certified OB/GYN who has delivered over 2,500 babies. 
There’s not a single fetal or maternal condition that requires third trimester abortion. Not one. Delivery, yes. Abortion, no.
— Omar L. Hamada, MD, MBA, MATS (@OmarHamada) January 23, 2019  This means doctors in New York will face severe scrutiny from the public over how they decide to interpret what’s best for the patient’s “health.” Is the law talking about the patient’s physical health? Economic health? Emotional? Doctors are given zero guidance on this issue, except to use their “professional judgment.” Yet these doctors are expected to carry the entirety of the political burden of deciding whether to abort a fully formed, viable human being––a burden that was supposed to be carried by the people we elect to make those decisions. Bill S2796 will expose individual doctors to the harsh winds of public scrutiny without so much as a blanket. Doctors’ Freedom Of Conscience Is at Stake Pro-life doctors will have to stand up for themselves against a law that violates their most sacred principles. Fortunately, they won’t be alone.  The Masterpiece Cake Shop and Hobby Lobby rulings of years past will help their cases. These previous Supreme Court cases decided that businesses and individuals had certain rights of conscience if they could prove sincere devotion to a certain religion or way of looking at the world. Doctors who object to third-trimester abortions have these rulings, as well as “conscience clauses” in 46 states that support a doctor’s right to refuse performing abortions if he disagrees morally with the procedure. These laws will help protect a doctor in case he objects to third-trimester abortion. But the new law in New York could throw a wrench in these conscience clauses. The law now gives the patient a discrimination clause, which directly competes with conscience clauses over a patient’s right to a late-term abortion. It explicitly states: the patient “should be able to… [seek and obtain] abortion care, free from discrimination in the provision of health care.” What does discrimination have to do with refusing to provide an abortion? Potentially a lot. In 1978, Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, creating a new protected class for pregnant women. Although that law was passed mostly to curtail employment discrimination, it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to see a state like New York expand the scope of this law to encompass consumer discrimination and require that doctors who perform abortions not discriminate based on the stage of pregnancy. The NY abortion law sets the stage for yet another battle between conscientious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. Doctors who refuse third-trimester abortions might have to brace themselves for the possibility of an extended court fight––but they have precedent on their side. Doctors Will Be Given An Unprecedented National Platform All this public and legal scrutiny on pro-life medical professionals may eventually prove beneficial, because it gives these doctors an opportunity to explain to their patients and the wider world how the facts and science about abortion make it impossible to deny the personhood of those inside the womb. Remember how Roe v. Wade was settled: by claiming that there are competing views to the life and personhood of the fetus, the Supreme Court could simply state that none of these views trump the other and therefore the woman’s right to privacy (which they interpreted to mean abortion) wins out against the potential human being’s right to life. But now, pro-life doctors have the opportunity of a lifetime. They should use the public attention to explain to the public why they chose life for their patients. They should point out the wealth of post-natal options for mothers who can’t afford to keep their child. They should point out how science supports the idea that from the very first zygote, the cell created by a sperm and an egg is a completely unique cell, capable of forming a living, breathing human being in a way no other single cell could. They should use ultrasound technology unavailable to doctors in 1973 (the year Roe was decided) to show that a baby’s heartbeat can be detected as early as eight weeks. Stating this evidence with clarity and precision will do wonders to convince the public about Roe’s outdated utility. Medical professionals are on deck for a greater role in the abortion debate than ever before, whether they like it or not. The New York abortion law and its abortion advocates seeks to isolate pro-life doctors and have them endure public scrutiny in the hopes they will cave and allow third-trimester abortion to be normalized across the state. But doctors should not fear: they have science and Supreme Court precedent to support their case. This law should galvanize doctors across America to draw a line in the sand, stating what the vast majority of Americans already believe: that no society where third-trimester abortion is the law of the land could ever be considered “healthy.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/01/new-yorks-barbaric-abortion-law-prompt-doctors-stand-life/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"255",255,"Why Banning Abortion Will Save Millions More Lives Than Banning Guns","Breitenbeck","David",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-03-26"," Over the weekend there was a massive march in Washington and other cities to demand new laws, ostensibly on behalf of innocent lives being endangered. That sounds like another giant protest march that takes place once a year in Washington, except this one is being reported coast-to-coast, buoyed by celebrity endorsements, and hailed as the dawn of a revolution, rather than being studiously ignored or downplayed. It should be obvious that I’m speaking of the March for Our Lives and the March for Life, two ostensibly similar marches advocating ostensibly similar views. Yet comparing the two positions reveals illuminating fundamental differences.  Ownership Versus Action Of course the most obvious distinction is in the subject matter: one favors limiting or ending gun owners, the other limiting or ending abortion. Let’s consider the two subjects, for here the crux of the matter rests. Gun rights deal with a person’s right to own a particular tool for a particular purpose. Put briefly, a gun is a weapon; weapons are used in fighting. People want to own guns so if they ever need to fight to defend themselves, their families, or their rights, they can do so effectively. There are obvious and legitimate reasons why they would want this, ranging from violent attackers to civil unrest. But, although they have legitimate uses, guns by nature are open to abuse. They allow a person with evil intent to inflict more damage than he would otherwise. Gun-control advocates argue the potential for abuse is greater than the legitimate need for private firearms, at least with regards to certain weapons. In other words, gun control advocates wish to limit access to guns in order to limit their potential for abuse. Abortion rights deal with a person’s right to do or have done a particular procedure. This procedure, by definition, destroys a human life: specifically the human life the people in question created by having intercourse, whether consensually or violently. They desire this because, to one degree or another, the life to be destroyed is unwanted or inconvenient and was not intended to be created.  Although the reasons for wishing to destroy this life may be understandable, abortion still destroys an innocent human life. Moreover, in most cases that innocent human life was created by other people voluntarily engaging in an act they knew could lead to this outcome. Pro-life advocates argue that deliberately killing an innocent human being simply cannot be justified, save in cases of direst need such as when the life of the mother is at stake. In other words, pro-life advocates wish to forbid a particular action that, by definition, destroys a human life. Note the difference: one involves a right of possession, the other of action. To own a gun says nothing of how it is used, and there are clearly legitimate reasons someone would want to own one. To perform an abortion, on the other hand, means to kill a human life, and the only question involved is whether such an act can be justified. Gun-control advocates argue that the undeniable potential for abuse outweighs the undeniable goods derived from gun ownership, while pro-life advocates argue that abortion itself is an unjustifiable action. Responsibility Versus Irresponsibility This difference points to another: private firearm ownership presupposes a degree of self-control and responsibility. Owning a weapon demands treating it with respect for the power it conveys. If we permit a person to own firearms, we assume he is a reasonably mature, independent moral agent who is able to act rationally and responsibly.  Those in favor of gun ownership seek to take responsibility for their own lives and actions, rather than being pre-judged incapable of doing so. Now, whether or not a given individual is capable of this is a legitimate question, but ultimately beside the point. The point is that to seek gun ownership means to ask for greater responsibility for one’s life and to be judged accordingly. Furthermore, the reason behind gun ownership is for the individual to be able to defend himself, his family, and his property without having to depend upon official institutions for protection. It demands that he not only treat his gun with respect but also be able to judge when it ought to be used and be able to use it. The right to gun ownership, therefore, means the right to take responsibility for one’s own life. Whether you believe in gun ownership or not, that is what the position objectively is. On the other hand, abortion presupposes a lack of responsibility and moral agency. It is precisely a means to escape from the consequences of one’s choices: to be able to enjoy sexual intercourse without having to care for any children that result. It demands the power to destroy developing life that one’s own choices created, meaning the power to escape moral responsibility. To this, of course, some raise the issue of rape. So should abortion should only be legal in cases of rape and similar crimes? Those who think so essentially agree with the principle being discussed, and we may leave that issue for another time. Those who think not haven’t added anything to the conversation by raising this issue. Rape and similar matters account for a very small number of abortions, and we may take such cases as a separate question. When people advocate against abortion, they are primarily thinking of the vast majority of cases, in which abortion follows consensual sex as a means of birth control. I am not here making any statement about that consensual sex, as that’s a different discussion. I’m merely saying abortion means destroying a human life that sex created. The creation of human life is an entirely predictable result of engaging in intercourse. Therefore, abortion, by definition, means removing the consequences of what is, as a rule, a voluntary act. So it is a means of escaping responsibility. Whether or not you think abortion can be justified, that is what it objectively is. Thus, a pro-gun position demands personal responsibility. A pro-abortion position demands an escape from it. Clarity of Vision Finally, there is the difference in goals and vision. The pro-life movement’s goals are straightforward enough: end abortion, or at least end common, voluntary abortion not involving rape or serious health issues. Pro-lifers argue this would save millions of innocent lives, which is simply fact, since abortion by definition means killing a human life. The goal of the pro-life movement is thus so straightforward as to be a tautology: don’t kill people and those people won’t be killed. On the other hand, the gun-control movement’s goals and reasons are far more vague and dubious. For instance, the immediate issue of the Washington march seems to be another assault weapons ban (although the rhetoric seems to be demanding much more, further pointing to the vagueness of their position). The goal of the pro-life movement is thus so straightforward as to be a tautology: don’t kill people and those people won’t be killed. This first raises the question of what constitutes an “assault weapon,” and second the issue of whether this would actually help. Even assuming the broadest definition of assault weapon, and assuming the ban were effective, this would only mean a change in weapon choice for the next mass shooter, and more mass shootings have been committed with handguns than with rifles. It seems reasonable to assume that, if rifles were not available, potential mass shooters would simply use handguns, and so on and so forth down the list of weapons until we come to knives and bombs. This is the elephant in the room for gun-control advocates: all this effort, all this anger, and all for something unlikely to actually help. If the pro-life movement manages to ban all abortions after a certain developmental stage, that means a clear limit to the number of people killed because what is being banned is the act of killing itself. There is a clear expected benefit to their advocacy, and that benefit (fewer people killed by abortion) rises the further the position is pushed. But if the gun-control movement manages to ban semi-automatic rifles, that won’t save a clear number of lives that those rifles would have killed, because what is being banned is simply a tool that may or may not have been used to commit murder, and whose absence certainly will not prevent the attempt. The expected benefit (fewer murders and mass killings) is dubious at best, and remains dubious no matter how far the position is pushed. If you ban all abortion, then nobody is legally killed by abortion. It is a simple one-one exchange. If you ban all guns, it doesn’t mean no one is legally killed by guns (since that has never been legal). It only means the general populace is denied the right to defend themselves and becomes further dependent upon government institutions while becoming more vulnerable to violent aggressors.

One argues man is a moral agent who is responsible for his own actions. The other argues that man cannot be trusted, only institutions. Behold the American political divide in a nutshell.

"257",257,"California Denies Women Choice To Save Babies Through Abortion Pill Reversal","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-09-14"," If there was any doubt about California’s status as the nation’s standard-bearer for abortion, a letter sent September 5 by the state’s Board of Registered Nursing should clear that up in a jiffy. Acting at the behest of abortion activists in the state legislature and online media, the board reversed its decision from just a month prior, sending Heartbeat International a letter to demand that the pro-life pregnancy help network “cease and desist” offering nurses continuing education units (CEUs) for abortion pill reversal classes.  More than 350 doctors nationally have joined the Abortion Pill Reversal network, while 300 mothers have successfully rescued their children from abortion through the medical intervention (see here and here for examples), which introduces an emergency and ongoing progesterone treatment to counteract the first of two pills in the chemical abortion (RU-486) process. The board’s sudden reversal seems a direct effort to deny a woman access to her own choice during an unexpected pregnancy, Heartbeat International president Jor-El Godsey said Monday. “This is a naked political assault on a procedure that is the very essence of choice,” Godsey said. “To oppose Abortion Pill Reversal is not only to deny the science and reality that there are children living today because of it, but it’s to materially keep a woman from even so much as knowing she has the option to potentially stop a chemical abortion once it has begun. This is the abortion lobby taking choices away from women.” Playing Politics with Women, Children, and Nurses The letter, postmarked September 5 and received September 11, gives Heartbeat International five days from receipt to remove CEU credit from its online courses, offered online through the Heartbeat Academy. It also marks a 180-degree shift from a letter the same board sent Heartbeat International and sister pro-life network, National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA), approving both organizations’ status as a continuing education providers.  The original letter, sent July 28, 2017, followed a 17-month period where the board reviewed hundreds of pages of submitted documentation starting in February 2016. No subsequent paperwork or filing of any kind was requested prior to or cited in the most recent letter. The board had originally questioned Heartbeat International’s inclusion of abortion pill reversal courses during the audit process, then agreed to reinstate the courses after Heartbeat International responded with a multi-point statement demonstrating the courses’ relevance to nursing practices. While Heartbeat International is complying with the letter’s demand to remove CEU credit from its online abortion pill reversal courses, the courses will still be activated while the organization appeals this decree. “How the Board of Nursing can play politics with the lives of women and children is beyond me,” Godsey said. “If there were any hint of noncompliance on our part, it’s clear a 17-month audit would have uncovered it. What could possibly have changed in one month’s time? “Meanwhile, nurses across California and the nation could be presented with patients who want to reverse their abortion decision before it is too late, and this new mandate prevents nurses from being prepared to serve their own patients.”  A Hunt for Non-Compliance Radically pro-abortion media source Rewire.com reported September 8—three days before Heartbeat International received the letter—that the letter had been sent. The site had originally influenced San Francisco Bay Area state Sen. Jerry Hill to call for the audit of Heartbeat International and others in early 2016. After pushing the board to audit Heartbeat International—a nonprofit that serves 2,200 affiliates worldwide and operates a 24-7 pregnancy helpline, Option Line—Hill then proposed legislation eventually signed into law in 2016 by Gov. Jerry Brown that beefed up the requirements for nursing CEU providers. That law, however—which mandated that courses rely only on “generally accepted scientific principles”—was insufficient to wield against the abortion pill reversal courses. Instead, the board cited California Code of Regulations (CCR) Section 1456 in its demand letter to Heartbeat International. Curiously, the section the board cited pertains only to the need for courses to be “relevant to the practice of nursing,” differentiating between courses that deal with patient care (direct and indirect) and those which, “deal with self-improvement, changes in attitude, financial gain, and those courses designed for lay people…” Fitting that definition, Heartbeat International only offers CEU credit to nurses for abortion pill reversal courses it offers online and at its annual conference. Heartbeat International has been a California-approved CEU provider since 2012, opting to go through California because the state’s CEUs are generally accepted throughout the United States. Since 2015, Heartbeat International has issued nursing CEUs to well more than 400 nurses. A Coordinated Effort to Steal Choices The board’s flip-flop fits into a larger pattern of the state of California’s targeting of political opponents who pose an alternative to abortion or otherwise threaten the abortion industry’s marketplace stranglehold. In addition to pursuing charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt in response to their three-year undercover work of exposing Planned Parenthood and others’ complicity in the trafficking of body parts harvested from aborted babies, the state of California also launched an assault on community-funded pro-life pregnancy centers and medical clinics with a 2015 law that could be challenged at the Supreme Court as early as this month. Earlier this month, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by several California churches that are challenging the state’s requirement that all insurance companies cover the cost of employees’ abortions. “At this point, it’s hard to say we’re surprised by any effort to prop up the failing abortion industry,” Godsey said. “But this is a direct effort to steal a mother’s choice right out from under her. Women and men become nurses to help and serve others, but politically driven moves like this keep them from accomplishing their compassionate, God-given mission.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2017/09/14/california-denies-women-choice-save-babies-abortion-pill-reversal/",0.9929,0.0071,"male",2012,2012
"258",258,"The Irish Mother Emma Watson Wrote To Didn’t Die Because Abortion Was Illegal","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-10-03"," Another celebrity has joined the slew of stars who supported Ireland’s repeal of its laws protecting life from conception, this time in an open letter from Emma Watson ostensibly to a woman who died of being refused an abortion. In an emotional open letter to Savita Halappanavar, whom she called “passionate” and “vivacious,” Watson invokes sympathy for the Indian-born woman who died while pregnant. In 2013, Halappanavar was not allowed to receive an abortion in Ireland despite her wishes and subsequently died. Abortion supporters say her death was directly due to the fact that abortion was illegal in Ireland at the time, and it sparked national outrage.  In a fashion magazine called Porter, Watson writes an open letter: Dear Dr Savita Halappanavar: You didn’t want to become the face of a movement; you wanted a procedure that would have saved your life. When news of your death broke in 2012, the urgent call to action from Irish activists reverberated around the world – repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution. Time and again, when our local and global communities collectively mourn a tragic death due to social injustice, we pay tribute, mobilize and proclaim: rest in power. A promise to the departed and a rallying call to society, we chant: never again. But it is rare that justice truly prevails for those whose deaths come to symbolize structural inequality. Rarer still is a historic feminist victory that emboldens the fight for reproductive justice everywhere. The timing no doubt marks the fact that Ireland’s president officially signed Ireland’s controversial reversal of their unborn protections into law on September 18. On May 25, the country voted to overturn their decades-old protections for unborn human life. Leading up to the vote, dozens of local celebrities, like Hozier, U2, and Boy George, promoted the repeal, saying it was the very definition of “love.” But Halappanavar Didn’t Die Because Abortion Was Illegal To be sure, Halappanavar’s death is a tragedy. It’s sad, awful, and no loved one would want to endure such news. However, it’s disingenuous to say that she died because abortion was illegal. It’s worse to use her death as a political tool. Halappanavar died of a septic miscarriage and a misdiagnosis of the sepsis. According to the official investigation, around 16-17 weeks’ gestation, she was told she was having a miscarriage, which took about a week to unfold.  During this time, Halappanavar requested an abortion. This abortion would not have been, as nearly all are, to kill her child, who had already died or was in the process of doing so naturally. In cases of miscarriage, similar procedures to abortion are sometimes used to make sure all of the child has left the mother’s body after it has died. But sometimes the miscarrying mother’s body ejects the child and related tissue on its own, and often doctors will wait for the mother to do that naturally before using dilation and curettage to ensure no parts of the child or pregnancy remain so the mother can heal. Doctors were unaware at this point that Halappanavar had sepsis—a blood infection—so they denied her request because they did not know her life was in danger. Eventually, doctors diagnosed the sepsis, but at that point the miscarriage was complete and the sepsis continued to attack her body. The official investigation found Halappanavar died of cardiac arrest caused by the sepsis. Yet Ireland’s abortion ban allowed the procedure if it was deemed medically necessary to save the mother’s life, so overturning the Eighth Amendment’s life protections for both mother and child was not at all necessary to protect Halappanavar or anyone else in her situation. Still, Halappanavar’s death following a miscarriage and the news that she had been denied an abortion sparked national outrage. Irish journalist Eilis O’Hanlon stated that in its initial coverage, The Irish Times had “opted to present what had happened as a simple morality tale” and said “the debate for the rest of the week was coloured entirely by The Irish Times’s decision to reduce a complex personal tragedy, about which few facts were still known, to a rallying call.”  Partly in response to her death and the outcry, the Irish government introduced and passed the “Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013” which loosened Ireland’s guidelines for their abortion law. Halappanavar’s name continued to be invoked during the campaign to repeal Ireland’s abortion law, just as Watson continues to invoke it now. But using her story this way is simply a misrepresentation of the facts. Abortion Is What Truly Endangers Women The fact that Watson is using Halappanavar to support a new law that makes it legal to abort babies is not surprising, since she’s on record as an abortion proponent. But her involvement is even more irresponsible in light of additional developments since Ireland voted on the referendum in May. Ireland has not only decided to make abortion legal, with a few parameters, but its Health Minister Simon Harris confirmed that abortions will be sponsored by taxpayers. Making abortion free will not just increase abortions but skyrocket them. Why? It’s called moral hazard: responsibility will go out the window, since others must pay for the “fix” for unwanted pregnancies. This is irresponsible not just fiscally but morally. On top of this, medical professionals warned the Oireachtas Health Committee that Ireland may be unprepared to suddenly embark on free, nationwide abortions. Doctors and other medical professionals told the Health Committee they are worried providers will not be adequately prepared to do abortions, due to lack of training or equipment. Dr. Mary Favier, vice president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, told the committee, “The result of this referendum has created a new reality. … Termination of pregnancy will be legalized for the first time in Ireland, this means that there are actually very few clinicians who are trained to deliver this care pathway unless they have received training outside of the jurisdiction.” So not only will there likely be a spike in abortions due to the law, and the fact that they are free, but Ireland’s doctors may be unprepared to facilitate the procedure safely. This is a long step backward from the place Ireland has been for decades, in terms of medical practices. According to the Maternal Death Enquiry, Ireland has been one of the safest countries in the world to have a baby in because doctors have found better ways to work through problems during pregnancy, since abortion was illegal. While it’s certainly become commonplace for Hollywood celebrities to insert themselves in political causes, Watson spread false propaganda. Neither misleading women nor advocating for killing their children is pro-woman. Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated “dilation and curettage is not a treatment for sepsis.” It is in fact the usual treatment for uterine sepsis before an unborn child reaches 14 weeks old. Halappanavar’s child was 17 weeks old at the time of her miscarriage. However, the purpose of such a procedure in cases like Halappanavar’s is not to kill the child, as an abortion is, but to clear the infected uterus of what will quickly kill the mother if not removed, in an effort to save any lives possible. Thus this use of the procedure is not comparable to elective abortions, as the author argues here. The Federalist consulted with an OB-GYN to clarify this matter and issue this correction.

"259",259,"Biden Administration Endorses More Baby Killing By Green-lighting Mail-Order Abortion Pills","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-12-17"," In the Biden administration’s latest decision to promote its radical pro-abortion agenda, the Food and Drug Administration announced on Thursday that it will allow women to mail-order abortion pills for do-it-yourself chemical abortions.
Previously, the FDA required women seeking to end the lives of their unborn babies up to 10 weeks gestation, right about when the baby-in-utero develops pain receptors, learns to curl his fingers, and even mimics breathing movements in the womb, to visit and obtain the drug from certified physicians. That prerequisite, however, was lifted earlier this year when the FDA announced it would “exercise enforcement discretion” in the name of the pandemic. Now, all that’s required to obtain the fatal, two-drug Mifeprex pills is a prescription from an abortion supplier via a telemedicine consultation.
Data shows that abortions performed at home using a pill caused a more than 500 percent increase in emergency room visits due to complications with chemical abortions. In a longitudinal study of the abortion drug mifepristone, one of the two drugs included in Mifeprex, the Charlotte Lozier Insitute found that in 17 taxpayer-funded abortion states, there was a 22 percent greater risk of general hospital visits within a month of taking an abortion pill and a 53 percent greater risk of chemical abortion-related hospital visits when compared to surgical abortion.
Similar studies focused on Finland, Sweden, and California found that abortion pill complication rates not only far outweighed surgical abortions but also increased over the years.
“Large-scale, peer-reviewed studies show chemical abortion is at least four times riskier for women than surgical abortion. Complications can include severe bleeding, infection, the need for surgical intervention, and in some instances even death. Taking abortion drugs during an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy, for example, can be fatal. No video chat, possibly from hundreds or even thousands of miles away, can replace in-person evaluation by a doctor. That is patient abandonment and an egregious example of playing politics with women’s health and safety,” said Tara Sander Lee, Ph.D., senior fellow and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute.
Several states including Ohio, Oklahoma, Montana, Indiana, Arkansas, Arizona, and Texas have already taken action to prohibit or limit the use of a mail-order abortion program while other red states are expected to follow.
“The Biden administration’s reckless move puts countless women and unborn children in danger. Abortion activists’ longtime wish has been to turn every post office and pharmacy into an abortion center. They promote abortion drugs as easy, painless and private,” Susan B. Anthony List State Policy Director Sue Liebel said. “Science says otherwise. Women who take chemical abortion pills are significantly more at risk of serious complications and more likely to require a visit to the emergency room. Some women even die. Already-exhausted ER doctors and nurses will be forced to ‘clean up after’ an abortion industry that puts profits before safety and won’t regulate itself — all to please Biden’s radical base and pay back political allies.”

"260",260,"Don’t Let Ralph Northam’s Racism Controversy Obscure Democrats’ Sickening Abortion Policies","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-04"," Last week’s outrage over Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s statement that babies born alive following a botched abortion could be allowed to die quickly evaporated when a racist photograph from Northam’s medical school yearbook began circulating. Northam quickly apologized for the picture, only to later backtrack, claiming that he was not the man in blackface or hidden beneath a Ku Klux Klan hood, but had darkened his face for a Michael Jackson costume that same year and thus his confusion. Either way, Northam’s political career is over: Even if Northam does not resign, he’s the lamest of lame ducks. While Democrats may not be happy with Northam for dragging out the inevitable and hurting their brand in the meantime, the uproar over Northam’s past succeeded in diverting attention from media’s focus on the party’s extreme abortion position.  Yet, even without the straight-talking Northam to expose the barbarity of late-term abortions, the extreme laws the Democratic Party supports remain unchanged. And those laws are even more horrific than even Northam’s comments revealed. Those comments came last week in a radio interview, when Northam was asked whether he supported state Del. Kathy Tran’s late-term abortion bill, which, as Tran acknowledged during committee debate, would allow an abortion at full-term even if the mother had already started labor. Northam told the radio host: “If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” The sub-committee tabled Tran’s bill. But many fail to realize that Northam’s statement that “the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired” applies equally to Virginia’s current abortion law. Under both current law and Tran’s proposed amendment, following an abortion, if there is “any clearly visible evidence of viability,” the abortionist must provide “life support.”  But nothing in the law requires the doctor to first resuscitate the newborn infant or to provide other ordinary care necessary to allow the infant to survive. Nothing also prevents the mother, who had just attempted to abort her now-newborn, from directing the hospital staff to abide by a do not resuscitate order. That is why, on the heels of Northam’s comments, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivor’s Protection Act for fast-track passage. This proposed legislation would require any health care practitioner present at the time a baby is born alive following an attempted abortion to “exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.” If passed, this law would prevent Northam types from leaving a newborn to die because that was the mother’s desire. Backlash over Northam’s comments sent the left into a full-spin zone. Northam himself said “I don’t have any regrets, but I do regret how my comments have been mischaracterized,” sticking to his claim that third-trimester abortions are only done in cases involving “severe deformities.” Defenders of Northam’s statements likewise pretended that the only babies to survive abortions will be those who bear a condition “incompatible with life” or with “severe deformities,” and thus any medical care for such a child would be futile. This position is both legally and factually wrong. Legally, Virginia law permits abortions of healthy, viable fetuses up to the point of delivery, if three physicians state that “continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman.”  While proponents of this provision paint the abortion as necessary to preserve the life of the mother, there is no reason such babies could not be delivered alive as opposed to delivered after they are killed. Further, the current law allows abortion based on mental health, not merely physical health, and mental health is often loosely interpreted. Tran’s proposed amendments would make it easier to obtain a late-term abortion in Virginia by expanding the legality of late-term abortions to circumstances in which one doctor certified that continuing the pregnancy would “impair” the “mental health” of the woman. Virtually any stress or anxiety caused by the pregnancy could qualify as impairing the mother’s mental health, making Tran’s proposed amendment one that would, in essence, allow abortion on demand to the point of birth, including of healthy and viable fetuses. While Tran’s bill was tabled, Virginia law still allows exactly the scenario that outraged Americans: the abortion of full-term fetuses after labor had begun. Further, although Virginia has not yet allowed any mental health condition to justify such barbaric practices, New York has: Less than two weeks ago, to cheering adulation, New York’s Democrat governor signed into law the so-called Reproductive Health Act. That law allows abortions for any reason prior to 24 weeks of gestation, which given scientific advancements of late will include some viable fetuses. The statute also legalizes abortions to the moment of birth if a “practitioner” believes it necessary “to protect” the patient’s health. Again, the squishy definition of mental health will suffice to allow the killing of a fully formed and viable fetus. Defenders of New York’s law and Virginia’s legislation nonetheless seek to justify late-term abortions as only occurring in cases of “severe deformities.” Factually, this claim is also false. The pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute admits, citing its own research, that “data suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.” Further, “fetal anomaly” would include such non-severe situations, such as a cleft palate or a club foot—“deformities” most Americans would be horrified to learn are used to justify a late-term abortion. If abortion activists want to defend their laws based on fake facts, conservatives need to call them out. We may no longer have Northam’s horrifying soundbite to question Democrats on their view of infanticide, but we still have the law—a law that permits the killing of full-developed, healthy, and viable fetuses until the moment of birth. Ask Democrats about their support for that law. When they obfuscate, ask whether they would support a law prohibiting late-term abortion absent the so-called severe deformities they hide behind. Their answer will expose them as both pro-eugenics and pro-abortion extremists.

"261",261,"Falling Short Of Honest Dialogue On The Abortion Pill","Loftis","Leslie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013-11-15"," Last week, New York Magazine published a post which covered RU-486, also known as mifepristone or the abortion pill, and how it has not revolutionized abortion as once expected. Ostensibly about the fact that a lack of an honest dialogue on abortion hurts women, the piece offered a word of correction to each side. The author noted that abortion proponents weren’t forthcoming about the extreme pain of medicine-induced abortion, and pro-lifers overstate the risks. But the piece fell short of a truly honest dialogue.
A few highlights from the post:
[T]here are eight cases [since 2000] of women dying from an infection after taking mifepristone.
When reading data in news reporting, the qualifying prepositional phrases, such as “from an infection,” are often very enlightening. There were eight cases of women dying from sepsis, yes, but an additional six reported deaths from other complications (including two from ectopic pregnancies that should not have been treated with the abortion drug) along with 612 hospitalizations (excluding the 14 total deaths) and 339 women “experienced blood loss requiring transfusions” listed in the FDA’s after market summary. The footnotes also mention five non-US deaths reported but not included in the total and state that the FDA cannot conclusively determine precise causal correlation due to practical things like reporting methods or individual doctor interventions.
The pro-choice movement relies upon these research qualifications to understate the risks in abortion. To get an honest dialogue, we must address the entirety of the footnotes, not just the qualifications that lower the ugly statistics.
And even though the World Health Organization says the pill is safe to be administered by medical professionals who aren’t doctors, many states have passed bills that say only a physician can administer it — in person.
Why might states have passed rules about restrictions? Because legally they must follow our own FDA, not the WHO. So why does the author reach for the WHO? Perhaps because the FDA things such as, “[T]he treatment procedure is contraindicated if a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete abortion, blood transfusions, and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.” That is from the medical providers guidelines.
Not only is the FDA more relevant than the WHO to state regulation, but their guidelines also make more sense. The complications don’t occur immediately upon administration of the drug. Note the 339 women who required blood transfusions. But for medical intervention, the number of deaths could be much higher. And the seemingly superfluous “–in person” requirement might be due to the need to rule out preexisting contraindications such as ectopic pregnancy.
Even after counseling at a clinic, many women are unprepared for the experience. “I took one pill at home, and I remember at one point actually feeling my cervix open. It was a terrifying feeling,” says Katie, who had a medication abortion in 2004. Another woman described pain that was “so intense that it’s hard to really remember. You sort of feel like you’re tripping or something.”
Either the counseling is cursory and wholly inadequate or abortion supporters have flooded the culture with so many assurances that abortion is easy, that women ignore the cautions as overdone, common sense safety warnings. To the author’s credit, she covered this point.
All of the above are relatively standard abortion debating tactics. It was the following statement that first caught my attention:
A nurse at an abortion clinic once told me, “Women who have done both will go back to surgical. I’ve never had anyone who’s done both go back to medical.”
The pro-choice movement often tsk-tsks concerns that women will use abortion as birth control. But to get to “go back to medical” a woman has to be on at least her third abortion. And for a nurse to make such an unqualified generalization, that suggests that third timers are at least not-rare.
Finally, let’s look at one last quote, from the introduction, that set the tone of the piece:
Advocates hoped — and anti-abortion groups feared — that the abortion pill would be prescribed by regular doctors, family practitioners and OB/GYNs, allowing women to have an abortion in the privacy of their home, far from the picket lines.
For the record, concern about the convenience of these pills wasn’t that women could do it away from the picket lines, but that their separation from medical care could jeopardize their safety. It’s difficult to manage an open and honest dialogue on the incredibly weighty subject of abortion, but a good first step is to put the best construction on others’ arguments, including that care for women underlies pro-life motivation.

"262",262,"You Won’t Believe What Texas Prosecutors Are Finding From Abortionists Opposing A Human Dismemberment Ban","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-09-26"," Earlier this month, a federal judge in Whole Woman’s Health v. Paxton entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting Texas officials from enforcing the state’s legislative ban on live dismemberment abortions—abortions performed by a doctor pulling a fetus apart limb by limb until the unborn baby dies. As I explained recently, rather than further challenge the district court’s temporary injunction, Texas’s Attorney General Ken Paxton opted instead to head to trial. Trial is set to begin on November 2. At trial, the plaintiffs—Whole Woman’s Health and a slew of other abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood—must prove that the live dismemberment abortion ban contained in Texas’s Senate Bill 8 “imposes an undue burden on women seeking to terminate a pregnancy before viability.” As the Supreme Court recently clarified, whether a law places an undue burden on a woman’s “right” to choose an abortion, courts must “consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.”  In preliminary court filings, the plaintiffs have already made clear their theory of the case: Senate Bill 8 imposes an undue burden on abortion access by banning the safest method of second-trimester abortions—dilation and evacuation, or D&E, abortions. Texas has defended the ban’s constitutionality by stressing that abortion providers may legally perform D&E abortions by causing fetal demise prior to dismemberment, with, for instance, the poison digoxin or by severing the umbilical cord. But the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction by making “sweeping allegations that causing fetal demise prior to dismemberment is not feasible because some doctors do not currently do it, it is unsafe, and it is ineffective.” Then Comes the Discovery Late last week, though, Paxton’s office won an important victory in its efforts to counter these claims: After six weeks of refusing to comply with Texas’s discovery requests, the district court ordered the abortion providers to turn over detailed information concerning the second-trimester abortions performed at their Texas clinics. Of significance, the abortion providers must identify each individual who performs or has performed abortions on fetuses 14 weeks old or older, from 2001 to the present, detailing the procedure performed, whether digoxin or another fetal demise technique was used, and whether fetal demise occurred prior to dismemberment, as well as whether any complications occurred. Additionally, the federal court ordered the plaintiffs to provide all records of digoxin purchases, any informational material or consent forms related to digoxin, and communications between Planned Parenthood Federated of America and the Planned Parenthood plaintiffs regarding digoxin. While it is too early to know whether these documents will negate the plaintiffs’ assertion that methods of causing fetal demise prior to dismemberment are ineffective and unsafe (to the woman), there is some evidence that will be the case. Specifically, in its Motion to Compel, Texas noted that in seeking a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs alleged digoxin fails to cause fetal demise 5 to 10 percent of the time, but that in discovery two of the plaintiff physicians who currently use digoxin estimate only a 1 to 2 percent failure rate.  Similarly, while the plaintiffs alleged that digoxin use prior to 18 weeks is “experimental,” implying that it is thus somehow unsafe (to the mother), Texas noted in its court filings that Planned Parenthood’s current policies—which were filed under seal and thus not available to the public—“clearly contemplate that providers may use digoxin in earlier gestational ages.” Now that the court has ordered the abortion providers to comply with Texas’s requests for additional information, the state will have access to internal documentation and communications to counter the plaintiffs’ assertion that the ban on live dismemberment abortions imposes an undue burden on abortion access. Texas Still Has Lots of Work to Do In addition, Paxton’s legal team will need to provide evidentiary support for the two main benefits Texas’s live dismemberment abortion bans confer: Protecting the integrity of the medical community and requiring the humane treatment of unborn (but constitutionally unprotected) human beings. It is still unclear what witnesses Texas intends to call, as the parties agreed not to file their witness lists with the court. But there is abundant evidence available to support Texas’s claim that performing later-term dismemberment abortions on still-living human beings degrades the integrity of the medical profession. David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt’s undercover Planned Parenthood videos for the Center for Medical Progress exposed that much, from doctors chomping on salads and swirling wine while nonchalantly discussing “crushing above” and “crushing below” to get the best fetal specimens, to cavalier Lamborghini-coveting abortion providers haggling over the price of baby body parts.  Then there is always the morbidity on display when one abortion provider was asked in the videos if there were “any fresh specimens from today” to view. The abortion provider responded with a laugh: “We had a really long day, and they’re all mixed up together in a bag.” Add to that the discovery in Michigan of an abortion doctor driving around with fetal remains in his trunk, and the progression of Kermit Gosnell from “a ‘respected man’ in his community” to mass murder. This is a man who began his career proclaiming, “As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them,” and ended it by stabbing newborn babies after failed abortions. Whether We Will ‘Ignore the Pain of the Fetus or Not’ Evidence also supports Texas’s position that the live dismemberment abortion ban helps further the state’s goal of preventing abortion providers from causing the death of fetus in an inhumane way. In its earlier court filings, Texas stressed that it would be illegal to kill an animal in the way the abortion providers kill a fetus in dismemberment abortions—pulling the unborn baby apart limb from limb until he bleeds to death. At trial, Texas would be well-served to back up this point with expert testimony from Dr. Maureen Condic. Condic testified before Congress on human development in uterus, explaining: To experience pain, a noxious stimulus must be detected. The neural structures necessary to detect noxious stimuli are in place by 8-10 weeks of human development. There is universal agreement that pain is detected by the fetus in the first trimester. The debate concerns how pain is experienced; i.e., whether a fetus has the same pain experience a newborn or an adult would have. . . .
In the end, when considering pain in any other human individual we must choose, based on what we know and what we observe, whether we will give that individual the benefit of the doubt, out of compassion, empathy and justice, or whether we will ignore the pain they experience simply because the precise psychological quality of their pain cannot be known with certainty. And this choice is as much about the kind of society we want to be as it is about the experience of the fetus. Imposing pain on any pain-capable living creature is cruelty. And ignoring the pain experienced by another human individual for any reason is barbaric. We don’t need to know if a human fetus is self-reflective or even self-aware to afford it the same consideration we currently afford other pain-capable species. We simply have to decide whether we will choose to ignore the pain of the fetus or not. Of course, these same facts also prove the inhumanity of killing a fetus by dioxin poisoning or severing his umbilical cord, neither of which causes instantaneous death. But that is exactly the point. Thus even if the abortion providers win following a trial, the pro-life cause will have succeeded in laying bare the violence of abortion—both to the public and later to the most likely destination, the U.S. Supreme Court.

"263",263,"FACT: Late-Term Abortions Are Never Medically Necessary","Rose","Lila",NA,"Davenport, Mary",NA,NA,"2019-02-26"," New York’s law legalizing abortion after a child’s gestational age of 24 weeks was caught in the crosshairs of President Trump’s state of the union address a few weeks ago. “Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth,” said the president. Dozens of news outlets rushed to quibble with his words. An NBC “fact check” labeled the statement false. The law allows abortions “after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or when it’s necessary to protect the life of the mother,” the fact-checker reported.  Defenders of this law and those like it say it is moderate and compassionate, concerned only with making sure women with life-threatening pregnancy complications are not left to die. But if one looks at the medical and legal context for the law and understands what exactly the terms mean, it becomes clear that the reality is much less straightforward—and much darker. Viability and Abnormalities First, let’s look at the idea of “fetal viability.” In Roe v. Wade and many state abortion laws, “viability” means the fetus has reached a sufficiently advanced gestational age to be able to survive outside the womb—22 weeks, with current medical technology. But the New York law uses the term “viability” in an unusual way to signify a life-limiting birth defect. Some fatal birth defects, such as Potter’s syndrome or thanatophoric dysplasia, are often detected at the 20-week ultrasound, with abortion recommended as the only option. But ultrasound images are not perfect. Some babies diagnosed by ultrasound as having lethal defects have turned out to be completely normal. Even when severe birth defects are present, babies can undergo surgical repair after birth.  Speaking of children born with omphalocele (organs outside of the body), former surgeon general and renowned pediatric surgeon C. Everett Koop noted: “The prognosis usually is good….the first child I ever did, with a huge omphalocele much bigger than her head, went on to develop well and become the head nurse in my intensive care unit many years later.” In the case of truly lethal birth defects, a child can be given perinatal hospice care instead of aborted. Perinatal hospice involves continuing the pregnancy until labor begins and giving birth normally to the baby,  in a setting of comfort and support until natural death occurs. It is similar to what is done for families with terminally ill older children and adults.  The family can spend the newborn’s life—be it minutes or hours—in comfort, with pain management available for the infant, until the baby passes away. Families who have experienced perinatal hospice say that brief time with their child is a precious memory that they would not trade. In contrast, many couples who have abortions for birth defects experience adverse long-term psychological and relational effects, and children who learn that they have siblings who were aborted can suffer feelings of worthlessness, guilt, distrust, and rage. Parents may also be counseled that their pre-born babies have conditions “incompatible with life,” such as Trisomy 18 or Down syndrome. These often non-fatal conditions, which cause mental and physical developmental problems, have been used to justify abortion. But even the most severely disabled of these children may go on to live for days, months, or years after birth. Whatever the prenatal diagnosis, they are still human beings, and they are alive.  What About the Mother’s Health? What about late abortion to preserve maternal “health”? In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court authorized abortion beyond fetal viability to protect the “life or health” of the mother. But in Doe v. Bolton, the companion case to Roe, the court gave such a sweeping definition of “health” (including physical, emotional, psychological, or familial well-being) that it effectively allowed states to permit abortion on demand throughout an entire pregnancy. To say that the New York law permits late-term abortions for “health” reasons implies that late-term abortions will only occur in life-or-death situations. But due to the Supreme Court’s extremely broad definition of “health,” many of these situations are simply not life-or-death at all. Statistics compiled by the Guttmacher Institute indicate that, in 2014, about 11,100 abortions were performed after 21 weeks, when babies have the ability to feel pain. Despite this large number of abortions, data about what drives these decisions are less than robust. But the information we do have reveals that the reasons given for these abortions are frequently similar to those motivating early-term abortions: relationship problems, young or old maternal age, and education or financial concerns. Abortion law defines “health” so broadly it has made many late abortions effectively elective, as it requires no genuine threat to the mother’s life. Advocates of abortion insist that late abortion must be kept legal because certain serious maternal health problems require abortions. This is completely false. There is no medical situation in which late abortion is medically necessary to save the life of the mother. In a common late abortion technique, a lethal intracardiac injection is given, and labor is induced. This takes between two and four days and is not a procedure done in true emergency situations. With any serious pregnancy complication, the pregnancy can be ended by inducing labor or delivering the baby via C-section—saving both the mother’s and the baby’s life. Late-Term Abortion Referrals Can Be Based in Ignorance Murphy Goodwin, M.D., a distinguished professor of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Southern California, writes that many abortion referrals based on maternal health situations reflect sheer ignorance from the referring physicians. Typically, he says, they are medical specialists who lack experience treating women with high-risk pregnancies. Goodwin describes describes multiple cases in which women with severe life threatening  conditions—from cardiac problems to cancer—were told that they needed to have abortions. In each situation, physicians were able to find solutions that allowed the mother to bring the baby to 28 weeks, at which point approximately 90 percent of babies survive in neonatal intensive care. Current law has an unfortunate pro-abortion bias. Physicians face severe legal penalties if they do not inform a mother of all possible risks of continuing a pregnancy. Yet there is no legal penalty for recommending abortion, even with minimal to no justification. Defending New York’s late-term abortion law as necessary to protect maternal and fetal health is disingenuous, if not downright dishonest. There is no situation in which late abortion is the only, or even the best, solution to a maternal or fetal health crisis. Advocates of this New York law, and of other states’ permissive late-term abortion laws, must be prepared to defend late abortion for what it is: the unnecessary destruction of a viable baby. There are alternatives to late abortion that protect women’s health and preserve the life and dignity of the baby. It is imperative that physicians, lawmakers, and citizens be informed of these alternatives, and understand that even in difficult situations, choosing life is always possible.

"264",264,"Planned Parenthood: Women Need An Abortion Center That Can’t Keep Them Safe","Downs","Rebecca",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-06-03"," Until a judge stepped in last week, May 31 was the last day Missouri would have had an abortion facility. The facility in question is Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, which has had difficulty renewing its state license due to health and safety violations. Yet last week a judge granted a temporary reprieve until a June 4 hearing. Planned Parenthood claims state requirements for license renewal were “out of its control.” CBS News reported:  According to Planned Parenthood, the health department said it was investigating ‘deficient practices,’ and needed to interview seven physicians who provide care at the clinic. Planned Parenthood said it could offer interviews only with two who are its employees. The other five physicians working at the facility are residents in training and not employed by Planned Parenthood, a spokesperson for the clinic said via email on Tuesday. The state has indicated that the result of those interviews could be ‘board review’ in addition to ‘criminal proceedings,’ the spokesperson said. The medical residents declined to be interviewed for the state’s investigation. If these medical residents refused to be interviewed to ensure the abortion facility is providing safe and proper care for women, how is that the state’s fault? Naturally, Planned Parenthood sounded the alarm, via a lengthy and hysterical statement on its website, tweets from President Dr. Leana Wen, and on mainstream news networks. As CNN reported, Missouri Gov. Michael Parson acknowledged that the facility “should have every right under the law to have their license renewed, but they should not receive any exemptions simply because they’re one clinic.” Parson also noted “this is about a standard of care for women in the state of Missouri.” It’s worth noting that even the abortion-friendly CNN conceded “the lack of a license would not mean the end of the health center. It would still provide care including birth control, STD testing and treatment, cancer screenings and more.” While the outlet bemoaned that “the reality of what this would mean for abortion access is stark,” what’s not only stark, but largely underreported, is the slew of incidents and medical emergencies occurring at the facility. In the statement, Wen referred to the possible cessation of providing abortions as “a real public health crisis.” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at the facility, claimed “our top priority is to ensure access to abortion continues so that every patient can access high-quality care in Missouri” and that “None of this has one bit to do with patient health or safety, but rather, banning abortion. State officials continue moving the goal post on abortion providers until we can no longer provide care.”  Pro-lifers can agree that there is “a real public health crisis,” and from McNicholas’ statements, one would never know it has to do with the facility still being allowed to provide abortions. Pro-lifers have dubbed this center “the most dangerous abortion facility in the country.” It just sent its 74th patient in 10 years to the hospital earlier this month as a result from a botched abortion. That’s about a medical emergency every seven weeks. Operation Rescue noted that it was the third time in 22 days an ambulance was called to the center. Witnesses described seeing “a prone woman totally strapped in and not moving.” On April 26 during another medical emergency, witnesses could not see the victim or if she was even conscious. Planned Parenthood has been prone to concealing and covering up medical emergencies this way. The ambulance even arrived quietly, without lights or sirens, despite state law requiring them to do so. Operation Rescue says “the most common reason for calls for emergency assistance and transport at the Planned Parenthood in St. Louis is hemorrhaging, which is a life-threatening condition.”  As if these medical emergencies were not bad enough, the clinic has had less than stellar health inspection results. An inspection from 2017 revealed the medical director, Dr. David Eisenberg, not washing his hands, the contamination of sterile gloves, the improper removal of soiled medical instruments, and a violation of infection protocol. With these key facts in mind, one could objectively make the argument that it is “about a standard of care” and that it is Planned Parenthood which is playing politics. If these medical emergencies continue, at such a rate, it would be “a real public health crisis” to not order them to stop performing abortion. This all comes after Parson recently signed legislation banning abortion at eight weeks in Missouri. It is worthwhile for the pro-life movement to debate making abortion unthinkable by banning it outright, or by seeking to restrict the procedure with a more incremental approach, such as through 20-week bans or with regulations meant to make the procedure safer for mothers. The latter is especially helpful in informing the public how abortion not only kills an unborn child, but is unsafe for the mother who undergoes the procedure. If an abortion clinic has to close because it can’t comply with health and safety regulations, as is the case in Missouri, then fault is with the clinic and the abortion industry, not the state. CBS reported that McNicholas claims to be “100 percent committed to the best care that we can provide for patients. So certainly if there is an issue with the care we’re providing we want to know about it.” She’ll forgive us for not believing her, especially when she chalks it up to how “we can’t do that when we’re being attacked.” It’s not an attack if and when medical care is substandard. Under Roe v. Wade, abortion was legalized in all 50 states, so it is likely courts will step in to allow the St. Louis facility to perform abortions, even if it does so unsafely. Such a standard, however, is not only unsafe for children being aborted, but for their mothers. It appears Planned Parenthood and its allies seek to protect abortion first and foremost, even unsafe abortion.

"265",265,"In States That Limited Abortion After Dobbs, Biden’s Federal Agencies Are Pushing It Anyway","Corso","Sophia",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-12-22"," As a result of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision returning abortion regulations back to the states, the Biden administration has worked overtime to open every back door to advance its pro-abortion agenda, including in states with recently passed abortion restrictions or even bans. To accomplish this, it has turned to federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs to terminate the lives of unborn children. These efforts have quickly turned into a legal disaster.



Just last week, news broke that Stephanie Carter, an Army veteran and nurse practitioner at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital in Texas, is suing the Department of Veterans Affairs for forcing her to handle and distribute abortion pills — one of the latest mandates enacted by the Biden administration to circumvent the Dobbs decision. The “Reproductive Health Services” rule enacted in September “immediately allowed elective abortions at VA medical clinics.”



This rule does not currently allow for religious exemptions for workers like Carter, who have religious objections that conflict with this life-ending procedure. When Carter attempted to opt out of the handling and distribution of abortion pills at the Olin E. Teague Veterans’ Center, her supervisor refused, according to a report from Live Action. This egregious violation of religious freedom has resulted in First Liberty Institute filing a lawsuit on Carter’s behalf.



To make matters worse, because this VA hospital is under both federal and state jurisdiction, Carter could be held liable for providing this abortion access, as it potentially conflicts with the various abortion restrictions in Texas.



“The rule that’s at issue in this case,” according to Danielle Runyan, an attorney of First Liberty Institute, “allows for abortions to be provided … to protect the life or health of the mother. ‘Health’ [can be] a wide variety of things that can potentially be in conflict with the laws of the state of Texas. So not only are Ms. Carter’s religious liberties being violated, but she could also be held criminally and civilly liable here in Texas if she complies with the rule.”



The Larger Biden Abortion Agenda



This gross violation of religious liberties is just one instance in the Biden administration’s recent efforts to bring abortions to states with pro-life laws. Just two weeks after the quite literally life-altering Dobbs decision, President Joe Biden signed the executive order “Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services” in an attempt to access any loopholes.



The Federalist staff writer Jordan Boyd explained this order will effectively “funnel federal time, resources, and funds, mostly through the Department of Health and Human Services, to shield existing abortion facilities, promote unlimited abortion, and circumvent Republican state laws to help send women to abortion appointments in other states.”



Additionally, the order’s pledge to “protect access to medication abortion” is a misleading euphemism for a chemical abortion that starves, kills, and expels the dead child from a mother’s womb. This is clearly the antithesis of “medication” and has also sparked lawsuits against the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The order is just another way for the Biden administration to push abortion into states that have legally placed restrictions on it.



Since this order was signed, HHS has further peddled this abortion agenda. In August, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure wrote a letter to each U.S. governor, encouraging them to work with CMS by applying “for Medicaid 1115 waivers to provide increased access to care for women from states where reproductive rights are under attack and women may be denied medical care.”



So while the Dobbs decision has promoted federalism, reverting the choice to legalize or ban abortion back to the states, the pro-abortion Biden administration led by our self-proclaimed Catholic president is working to find every last loophole to allow the killing of unborn children in these abortion-restricted areas. Lawsuits like Carter’s may have these mandates come tumbling down into the same ash heap Roe now lies in.

"266",266,"Abortion Is About ‘Women’s Health’ Like The Civil War Is About ‘States’ Rights’","Hemingway","Mark",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-08-17"," Jeb Bush recently said something dumb. Now, Jeb Bush is not dumb. Far from it. But politicians who have to talk all day for weeks at a time are prone to slip up. He said: “I’m not sure we need a half a billion dollars for women’s health issues — but if you took dollar for dollar, there are many extraordinarily fine organizations, community health organizations that exist, federally sponsored community health organizations to provide quality care for women on a wide variety of health issues. But abortion should not be funded by the government, any government in my mind.” He later clarified that he meant to say, that in the context of Planned Parenthood, money given to the abortion provider should be spent on other, more worthy health initiatives. So why did Jeb Bush say what he said?  Well, the most logical answer would be that Jeb was tripped up by the pro-choice movement’s own concerted effort to twist political rhetoric into something divorced from reality. It’s a long-standing goal of the pro-choice movement to make an elective procedure that kills gestating human beings synonymous with “health care.” If you don’t believe me, see the “community campaign” over at abortionishealthcare.com. Or maybe you could read this HuffPo op-ed from the CEO of Planned Parenthood New York City headlined “Abortion is Health Care.” In December, Cecile Richards, the national president of Planned Parenthood, wrote an op-ed headlined “Women’s Health Care Under Attack: Sneak Preview of 2015.” In other words, Richards was already planning to accuse pro-life politicians who oppose Planned Parenthood of attacking women’s “health care” long before Jeb Bush put his foot in his mouth. Abortion Isn’t Health Care So before we go along with this Orwellian attempt to describe dismembering a fetus in the womb as “women’s health care,” let’s get something straight. Abortion is about “women’s health care” the way that the Civil War was said to be about “states’ rights.” It’s a convenient distraction from the moral atrocity that defines the conflict, designed to make those who take the odious position seem justified. No genuinely objective person thinks it’s accurate or fair to say the recent attempts to deny Planned Parenthood tax dollars is an attack on women’s health. Even more disturbing, pro-choice activists have been remarkably successful at getting the media to help them bowdlerize the debate such that Jeb Bush gets pilloried throughout the press for an obvious mistake. Meanwhile, at outlets such as The Atlantic, we get Gillian White attacking Jeb Bush and declaring that “Planned Parenthood receives about $530 million from the government annually, or $3 per woman per year. Seems pretty worth it.” Out of this 600 words of argumentative sludge defending federal funds to Planned Parenthood, you know what word is missing? That’s right, “abortion.” Apparently, some of Planned Parenthood’s defenders can’t even bring themselves to mention it, lest they have to wrestle with the concrete reality of endorsing an organization that surgically dismembers fetuses and founded on the rationale that that abortion leads “ultimately to a cleaner race.” No genuinely objective person — and by that, I mean precious few journalists — thinks it’s accurate or fair to say the recent attempts to deny Planned Parenthood tax dollars is an attack on women’s health. In fact, the recent Senate bill that would have defunded Planned Parenthood didn’t just strip Planned Parenthood of the hundreds of millions in federal funds it receives every year, it would have taken that money and distributed it to other providers of health care for women. If Democrats in Congress agreed to defund Planned Parenthood in exchange for quadrupling the amount of federal dollars spent on health care for women, the pro-life members of Congress would leap to take that deal.  Nonetheless, Planned Parenthood supporters like to pretend that the organization’s rasion d’etre is something other than abortion. “I shouldn’t have to point this out, but I guess I do: abortion is not funded by the government, by law,” wrote The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent earlier this month. “Saying ‘abortion should not be funded by the government’ as an argument for forbidding women to get health services from Planned Parenthood is like saying that because some supermarkets sell beer, food stamps shouldn’t be able to be used at supermarkets, even though food stamps can’t be used to buy beer.” Planned Parenthood Doesn’t Deserve The Benefit Of The Doubt The idea that the federal funds Planned Parenthood gets aren’t fungible and that there’s some sort of strict firewall that keeps your tax dollars from subsidizing abortion is as laughable as Sargent’s analogy is daft. If this is true, Planned Parenthood will happily agree to a third-party audit clearly demonstrating all of the federal funds aren’t subsidizing abortion, right? This assertion also relies on the notion that Planned Parenthood can be relied on to act honorably. Call me crazy, but when your organization has been caught on tape helping pimps make trafficking underage girls look “as legit as possible,” maybe they don’t get the benefit of the doubt about following the law or looking out for “women’s health.” And just last week, Planned Parenthood was caught lying about how its Texas facilities didn’t participate in fetal tissue research after they were caught on tape by the Center for Medical Progress picking out baby parts out of a dish and bragging about their long history of selling them. There’s plenty of ways to offer women’s health services without making women rely on abortion providers. It’s also worth noting that Planned Parenthood is by no measure the largest provider of “women’s health care” in the country. There are more than 9,000 community health care centers in the country, compared to 700 for Planned Parenthood. And the organization and its supporters have brazenly pretended that the organization provides health care services that it doesn’t in order to make Planned Parenthood seem more needed than it is. President Obama himself claimed that “there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care; they rely on it for mammograms.” But Planned Parenthood doesn’t do any mammograms — none at all. There’s plenty of ways to offer women’s health services without making women rely on abortion providers. But let’s consider the first part of what Obama said, and let’s take a really expansive view of “women’s health care” and say that it includes contraceptive services. In May, Sens. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) introduced the “Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act,” to make oral contraceptives legal to sell over the counter without a prescription, an idea that a great many national Republicans favor.  How did the pro-choice community react? NARAL Pro-Choice America’s president Ilyse Hogue said the “bill is a (sic) specifically designed to deceive voters into thinking these anti-choice legislators are on the side of women, when their track records tell a starkly different story.” In other words, the politics of abortion are so scorched earth, that demonstrable effort to increase access to birth control is to be opposed if it would redound to the credit of pro-life politicians. It’s odd how these supposed champions of women’s health services now find themselves strongly opposed to efforts to make health care for women much easier to obtain. The Schism Between The Physical And Political Treatment Of Human Beings Of course, Planned Parenthood also officially opposes over the counter birth control in no small part because that would mean fewer women would go to Planned Parenthood for birth control prescriptions. And that in turn helps subsidize all the abortions they perform. To the extent that women need birth control and other health services, they can easily be provided without Planned Parenthood being federally subsidized. If this country is as pro-choice as Planned Parenthood insists it is, the people who believe that “women’s health care” includes the right to kill a child in the womb specifically because you’re a woman can stand up and pay for it without reaching into my pocket for the blood money. And one day, 150 years from now, we’ll look back with the same kind of horror at people who say abortion is about “women’s health care.” Abortion is not health care, pure and simple. If you believe in abortion, the least you can do is forthrightly argue that it’s a moral act without arguing it’s something that it’s not. The more pro-choice activists find themselves pretending that the debate to defund Planned Parenthood is about “women’s health care,” the more they’re only fooling themselves. In the Obama era, the phrase “wrong side of history” has been oft abused. But if we are to determine who is on the wrong side of history, a good litmus test is figuring out who is employing nakedly political rhetoric to win what is at heart a moral debate. In this respect, no other debate since slavery and its related racial sins has created a such a jarring schism between politics and the physical treatment of human beings. We all know the Civil War wasn’t really fought over states’ rights. And one day, 150 years from now, we’ll look back with the same kind of horror at people who say abortion is about “women’s health care.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2015/08/17/abortion-is-about-womens-health-like-the-civil-war-is-about-states-rights/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"267",267,"In Bizarre Screed, FiveThirtyEight Falsely Labels Pro-Lifers Racist, Ignores Racism Of Abortion Industry","Whitehead","Beth",NA,"Hemingway, Mollie",NA,NA,"2022-07-26"," Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website claims to use “statistical analysis to tell compelling stories about elections, politics, sports, science and life” and attempts to present itself as a moderate voice, alongside its fellow Disney-owned media properties such as ESPN and ABC News, both of which have endured heavy criticism for erroneous and ideologically driven reporting in recent years. FiveThirtyEight’s recent abortion article, however, goes a long way toward disabusing readers of the notion that it is an empirical or centrist media outlet. 



The inaccurate screed argues that the pro-life movement is intrinsically rooted in racism, even though the modern abortion industry is an outgrowth of blatantly racist and eugenicist thought among early 20th-century progressives. Even more bizarrely, it argues the pro-life movement has ties to “replacement theory,” an oft-quoted idea in corporate media that the left will politically dominate due to a massive influx of immigrants.



The article, “How The Fight To Ban Abortion Is Rooted In The ‘Great Replacement’ Theory,” written by Alex Samuels and her colleague Monica Potts, even openly contradicts its own thesis. 



In order to make this tenuous assertion, the article invokes the recent racist mass shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York. The authors note that in the shooter’s 180-page manifesto, he “expressed concern about the declining birth rates of white people. That’s because the anti-abortion movement, at its core, has always been about upholding white supremacy.”



However, the shooter never once mentioned the word “abortion,” and that’s probably for a very obvious reason: Racists understand that legal abortion is very helpful for their twisted cause. Abortion rates for black women are about four times that of white women, and abortion advocates routinely oppose laws designed to prevent abortion based on the sex and race of the child being aborted. Planned Parenthood has 62 percent of its abortion centers strategically placed within two miles of concentrated African American populations.



FiveThirtyEight also launches into a very dubious history lesson: “Declining white birth rates, along with the rising eugenics movement — a now-discredited pseudoscience focused on the genetic fitness of white Americans — were connected to the practice of abortion, and this helped bolster flawed, racist arguments for a total ban of the procedure.” FiveThirtyEight makes no attempt to explain how opposition to euthanasia and abortion would lead to “flawed, racist arguments for a total ban” of abortion, since abortion reduces the black population and euthanasia has historically been a means of targeting minorities and those with disabilities. 



The founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, spoke to the KKK and was a proponent of euthanasia and birth control, known for her saying, “Eugenics without birth control seems to us a house builded upon the sands. It is at the mercy of the rising stream of the unfit.” In 2020, Planned Parenthood took Margaret Sanger’s name off a New York City facility, and said the move was “the first of many organizational shifts to address Sanger’s legacy and system of institutional racism.” 



And while it might be understandable that reporting on an issue as polarizing as abortion would cause reporters to rely on ideologically driven sources, FiveThirtyEight resorts to fringe voices such as “the co-founder of the Institute for Research on Male Supremacism.” 



Finally, in a key paragraph, the authors seem to admit that the premise of their own article is contradictory and incoherent:



Even on its own terms, though, the logic of tying the anti-abortion movement to the racist great replacement theory is deeply convoluted — and downright inaccurate. For instance, fewer women are seeking abortions, and women of color — particularly those who are Black — are more likely than white women to seek an abortion. 



“This idea that they are writing about the nation, that the fight over abortion rights is somehow tied to great replacement theory — there’s just no evidence for in what they’ve written,” Dr. James Sherley, stem cell biologist and associate scholar of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, told The Federalist. “If you look at all of the causes of deaths for African Americans, that rate is still less than all the deaths due to abortions — so abortion is the number one killer of black people in America. That just really flies in the face of this article by FiveThirtyEight.”



“It’s just really a terrible article,” he added. “It’s a random assortment of random observations.”

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the embryo implants and begins growing somewhere outside the uterus, almost always in one of the mother’s fallopian tubes. “In these cases, the pregnancy can’t continue normally, and it requires emergency treatment,” states WebMD. “Unfortunately, the foetus cannot be saved in an ectopic pregnancy. Treatment is usually needed to remove the pregnancy before it grows too large,” says the U.K.’s National Health Service. “There is no way to save an ectopic pregnancy. It cannot turn into a normal pregnancy,” according to the major health provider Cigna. “You will need quick treatment to end it before it causes dangerous problems.” Every patient-facing source I’ve found gives the same answer: Agree to abortion, or risk your own death. Is Abortion Always the Only Answer? As I wrote recently with regard to NIPT (Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing), medical professionals and those who report on medical issues sometimes perpetuate false, and lethal misunderstandings. Doctors aren’t infallible; they are liable to accept the status quo without question, thus limiting patients’ options, and move forward with hasty interventions that lower their risk of getting sued.  Abortion is almost universally assumed by pro-lifers and abortion advocates alike to be the only answer in cases of ectopic pregnancy. Pro-lifers say it’s “the sad exception” to abortion bans because “the mother’s life is threatened.” This threat is rarely defined but extremely alarming, especially when pronounced by a doctor. It’s no wonder nearly every mother facing an ectopic pregnancy chooses to terminate. But we owe it to mothers and their babies to examine how severe and how common this threat to her life and health really is, and if there are other ways to ensure her safety that don’t include killing the child. According to a 2017 report in Obstetrics and Gynecology, 54 U.S. deaths were due to ectopic pregnancies in 2011-2013. If roughly 2 percent of all pregnancies are ectopic, we can estimate a maternal death rate of 0.023 percent for ectopic pregnancies.* We don’t know what the rate would be if abortion weren’t employed in most of these cases, but more importantly, what’s missing from the data are the specific reasons these deaths occurred (e.g., delayed treatment, misdiagnosis, etc). Data from the U.K. and Ireland might help clarify whether the risk of death or serious injury can be substantially mitigated in cases where ectopic pregnancies are left to continue.  The Facts About Ectopic Pregnancies Ectopic pregnancy (EP) deaths “mainly occur after an acute initial presentation,” according to a clinical practice guide from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and Directorate of Clinical Strategy and Programmes, Health Service Executive, revised in 2017. In other words, no warning signs presented, so there was therefore no opportunity to manage the situation before it became an urgent matter. The guide also noted that “in about half of those with EP presenting to emergency departments the diagnosis is missed at first assessment.” Likewise, according to 2003-2005 data from the U.K., an inquiry into maternal deaths indicated that “most of the women who died from ectopic pregnancy were misdiagnosed in the primary care or accident and emergency settings.” That is to say, they died because health care providers thought something else was wrong with them, such as appendicitis, not because doctors saw they had an ectopic pregnancy and opted for close monitoring of the pregnancy until it ended on its own or required medical intervention (called “expectant management” or “watchful waiting”) instead of immediate abortion. It’s important to note that about half of tubally implanted embryos die on their own without medical intervention (between 47 percent and 82 percent in cases of expectant management) and without threatening the mother’s health. Embryos are reabsorbed into the tissue, which is exactly what methotrexate, the widely popular “early intervention” alternative to surgical removal, is used for. In cases where the tube ruptures, on the other hand, the baby has most likely perished already, so abortion isn’t necessary in this circumstance, either. In cases where neither scenario has played out yet, there’s a strong argument to be made that abortion is not necessary. According to Dr. Patrick Johnston in an article for Celebrate Life Magazine, suctioning out the hemorrhaged blood, filtering it, and reinserting it via IV (called autotransfusion) “has a higher success rate than the most commonly employed abortive method.” A study of 632 cases of exclusive use of autotransfusion for ruptured ectopic pregnancies in 16 developing and 5 developed countries yielded one death “thought to be due to pulmonary embolism” and “nine major and minor complications.” So, the death rate was 0.16 percent, and 98.4 percent of patients had no complications. That’s better than the 94.4 percent non-morbidity rate for the least invasive form of appendectomy (although there were no deaths in that study). Knowing that a medical condition carries a very small chance of death is scary, and 0.16 percent is higher than the estimate given above, where abortion is aggressively used to “treat” the pregnancy. The sample size for the study is 382 times smaller than my U.S. EP estimate, of course, but assuming it’s accurate, is that very small chance enough to prompt you to suffer through purposely destroying your own child? Would you rather live with that on your conscience, knowing that in all likelihood it wasn’t necessary? Still, death isn’t the only concern in ectopic pregnancies. A loss of a functioning fallopian tube due to rupture lowers fertility, although in some cases doctors can repair a ruptured tube. As it stands, 60 percent of women who have had ectopic pregnancies go on to have another normal pregnancy (including women who didn’t plan to conceive). Even if this weren’t the case, is the potential loss of fertility a sufficient reason to keep abortion legal for ectopic pregnancies? It is right to destroy a human life for fear you may have trouble creating more? And the risks associated with EPs must also be contextualized by the fact that ectopic pregnancies sometimes do result in live births, so a woman with an EP isn’t necessarily risking her health for no child. Some Embryos Reimplant — and Survive In a 1982 paper in the Journal of the National Medical Association, author John F. J. Clark discusses the success rates of embryos naturally reimplanting from the fallopian tube to other areas outside the uterus. “In the 20 patients who had the symptoms, reimplantation occurred from five weeks to ten weeks,” he states, showing that chorionic tissue (the membrane surrounding the embryo) is, “very adaptable in relocating on various sites.” Out of 44 patients with advanced ectopic pregnancy, 18 cases progressed beyond 28 weeks of gestation, and 9 babies were delivered live, all between 34 and 40 weeks. Specific cases of infant survival have come to light as well, such as that of Thomas Smith, born January 1974, and twins Heidi and Halle, born August 2013. In the latter case, an embryo traveled down the tube into the womb shortly before the surgery to remove the tube and the embryo thought still to be inside it. Taken altogether, this evidence suggests that patients with ectopic pregnancies that don’t “resolve on their own” (about half of cases) but cause a rupture and hemorrhaging can be effectively treated with autotransfusion. If left alone, a small minority of babies will reimplant in a safer location (such as on top of the tube) between weeks 5 and 10 and continue developing. Twenty percent or more of those could result in a live birth at term or near term, with at least another 20 percent making it past the current point of viability at 22 weeks. The Medical Consequences of Abortion Legality Obviously, it’s much safer for a baby to develop in the uterus. One might think that, two decades into the 21st century, doctors would have found a way to transplant an embryo from the tube to the uterus, yet we have only a little evidence it has ever been done successfully. In a 1990 letter to the editor in Human Reproduction, Landrum B. Shettles described his success. He is elsewhere cited by J. G. Grudzinskas as having performed a successful transfer. Letters to the editor are not excellent evidence, however. There are two other reports of successful embryo transfers leading to live birth, one from 1917 by C.J. Wallace, which wasn’t peer-reviewed and likely didn’t happen, and another in 1994 by J.M. Pearce that was retracted by the journal after an investigation found no evidence he ever performed the study. Even if no transfer has yet been successful, it may be because, as the authors of the report to which Grudzinskas was responding, stated, the window for a successful transfer surgery is “just where laparoscopic surgery and medical therapy afford the best results.” In other words, why bother attempting more invasive surgery if you can less invasively remove the embryo (thus resulting in its death) or chemically destroy it by causing its reabsorption into the tissue? As long as the woman can maintain her fertility, what’s the big deal? Take note: This near-universal refusal to save tiny lives is a consequence of legal abortion, which promotes the idea that only one patient’s welfare — the larger, older one — must be considered when her health is at risk. As long as abortion is legal, it is the go-to “preventative” solution for ectopic pregnancies. Doctors don’t want to be sued for malpractice if a pregnancy develops complications, and they tell mothers that abortion is their only safe option. As long as the tiny life is expendable, why not just kill it to be on the “safe side” and move on? Abortion Is Never the Answer But if killing the preborn weren’t legal, doctors would be more likely to develop solutions that safeguard the welfare of both patients. That includes improving the accuracy of early diagnosis, so patient and doctor can be informed of the signs and symptoms of rupture, and discovering and improving techniques to reimplant the embryo in the uterus. Most mothers want desperately for their baby to survive — and knowing that abortion is not necessary and not an option, they’ll fight for their little one, encouraging health care providers to fight, too. Just like the common false positives that result from early prenatal screening, which parents are led to believe are extremely rare, the false dogma surrounding ectopic pregnancies is likely contributing to the abortion rate. The goal of debunking the conventional wisdom shouldn’t be merely to ensure patients “know their options,” though. It should be to wake up the whole world to the fact that abortion is never the answer and galvanize citizens to demand an end to the abominable practice — with no exceptions. *This is a rough figure using 102 percent of the total live births (11,838,612) during that time period as total number of pregnancies. If one includes an estimate of miscarriages and non-EP abortions, the death rate would be even lower, as the estimated number of ectopic pregnancies would be even higher. This article offers no medical advice for specific cases; in such circumstances, always consult your doctor.

"269",269,"The Abortion Storyline In Lindy West’s ‘Shrill’ Shouts An Important Truth","Wolfe","Liz",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-03-20"," Contrary to my cynical expectations, Hulu’s new TV series, “Shrill,” is not entirely offensive or unfunny, despite my disdain for the author of the book it’s based on — Lindy West, co-founder of the #ShoutYourAbortion campaign. In a sense, it’s a fat person finally getting her due, not being belittled or stooping to the Rebel Wilson-esque tired archetype of comic relief. Annie (Aidy Bryant) is not the butt of every joke or subjected to crude, low physical humor. The show is fundamentally a story about Annie gaining a sense of how to stand up for herself, and it’s decently nuanced despite some naive or silly moments.  In an entertainment landscape where there’s sometimes a dearth of dignity offered to fat people and people who don’t fit traditional beauty ideals, it’s refreshingly thoughtful, albeit significantly less funny than woke comedy lookalike “Broad City” and Lena Dunham’s slightly more serious counterpart, “Girls.” Seattle’s alt-bi-weekly The Stranger puts it well: “This is one of the first times we’ve seen someone like her before—the main character in a show centered around a fat woman who isn’t trying to change herself but instead is figuring out what she wants.” I take no issue with a search for empowerment, and find Annie endearing at times. But there’s a bigger issue with the storyline (and one touched on by my colleague Libby Emmons here): Annie’s abortion. Abortion Representation on TV Abortion storylines in TV are still relatively few and far between. “Grey’s Anatomy” has two — or, rather, almost has two. Cristina Yang attempts to get one early on but ends up having an ectopic pregnancy that causes her to collapse dramatically during surgery (show creator Shonda Rhimes has a penchant for dramatic collapses). It’s only later in the series that she gets pregnant again, with her husband’s baby (that he’d very much like to keep), and gets an abortion, right on prime-time TV. Pro-life beliefs aside, this is a “good” abortion storyline, if there is such a thing. That’s because it’s representative of the type of woman who most often gets abortions instead of the most sympathetic possible cases, which are not always representative of reality.  The new Canadian show on Netflix, “Workin’ Moms,” has a good abortion storyline too. Sassy and bitter Anne, who already has two children, finds out she is pregnant with a third. She’s seemingly rich, and she’s married, although she doesn’t seem thrilled about her husband’s existence. Together they make the decision to have an abortion after extensive list-making weighing the options. The actress who plays Anne (Dani Kind) reflected on the plot device, saying “I have never seen a woman on a TV show or in a movie who is married, with her husband, decide to abort their third child…it was a decision that brought them peace. It was a beautiful thing they were doing together and had decided it together for their marriage and their family. I had never even thought of abortion in that way.” Beautiful isn’t how I’d describe it, but her comments reflect the strange reality of what many of us think about abortion: that it isn’t something sought by married mothers when, in fact, it very much is. (One less realistic component to many of these storylines is that the characters tend to be pretty wealthy. Statistically speaking, women who seek abortions are often lower income.) The “Shrill” storyline is also good, as is the “Girls” storyline where notoriously selfish dips–t Jessa flakes on her own abortion appointment to hook up with a stranger in a bar bathroom (she realizes she’s bleeding during the encounter, rendering the appointment moot anyway). They’re good because showing the actual statistical reality of abortion bolsters pro-lifers’ arguments and gives pause to moderates.  The abortion dialogue too often centers around exceptions—what to do in cases of rape, what to do when teenagers who are ill-prepared to parent get pregnant, what to do when women are too poor to take care of a baby. Actual abortions are in fact sought by these people; but an inconvenient part of the story is that abortions are, in a surprisingly large number of cases, sought by women who just don’t feel like being a mom or just don’t want to have a kid (or another kid, in many cases) or just want to enjoy their twenties (or thirties). Not exactly the best sob story of all time. Data Don’t Lie Statistically speaking, lots of women who have abortions are already mothers. Plenty are married. A bunch are adults who can (or should be able to) largely provide for themselves. According to the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute, women between the ages of 20 and 24 obtained 34 percent of all abortions, and women between the ages 25 and 29 obtained 27 percent of all abortions. Together, women in their twenties account for the majority (only 3 percent of abortions are performed on people between the ages of 15 and 17 and less than 0.2 percent are under 15). Lots are hipsters running around Portland (in Annie’s case) or Brooklyn (in Jessa’s case) having unprotected sex or being foolish with birth control methods, as if buying a few condoms is somehow hard. About half of people who seek abortions were living with a partner (spouse or boyfriend) at the time they got pregnant, per 2014 data. From the same year, about 59 percent of abortions were obtained by women who had already birthed a child. The most baffling statistic, that perhaps shows just how true “Shrill” is to reality, is that only 51 percent of women seeking abortions in 2014 were using some form of birth control in the month they became pregnant. You read that right: people aren’t buying condoms, and that’s leading to abortions. Or they’re not using condoms (or IUDs, or contraceptive pills), and that’s leading to abortions. Perhaps our morality is broken if “rawdogging” (the condom-free sex that Annie’s casual, hairy manchild partner prefers) is worth aborting a fetus. As a libertarian, I’m generally compelled by the argument floated by abortion advocates that the reason someone seeks an abortion should really be nobody else’s business, not up for review. In many other areas, I agree. The reason someone seeks to use marijuana doesn’t need to be justified to society overall–it doesn’t need to be wrapped in some medical excuse, or with doctor’s supervision, for it to be a perfectly worthwhile decision. The reason someone chooses to smoke cigarettes doesn’t need to be opened up to the peanut gallery, either, when it’s one’s own body on the line (arguments about health care liability aside). Yet abortion is different if you believe, like I do, that an innocent being is directly and irrevocably harmed by the choices of his or her mother. Compassion for Some, Less for Others A significant part of the abortion debate—or at least those of us wondering how to reduce unwanted pregnancies and support women in difficult situations—hinges on pro-lifers and pro-choicers attempting to find common ground and genuine solutions for mothers who are, through circumstances sometimes outside of their control, in unfathomably difficult situations. These are the people sometimes trotted out by those who are politically moderate, and perhaps rightfully so. Many pro-lifers wonder how to create a harm reduction framework where abortion is seen as unacceptable in our society, but desperate women aren’t forced into dangerous, black-market situations. In other words, it might not be morally complicated to adjudicate (abortion is wrong, period), but it’s a bit stickier from a public policy perspective when we consider the plights of women who are so poor they will struggle to provide proper care to a child, or women who have no familial support. Sex is messy, and relationships are complicated. When a child results from an abusive or unhealthy union, it’s tough to figure out how to support a mother who is trudging forward in a less-than-ideal circumstance. But TV shows like “Shrill” are good because they accurately portray the types of choices that often lead to abortions. Sometimes it’s as simple as stupidly not using condoms and relying on obscene numbers of the morning-after pill (which, by the way, is not good for your body). This is less sympathy-inducing than other narratives, but more true to reality than pro-choicers might want you to believe. It’s also an easier case for pro-lifers to look at and judge: in a surprisingly large number of cases, there’s really no good excuse for women to be seeking abortions. A good number of them are not too desperate or helpless, they’re just irresponsible. Then again, per pro-choice logic, that’s their prerogative.

"271",271,"New Mexico Town Votes Unanimously To Become Sanctuary City For Unborn Despite Governor’s Abortion Radicalism","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-11-16"," In a direct rebuke to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s radical abortion agenda, the City Council of Hobbs, New Mexico, unanimously voted last week to become a sanctuary city for the unborn.



Overwhelming support for and passage of the ordinance mean abortion is now classified as murder and outlawed within Hobbs city limits. It also means that any blue politicians or abortion facilities that try to go against the city’s wishes could face an uphill legal battle. 



The vote was vehemently opposed by Lujan Grisham, who called the architects of the ordinance “out-of-state extremists.” The governor’s reaction is no surprise considering her own history of abortion extremism. 



Shortly after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision, Lujan Grisham signed an executive order designating $10 million in taxpayer funds toward the development of an abortion facility in Doña Ana County, an area that shares a border with El Paso, Texas. That was just a couple of months after Lujan Grisham signed an executive order “protecting medical providers from attempts at legal retribution” for granting abortions and refusing to comply with other states’ abortion extradition laws. 



“As more states move to restrict and prohibit access to reproductive care, New Mexico will continue to not only protect access to abortion, but to expand and strengthen reproductive health care throughout the state,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “Today, I reaffirm my resolve to make sure that women and families in New Mexico — and beyond — are supported at every step of the way.”



Since then, abortion dominated the state’s political scene and even became a focal point in Lujan Grisham’s re-election race against Republican challenger Mark Ronchetti.



Amy Hagstrom Miller, the CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, one of the nation’s largest dealers of abortion, previously told Reuters that Lujan Grisham’s friendliness toward abortion led her to consider relocating some of their Texas facilities closer to the border with New Mexico.



The goal was to offer abortion to women in neighboring Texas cities such as Lubbock, which voted to become a sanctuary city for the unborn in May of 2021, following the Lone Star State’s ban on abortion via the Texas Heartbeat Act.



Residents of Hobbs, a nearly 40,000-person town, however, weren’t taking any chances on getting swept up in Lujan Grisham’s pro-abortion executive spree. The pro-life community in Hobbs as well as the nearby city of Clovis revolted with the introduction of ordinances designed to protect unborn babies.



The threat of legal challenges thanks to widespread support for those sanctuary city ordinances, Hagstrom Miller confessed, “has given her pause about operating in eastern New Mexico.”



“In this post-Dobbs era, where anti-abortion folks are emboldened, I want to be sure we’re in a place where our patients can be safe, where our doctors and our staff can be safe,” she said.



The Clovis City Commission postponed its vote on the ordinance allegedly so it can “perfect the language to better protect against litigation.” 



“We hope this sends the message to our state legislature that there are pro-life cities out there and we want to self-determine on this issue,” Clovis Mayor Mike Morris said shortly after a vote to advance the ban.



If Clovis passes the ordinance, it will join Hobbs and a myriad of other towns that all recently decided to push back against Democrats’ abortion extremism. 



“Between Governor Abbott’s resounding defeat of Robert Francis O’Rourke to four more municipalities joining over fifty towns with existing sanctuary city for the unborn ordinances, this is an exciting time for Texans as we work to end abortion,” Texas Right to Life President Dr. John Seago told The Federalist. “Additionally, as the abortion industry looks to target Texas women from just outside our borders, it is equally exciting that Hobbs, New Mexico has joined the fight and passed the ordinance to keep the desperate abortion industry out of their city limits.”



The pro-life movements in Texas and New Mexico have been so effective recently that they’ve even earned the wrath of the Biden White House. 



“We have been very clear about what MAGA extreme Republicans are trying to do when it comes to a woman’s rights to choose,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a recent trip to New Mexico with President Joe Biden. “They’re trying to take that away, clearly, and in the most extreme ways. What it’s doing is it’s putting women — women and girls’ lives at risk.”



This article was updated on 11/16 to reflect that members of the Clovis City Commission are no longer unanimously “expected to vote in favor of the ban.”  



“The Ordinance, as it stands now, is ready. The commission, however, is unready and unwilling,” Mark Lee Dickson, founder of the Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn Initiative, told The Federalist.



Dickson also said that Clovis Mayor Mike Morris is facing backlash after he was “pressured by several Republicans to push things past the election and even past the legislative session.”

"272",272,"Lena Dunham Accidentally Confessed The Truth About Abortion","Payton","Bre",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-12-22"," Lena Dunham just admitted abortion is emotionally and physically “challenging” on Instagram after facing a backlash to her bizarre comments on abortion from last week.
“Now I can say that I still haven’t had an abortion, but I wish I had,” the creator of HBO’s “Girls” said in her most recent episode of her podcast. Unsurprisingly, her remark offended a lot of people who thought Dunham’s comment showed an alarming lack of empathy for women who have experienced reproductive challenges or undergone an abortion.
She has since walked back her comment, claiming that it was a joke and that she was merely playing a persona. A portion of her apology reads (emphasis added):
My words were spoken from a sort of ‘delusional girl’ persona I often inhabit, a girl who careens between wisdom and ignorance (that’s what my TV show is too) and it didn’t translate. That’s my fault. I would never, ever intentionally trivialize the emotional and physical challenges of terminating a pregnancy. My only goal is to increase awareness and decrease stigma.
Dunham isn’t wrong — abortion is physically and emotionally hard on women. And not even the most pro-choice of women can pretend otherwise.
The truth is, women are often coerced into getting an abortion. In a 2005 study, researchers found that 34 percent of the women they surveyed who were recruited from a domestic violence program said they had been pressured into getting an abortion by their partners. A 2010 Guttmacher Institute study affirms that reproductive control, including forced abortions, is a huge problem among women who have suffered domestic abuse at the hands of a partner.
While the exact numbers of how many women are pressured by others into having an abortion is unknown, multiple studies have affirmed that it’s not at all uncommon. Women who have had an abortion are also more likely to have been abused by their partners within a year of getting an abortion. In other words, abusive men often use abortion as a means to control and hurt their female partners.
Abortion can also be psychologically traumatic. A 2011 study from the British Journal of Psychology found that post-abortive women faced an increased risk of mental health issues: “Women who had undergone an abortion experienced an 81% increased risk of mental health problems, and nearly 10% of the incidence of mental health problems was shown to be attributable to abortion,” the study states.
Getting an abortion isn’t a lighthearted activity that women can just shrug off afterwards. It’s a procedure many women don’t chose for themselves. When they do chose it, it’s usually because they’ve recently undergone a disruptive event (like unemployment, separation from a partner, or are facing dire financial circumstances) and feel they have no other option. In other words, abortion often isn’t a “choice,” it’s something a woman does when she feels like her back is against the wall.

"273",273,"How Many Women Are Pressured Into Abortions?","Scandlen","Greg",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-09-18"," One would think any large movement that styles itself “pro-choice” would want to ensure its beneficiaries are in fact free to choose and well-informed about the implications of those choices. One might think that unless, of course, one were dealing with an abortion industry whose goal is not “choice” at all, but delivering as many abortions as possible.  Why else would the industry try so hard to downplay the problem of coerced abortions? Why is it so hard for them to have any sympathy for a young girl who gets pregnant, who is scared and confused and hears from a boyfriend or family member, “You’re PREGNANT?!? Get rid of it NOW!” Maybe it’s a boyfriend who doesn’t relish the thought of 18 years of child support. Maybe it’s a mother who thinks she is too young to be a grandmother. Maybe it’s a father who is ashamed of having a slut for a daughter. The pressure can be intense, involving the threat of violence, abandonment, shunning, and expulsion from the home. It might just be a barrage of yelling and screaming. It is extremely hard for a young woman who is already going through the hormonal changes of pregnancy—morning sickness, fatigue, dizziness, nausea—to stand up to such abuse. Women Are Pressured into Abortions We may never know the extent of the problem. The pro-life side likely exaggerates it and the pro-choice side minimizes it. There are anecdotes aplenty. The article pays no attention to women who are coerced into abortions without first being coerced into getting pregnant. One study from the pro-life side reported, “In a national study of women, 64% of those who aborted felt pressured to do so by others. This pressure can become violent. 65% suffered symptoms of trauma. In the year following an abortion, suicide rates are 6-7 times higher.“ See also this report from “Clinic Quotes.”  But even the pro-choice side is beginning to wake up to the issue. An article in The Daily Beast is headlined, “Coerced Abortions: A New Study Shows They’re Common.” The article is based largely on information from the Guttmacher Institute (a pro-abortion research center) but raises the topic of “reproductive coercion.” This is an interesting twist on the concept. Rather than looking at women who are coerced into having an abortion, it looks at women who are coerced or tricked first into getting pregnant, then also coerced into aborting the baby, identified as “reproductive control.” The article notes that very little research had been done on this until 2007, but since that time there have been several studies of women who are in “violent relationships.” They found that one-third to one-half of these women have experienced some form of “reproductive coercion,” as have some 15 percent of women not in violent relationships. But the article pays no attention to women who are coerced into abortions without first being coerced into getting pregnant. Abortion Coercion Isn’t Just a Subcategory This sleight of hand is also used in a long report by Sofia Resnick, “Health Experts Challenge ‘Coerced-Abortion’ Laws.” This author is concerned that, “This year alone, at least 11 states have considered abortion bills that deal with coercion, according to Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion policy group in Washington, D.C.” Is coerced abortion really just a subcategory of a bigger issue of domestic and sexual violence, or is it an important issue in its own right? She believes such laws are simply a pretext to make access to abortion more difficult: “Many public-health professionals who support abortion rights oppose these types of abortion laws because they say anti-coercion policies that single out abortion sidestep the broader issue of domestic and sexual violence, which many believe is the root of coercion.”  But is coerced abortion really just a subcategory of a bigger issue of domestic and sexual violence, or is it an important issue in its own right? The article goes on to say, “very little research has been done exclusively on coerced abortions,” and cites Elizabeth Miller, who “has been researching domestic and sexual violence for over 30 years,” as saying, “To focus on the minutia of coerced abortion really takes away from the really broad problem of domestic violence.” This falls into the “to a hammer, everything looks like a nail” category. How does Miller know coerced abortion is “minutia” if so little research has been done on it? Miller’s career has been all about domestic violence, so of course, to her anything else is a distraction. In fact, coercion does not have to involve violence at all. There can be emotional coercion, financial coercion, and social pressure. There can be browbeating, ridicule, and ostracism. This sort of bullying has been known to lead emotionally insecure adolescents to suicide, and no one dismisses it as “minutia.” Women Are Never, Ever Bullied A medical facility should be a safe haven, a place where a troubled girl can be protected from such bullying, catch her breath, and refocus on what she wants in this life. Medical professionals should devote themselves to the wishes of their patients, not the wishes of family members, boyfriends, or social peers. Usually in cases of domestic abuse, such “caregivers” are required to report abusers to the police or social agencies. It is not optional. But in the case of abortion, an entire industry will steamroll over anything that gets in the way of their profit centers. Take Amanda Marcotte. She writes: So the amount of conspiracy theorist bullshit around Planned Parenthood is growing dramatically, as Fox News is adding the anti-choice myth that women don’t choose abortion, but are forced into it by an evil feminist/male pervert/gynecologist conspiracy to make women, uh, ‘sexually available.’
This claim that women do not choose abortion, but are coerced into it, was drafted for politically convenient reasons. Anti-choicers realize that by claiming that abortion is ‘murder’, they are arguing that 3 out of 10 women in the United States should be in prison serving a life sentence—or even, by their own measure, be slated for a death sentence.
Now, to be clear, they don’t really believe it’s murder. That’s just a typical right wing hyperbolic story that paints them as the good guys to cover up for their true intentions… it basically, without saying it, still conveys their usually unspoken ideas about women and sex: That women are (or should be, anyway) not interested in sex. Liking sex for its own sake is often euphemistically called ‘acting like men’. Good Gravy! Is there anyone the abortion industry won’t throw under the bus? Suddenly women are never abused, never coerced, never vulnerable, never pressured, (never raped?). Like Soviet-style murals of heroic agricultural workers, women are all strong, brave, and unafraid! They all stride boldly across the stage of sexual politics. Yet at the same time, there is a fearsome “rape culture” on college campuses, women can’t manage to pay for their own birth control, they must be protected against every “microaggression” that rears its ugly head, and run to “safe rooms” where they can watch videos of puppies at play to recover from the assault of a speech by Christina Summers. Meanwhile, in the real world, the one not populated by cardboard cutouts of cartoon characters, there is a real problem of bullying and abuse. Some not-small numbers of the victims are newly pregnant women and girls who are not allowed to be “pro-choice” because someone else has already decided their fate.

"274",274,"Abortion Harms Fathers Too","Mayo","Greg",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-10-21"," Thirty-four years ago, President Ronald Reagan and Congress named October Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month. Their goal was “to increase our understanding of the great tragedy involved in the deaths of unborn and newborn babies” and to raise awareness of how to “meet the needs of bereaved parents.”But I didn’t need the president of the United States to tell me about the grief of losing a child. Six months before the declaration, I lost my first of three children. Like many parents who lose a child, I felt confusion, grief, and sorrow. But unlike those who lose a child through stillbirth or miscarriage, I had no one to help me come to terms with my pain, because my child was aborted.  



Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month has done a great deal to open people’s minds and hearts about miscarriage and stillbirth, but there is still widespread misunderstanding about how abortion harms both women and men. My story of lost fatherhood is common, but it is also commonly misunderstood.



My Experience



I was just 18 when my child died. I opposed the abortion but tried to “support” my then-girlfriend by accompanying her and her mother to the abortion center. I had spent years overcoming a difficult childhood, getting my life on track for success — but the abortion changed that. Confused, hurt, and ashamed for reasons I didn’t yet realize, I tried to hide it all by staying busy — drifting around the country, changing jobs, and avoiding getting close to anyone. 



But this unhealthy lifestyle came back to bite me just a few years later when a different ex-girlfriend told me she was pregnant. We’d only had a brief relationship, so this was the definition of an unexpected pregnancy, one she wanted to end with an abortion. I begged her to keep the child, offering to marry, raise the baby without her, or even place the child up for adoption. But she turned me down, saying our child wasn’t a baby and that it wasn’t my choice.



Like many men, I believed she was right. My opinion didn’t matter; my pain and regret were inappropriate. It took 17 years for me to begin to find healing, to begin to understand so much of my pain and shame came from feeling helpless to protect my unborn children. And it was years later that I began to truly understand that I wasn’t alone, that “pregnancy loss” often profoundly affects men.



A Place to Heal



There’s very little data about how abortion harms men and women, but what we do know is that it hurts a great deal. Data on how abortion hurts men and women are not well publicized. Research in Support After Abortion’s 2021 Annual Report showed that while 44 percent of men said that they did not have a say in the abortion decision, 71 percent of men said they had experienced adverse effects. 



Women face the brunt of social pressure related to abortion — whether it’s being told that abortion is a sin or that abortion should be celebrated. But at least society recognizes that women are involved with abortion, which can sometimes give them avenues of opportunity for care, love, and healing. For men, who often oppose the abortions their partners procure, society presents no such opportunity. We crawl inside ourselves to stuff away the pain, not realizing that anger, depression, and pornography addiction are often symptoms of the pain we won’t acknowledge even to ourselves.



After nearly 50 years of nationally legal abortion, things are beginning to change for men and women. Numerous organizations offer men and women a place to heal, to make better choices so that the ripples of abortion aren’t so widespread. And I’m proud to be associated with Support After Abortion, which connects people seeking healing from abortion to those who provide it, and equips providers with curriculum, resources, and training — all with compassion and without judgment — to reach hurting people and help them find hope and healing after abortion.



But there are millions of men who, like me 30 years ago, remain alone in their pain and grief. Any good clinical therapist will tell you that healing can only begin by being honest with yourself — acknowledging pain, uncovering the source of that trauma and pain, and taking responsibility for actions taken in response to that pain. Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month is the right time for men to come out of their shadows and find their path to real recovery.

"276",276,"8 Things To Do When Considering Abortion","Bea Peters","Ruby",NA,"Yeo, Hilary",NA,NA,"2015-09-29"," Lisa* was a senior in high school, the first in her family who would graduate. She was a strong student and the “good girl” among her many siblings, so expectations were very high for her. Lisa was visibly terrified when she came to our office asking for a pregnancy test. When she learned of the positive result, she felt abortion was her only option. We educated her about the importance of first being sure she was dealing with a live pregnancy, so she and her boyfriend came back in for an ultrasound. He was supportive of her carrying to term and them parenting their child.  But Lisa was afraid of her parents’ reaction. Rightfully so. They were angry when they found out she was pregnant, and kicked her out of the house. A friend offered her a place to live, and she graduated from high school with honors. Her parents didn’t come to graduation. In the first few months of the pregnancy, Lisa probably came to our office once a week. She needed a safe place to talk, a place where she could take her time. She needed to be heard, and she needed to think things through to process this life-changing decision. Many months later, Lisa returned to our office with a beautiful baby boy in her arms. She and the father plan to marry. Her relationship with her parents has been restored, and they adore their grandson. She told us, “I can’t believe he is mine.” This is a girl who was very sure that abortion was her only choice. When a woman wonders if she might be pregnant, regardless of her age or circumstances, she faces change, and has one of three hard choices to make: she can carry her baby to term and be a parent; she can carry to term and make an adoption plan; or she can have an abortion. Emotions can range from extreme happiness to feeling unsettled to crippling fear.  For women who feel abortion is your only choice, here are some important guidelines to help in deciding your next steps. 1) Find a Safe Place to Talk with Someone A safe place is where no one has a financial interest in the decision that you make. It is a place where you are safe to talk freely without judgment, pressure, or coercion. A safe place will give you the time that you deserve to process. Google “pregnancy care center near [your city]” to find a safe and confidential place close to you. 2) Take a Pregnancy Test—Twice Take a pregnancy test, and if you do one at home that yields a positive result, have it confirmed. Some women assume they are pregnant and begin considering an abortion before they know they have a positive pregnancy test. They might “feel” like they are pregnant, and immediately call an abortion clinic.  3) Make Sure You Have a Live Intrauterine Pregnancy A positive pregnancy test alone is not enough information to determine if you should have an abortion. Many pregnancies do not develop, and end in miscarriage. If you do not have a live intrauterine pregnancy, you do not need to consider an abortion. You may not have a live pregnancy, but may have symptoms of pregnancy rather than miscarriage. If you are considering an abortion, an ultrasound is a due-diligence next step following a positive pregnancy test result. An ultrasound will tell you two critical pieces of information: how far along you are, which would determine what kind of abortion procedure you may have; and if you have a live intrauterine pregnancy. Make sure you have a live intrauterine pregnancy before you put yourself through the financial, physical, and emotional experience of abortion. 4) Consider All Three of Your Options Equally Every woman has three options to consider for a pregnancy. She can carry to term and parent her child, she can carry to term and make an adoption plan for her child, or she can have an abortion. All three choices are life-changing, and all of them hard. No matter how unlikely any one of these scenarios may seem, you deserve to have the time to think through each one very thoroughly. You deserve to have the time and opportunity to understand the short-term and long-term effects of each of the three choices. No one should coerce or pressure you into a decision. You make the decision. You deserve to have complete information. 5) Find Out What to Expect from Abortion Like any other medical procedure, there are physical risks and side effects associated with abortion. Many women experience emotional side effects, as well. Some places will tell you those are the result of “hormonal changes.” We know from working with women who have had abortions that these emotional side effects can still be felt even 40 years after a procedure. That isn’t someone’s hormones talking. One of the most common things we have heard from post-abortive women is, “No one told me it was going to be like this.” That isn’t fair. You deserve to know the truth. You’re worth it. You can go here to get good information about abortion procedures, risks, and side effects. 6) Make Sure No One Is Pressuring You It is against the law in all 50 states to force someone to have an abortion. 7) Know Your Legal Rights Many states require a waiting period before you can have an abortion. Many states require that you be provided with certain information and offered an ultrasound with a thorough explanation of the age and development of the fetus, among other legal rights. Many states have laws about what kind of medical professional can perform an abortion. You deserve to know what the laws are in your state. Go here to find the laws for your state. 8) Find Local Resources Pregnancy care centers are all over the United States, and exist to provide a safe place for women to think. Most of them provide free pregnancy testing, free ultrasounds, and education on all three of your options. They are completely confidential. You are valuable, and you deserve time, information, and another person to think things through with who will not judge you, coerce you, or make any money from the decision that is yours alone to make.

"277",277,"Abortion Facilities, Not Crisis Pregnancy Centers, Deal In Misinformation","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-10-30"," On Oct. 23, Attorney General of California Rob Bonta along with 15 other attorneys general, including Letitia James of New York and Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, made public an open letter calling crisis pregnancy centers (CPC) sources of “misinformation and harm.” 



As crime runs rampant in our cities, these 16 elected officials are spending taxpayer-funded resources harassing life-saving crisis pregnancy centers for not being what they never claimed to be: full-service “reproductive health clinics.”



The impetus for the letter was to signal support for Yelp in its ongoing legal spars with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton over the review site’s descriptions of CPCs. Since the Dobbs decision, Yelp added disclaimers to CPC center review pages alerting users that the centers do not provide abortion services, even adding language like, “May not have licensed medical professionals onsite.”



The attorneys, hiding under the statement that Yelp’s efforts “ensure that consumers receive clear information” sadly lack pursuing the same “clear information” for abortion facilities advertising where very real damage has been done to countless numbers of women for more than 50 years. In fact, the AGs even go so far as to deny the personal experiences of these women.



As a post-abortive woman and a person who has worked in ministry with other women who have experienced abortion for the past 30 years, I represent thousands who have sought our help with the damage of abortion, which Bonta’s letter denies.



Claiming in their letter that abortion is “health care” is itself misinformation. Abortion is the destruction of a separate unique human being, an unborn baby, a truth still often hidden from those who go to abortion facilities. The failure to mention in their claim to “protect public health,” the lies, risks, and false information often given out by these facilities is staggering. 



We know there are lies, and purposeful omittance of information because many of us have been victims of it. I was denied knowledge of the development of my unborn son and an explanation of the procedure I went through. The experience left me traumatized for years, yet by the standards implied by the attorneys general my experience did not even happen.



Crisis pregnancy centers do not claim to be health care facilities, so you must wonder why these 16 AGs feel the need to attack them on that premise. Instead, they provide much needed assistance to women who choose to have their babies, something that should be praised and welcomed instead of attempting to shut them down.



The AG’s letter states that CPCs offer maternity and baby supplies “Usually only if pregnant individuals attend religious-based programming.” This is perhaps the biggest untruth in a document that claims to want to eliminate “misinformation.” I am familiar with many CPCs and not one that I know of requires religious-based programming.



It is obvious the AGs are judging CPCs on what they have decided should be their standards and practices instead of what they actually are — places where women can hear the full truth about abortion and how they can get the support they need to bring their babies to term if they so choose.



Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the letter was the blatant denial of the very real repercussions of abortion for countless women:




CPCs provide “misleading information” connecting abortions to, inter alia, infertility, breast cancer, and mental illness, claiming “that abortion directly results in a fictitious condition called either ‘post abortion syndrome’ or ‘post abortion stress'” as well as “grief and regret.”




As someone who assists 100 to 200 people each year suffering from abortion, this denial of what many of us have experienced shows ignorance of proven facts and a total lack of the reality of the negative effects of abortion, not to mention a complete disregard for our experiences and suffering we have endured.



I am tired of having to justify my experience because of those who have an extreme pro-abortion agenda. Some live with “grief and regret” for decades, afraid to come forward because they are told their pain does not exist. Under the guise of exposing “misinformation” the AGs themselves are promoting misinformation. These women deserve to have their experiences legitimized.



The AGs can reject the fact that abortion can cause infertility in some women and mental suffering, and they can call “post-abortion stress” fictitious, but it is very real to the hundreds of people who reach out to us every year in the New York area. The claim that there is no “grief and regret” shows that these public figures who should be representing all people have never taken the time to speak to the thousands of women that are part of campaigns like “Silent No More” and “Operation Outcry.”



Also lacking in their letter claiming to expose “misinformation” is the concern for women undergoing chemical abortions. Many have been told how easy this is and that they can end their pregnancy in the comfort of their homes only to then have to face the trauma of seeing their dead unborn child. This is something they will live with for the rest of their lives. Or the miscalculations of pregnancies due to obtaining the chemicals online (so much for a doctor and their patient) only to find your child much more developed than you were led to believe.



These AGs can claim they are protecting women, but more and more of us are learning the truth not from words like theirs but sadly through our own experiences. Try as they might, they cannot hide what we know to be true.



Lawmakers should be more concerned with the misinformation in the abortion facilities that actually kill the unborn and very often harm women, mentally and physically, than the CPCs that aid pregnant moms in need.

"278",278,"If Google Had Banned Abortion Pill Reversal Info In 2013, My Beautiful Child Could Be Dead Today","Hagan","Rebekah",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-10-01"," On a Saturday morning in 2013, I was alone, sitting on the floor of a dirty grocery store bathroom staring at two pink lines on a First Response pregnancy test and feeling a surge of panic. I was 18 years old, a freshman in college, and living with my parents — and my 10-month-old baby, who I was raising as a single mom. Before I left that stall, I knew I had to end this pregnancy before anyone found out, and before I got any more attached to the new baby growing inside me. In my moment of panic, abortion felt like hope. I had made my choice.  It was so easy to act on that choice. A quick Internet search revealed eight abortion clinics within a 25-mile radius. Before long I was holding an RU-486 abortion pill that would simply “end my pregnancy,” as the Planned Parenthood nurse explained. A swish of water, one big gulp later, and the pill was working its way down. This was the first step in the two-part chemical abortion pill process, which accounts for nearly half of the estimated 800,000 abortions that occur in the United States every year. A woman takes the first pill, mifepristone (or RU-486), which blocks progesterone, a hormone necessary for an unborn baby to survive. Hours later she takes the second drug, misoprostol, which expels the baby. But as I walked to the parking lot of the abortion clinic, the brown paper bag containing the misoprostol that was supposed to “expel my pregnancy” over the toilet the next day began to feel heavier and heavier. I realized I was carrying the weight of my unborn child’s life. My regret was immediate. My grief was real. I said a prayer. Then I pulled out my phone to search the Internet for an answer, like I’d done as soon as I learned I was pregnant. Only this Internet search revealed a very different answer: abortion pill reversal.  We turn to quick Internet searches every day looking for solutions to many problems, large and small. By acting as gatekeepers for the information we need, these search engines, especially Google, play a huge role in the choices we make and how we live our lives. That’s why it’s so dangerous when they choose to hide certain pieces of information from users. On September 14, Google bowed to pro-abortion pressure and made the decision to remove and ban abortion pill reversal advertisements from pro-life Live Action and its partners. That means women like me who change their minds and want to save their babies will have a harder time finding health-care options. In my case, my Internet search came up with a group called Heartbeat International. Right there in my car in the abortion clinic parking lot, I called their hotline, and a calm and compassionate nurse explained what could be done. Since I had taken the first chemical abortion dose but not the second, it was possible, with progesterone treatment, to “out-compete” the abortion pill. “If we can get progesterone back into your body before that pill runs its course,” she said, “we may be able to sustain your hormone levels and save your baby.”  Progesterone is an FDA-approved hormone regularly given to pregnant women, for instance to sustain pregnancy in women who tend to miscarry or who are going through IVF. I was able to get it quickly from a local ob-gyn, and my mission to save my baby was on. By the grace of God, it worked. On October 20, 2013, I delivered a full-term and perfectly healthy baby boy who will soon turn eight years old. Abortion pills can be reversed and healthy children born in about 68 percent of cases, according to a study by a pioneer in the field. Yet Planned Parenthood says “Claims about treatments that reverse the effects of medication abortion are out there … But these claims haven’t been proven in reliable medical studies — nor have they been tested for safety, effectiveness, or the likelihood of side effects. Studies on the abortion pill do show that if you take the first medicine but not the second, the abortion pill is less likely to work.” Proof that the abortion pill reversal regimen works are the more than 2,500 children who have been saved rather than aborted, according to Heartbeat International. That number was increasing and, until this week, Heartbeat International’s reversal hotline regularly received more than 150 calls per month from women desperately wanting to undo their mistake. Many had found the abortion pill reversal website and hotline number through online advertisements from Live Action on Google. With Google’s recent decision to shut down those ads, where will those women turn? Why is Google attempting to erase my experience and the reason for my child’s existence? Here I am. Here we are. If they make the decision to hide information from women seeking to make a choice, is it really a choice at all?

"279",279,"Biden Uses Your Tax Dollars To Deal Abortions To Pro-Life Countries That Don’t Want Them","Koren","Elyssa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-11-21"," Hungary is currently at the forefront of international pro-life momentum. The government has recently taken on the role of leading the Geneva Consensus Declaration, a coalition of 36 countries that pledges a commitment to authentic women’s health beyond abortion. At the second anniversary of the coalition’s launch on Nov. 17, the Hungarian government articulated its pro-life position with resounding clarity. “Every human being should have the right to life … and fetal life shall be subject to protection from the moment of conception,” stated Szabolcs Takács, the Hungarian ambassador to the United States.



At the Geneva Consensus anniversary, staunch pro-life positions were reiterated by the representatives of Brazil, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and others, with the ambassador of Guatemala stating, “Life starts at conception. For us there is no question.”



Last week, at United Nations headquarters, Guatemala launched opposition to a contentious resolution on preventing violence against women, formally challenging abortion references by way of a vote.



International Effort to End Abortion



These government initiatives are reflective of political momentum to fight back against abortion activism and to assert sovereign national positions in defense of unborn life. Ultimately, they are irrefutable proof that any insinuation that a human right to abortion has come by political evolution is a lie removed from the deeply rooted pro-life ethos of these countries.



In the midst of ongoing backlash, both at home and abroad, to the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, the significance of robust international commitment to unborn life cannot be overstated. There exists strong global opposition to the creation of a faux human right to abortion, which is so often invoked to pressure countries to abandon their laws and policies that protect unborn life. As Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., co-chair of the Geneva Consensus commemoration, said in his remarks to the coalition, the reason for the group’s existence is to ensure that “international law and international agreements are not rewritten to invent an international right to abortion that would override the duly enacted laws of your countries protecting pre-born babies.”



The positions of pro-life governments stand in sharp contrast to persistent efforts on the part of the Biden administration to lure developing countries, by incentive or by force, into upending their laws and policies on abortion. In fact, by design, efforts such as the Geneva Consensus serve as a crucial buffer against these persistent attempts. Undergirded by a foundational respect for national sovereignty, the declaration reaffirms that “any measures or changes related to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or local level” — a veritable “no thank you” to unwanted government incursions on others’ turf.



U.S. an Outlier on Abortion



While many have been muzzled by the abortion freneticism of the West, the vast majority of countries either heavily restrict access to abortion or protect unborn life entirely. The majority do not allow abortion on demand, specifying highly restrictive grounds as to when an abortion may be obtained. Under Roe, the U.S. was a true outlier in this regard, and as U.S. states battle to protect life, we must keep in mind that the country is recalibrating in line with majority practice on this issue.



With the overturning of Roe, the United States has taken a crucial step toward realignment with the rest of the world on abortion. But for now, we continue to carry the dissonant stigma of being the greatest international exporter of the abortion agenda. In 2022, the Biden administration increased its annual budget for international “sexual and reproductive health and rights” services (code for abortion) by 9 percent, totaling $597 million in program allocations around the world.



U.S. Is Wrong to Push Abortion Abroad



Given the state of play in the United States, it is both profoundly incongruous and inappropriate for the U.S. to lead the charge on global abortion promotion. Not to mention it is also illegal for the U.S. government to assume this role, considering the plain fact that abortion is against the law in the vast majority of countries where the Biden administration engages in the dirty work of bankrolling the practice.



The hope is that our changing landscape will reinvigorate the willingness of other countries to reject American abortion interference, motivating more governments to embrace bold pro-life expressions such as the Geneva Consensus. As stated by Valerie Huber, organizer of the commemoration, the coalition “was born out of a need to refuse to permit women and girls to needlessly suffer just because special interests have sidelined the most pressing needs in favor of their own ideological agendas.”



It would behoove America to look to the example set by these pro-life governments. Authentic women’s health cannot be achieved at the expense of innocent human life. And the prerequisite of a truly progressive society is the support of both woman and child through motherhood and beyond.

"280",280,"Media Lies About Trump To Cover Up The Brutal Reality Of Late-Term Abortion","Downs","Rebecca",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-05-06"," On April 27, 2019, President Donald Trump held a rally in Wisconsin, where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has vowed to veto a bill that would require medical care be provided to babies accidentally born alive during abortions. Evers claimed the bill would be “redundant and seems to be not a productive use of time.” “The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully, and then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby,” Trump said about babies who are left to die from abortions.  As charged as his words might sound, he was merely putting restating what Virginia’s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam said about a bill that, had it passed, would have repealed late-term abortion regulations in his state. The bill thankfully failed in committee. “The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,” Northam said on a radio program. Predictably, the media pounced on Trump’s statements. Some even claimed that Trump was inciting violence on abortion facilities. From just these past couple of days, several media outlets have called out the president, including: Time’s “Trump Keeps Talking About Second-Trimester Abortions. Here’s What He Gets Wrong,” by Abby Vesoulis
New Statesman’s “Why it’s so dangerous when Trump describes abortion as baby execution,” by Sophie McBain
Slate’s “They Will Execute The Baby,” by Rebecca Onion
The New York Times’ “Trump’s Anti-Abortion Incitement,” by Michelle Goldberg
Mother Jones’ “It’s Time To Stop Repeating Donald Trump’s Lies,” by Kevin Drum
The Daily Beast’s “‘Bizarre, Dangerous, and Insulting’: Baby Nurses Fed Up With Trump’s Bogus Abortion Rants,” by Emily Shugerman
CNN’s “Trump’s statement on abortion, in context,” by Holmes Lybrand
Vice News’ “Trump’s lies about doctors executing babies are outrageous and dangerous,” by Carter Sherman
The Cut’s “Trump’s Lies About Abortion Keep Getting More Disturbing,” by Hannah Gold Many of these articles repeat the same falsehoods. Vesoulis’ article for Time is particularly bad, since 9 percent of abortions are committed during or after the second trimester, when the baby is between 14 and 27 weeks old and can sometimes be born as a preemie. Vesoulis instead focuses on the 1.2 percent of abortions committed during the third trimester, which is the point at which most unborn babies can be saved through a C-section or induced labor. Going by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures, Vesoulis is really talking about 56,797 abortions, which suddenly doesn’t seem so rare.  Vesoulis also claims that late-term abortions “mostly happen because of a serious fetal anomaly or for the health of the woman.” It is an oft-repeated claim and also a misleading one. The Guttmacher Institute and a study conducted from 2008-2010 found that most late-term abortions are performed on healthy women with healthy fetuses. Women who sought these procedures were more likely to be young, minority women with limited financial resources. Reasons given were more logistical than medical. They may have aborted because they didn’t know they were pregnant until later in their pregnancy, had trouble deciding, or had trouble making arrangements. The claim that many late-term abortions are performed on women who face medical problems is also turned on its head when medical professionals, including former abortionists, acknowledge that abortion is never medically necessary. In cases of medical emergencies, a child may be delivered by a C-section. But these mainstream media outlets should not even need to discuss abortion numbers because legislation that has been considered at the state and federal levels, as emphasized by the bill’s sponsor, U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, does not seek to regulate or restrict abortion. It merely requires that babies born alive from abortion attempts receive the same medical care as those born at that gestation for whom parents will take responsibility. Once a child is born, no distinction is made between whether the child is wanted or unwanted.  Another claim from the media is that babies are rarely born alive from an abortion procedure. So? Proper care should still be given even if it is just one baby who is born alive. An Associated Press article writes that “Wisconsin health officials lack data on abortion survivals.” By that admittance, shouldn’t doctors err on the side of protecting babies who are born alive? The article even acknowledges that “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 143 instances nationwide in which live births were caused by an attempted abortion between 2003 and 2014,” which means some of those live births could have resulted in babies being left to die. States aren’t even required to report their abortion numbers to the CDC, so it stands to reason that failed abortion attempts would be even more so covered-up. It’s not merely the CDC that has evidence of babies born alive from abortion attempts. If congressional findings, personal testimonies, and stories shared by abortion survivors aren’t proof that babies are born alive, it’s worth wondering what would be. That the mainstream media sees such a need to supposedly correct the record makes it all the more important for those of us who know better to speak up about the truth. The mainstream media is complicit in failing to protect the truly most innocent, vulnerable, and defenseless among us.

"281",281,"Biden Justice Department Promises To Bring Abortion Pill Case To The Supreme Court ","Duffy-Alfonso","Evita",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-04-13"," The Biden Administration’s Department of Justice issued a statement Thursday, committing to taking Wednesday’s circuit court ruling restricting the abortion pill all the way to the Supreme Court.



Yesterday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit temporarily blocked Trump-appointed Federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s decision to suspend the FDA’s approval of the dangerous abortion pill — mifepristone — but implemented some restrictions on the drug.



The circuit court ruled that the mifepristone will remain available but upheld Kacsmaryk’s suspension of mail-order abortion pills and reimplemented rules that the lethal drug can only be provided in person at a clinic or hospital, not via the mail or through retail pharmacies. 



The court also ruled the drug would remain legal for up to seven weeks of pregnancy while the case is being appealed. Previously, the abortion pill was approved for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Lastly, the ruling requires that all adverse events related to the abortion pill once again be reported, not just fatalities. Before now, the FDA did not require reporting of non-fatal adverse reactions.



“The Justice Department strongly disagrees with the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA to deny in part our request for a stay pending appeal,” said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. “We will be seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to defend the FDA’s scientific judgment and protect Americans’ access to safe and effective reproductive care.”



Last week, Kacsmaryk froze the FDA’s approval of the abortion pill, explaining in a 67-page ruling how the FDA made neither a “scientific judgment” nor a legal one and why this supposed “reproductive care” is not safe for women. 



Kacsmaryk cited the physical and psychological threat the abortion pill poses to women, the minimal regulations on the dangerous drug, the potential special interests behind its approval and increasingly lax restrictions, as well as the drug’s eugenic roots.

Crucially, Kacsmaryk ruled that the FDA was only able to approve the drug because it falsely characterized pregnancy as an “illness” under the FDA’s “Subpart H” regulations. The FDA also failed to prove abortion drugs are “safe and effective under particular conditions of use.” 



Democrats largely ignored the facts behind Kacsmaryk’s fact-based ruling and instead focused on semantics, slamming the judge for using the term “unborn human.” 



Kacsmaryk, however, explained in his footnotes that unborn human is the most scientifically accurate term because abortion drugs apply to multiple gestational stages, and the often misused term “‘fetus’ refers to a specific gestational stage of development, as opposed to the zygote, blastocyst, or embryo stages.”



Alliance for Hippocratic Me… by The Federalist







“Mifepristone is responsible for a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits,” reports The Federalist’s Jordan Davidson. “One longitudinal study revealed that in at least 17 states with taxpayer-funded abortion, many of which have relaxed chemical abortion laws, emergency room visits within 30 days following chemical abortions grew to nearly 34 percent of all ER visits as of 2015.”



What often goes unstudied and unaccounted for in the public discourse surrounding the abortion pill are the emotional side effects. Indeed, the best argument against Garland’s claim that the abortion pill is “safe” comes from the personal testimonies of women who have taken it.



​​A pro-abortion TikToker by the name of Paris Glass recently uploaded a now-viral series of videos discussing the emotional and physical trauma she experienced from chemically aborting her unborn child. Glass describes experiencing excruciating physical pain while alone in her bathroom for hours.



Within 10 minutes of taking the abortion pill, Glass said she was “on the toilet sh-tting [her] guts out and vomiting at the same time.” The nausea medication did not mitigate the pain of having her cervix “forced open.” Glass recounted going through cycles of “intense, unbearable pain” until “a piece of tissue about the size of a lime [came] out of my body.” This pattern repeated for four hours.



Glass also described the agony of “meet[ing]” her aborted baby that she had internally labeled a “clump of cells.” “Even though logically I know it’s a clump of cells — it never felt anything — every emotional defense I had crumbled in one second,” Glass confessed. “Nothing and no one can make me hate myself more than I did in that moment.”

"282",282,"Nearly 50 Years After Roe, 65% Of Americans Want A Candidate Who Supports Significant Abortion Restrictions","Griswold","Kylee",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-01-22"," Forty-seven years ago to date, the Supreme Court handed down the landmark decision in Roe v. Wade in a move of sweeping judicial activism, legalizing abortion in violation of natural law through a fanciful and fatal reading of the 14th Amendment’s due process clause. In a 7-2 vote, the bench decided the clause — “nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” — included a “right to privacy” that gave women license to kill their unborn children in the womb.
Now nearly 50 years later, Americans are engaged in a vigorous tug of war over human life. And although the political left and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates endlessly strive to out-progressive each other on abortion policy, a new poll reveals bipartisan support for abortion restrictions.
The latest annual, nationwide Marist/Knights of Columbus poll shows most Americans, 70 percent, desire significant restrictions on abortion, such as limiting it to the first trimester, permitting it only in cases of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life, or prohibiting abortion altogether. In fact, even 47 percent of people who identify as “pro-choice” want some form of these restrictions.
The poll finds most Americans also want to vote for a candidate who supports significant restrictions on abortion, including more than 60 percent of independents, and even 44 percent of Democrats. This may be partially due to the fact that Americans understand abortion restrictions don’t have to threaten women’s well-being and rights. Eighty percent of survey respondents agree that laws can protect both women and the lives of the unborn, compared to only 14 percent who say laws must choose between protecting one or the other.
2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have repeatedly called for nearly unfettered abortion access, insisting it’s what most Americans want. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s abortion policy proposals include prompting Congress to pass laws establishing an “affirmative and statutory” right to abortion, which would codify Roe v. Wade and prohibit states from enacting restrictions. Warren also supports repealing the Hyde Amendment to expand taxpayer funding of abortion.
“The overwhelming majority of Americans have no desire to return to the world before Roe v. Wade. And so the time to act is now,” Warren said.
When it comes to the courts reconsidering Roe v. Wade, however, the majority of Americans want it reinterpreted, with 46 percent of the Marist poll respondents wanting each state to determine its own restrictions, and 16 percent wanting abortion made illegal.
This public opinion runs directly contrary to the platforms of 2020 Democratic contenders. Former Vice President Joe Biden has flip-flopped throughout his career, most recently on the Hyde Amendment. In June his campaign announced he would support Hyde and less than 48 hours later reversed their position after facing backlash from abortion advocates. According to Politico, Pete Buttigieg supports few if any limits on abortion. In September, Buttigieg tried to justify abortion up until the moment of birth, saying the Bible talks about “how life begins with breath.” Bernie Sanders has even advocated abortion as a means of population control to curb climate change.
As 2020 Democrats continue to move left on issues like abortion, they risk ostracizing the majority of voters who value human life inside and outside the womb.
“Congress should act to ensure that the will of the people remains the law of the land,” Warren said in regard to Roe. The senator might just change her tune if she were honest about what the people’s will actually is.
The Marist/Knights of Columbus annual poll interviewed 1,237 U.S. adults and has a ±3.7 percentage point margin of error.

"284",284,"Five Pro-Abortion Bills California Wants To Pass In Light Of Draft Roe Opinion ","Justice","Tristan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-05-08"," Within an hour of a leaked draft opinion revealing a Supreme Court prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade, California’s left-wing governor pledged to “fight like hell” to save abortion access with the same three words that provoked a snap impeachment of former President Donald Trump.



“Our daughters, sisters, mothers, and grandmothers will not be silenced,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom. “This world is about to hear their fury. California will not sit back. We are going to fight like hell.”



Newsom pledged California would become a sanctuary for out-of-state abortion, surrounded by states with trigger laws restricting access to the deadly procedure upon the repeal of Roe v. Wade. The state had already been gearing up for Roe’s reversal after the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court heard arguments in a case to contest a Mississippi abortion ban beyond 15 weeks last December, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion research non-profit, estimates out-of-state abortions in California could swell from 46,000 annually to more than 1.4 million, primarily from Arizona. 



Here are four bills California lawmakers are determined to pass to make Newsom’s vision of the Golden state as the abortion capital of the country a reality: 



Decriminalized Infanticide 



The left-ward lurch provoked by the elimination of Roe v. Wade as standing precedent has led California lawmakers to propose legislation that not just expands abortion access but decriminalizes infanticide.



Assembly bill 2223, proposed by Oakland-area Rep. Buffy Wicks in February, removes safeguards for unsupervised abortions and bars the criminal investigation of fetal deaths even after birth. The bill, now on its way to the Committee on Appropriations, already passed the Assembly Judiciary Committee and the Assembly Health Committee.



Rep. Wicks and her allies in the left-wing press have sought to dispel claims her legislation opens the door to legal infanticide, arguing instead the bill “protects reproductive freedom by clarifying that the Reproductive Privacy Act prohibits pregnancy criminalization.”



The bill’s text, however, is explicit with a prohibition on “using the coroner’s statements on the certificate of fetal death to establish, bring, or support a criminal prosecution or civil cause of damages against any person,” related to deaths from a “known or suspected self-induced or criminal abortion.” Criminal liabilities are also eliminated for “actions or omissions” associated with pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes. 



Section 7 of the bill outlines the extent of protections for individuals who terminate their own pregnancies stretching to after-birth.



The Legislature finds and declares that every individual possesses a fundamental right of privacy with respect to personal reproductive decisions, which entails the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy, including prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management, and infertility care. …Notwithstanding any other law, a person shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or penalty, or otherwise deprived of their rights under this article, based on their actions or omissions with respect to their pregnancy or actual, potential, or alleged pregnancy outcome, including miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion, or perinatal death due to a pregnancy-related cause.



Legal experts hold varying definitions of “perinatal period” but all include some time after birth. The California Welfare & Institutions Code defines the term as “the period of the establishment of pregnancy to one month following delivery.” The California Department of Public Health regulates “perinatal services” up to 60 days after birth. 



The Sacramento Bee rated claims that Wick’s legislation would legalize infanticide as “false” while conceding in its own description of the ruling the “perinatal period” extends beyond birth by the California Welfare & Institutions Code. 



Abortion as a Californian Constitutional Right



On Wednesday, Newsom announced with assembly leadership that state lawmakers would pursue an amendment to the California Constitution protecting access to abortion.



“We can’t trust SCOTUS to protect the right to abortion, so we’ll do it ourselves,” Newsom wrote on Twitter.




NEW: We are proposing an amendment to enshrine the right to choose in the California constitution.We can’t trust SCOTUS to protect the right to abortion, so we’ll do it ourselves.Women will remain protected here. https://t.co/WTUpfymLS0— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) May 3, 2022
Passage will require supermajorities in both houses of the Democrat-dominated legislature by June 30 to make it in front of voters by November as a statewide ballot measure. 



Adoption would mostly be symbolic, given abortion is unlikely to ever become illegal in the state unless Congress were to pass a federal ban in the absence of Roe as standing precedent. Republicans, however, have largely expressed the issue as one that belongs to the states to regulate, a position reiterated in the draft opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito.



Taxpayer-Funded Cross-Country Abortion Holidays



Democrat State Sen. Nancy Skinner of Berkeley introduced legislation in March to empower out-of-state residents to travel to California for abortions funded by state tax dollars. 



The proposed law, Senate Bill 1142, establishes a government website to navigate access to abortions in California while offering taxpayer dollars to out-of-state residents who seek the procedure. The state travel fund offered to both in- and out-of-state residents covers “airfare, lodging, ground transportation, gas money, meals, dependent childcare, doula support, and translation services, to help a person access and obtain an abortion.”



Skinner’s bill passed both the state Senate Health and Judiciary Committees in April.



From ‘Safe, Legal, And Rare,’ to Common and Unregulated



In March, California State Senate Pro Tempore Toni Atkins, a Democrat from San Diego, proposed a law to lower supervision requirements for abortions in the first trimester. 



Senate bill 1375 allows certified nurse practitioners to execute abortions within the first trimester of pregnancy without a supervising physician. To qualify for carrying out the procedure, nurse practitioners must have practiced medicine for at least three years or 4,600 hours. 



Civil Protections for Abortion



After Texas passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country last fall without interference from the Supreme Court, California lawmakers proposed legislation to counter the rival state’s policy that empowers residents to enforce the measure on behalf of the unborn. 



In Texas, citizens may sue abortion clinics for violating the state’s ban on the fatal procedure after six weeks of pregnancy. Citizens who press charges may earn $10,000 per violation from the culprit clinics or providers if successful.



One month after the Supreme Court refused to strike down the law, California Democrat Rep. Rebecca Bauer-Kahan proposed a bill to offer civil protections for patients and providers, shielding them from out-of-state retaliation in California.

"285",285,"On Abortion, Democrats Are Living In A Fantasy Land","Daniel Davidson","John",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-09-09"," If you think Democrats have become untethered from reality on climate change and the Green New Deal, which most of the 2020 frontrunners now seem to endorse, it’s nothing compared to the unreality they’ve embraced about abortion. During an interview last week, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said that “life begins at breath,” apparently endorsing the extreme view that abortion should be legal up until the moment a baby takes its first breath upon birth.  Setting aside, for now, the abject falseness of Buttigieg’s claim—it’s a long established scientific fact that life begins at fertilization—this is the ascendant view of abortion on the left. Far from “safe, legal, and rare,” Democrats now tout abortion as a positive good , which means it should not only be free from almost any restrictions, but also paid for by U.S. taxpayers. This devotion to abortion makes for some strange policy outcomes, some of which are beginning to crop up in the Democratic primary. These tell us quite a lot about where the American left in general, and the Democratic Party in particular, is headed. Consider the population control policy espoused by Sen. Bernie Sanders last week during the CNN climate change town hall. A woman asked Sanders if he would support a campaign to “empower women” and educate everyone on “the need to curb population growth,” and whether he would make this a key feature of a plan to address “climate catastrophe.” Perhaps sensing on some level the ghoulishness of what she was asking, the woman prefaced her question by saying, “I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians.” Not for Bernie. He understood just what she meant. The answer is yes, he said, “and the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America… have the right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions.” The audience cheered. Sanders went on to explain his opposition to the Mexico City agreement, which bars U.S. tax dollars from funding or promoting abortions abroad, and which the Trump administration reinstated in 2017. He called the agreement “absurd,” and said it’s especially important that women in poor countries have access to abortion.  In other words, Sanders endorses abortion, including U.S. taxpayer funding for abortions in foreign countries, as a means of population control to combat climate change. It’s not merely about access to abortion or birth control, as the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake argued. If you follow Sanders’ logic, the entire point of increasing access to abortion is so more people will have them. The inescapable conclusion is that he thinks women in poor countries should be having more abortions as a way to control the population and avert “climate catastrophe.” Even though this line of argument manages to be racist, elitist, and murderous all at once, it’s nevertheless familiar and long established among environmentalists—just as, a century ago, eugenics was a familiar line of argument among progressives who supported some form of population control. What made Sander’s response newsworthy was that, until now, a major presidential candidate had never explicitly endorsed such a morally repugnant idea in the name of climate alarmism. Consider the logical implications of Sanders’ position. If abortion is an acceptable form of population control, and we’re really facing a climate catastrophe, then why not forced abortions? Why not euthanasia for the elderly, or the terminally ill? Drastic times, and all that. Abortion Requires Not Calling Things What They Are Maybe Sanders was just trying to distinguish himself in a field of candidates desperately trying to outdo each other on climate alarmism. But it’s more likely that Sanders really means it. Like the other leading lights of his party, he has internalized the macabre logic of abortion-as-a-positive-good.  That logic has already led to all kinds of gruesome policies that don’t tend to make it into the news cycle. To take a recent example, last week a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments over a Texas law that would require fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages to be buried or cremated. You might think a law regulating the care and disposal of what are, without question, human remains would be uncontroversial, but here is precisely where the unreality of abortion ideology comes into play. A federal judge who blocked the bill last year reasoned that it would stigmatize and intimidate women who seek abortions. At last week’s hearing, a lawyer for the abortion clinics challenging the law brought up the testimony of a woman who sought treatment at a hospital for a miscarriage and was upset at learning of the hospital’s requirement for interment of the remains. “She felt she was being treated as a child,” the attorney said. Here we have educated, professional adults arguing that we should treat human remains not as what we all know they are, but instead indulge the rank fiction that aborted or miscarried fetuses are nothing more than “medical waste.” These people know better, of course, but to maintain their position they must pretend otherwise in much the same way Buttigieg must pretend that “life begins at breath.” Don’t Believe Your Lying Eyes This devotion to unreality began playing out in a slightly different way last week in San Francisco Superior Court, where preliminary hearings were held for pro-life activist David Daleiden and his colleague Sandra Merritt. The purpose of the hearings is to determine whether they committed a crime when they secretly recorded conversations with abortionists and human tissue procurement firms discussing the harvesting and sale of aborted fetal organs and tissue, which is illegal in the United States. But the abortionists and human tissue procurement firms are not the ones on trial. Daleidan and Merritt face 14 criminal felony accounts of eavesdropping and one count of criminal conspiracy, marking the first time eavesdropping charges have ever been brought in the state of California (in this case, by then-California attorney general Kamala Harris). As Lauren Fink noted in her coverage of the hearings for The Federalist, “The nine-day hearing is the first time Planned Parenthood leaders and affiliates have publicly gathered and testified in court since Daleiden’s Center for Medical Progress published 11 undercover videos featuring Planned Parenthood leaders discussing—and in some videos displaying—the harvesting and selling of aborted fetal organs and tissues.” Yet the hearings were largely ignored by the news media. One likely reason is that they will shed unwelcome light on the brutal realities of the abortion industry, just as Daleiden’s undercover videos did in 2015. They will also likely produce some absurdities and outright lies, and in fact they already have. On day one, the vice president of external affairs for the National Abortion Federation, Melissa Fowler, the prosecution’s primary witness, testified that she doesn’t know what a human tissue procurement company is or does. Yet StemExpress, a human tissue procurement lab exposed in Daleiden’s videos that’s now under federal investigation, is a vendor of her organization. The point of pretending you don’t know what a human tissue procurement company is, especially if you’re an executive for an organization that regularly works with such companies, is to deny the entire premise of Daleiden’s claims—specifically, that your organization is harvesting and selling aborted fetal organs and tissues for profit. Maybe Fowler and the other executives at NAF should take a cue from Sanders and Buttigieg, and just follow where the logic of their position leads. If aborted fetuses are just “medical waste” or “tissue,” why can’t they be harvested and sold? If life doesn’t begin “until breath,” why couldn’t pregnant women sell the body parts of their unborn children to the highest bidder? What’s the big deal? The danger for Democrats in all this is that the American people will plainly see the consequences of this ghastly logic, and recognize that the extreme abortion ideology now embraced by the Democratic Party is based on a monstrous lie.

"287",287,"Trump Is Delusional To Think He Can Broker ‘Peace’ In The Abortion Debate","Daniel Davidson","John",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-09-19"," Former President Donald Trump apparently thinks he can bring “peace” to the abortion debate by negotiating a compromise between the pro-life and pro-abort sides, finding an acceptable gestational timeframe after which abortions would be banned by federal law.



In an interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker on Sunday, Trump said he would “come up with a number of weeks or months” that would “make people happy.” He then made the outrageous claim that “92 percent of the Democrats don’t want to see abortion after a certain period of time.”



What nonsense. Has a single Democrat leader ever articulated the stage of pregnancy after which they would support an abortion ban? No, they haven’t. My colleague David Harsanyi rightly noted Monday that Democrats support zero limits on abortion, even up to the point of birth in some states, and “are also opposed to compelling doctors to provide infants who survive attempted abortions the minimum amount of care they would be expected to provide any other person.”



Earlier in the interview, Trump sounded a slightly different note about Democrats in response to a biased question from Welker that pushed the false narrative that intentionally killing an unborn child in the womb is sometimes medically necessary. In response, Trump said, “The radical people on this are really the Democrats that say, after five months, six months, seven months, eight months, nine months, and even after birth you’re allowed to terminate the baby.”



As if on cue, Welker interjected, “Democrats are not saying that.” But of course they are. They say it all the time, mostly in how they vote on abortion legislation. Monday in these pages, Mollie Hemingway detailed a number of recent votes in which Democrats almost uniformly supported unrestricted abortion, from a Senate bill last year that would have “codified Roe” and gutted state laws that protect the unborn, to a 20-week abortion ban the GOP-led House passed in 2017 — and nearly every Democrat opposed. 



“Given a choice of whether to vote for or against legislation requiring states to permit the killing of unborn children up to the moment of birth,” wrote Hemingway, “nearly all elected Democrats vote enthusiastically for that.”



So much for Trump’s naïve (or perhaps insincere) claim that he can convince Democrats to abandon their position. No one, not even Trump, will ever be able to broker a compromise on abortion for the simple reason that Democrats will never accept a compromise if it means placing hard limits on the killing of the unborn. Abortion has become a sacrament of the left’s neo-pagan religion, and Democrats will defend it to the last. 



But the exchange between Trump and Welker exposed something else besides Trump’s naiveté, which is his utterly transactional approach to the abortion debate. He won over pro-life Republicans in 2016 by promising to nominate originalist justices to the Supreme Court, which meant guaranteeing Roe’s eventual demise. Pro-lifers went along with it and supported Trump because it was their best shot at accomplishing the half-century goal of overturning Roe, something previous Republican leaders had failed to do — and often had not even tried to do. 



For Trump’s part, he seems to think overturning Roe was enough and that aggressive efforts like those of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed a bill this year banning abortions after six weeks, are misguided. Trump called the Florida bill “a terrible thing and a terrible mistake,” and presumably thinks the same about similar abortion bans passed and signed into law in Texas, Georgia, and Tennessee. 




Trump says that it’s a “terrible thing” to sign a heartbeat abortion bill such as the ones passed in FL, IA, OH, GA etc. Where are the alleged pro-life groups/leaders on this?pic.twitter.com/2c4llNtkQO— AG (@AGHamilton29) September 17, 2023
Clearly, Trump has no philosophical or theological convictions about abortion. That was clear as far back as the 2016 GOP primary campaign when Trump, a lifelong pro-abort Democrat, suddenly became a pro-life Republican. So why did the pro-life movement support him? Because when you really believe, as pro-lifers do, that human lives are at stake, you’re willing to engage in nakedly transactional politics to save as many of those lives as possible. In this, the pro-life movement shares striking similarities with the abolitionist movement of the antebellum era, which was willing to accept compromises to limit the spread of what they sincerely believed to be the great moral evil of slavery.



But precisely because the pro-life movement, like the abolitionist movement, is motivated by moral convictions about the rights and dignity of the human person, there are limits to what can be achieved by compromise. Pro-lifers will never be at “peace” about abortion so long as it persists as a legal regime, however restricted it might be, just as abolitionists saw their compromises as part of a long-term strategy to eradicate slavery entirely.



Trump might think a 15-week ban, for example, would placate both sides, but the truth is that most pro-lifers would see it merely as a way station en route to a total or near-total ban, while pro-aborts would see it as an unacceptable stripping away of a woman’s “right” to kill her unborn child. 



The truth is, the abortion debate in America will never end because each side represents a worldview that is fundamentally incompatible with the other. Either the unborn are human beings with the inalienable right to life, or they have no rights at all and can be killed and discarded just as easily as black slaves were in the antebellum South. There isn’t really any middle ground here on which to forge a compromise.



Democrats sense this about the pro-life side, which is why they view with skepticism any Republican legislation proposing limits on abortion, fearing, as southern slaveowners once did, that any limits are the beginning of abortion’s eventual demise.



In a similar way, most pro-lifers understand that nearly every elected Democrat today believes that the vindication of the constitutional rights of one group of people, women, depends entirely on denying all constitutional rights of another group, the unborn. Democrats have long held such views about the Constitution and were willing to wage a war to defend them. 



The pro-life movement of course has nothing on its side like the pro-abort movement has in the Democrat Party. The Republican establishment has always held its nose at the pro-life wing of the party and done the bare minimum to placate it. No wonder, then, that when Trump came along promising to deliver tangible results in exchange for pro-life support, the movement accepted the offer. Pro-lifers figured, correctly, that however much Trump might disappoint, he could not be more of a disappointment than the GOP had been for the last half-century.



The Welker-Trump interview at least makes all of this rather clear: There will be no compromise on abortion. As Abraham Lincoln famously said of slavery in his “House Divided” speech, so too we might say of abortion in our time: We will become all one thing or all the other.



The sooner Trump gets that through his head, the sooner he’ll clear his mind of cant about convincing Democrats to compromise — or casting aspersions on Republicans like DeSantis who make the least compromise possible to advance the cause of life.

"288",288,"Not Even A Comedy Like ‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ Can Make Abortion Seem Normal","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-11-18"," Ever-vigilant to keep controversial issues in the pop-culture limelight, CW has once again featured abortion on an episode of one of their shows, a musical comedy called “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.” Per usual, the show’s writers paint babies as inconvenient: Paula has an abortion because having a baby will complicate going to law school and becoming an attorney. The show works so hard to make abortion seem routine that the scenario not only comes off as unrealistic, but marginalizes women who’ve struggled in the aftermath of abortion. While it’s fine to make a generally taboo subject like abortion part of a plot or subplot, the strange treatment of it in this case seems more like propaganda than art.  The Subplot: Career Versus Children The argument that children are inconvenient to a woman’s work pursuits has long been a part of the Left’s pro-abortion armory. It’s so predictable, it’s almost tiresome. In the 1970s and even ’80s, when workplaces were more rigid, the Internet was barely a blip on a screen, and men greatly outnumbered women in the workforce, it made some logical (although not moral) sense. Now, however, more women than men are earning college degrees, mothers are increasingly in the workforce, and the wonder of the Internet has allowed women (and men) to create work that’s flexible, so they can parent and work more easily. But that hasn’t stopped CW from creating the prosaic scenario wherein Paula, Rebecca’s best friend, considers an abortion because a baby will interfere with her dreams to go to law school and become an attorney. A career in law is a new pursuit for Paula, and she learns of her pregnancy soon after making it. Since she already has children with her husband, Paula immediately decides she now can’t go to law school while pregnant. Of course it wouldn’t be easy, but it’s not impossible. In fact, a good friend of mine did this. Stephanie Tackett earned a nursing degree, then went to law school when her firstborn was only nine months old.  “My law school friends helped babysit him when I had classes during the day. It was good for all of us,” she told me. Not only was it possible, she thinks her baby helped her succeed (although she had to work hard). “Having him kept me focused. It just made me work harder for my goal.” Her firstborn law-school baby is now a wide receiver on his high school football team. Tackett has three thriving, adorable girls—oh, and she’s practicing law, after working as a nurse part-time when her children were young. Now isn’t that more inspirational than aborting your child because he may have interfered with a career aspiration? Options Means Abortion Isn’t the Only Answer In “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” Paula’s husband opposes his wife’s decision to forget law school just because of a baby. When Paula refers to abortions as “those options…for teenagers the month after winter formal,” he encourages her to explore them. Explore she does—by this, I mean she terminates her baby. As The Muse reports, “The next time we see Paula, she’s lying in bed, looking resolved though a little tired. The procedure has already happened and she shows no signs of regret or shame, nor does her husband or children. In fact, when the pizza delivery man rings their doorbell, her typically lazy teenage son casually remarks, ‘Mom, I’ll get it since you just had an abortion.’” Later, when her friend Rebecca comes over, Paula doesn’t even mention the pregnancy or abortion, it was so ho-hum. Even The Muse found this odd: “Instead, she brushes it off as nothing because—despite this being a procedure experienced by a huge percentage of women—she is either too caught up on the idea that married mothers don’t have abortions (they do!) or her role of playing second fiddle to Rebecca and her overwhelming problems.”  This is so far from reality. Studies show women experience a range of emotions following abortion, including grief, sadness, and anger. Scenes like this also undermine the experiences of most women. It’s absolutely normal to grieve loss—and women who desire a baby grieve if they conceive and miscarry. Why wouldn’t a mother grieve if she aborted a child, even if she did so because she thought it was best? Showing a character aborting her baby then ordering pizza with her family like any ‘ol Friday night is disingenuous at best, and marginalizing to other grieving moms at worst. Normalizing Abortion Is a Trend in Entertainment This isn’t the first time television shows have included subplots with women having abortions. CW recently featured abortion in another show, “Jane the Virgin.” The Muse counted this “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” episode, particularly Paula’s lack of guilt and “the importance of normalized depictions of abortions and the women who get them” as a positive thing. Yes, it is a part of life, albeit a tragic one, and as such, perhaps should appear onscreen. Yet why not write scenes that depict the issue honestly? In essence, cut out the Hollywood agenda that aims to depict abortions as everyday occurrences like stubbing a toe. For example, while abortions still occur, and they’re still a controversial issue, they’re actually at their lowest rate since Roe v. Wade. Abortion is nowhere near as common as many people think. Ever since the House Oversight Committee found last year Planned Parenthood had been selling and profiting from aborted baby parts and didn’t need federal funding, abortion facilities nationwide have been closing. Pro-life clinics have popped up in their place. This has likely contributed to the decline in abortions. So despite the fact that abortion isn’t an everyday occurrence, nor is it undramatic or mundane, Hollywood continues to shove it into audiences’ faces, especially young ones, making it appear everything from normal to hip. Pushing this agenda relentlessly and dishonestly feels tiresome, if not aggravating. It’s almost as if “art imitating life” isn’t exciting enough, or they’re flipping the script in hopes life will imitate art. If networks like CW want to show what it’s like to have an abortion, perhaps they should consider nixing their agenda and describe it like it really is: a painful decision that ends a baby’s life and often grieves his mom. Viewers might not only relate to this more, it might actually encourage them to look at abortion for what it is—a traumatic act for mom and baby—and consider viewing baby as a benefit to career, art, and life, like my friend Stephanie and her now-16 year-old son. Why not write more scenes that feature truthful, inspirational stories like hers? Choosing life doesn’t have to sound mundane. In fact, it’s increasingly more common and inspiring.

"289",289,"Puerto Ricans Hope For Clinic Closures After U.S. Stops Funding International Abortions","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-02-23"," Joseph and Daisy Pardo hope U.S. President Donald J. Trump’s reinstitution of the Mexico City Policy that bans U.S. funds from international abortion providers will speed the closure of an International Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in Puerto Rico. In the meantime, they’re celebrating the closure of two privately owned Puerto Rico abortion businesses in early 2017, as well as an upcoming birth for a young woman with a remarkable story. The Pardos direct the first stand-alone pregnancy help center in Puerto Rico after relocating their family of six from Tampa, Fla., in fall 2015. Until recently, their center, Cree Women’s Care, had been situated within just a couple hundred feet of two abortion clinics on a one-way street.  Now, just one remains. In early January, abortion practitioner Santiago Diaz abruptly shuttered his clinic next door to Cree and his second location, which had operated directly in front of the main hospital in San Juan, right next door to its abortion industry competitor, “Clinica Iella,” a local affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). Just three days after his inauguration, on January 23, President Trump reinstated a policy that keeps $100 million out of the hands of IPPF as part of the broader protection of $607.5 million in overseas funding that now cannot go toward international organizations that promote or perform abortions. That action, the Pardos hope, makes Clinica Iella the next clinic to put up a “For Sale” sign in the window. “This is one of the busiest abortion clinics on the Island,” Daisy Pardo said, pointing out that Clinica Iella is known locally for its administration of the RU-486 abortion pill regimen. “[The Mexico City Policy] is going to, we pray, directly affect this clinic, so that we can go down to six abortion clinics in Puerto Rico. That’s what we’re praying, because they do receive the funds from International Planned Parenthood.” Beyond San Juan: A Community in Action Upon learning of the 17,000 abortions that take place in Puerto Rico each year, the Pardos strategically chose to locate their ultrasound-equipped medical center within a mile of three abortion clinics in Bayamon, near the capitol city of San Juan. While the Pardos’ long-term vision is to establish life-saving pregnancy centers next to every abortion clinic in Puerto Rico, they’re already seeing a wide-reaching effect of the pro-life community in action.  In October 2016, while they were visiting supporters in Tampa, Daisy took a call from a young woman in Ponce, an hour and a half drive to the opposite side of the island from San Juan. At first it didn’t seem that the woman, who was four months pregnant, was considering aborting her baby, but as the two kept in contact, it became apparent she felt like abortion was her only option. “This really burdened me, so right then and there, I wrote this long email and talked to her about fetal development, abortion—what kind of an abortion she would get at this point in the pregnancy—and adoption and our services,” Pardo said. “I also gave her direct contacts so she wouldn’t feel it’d be hard thing to get through to someone.” Facing the threat of homelessness and abandonment from her family, the young woman ended up booking an abortion a day later, but thankfully, she let Pardo know of her plan late the night before. The next morning, Pardo called her to see if they could have one last conversation before the abortion. The woman, “Victoria,” answered her phone from inside the abortion clinic waiting room. “I was thinking, ‘Oh Lord Jesus, I’m in Tampa. Why?’” Pardo said. “This was on the other side of the island, so it’s not like I know a lot of people there.”  When Victoria agreed to meet up with someone face-to-face prior to going through with her abortion, Pardo reached out to a Ponce-based OB-GYN and pastor she had only met briefly. Still, he was the best hope for Pardo—and Victoria—going forward. One problem: the doctor was in Orlando when he answered his phone. But, while he couldn’t meet Victoria at the abortion clinic, he knew a woman in his church who would be willing to help. In the meantime, Pardo reached out to a friend she hoped would know someone in Ponce as well. Perfect Strangers Before long, two women who’d never met each other or Pardo, and who hadn’t been trained to work in a pregnancy center, left their workplaces and were en route to meet Victoria at the clinic. “So when she gets out of the abortion clinic, there’s these two girls,” Pardo said. “They met with her at a Wendy’s—yes there’s Wendy’s in Puerto Rico—and they just go, ‘The Lord loves you so much. You are not aborting this baby.’ They prayed with her and asked her what they could do to help her, and she just felt God working. “She sent me a text message saying how powerful the conversation was. She said, ‘I just want to thank you so much for what you and your friends have done.’ I thought it was hilarious because she said, my ‘friends,’ but I don’t even know them. She said, ‘I don’t know what I would do if you were not there.’” In January, Pardo finally had the chance to meet her two “friends”—one a teacher and one a worker at a nursing home—at Victoria’s baby shower in San Juan. Although the past few months were a trying time for Victoria, she’s seen a turnaround in her relationships with key family members, including her mother and grandmother, who both attended the baby shower. “One of Victoria’s fears was that she would get kicked out of her home, and her grandparents did do that,” Pardo said. “But God was so good. He has used this to reunite her with her biological mom and restart a relationship with her. They were all there at the baby shower: the grandma who kicked her out, the mom who received her, and everybody who was there for her at the moment. It was a very sweet time.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/23/puerto-ricans-hope-clinic-closures-u-s-stops-funding-international-abortions/",0.9929,0.0071,"male",2012,2012
"291",291,"Democrats Push Taxpayer-Funded Abortion Until Birth Despite Significant Unpopularity Among Americans","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-28"," Even though polls show the vast majority of Americans support at least some restrictions on abortion, Democrats are pushing taxpayer-funded abortion on demand for any reason up until birth. 



In addition to pushing the misnomered “Women’s Health Protection Act” which tried to codify abortion and nullify red state voters’ right to ban it, Senate Democrats are promoting a new bill that would devote $350 million in taxpayer dollars to abortion. The legislation, if passed, includes provisions that funnel money to companies that profit off of ending life in the womb and fund abortions for women by paying for travel, lodging, and “other barriers.”



Republicans, specifically, are concerned that the legislation will “repeal … the Trump-era policy that blocked foreign assistance to organizations that ‘promote or perform abortions,’” create an abortion czar who promotes dangerous chemical abortions, and embolden healthcare providers to ignore their employees’ conscience rights.



The proposed bill also openly wages a war on the Hyde Amendment, a provision that has protected Americans from funding most abortions for decades and was at one point supported by President Joe Biden. 



Those kinds of measures, however, were never mainstream in the U.S. or even the Democrat party and they certainly aren’t now. Recent polling suggests that 72 percent of American voters support abortion restrictions at least as strict as the Mississippi law featured in the Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court case. Approximately 60 percent of Democrats feel the same. Only 10 percent of those polled supported abortion up to the moment of birth. 



Even polls that corporate media outlets skewed to make it look like Americans support Democrats’ abortion agenda suggest that Americans largely believe abortion on demand up until birth is too radical. In general, more Americans support than oppose 15-week abortion bans. Some polls have found that a majority of U.S. adults oppose abortions after 15 weeks.



Yet, instead of focusing on what voters really want now that Roe v. Wade is overturned, dozens of Democrat legislators are seeking to expand taxpayer-funded abortions by any means possible. This includes Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Mazie Hirono’s efforts to solidify no-questions-asked abortions through the Department of Veteran Affairs where federal law currently prohibits ending life in the womb. 



While Americans struggle to pay their gas, electricity, and food bills during historic inflation and a Democrat-induced recession, blue politicians are busy hosting pro-abortion hearings and passing legislation that is celebrated by the largest abortion company in the United States: Planned Parenthood. 



As Federalist Editor-in-Chief Mollie Hemingway noted shortly after the Dobbs decision, Democrats’ abortion radicalism may not be the winning point they think it will be in the upcoming midterms. 



“At a time Democrats desperately need to seem normal, they are saddled with one of the least defensible policy positions in American life: that ending human life in the womb should be legal for any reason up until the moment the baby is being born,” Hemingway wrote. 



Pro-life groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America also see problems with Democrats’ rapid and radical shift towards abortions on demand for everyone, including women in states that have already banned ending life in the womb. 



“While at least a dozen states have acted swiftly to save lives after Dobbs, radical Democrats will stop at nothing to expand abortion on demand, paid for by taxpayers, up to the moment of birth,” SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. “At the same time they seek massive payouts to the profit-driven abortion industry that spends millions to elect them, Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren want to ‘shut down’ nonprofits that outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities 14 to one and provide real services for women and families. Abortion is not health care, it is not ‘family planning,’ and abortion businesses do not need or deserve taxpayer dollars.”

"292",292,"The Pro-Abortion Movement Makes Its Violent Tendencies Clearer Than Ever","Chalk","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-06-27"," Following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling Friday overturning Roe v. Wade, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) warned that threats of political violence, especially against judges and state officials, will probably intensify in coming days.



“The hell with the Supreme Court — we will defy them,” Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., exhorted protesters. “You see this out here?” added Waters in reference to the size of the D.C. protest. “You ain’t seen nothing yet.”



Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., called the court “illegitimate” and urged supporters “into the streets.” Cities and churches, in response, are preparing for protests and potential violence, especially given recent attacks against pro-life organizations and a politician.



Indeed, dozens of pregnancy help centers and other pro-life groups in states across the country have endured threats and seen their offices vandalized in recent weeks. Churches have experienced much the same. Authorities recently arrested a California resident who traveled to DC and allegedly told a Maryland 911 operator that he wanted to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh (the man pled not guilty to attempted murder).



Threats, vandalism, doxxing, violence — is this what the pro-choice movement is about? It certainly seems that way, especially when activist groups threaten to “take increasingly drastic measures against oppressive infrastructures,” and prominent pro-choice politicians remain silent about the rising number of such incidents against pro-lifers. 



Then again, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised, given abortion has always been defined by an act of violence against the innocent. The pro-choice movement is simply showing its true colors.



Are They Only Getting Started?



After the Supreme Court leak of the Roe repudiation, pro-choice activists aggressively sought to intimidate the highest court in the land. Pro-choice group “Ruth Sent Us” a couple of weeks ago alluded to targeting Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett at her home, church, and the school her children attend. Protestors have regularly appeared outside Justice Samuel Alito’s home in Virginia, while others on social media have threatened to kill him.



A DHS memo in May warned that “domestic violence extremists and criminal actors have adopted narratives surrounding abortion rights to encourage violence, likely increasing the threat to government, religious, and reproductive healthcare personnel and facilities and ideological opponents.” And so they have. 



A group calling itself “Jane’s Revenge” distributed flyers across the U.S. capital and country proposing a “night of rage” if the court overturns Roe v. Wade. Now that it has, and massive protests are planned across the country, one wonders when that shoe will drop. Given the heated rhetoric (and use of Molotov cocktails), it’s possible America is set to witness yet another wave of destruction and violence, as we did in 2020.



The Media’s War Messaging Campaign



But it’s not just pro-choice activist groups who are taking a more extreme, aggressive stance towards their opponents. Corporate media since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health leak have attempted to arouse the ire of the pro-choice base, warning that an end to Roe will usher in a dystopian future that will vitiate women’s freedom to levels not seen since… well, never, if you ask them. The New York Times now has an entire section devoted to keeping its readers’ angst about abortion at a constant fever pitch.



The Washington Post on June 20 published a front-page story on a Texas teen who discovered she was pregnant 48 hours before the recent Texas abortion ban took effect. WaPo reporter Caroline Kitchener tweeted about her story: “Nearly 10 months into the Texas abortion ban, women have started having the babies they never planned to carry to term.” 



Yet as pro-life activist Lila Rose retorted to Kitchener, “She trusted you and you wrote a cruel, condescending piece about her. You objectified her & her beautiful girls for your own pro-abortion ideology.” Indeed, imagine being one of those twin girls years from now, discovering your story was exploited by a national newspaper with the implicit message that perhaps it would have been better if you hadn’t been born. 



Prominent feminist pundit Jill Filipovic doesn’t seem to have a problem with that — she claimed the story is a “a perfect illustration of how girls and women are used, manipulated, and discarded, their futures and dreams snuffed out.”



Who Is The Real Extremist?



A “take no prisoners” approach to reporting on abortion — which is really opinion as journalism — represents only one aspect of the media’s pro-choice campaign. Another is the increasingly radicalized rhetoric in their public opinions. 



Feminist columnist Monica Hesse in a caustic January column censured the pro-life cause’s “brave new world” of “state-sanctioned control over women’s bodies,” and asserted that the pro-life movement, not individual persons, should be held responsible for everyone who gets pregnant. Such language matches well with the shift in pro-choice rhetoric from “safe, legal and rare,” to “shout your abortion” and “abortion without limits.” Abortion providers tattoo clothes hangers on their bodies. Brave new world, indeed.



In truth, the pro-choice movement wants an American regime whose abortion laws are far more extreme than those found in Western Europe. Already, the United States is one of only seven countries that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. 



That puts America in the company of not only Canada, Singapore, and the Netherlands, but communist, totalitarian regimes North Korea, China, and Vietnam. This is something to be proud of? Most of Europe has more restrictive abortion regulations than the United States: only three of 42 European countries that permit elective abortion allow it past 15 weeks.



The Saddest Irony



For all the bluster of the pro-choice cause — absurdly warning that overturning Roe will cause a cascade of secondary and tertiary effects resulting in an imagined tyrannical theocracy — it is they who have promoted a regime of violence. 



Let us not forget that abortion as early as six weeks stops a beating heart and ends the formation of a human brain. More fundamentally, abortion ends a human life when it is most vulnerable. It is an act of terrible, state-sanctioned violence that has caused the deaths of 63 million Americans. 



Moreover, as Ryan Anderson and Alexandra DeSanctis argue in their new book, the real secondary and tertiary effects are the physical and psychological harm abortion causes to women and families, the distortion of our constitutional regime, and the twisting of medical practitioners into executioners.



Perhaps, then, it isn’t surprising that the rhetoric of the pro-choice cause has turned to acerbic and profane, and that their public activities are increasingly destructive and violent. Abortion was, and always will be, an unprovoked act of murderous aggression against the innocent. 



That its promoters have been willing to pursue a scorched-earth policy towards their opponents — regardless of the collateral damage to many young women and children exploited by pro-choice messaging campaigns — simply proves what’s been true since the beginning. In the words of Anderson and DeSanctis’s new book, abortion harms everything and solves nothing.

"293",293,"5 Things Alyssa Milano’s Sex Strike Gets Wrong About Sex And Abortion","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-05-14"," Fresh off the heels of her attempt to boycott working in the state of Georgia due to the six-week abortion ban, Alyssa Milano volunteered a new idea over the weekend:  Our reproductive rights are being erased.
Until women have legal control over our own bodies we just cannot risk pregnancy. 
JOIN ME by not having sex until we get bodily autonomy back.
I’m calling for a #SexStrike. Pass it on. pic.twitter.com/uOgN4FKwpg
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) May 11, 2019  Although Milano tweeted it late Friday evening, the #sexstrike took off with support from multiple blue-check Twitter accounts. While Milano’s ideas are silly to the point of absurdity, she managed to pack into one tweet several prominent falsehoods leftists often push about abortion, sex, and abstinence. Here’s what she gets wrong.  1. Abortion Has Nothing to Do With Reproductive Rights In the last few years, leftists started using the term “reproductive rights” in lieu of the word “abortion.” The only problem is the term isn’t even close to accurate. Abortion has nothing to do with reproductive rights: By the time abortion is even a possibility, a sperm and egg have formed a tiny embryo and the mother has often discovered (or will soon discover) that she is pregnant. In other words, reproduction is already complete. That “right” to reproduce has been exercised. Now there are other issues at stake. Science has revealed that a woman pregnant with this embryo is not carrying an extra part of her body with her DNA, such as a fifth limb or a third kidney. Instead, she is carrying a tiny person, with his or her own separate set of DNA, because life began at fertilization. If it hadn’t, CRISPR and the idea of the “designer baby” wouldn’t even exist. The mother is the carrier of this tiny, separate person until birth; she is not the arbiter of life and death in her womb. Still, the abortion lobby blatantly ignored scientific fact and conflated the two terms to win supporters with deceit, and it has worked beautifully. However, since the facts are wrong, that talking point didn’t work on Georgia’s six-week abortion ban. It essentially acknowledges the personhood of that tiny developing baby, whose rights have been denied since Roe v. Wade passed in 1973. Milano claims the abortion ban has affected women’s reproductive rights, when in fact, it’s only affected the legal rights of the baby being carried in the mother’s uterus. 2. Sex Shouldn’t Be Used as a Bargaining Chip It’s not surprising that a Hollywood liberal would advocate for abortion. Milano, in particular, can’t stand Georgia’s six-week abortion ban. I covered her aggressive attempt to boycott the state if the governor signed the bill in April. However, what made this particular tweet so eyebrow-raising was her attempt to use sex to reverse the ban or, as she puts it, “get bodily autonomy back.”  Sex can be weaponized, glorified, and everything in between. People disagree on what sex should be, but there are a handful of things most people agree sex should not be. One of those things is that sex should never be a bargaining chip to gain power, fame, money, chores, or anything else. Interestingly, in demanding a sex strike, Milano acknowledges the very high price of sex in the marketplace, yet her conclusion following this accurate premise is still false. Psychologist and researcher Roy Baumeister of Florida State University has articulated the theory that sex for men is a relatively high-profit investment with little risk. For women, due to the risk of pregnancy, it is a high-risk venture with comparatively little reward. Thus, women tend to be less interested or risk-averse regarding sex, reducing the supply. Since men typically demand sex more, the price of sex is high. This puts women in a position of power over sex, and most women inherently know this. Noam Shpancer commented on this idea: “Another reason why female sex has become a valued resource is related in all likelihood to human social history, in which, without exception, men have controlled most of society’s resources—money, status, and power positions. In such situations, sex has been one of the few assets that women could leverage for obtaining other valuable social goods such as power, status, and money.”  Milano was correct that sex holds distinct economic, physical, and emotional value—as well as consequences—for men and women alike. Guarding it so it holds its value makes sense. However, Milano’s proposal that women should guard sex so that it essentially becomes a bargaining chip to advance abortion rights is crude and immoral. This is a disingenuous and misguided use of a very valuable “commodity” in society and relationships. 3. Georgia’s Partial Abortion Ban Doesn’t Hurt Women After Milano sent her initial tweet suggesting a sex strike in exchange for a lift on Georgia’s abortion ban, this exchange occurred:  Cool. Be extremely careful. If you get pregnant and miscarry, and they can’t prove you didn’t miscarry on purpose, you can get thrown in jail for a long time in Georgia. #SexStrike
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) May 11, 2019  Again, Milano couldn’t be more wrong about Georgia’s ban. She should educate herself on Georgia’s specific statutes before tweeting nonsense. National Review’s David French broke this down over the weekend: The heartbeat bill did not repeal a number of Georgia criminal statutes that explicitly apply to abortions and unborn children, and it does not overrule controlling legal authority holding that these statutes bar prosecution of a woman for terminating her own pregnancy. Even though Milano attempts to portray conservative politicians in Georgia as lacking compassion and empathy for mothers, this is a baseless smear. The ban doesn’t actually impose any kind of life imprisonment on anyone—the maximum is ten years—particularly not a mother who might try to induce a miscarriage or abortion. The bill outlines that punitive measures would be taken against a third-party helping to abort the baby, not the mother. Even this isn’t cruel, it’s a logical conclusion to the premise that an unborn baby is a person with rights. The focus of the bill was securing the personhood and legal rights of the unborn, not punishing women who are pregnant and unsure of what to do. 4. Abstinence Works, But Not as a Political Ploy The action piece of Milano’s ban, if you will, is a call for abstinence. This is probably one of the most laughable aspects of the ban, yet it’s hard to overstate the irony of pulling this nugget out from the rusty repertoire of the Republican playbook and using it against men (and heck, even women). For years, conservatives, particularly religious ones, have been touting abstinence in sex education. Liberals not only ignored this, but successfully lobbied so that sex education, sans abstinence, has been taught for years in most public schools. After conservatives made significant efforts, abstinence as an alternative to sex education has been included in some schools. Abstinence works if you practice it; it does not work if you have fail to remain abstinent. A 2017 study in Science Direct says, “Although abstinence is theoretically effective, in actual practice, intentions to abstain from sexual activity often fail.” This applies both to kids in school and political sex strikes. How like a liberal to suddenly adopt a traditional moral like abstinence in order to advocate for the murder of an unborn person. It has to be one of the best examples of distorted leftist logic available yet this year. 5. Coopting Traditional Morality to Justify Abortion is Wrong However absurd Milano’s sex strike might look to conservatives, it immediately caught on with the mainstream and social media, not just because of her star power, but because she managed to snag so many hot-button issues into one cause. While the sex strike won’t catch on, and it’s easy to see how flawed each of Milano’s ideas are when they’re broken down, the sum of its parts is a primer on leftist logic. The left abandoned reason, morality, logic and a higher good long ago. However, those are still compelling aspects of society. Most Americans still operate within moral codes and boundaries, even if they don’t admit or recognize it. Thus, when the left really wants to be compelling, they prop up moral notions they previously eschewed as worthless in order to be persuasive. Sometimes it works. This is a good example:  Today and everyday, we honor mothers around the world and the people who guide us, provide for us, love us — mother us. Happy Mother’s Day to you all. pic.twitter.com/ePRrXB2XAJ
— Planned Parenthood Global (@ppglobe) May 12, 2019  Notice the irony: the inherent moral good in honoring mothers yet also the obvious irony of an organization that murders babies advocating for motherhood. A young, anxious mother-to-be might conflate the two in her mind as positive reinforcement, when really one is true and good, and the other is a lie and evil. In the case of Milano’s campaign, promoting “abstinence” or a sex strike to perpetuate abortion rights is manipulative at best and flips morality on its head to achieve evil at worst. To an untrained eye and ear, or to a person struggling to understand how sex, relationships, abortion, and law function together cohesively, this can be a trap. It’s sad Milano doesn’t understand how deeply she’s distorted the truth. ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/14/5-things-alyssa-milanos-sex-strike-gets-wrong-sex-abortion/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"294",294,"Why The Latest Abortion Pill Ruling Is Both Good And Bad For Pro-Lifers","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-04-14"," The abortion pill combination of mifepristone and misoprostol will remain available in the United States, but only under the original safety protocols the Food and Drug Administration adopted in 2000, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held on Thursday. The FDA’s authorization of a generic version of the drugs and its ruling that the drug may be distributed through the mail remain on hold, however — unless the Supreme Court intervenes.



Last Friday, in a 67-page opinion in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, a federal judge “stayed” the FDA’s Sept. 28, 2000, approval of the abortion pill and the agency’s follow-up decisions from 2016, 2019, and 2021 that increasingly loosened safety restrictions. The Biden administration immediately filed a notice of appeal with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and then asked the federal appellate court to freeze the trial court’s ruling that, in effect, banned distribution of the abortion pill. 



Early yesterday, a three-judge panel ruled partially in favor of the Biden administration, staying the stay of the FDA’s 2000 approval of the abortion pill. But the panel otherwise refused to put on hold the trial court’s decision in favor of the plaintiffs. Now without Supreme Court intervention and until the Fifth Circuit considers the merits of the FDA’s appeal, distribution of the abortion pill will be governed by the 2000 FDA approval, not the changes the FDA adopted in 2016.



Arbitrary and Capricious



The differences between the two FDA approvals are significant. In 2000, the FDA approved the drug for a maximum gestational age of 49 days, but in 2016, the federal agency upped that age to 70 days. In 2016, the FDA also reduced the number of required in-person office visits from three to one and allowed non-doctors to prescribe and administer the chemical abortion drugs. Finally, in 2016, the FDA eliminated “the requirement for prescribers to report non-fatal adverse events from chemical abortion.” 



The Fifth Circuit agreed with the analysis of the trial court, Trump-appointee Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who held the FDA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in removing those requirements in 2016 because the agency “eliminated [the] safeguards based on studies that included those very safeguards.” 



“Imagine that an agency compiles studies about how cars perform when they have passive restraint systems, like automatic seatbelts,” the Fifth Circuit analogized, and “then one day the agency changes its mind and eliminates passive safety measures based only on existing data of how cars perform with passive safety measures.” Such a decision is “obviously arbitrary and capricious,” the court concluded.



The Fifth Circuit also refused to stay Kacsmaryk’s ruling freezing the FDA’s approval of a generic version of the abortion drug in 2019 and its decision in 2021 to allow mail-order distribution of the chemical abortion pharmaceuticals. Here, the appellate court stressed that in 2016, the FDA “eliminated the requirement that non-fatal adverse events must be reported to FDA,” before turning around and declaring that “the absence of non-fatal adverse-event reports means mifepristone is ‘safe.’” 



“This ostrich’s-head-in-the-sand approach is deeply troubling,” the Fifth Circuit stressed, suggesting the FDA’s actions are “outside the zone of reasonableness.”



In striking the FDA’s authorization of mail-order abortion pills, the Fifth Circuit also noted the Comstock Act of 1873 prohibits the mailing of “any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted or intended for producing abortion.” While the FDA argued that “the Comstock Act does not mean what it says it means,” the Fifth Circuit found that position weak — especially the Biden administration’s dependence on a memo authored by its Office of Legal Counsel that relied on questionable precedent and “a single footnote within one Supreme Court dissent.” 



But the court held it need not, at this stage, resolve whether the Comstock Act barred the FDA’s approval of mail-order abortions because it had already concluded that a stay of that portion of Kacsmaryk’s opinion was not appropriate. 



While the Fifth Circuit refused to stay those portions of Kacsmaryk’s opinion, the panel entered a stay on his ruling freezing the 2000 approval of the abortion drug. Here, the appellate court reasoned that while a close question, it appeared the six-year statute of limitations may prevent the plaintiffs from challenging the FDA’s initial approval. Significantly, though, the Fifth Circuit noted the plaintiffs may nonetheless be able to establish later that the FDA had reopened its 2000 approval decision, thereby subjecting that decision to challenge too. At this preliminary stage, however, the Fifth Circuit was unwilling to decide that question, which would effectively pull the abortion pill entirely from the U.S. market.



Standing to Sue



This analysis came only after the federal appellate court resolved two other preliminary questions, the first being the plaintiffs’ standing, or their right to sue. The Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiffs adequately established standing on two different theories: injury to doctors and injury to the plaintiffs’ medical associations.



The FDA’s failure to properly regulate the abortion pill injured the medical associations, the court concluded, because the safety deficiencies forced the organizations to expend “time, energy, and resources” to educate the public on the danger of the drugs. The doctors also suffered concrete and real injuries by being forced to “devote significant time and resources to caring for women experiencing mifepristone’s harmful effects,” which created “enormous stress and pressure.” 



The Fifth Circuit opinion provided detailed examples of the types of emergency care needed after women took the abortion pill, including admission to intensive care units for sepsis and intravenous antibiotics. And while the FDA continued to claim its regulation of the abortion pill should be equated to its decision to sell Advil over-the-counter, the court rejected that argument because ibuprofen’s label “obviously bears no resemblance to the ‘Black Box’ warning on mifepristone’s label,” which includes death.



After determining the plaintiffs had standing to sue, the court considered whether those plaintiffs had properly “exhausted” their challenges to the FDA regulation by presenting their arguments to the agency first. It concluded they had — but alternatively held it would be futile to force the plaintiffs to present their claims first to the FDA. 



The court further concluded that Kacsmaryk acted reasonably in waiving the exhaustion requirement given the FDA’s failure to respond to the citizen petitions within 180 days, as required by statute: “Instead of timely responding, FDA responded to plaintiffs’ first petition fourteen years after it was filed,” and responded to the second petition over two years later. These outrageous delays justified waiving the “exhaustion” requirement.



While the Fifth Circuit’s standing and exhaustion analysis may seem tangential, without standing the courts cannot reach the merits. If the claims are not exhausted, or the exhaustion requirement waived, for instance, the case will be tossed. Thus the Fifth Circuit’s analysis of those preliminary points proves as important as its decision on the substance of the stay request. 



What Now?



The Biden administration has already moved to appeal the Fifth Circuit’s denial of its stay request to the Supreme Court. Given that the abortion pill was not pulled from the market and instead remains available just as it was for nearly two decades under the terms of the original 2000 approval, it seems unlikely the high court will intervene at this point, but watch for the three liberal justices to dissent.



The Supreme Court’s refusal to grant a stay, however, will not end this case. The Fifth Circuit must still consider the merits of Kacsmaryk’s decision freezing the various FDA decisions. And the three-judge panel that considers that appeal may view the various questions vastly differently than the two Trump-appointed judges did yesterday.



No matter the outcome, however, the case is educating the public on the dangers of chemical abortions much beyond what the Planned Parenthood pill-pushers have been doing for the last 20-plus years.

"296",296,"Hillary Clinton’s Religion Contradicts Her Abortion Stance","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-08-22"," In a profile of Hillary Clinton’s religious life, America Magazine, a “national weekly Catholic magazine,” says Mrs. Clinton is a “lifelong Methodist who has learned to keep her personal beliefs hidden.” Unfortunately for Methodists and Mrs. Clinton alike, her state religious beliefs also contradict her abortion agenda. Author Michael O’Loughlin details Clinton’s faith, beginning with her upbringing in the Methodist church. The thesis is thin. Surely Mrs. Clinton has a religious faith—she grew up Methodist—but where is it?  “[T]here have been some hints throughout the years at the kind of religiosity that informs Mrs. Clinton,” he writes. “She is said to read snippets of Scripture each day; she has cited figures from the familiar canon of progressive, modern theologians, including Paul Tillich, Reinhold Niebuhr and Henri Nouwen, as inspirations; and during her husband’s affair with a White House intern, Mrs. Clinton is said to have leaned especially hard on her faith.” In 2006, Mrs. Clinton met a political activist and Southern Baptist named Burns Strider, who influenced her opinion on social justice issues. “He then served as a faith outreach director during her 2008 campaign, and today he sends Mrs. Clinton emails several times a week with short passages from Scripture or quotations from figures she has said she enjoys reading, including the Catholic writer Flannery O’Connor, the poet Mary Oliver and the Christian writer Jim Wallis.” This faith, which no man or woman can confirm—only God knows the heart of every person—has supposedly informed Clinton’s beliefs on political issues. It’s not for mere humans to outright judge if her faith is sincere or merely political posturing, but since she is running for commander in chief and condoning articles that investigate her religious beliefs, this might be a useful observation: Mrs. Clinton has been active in politics for three decades. If her faith acted as such a quiet, gentle anchor, why are we just now hearing of it? Half-hearted quips about the “least of these” seems more like an impromptu political calculation, right for particular moments, than the overflow of a genuine guiding religious belief. For Clinton, Politics Seems to Trump Religion According to Pew, mainline Protestantism, which is uniformly liberal, has declined over the years, while evangelicalism has increased. This is at least partially related to the fact that liberal policies now pervade every aspect of life. Mrs. Clinton’s religious talk and liberal walk embody this: she talked about Christianity at a town hall in Iowa in January yet teams with Cecile Richards, CEO of the abortion giant Planned Parenthood, at every opportunity possible.  The largest religious groups in America all oppose abortion with nearly no exceptions, including Catholicism, the largest religion in the country. The article casually mentions this dichotomy. “One of the reasons Mrs. Clinton’s religious sincerity is questioned could be the clash of her social positions with the priorities of the U.S. religious right, which is often perceived as synonymous with U.S. Christianity.” Yet Mrs. Clinton, with her quiet, strong faith, does not perceive things his way? Grant it, Methodists, a branch of Protestants, are more liberal than Catholics, Baptists, or other more conservative “evangelicals”(a term that’s less and less accurate but still conjures an image most can identify), but exactly how liberal? Abortion liberal? Even late-term abortion liberal? Kristin Du Mez, a history professor writing a biography on Clinton’s faith, says “Mrs. Clinton’s religiosity can be best perceived through this prism of socially liberal Christianity,” and “Her views on many social issues are absolutely in line with her church’s views, with the possible exception of war and capital punishment.” And abortion. Clinton, Abortion, and Methodism The United Methodist Church hasn’t been mum on abortion. Their “Social Principles” state, “Our belief in the sanctity of unborn human life makes us reluctant to approve abortion” although they “recognize tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion, and in such cases we support the legal option of abortion under proper medical procedures by certified medical providers.”  Pew reports: “At its quadrennial convention, held in May, [United Methodist] church delegates voted to repeal a 40-year-old resolution supporting the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and approved another resolution ending the church’s membership in a pro-abortion rights advocacy group”—the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. An abortion rights activists who has worked for the United Methodist Church even went to so far as to say Clinton’s beliefs don’t conflict with the church’s stance on abortion. This sounds neat and tidy, but it’s so far from the truth it’s disgusting. Clinton’s stance on abortion wholly conflicts with what most Christians think about abortion, and with her own church’s stance indicating abortion should be a rare exception. Hillary Clinton is pushing to repeal the ban on taxpayer funding for abortions and advocates for late-term abortion—she told Chuck Todd perhaps there could be restrictions “in the very end of….the third trimester,” while admitting to him “unborn people don’t have constitutional rights (emphasis mine).” Methodists claim they are to “to bear a faithful Christian witness to Jesus Christ, the living reality at the center of the Church’s life and witness.” In the book of Matthew, Christ was clear “whatever you do to the least of these, you do to me.” An exhaustive list of “the least of these” would be impossible but it’s probable unborn babies, who have no voice, would make the cut, especially since the Bible talks beautifully about the personhood of unborn babies: “You knit me together in my mother’s womb”; “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you.” Every person lives with hypocrisy, with fissures of cognitive dissonance, because we are flawed human beings in a grueling process of sanctification. But this is so blatant it’s alarming. Claiming that Christianity condones the wholesale slaughter of unborn children because babies are sometimes inconvenient is like saying PETA authorizes you to binge on a ribeye just so long as you’re really hungry. It’s unfortunate that the first woman running for president, with purported faith (quiet or not), advocates for an evil so obvious and so hypocritical that it contradicts the very faith she claims to embrace.

"297",297,"Democrats Seek To Fulfill Promise Of Until-Birth Abortion In Virginia","Bateman","Ashley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-01-06"," In Virginia’s November election, Democrats won the majority of seats in both the state House and Senate. With Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam at the helm, the state is blue for the first time in 26 years. Lead Democratic candidates campaigned on a radical abortion platform, promising to make abortion through the ninth month of pregnancy accessible and remove other restrictions. Abortion-related groups were the second-largest single-interest donor category in the 2019 election, spending more than $3 million.  “Democrats will certainly repeal many protections for women and unborn children, in order to allow Planned Parenthood to expedite the abortion process and increase their profits. Whether or not Democrats will follow the lead of Governor Northam and push for a law to allow abortion practitioners to withhold care for babies who survive an attempted abortion will remain to be seen,” said Del. Dave LaRock (R-District 33). Earlier this year, Northam publicly stated that the decision to end the life of a child who survived an attempted abortion was between a physician and mother, citing “severe deformities” as one reason to end the life of a child after birth. As the next General Assembly is set to open January 8, pro-abortion leaders in the Senate and House are making good on their promise to push a radical pro-abortion agenda in the legislature. Bills already introduced for a vote in the upcoming session include multiple versions of the Equal Rights Amendment (which legally mandates abortion access), removing parental consent for minors’ abortions from law, two bills eliminating the requirement that a mother have an ultrasound before making an abortion decision, and a bill that would amend the Virginia Constitution to make abortion access a permanent legal right. “There’s no reason to remove basic safety regulations and informed consent laws…before making a permanent and irreversible decision,” said Olivia Gans-Turner, the Virginia Society for Human Life president. “The immediate effect is to put women in harm’s way. Laws like the ultrasound law in Virginia or the 24-hour waiting period do not …simply respect women’s intelligence, they respect that a woman may be under coercion or confusion about what [her] legal rights may be and the facts of the unborn child’s development.”  Turner also expects a bill requiring taxpayers to fund abortions in the state. Removing the ultrasound requirement means mothers “won’t have a full knowledge of that life that is inside her,” she said. “As one patient who was considering abortion told us, ‘When I saw the ultrasound I fell in love with my baby.’ We ask ourselves, why is the other side so threatened by a woman falling in love with her baby? What is really going on here?” The Cost of Heroes While Democrats push for more unborn deaths, a strong architecture of pro-life medical professionals and supporters are mobilizing free care for women in crisis pregnancies and expanding a new field of medicine, perinatal hospice programs, across the state. Care Net Pregnancy Resource Centers (Care Net PRCs) has helped stand up approximately 3,000 pregnancy centers across the country. Regional organizations operate independently and are run by individual boards of directors. Care Net PRCs in northern Virginia run on charity, and are funded entirely by individuals and churches in the surrounding communities. Thes organizations provide free medical care, including pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, consultation with medical professionals, plus adoption referrals. They also offer parenting and prenatal classes, as well as counseling for post-abortive women in distress.  “The elections in VA remind us that we need to be realistic about the culture in which we find ourselves,” said Care Net PRCs CEO Becky Sheetz. “Our focus is the woman in the counseling room or the waiting room right now. We provide free pregnancy medical services to one woman at a time, and give her hope and truth about her pregnancy and her options. Our vision is that every woman and every man struggling with an unplanned pregnancy would come through our doors and be transformed…Only God can change hearts, and we are grateful that He uses us.” Mobilizing and Connecting A new effort, Prolife Action Network of Northern Virginia, or PLAN, mobilized this fall to connect needy families with charitable efforts: adoption agencies, medical opportunities, legal advice, housing, and more. Duplication of resources and lack of communication between service organizations has resulted in missed opportunities to help vulnerable women in the past. “We’re creating a network to link all of these various programs so we can really see a family’s health not hurt by lacking resources,” Gans-Turner said. “Sometimes it’s a whole families in crisis, out of work with language barriers and literacy barriers, lots of reasons why people often think the only option they have is to have an abortion.” Mobile ultrasounds are an incredibly powerful tool to legitimize what a woman cannot see without their help, Sheetz said. CareNet is rolling out a tool that gives a woman digital images of her ultrasound to open and share from a mobile device. CareNet also educates women on adoption and refers to adoption agencies if clients are interested. “Women frequently have a very poor understanding of adoption,” Sheetz said. “Overwhelmingly, the understanding of what pregnancy is and how that baby develops are poorly understood by most of the women and men who come to us.” Groundbreaking Hospice Care A new area of medicine in obstetrics, perinatal hospice care, caters to women whose pregnancy receives a poor prognosis. The modern “progressive” approach for an at-risk fetus is abortion; pro-life programs explore more holistic care. “The goal is to provide the best standard of medical care as far into the pregnancy for mother and baby with the possibility of delivering the baby so there is an opportunity for the family to meet,” Gans-Turner said. “Religious tradition can be applied, the baby can be named. Siblings can meet their brother or sister.” Five hospitals currently offer perinatal hospice care programs in Virginia. Tepeyac OB/GYN, a pro-life obstetrics and gynecology practice in Fairfax, Virginia, first broke ground on the model more than a decade ago. “The idea that it’s medically necessary to abort is growing more false as medicine advances,” Gans-Turner said, contrary to how abortion is often posed as the “only option” in a high-risk pregnancy. Legislation has passed in several states requiring physicians to inform pregnant patients who are considered high risk for fetal death of perinatal hospice programs. “There is a palpable positive energy in the pro-life movement,” said Will Waldron, president of Divine Mercy Care, a non-profit umbrella organization advancing pro-life health care in the state. “There is optimism in what we are doing and we are seeing more collaboration with other ministries in the movement. There is more work to do, however, and we could be better at working together, but I have seen a marked improvement in the last couple of years.” Bills introduced for the upcoming session: SJ 5, Sen. Saslaw, ERA, and SJ 1, McClellan, ERA
HJ 1 (ERA), Del. Carroll Foy
SJ 2, Sen. Saslaw, a pro-abortion amendment to the Virginia Constitution
SB 21, Sen. Saslaw, overturns multiple pro-life laws, including parental consent, 24-hour waiting period and ultrasound law

"299",299,"Listen To Black Lives Matter Supporters, Don’t Dismiss Them With Abortion Stats","Marie Bennett","Christina",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-12"," In a September shooting that stunned the nation, a Tulsa police officer shot Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man. That same week, the shooting of armed black man Keith Lamont Scott sparked protests and rioting in Charlotte. These cases followed a series of shocking deaths over the summer, particularly the shooting of Philando Castile as his girlfriend watched from the passenger seat.  Most recently, San Diego police killed an unarmed man—after his sister asked officers to help him because of his mental state. We don’t know all the details of these cases. But we can still discuss how we should respond to them. Specifically: How should pro-life advocates respond to police brutality and growing frustrations in the African-American community? When police brutality comes up in conversation, I’ve heard fellow pro-life advocates shift the dialogue to high abortion rates in the black community. “If black lives matter, why are you aborting your children?” they ask. Their underlying message: it’s hypocritical for the black community to care about those dying from police brutality and not for those in their community who choose abortion. Meanwhile, I’ve read countless comments discussing police brutality, in which abortion statistics are brought up solely to suggest that there’s a bigger issue we should worry about. While it’s true that statistics show more black pre-born children die from abortion than black people die at the hands of the police, these are two separate issues. Both deserve attention without being pitted against each other.  Abortion deaths may be “bigger” in numbers, but this doesn’t negate the fact that any life lost through violence is a tragedy. #BlackLivesMatter Should Be A Pro-Life Message I remember when #BlackLivesMatter first began surfacing after the death of Trayvon Martin. When I saw the hashtag, it spoke a powerful truth to me. The message that black lives are valuable is one I identify with and believe in. I have worked more than a decade to show my people how high abortion rates have devastated our communities. I’ve educated others on the racist history of Planned Parenthood, revealing how founder Margaret Sanger aimed to decrease the black population. Black Lives Matter activists communicated a truth I believed in—but for a different purpose. I felt conflicted, because I couldn’t reconcile our messages around a mutual desire to preserve life. I also grieved over the tragic deaths of Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, and 12 year-old Tamir Rice, among others. At the same time, I grieved over the 16 million black children aborted since Roe v. Wade. It’s why I spent years praying at the Supreme Court for innocent lives. It’s why I serve in a local pregnancy resource center today. I wanted to join these causes together. I longed for my black brothers and sisters to take to the streets in protest for the unborn, as well as for those harmed by police brutality. That desire to fight for life at every stage is good and right. But I fought a growing judgment towards those passionate over lives lost to police brutality, yet seemingly apathetic towards those lost to abortion.  Both Movements Seek to Protect Life As the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement continued, I began to listen more attentively. Listening doesn’t mean I must agree with everything a person says or does. Listening is an act of love—an opportunity to be humble and hear the heart cry of another. As I listened to both friends and strangers, I heard stories of discrimination, decades of pain, and legitimate fears. While listening, a thought came to me. I wanted my people, the black community, to hear my pain over children killed via abortion. But they wanted others to hear their pain over the loss of their sons and daughters via police brutality. That realization led me to understand, in a deeper way, that the black community is collectively in mourning. This new empathy inspired me to commit to speaking with compassion and hope. I decided to look at police brutality and abortion as separate issues, both deserving of attention. I challenged myself to not interject abortion into the discussion of police brutality in ways that might accuse or shame the black community. This does not mean I am unaware of the fact that Black Lives Matter as an organization supports abortion rights. BLM leaders partner with the pro-choice women of color organization Sister Song. This is one of many planks in the BLM platform that I clearly do not support. How To Empathize With A Cause That’s Pro-Choice? This puts me in an interesting place. How can I empathize with a movement that advocates for something I disagree with? I’ve found the best way to do this is to see the movement for what it is: a broad group of people with varying levels of involvement, all trying to raise awareness and fight the specific issue of police brutality. The person who leads a BLM march and the teenager who tweets #BlackLivesMatter are different people with unique ambitions. But they both want to protect black lives. Black Lives Matter as an organization has initiatives and an agenda. By acknowledging black lives are important, I do not support every action members of the Black Lives Matter movement take. Rather, I look at the people in BLM as individuals in a larger movement—and I show solidarity to them in their cause for justice. I do not agree with every tactic or protest on behalf of BLM. But I believe police brutality is real and should be addressed. I am glad BLM is having this dialogue and bringing it to the national stage. Perhaps through open lines of communication, we can all work together to bring positive change. Pro-Lifers Shouldn’t Ignore Police Brutality What does the mean on a practical level? For starters, I’ve come to believe that using certain questions as a knee-jerk response—“If black lives matter, then why are your abortion rates so high?”—is hurtful to the people I want to reach. It deflects from the issue BLM is fighting for. It suggests that if black people don’t care about unborn lives as much as adult lives, then they don’t care at all. But many in the black community do care about the lives of the unborn as much as the lives of adults dying in the streets. Most of my black friends are staunchly pro-life. But they admit to feeling isolated among white pro-lifers when issues of race are discussed. Black leaders who’ve united with the pro-life movement are at times rejected and accused when they speak against racism. They are told to move past it, to “not see color,” to focus on more important issues like abortion (even when they already are) or “black on black” crime. What about those who care about people dying from police brutality, but not from abortion? These are the people we pro-lifers must reach. Just as the BLM movement has rallied people, we as pro-life advocates can use our creativity, passion, and message to do the same. Instead of accusing the black community of not caring, let’s work to help more of them see abortion as a human rights issue worth caring about. How do we bridge the divide? How do we all—regardless of race—stand for the pro-life message and communicate it to the black community with love? Pro-Lifers Must Display Compassion and Care First, we must seek to listen and care. We must refuse to use tools of shame, and instead uplift people with hope. Many black Americans already understand the issues that ravage our communities. They are not looking for a lecture. They are looking for compassionate people who will fight for change. If we want others to listen to our concerns, we must listen to theirs as well. I work with women daily who make decisions to parent, place their child up for adoption, or abort. I’ve never had an abortion-vulnerable woman talk about politics or race while making a pregnancy decision. Instead, these women share their financial issues, fear of abandonment, and need for practical resources. Discussions of movements and politics definitely matter. And I’m not saying we should stop discussing abortion with the black community. These discussions are vital. But how we have these discussions, and when we have them, is important. If we want others to listen to our concerns, we must listen to theirs as well. As the black community sees the pro-life movement act in caring, compassionate ways, they will understand that we care about the fate of their children. Black lives do matter—from the unborn child to the elderly. As pro-life advocates, we of all people should make that message clear.

"300",300,"Newsom’s Pick To Replace Feinstein Is A Professional Pro-Abortion Extremist","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-10-02"," California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s pick to fill the Senate seat left open after Dianne Feinstein’s death last week is a radical pro-abortion activist who supports abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy. Newsom claims to have slated Laphonza Butler to fill the Golden State’s vacant Senate seat because of her two-year track record as the head of EMILY’s List, a radical pro-abortion PAC dedicated specifically to electing anti-life Democrat women. Prior to advancing the left’s radical abortion goals and candidates, Butler was a senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris during her short-lived 2020 presidential campaign and the head of California’s largest union.  “As we mourn the enormous loss of Sen. Feinstein, the very freedoms she fought for — reproductive freedom, equal protection, and safety from gun violence — have never been under greater assault. Laphonza has spent her entire career fighting for women and girls and has been a fierce advocate for working people,” Newsom wrote in his official announcement. I'm proud to announce California's new United States Senator — Laphonza Butler.As we mourn the enormous loss of Sen. Feinstein, the very freedoms she fought for — reproductive freedom, equal protection, and safety from gun violence — have never been under greater assault.… pic.twitter.com/SOnbfVPmXj— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 2, 2023 Several prominent Democrats in the state including Reps. Katie Porter, Adam Schiff, and Barbare Lee started gunning for Feinstein’s seat, which she occupied for more than three decades, months before her death. Newsom, however, chose Butler, whom a recent FEC filing pins as a resident of Maryland, for the position based on her race and her sex. Butler’s proximity to the multimillion-dollar abortion lobby that helped Newsom win office and her distance from the Golden State’s competitive 2024 Senate primary race only contributed to his decision.

Catherine Cortez Masto, failed Senate candidate Cheri Beasley, and failed Senate challenger Val Demings who support no limits on abortion. As the face of EMILY’s List, Butler also celebrated abortion activists’ deceptive ballot initiative in Kansas and called the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision, which struck down the court’s previous decision to block state legislatures from prohibiting abortions, a “brazen assault on women’s reproductive freedom.” She repeatedly claims abortion is “a decision that should be made between a woman and her doctor.” Newsom’s decision to install an open abortion shill in office was immediately celebrated by far-left activist organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign, which hailed Butler as the “first Black lesbian to openly serve in Congress and the first openly LGBTQ+ person to represent California in the Senate.” Pro-life groups including SBA Pro-Life America, however, condemned the pick as yet another attempt by Democrats to push their abortion-through-all-nine-months wishlist on Americans who do not want it.  “The abortion lobby spends millions to elect Democrats who back its agenda of abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy, paid for by taxpayers. Democrats like Newsom, in turn, are beholden to the abortion lobby.

"301",301,"4 Ways To Stop Arguing About Abortion And Start Preventing It","Valle","Cara",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-11-08"," I’m a conservative, and most of my Facebook friends are conservative, too. Thus, my news feed is reliably peppered with memes like this one:  The intention behind memes like this is to use logic for a good cause. “If I expose the holes in pro-abortion arguments,” thought the sweet elderly lady who posted this, “then maybe people will change their minds about abortion, vote for pro-life candidates who will appoint conservative justices, and progressively outlaw abortion in America.” In the very simplest sense, this is a worthy goal. A widespread and reprehensible practice is something we should all work to prevent.  The problem with the sweet old lady’s strategy is that it is galactically ineffective. It will get “likes” and vigorous head-nods from her fellow pro-life conservatives. It may provoke an argument with a pro-abortion Facebook friend, if she has one. But it will almost certainly not change anyone’s mind about abortion, much less deter a woman from seeking abortion. Why? Because the sweet old lady doesn’t know what an abortion-seeker looks like, thinks, or needs. She’s been sucked into the ping-pong game of political arguments and forgotten about the people who matter: the women considering abortion. We are all prone to the sweet old lady’s mistake, especially near election time, which seems to infect even the sweetest people — conservative or liberal — with a nasty strain of seasonal political rabies. So, if you’re tired of arguing until you’re blue in the face and want to make a difference, here are four constructive, non-rabid channels where you can direct your energies. 1. Help Single Mothers The typical abortion seeker is a low-income mother — usually single — from an ethnic or racial minority. These mothers feel they must continue to support their already-born children and therefore cannot quit working to care for an infant, or afford to pay for childcare. (This does not, of course, describe absolutely all abortion seekers, but it covers the bulk of them. Teens and affluent, educated, white, married women account for comparatively few of the women who consider abortion.)  If you want to make a pro-life impact, do something — anything — helpful for women like this. Offer to babysit or bring groceries; rent out your pool house at a discount; help with gas or car repairs, help with the kids’ school supplies; offer to edit the mother’s resume as she seeks a better job; coach her on job-searching, interviewing well, or getting promoted where she is; help her apply for any public aid she legitimately needs — anything to show her she need not choose between her present and future children. What if you don’t know anyone who’s considering abortion? Help the single mothers you know anyway. It will help give hope to women who feel unsupported. If the norm is for single mothers to be left on their own — forced to sacrifice one of their children for the others — then they will be more likely to seek abortion. If the norm is for good people to offer provide legitimate, effective assistance, they will be more likely to have the courage to keep an unborn child and not view it as a threat to their older children’s well-being. 2. Raise Your Own Kids Well, and Don’t Complain Not all abortion-seekers are hard-working, honest single mothers who love their children. Some are just average people who think children are little brats and don’t want to be burdened by them. They see children throwing tantrums, bullying each other, trashing restaurants, sassing their parents, becoming more spoiled and unbearable the older they get. It’s no wonder they don’t want little monsters of their own. Work to correct this perception. If you have kids, teach them to behave well, and don’t spoil them. Require them to respect you as a parent, and that will teach them to respect others. Knowing just a few nice, pleasant children can truly change a person’s perspective on child-bearing in general.  Perceptions of children come not only from the kids themselves, but from the parents’ attitude. Parents who complain constantly and resent their children’s effect on their lives are not only a drag to be around, they scare potential parents away. There’s nothing like a bitter, cranky, Debbie Downer mother to make parenthood seem like a disaster to be avoided at all costs. 3. Move Beyond Outdated Arguments With 3D imaging and other advances in science and embryology, there is no longer much point in arguing about whether an unborn baby “counts” as a human life. Pro-abortion leftists increasingly acknowledge that it does. The increasing approval of euthanasia in our culture should clue us in to the fact that leftists don’t deny that someone is human — they just don’t care. Or they claim to care, but subscribe to a made-up algorithm that deems some humans less entitled to the privileges of, say, not being killed and dismembered, than others. Updating our rhetoric requires listening. Abortion advocates are, for the most part, no longer arguing the inanimate “clump of cells” idea. So what are they arguing? We have to ask, listen, and respond thoughtfully. To me, it seems that most pro-abortion rhetoric is about some rights taking precedence over others — a woman’s right to privacy taking precedence over an infant’s right to live. Pro-life conservatives need to put pressure on this ranking system and ask, “Who takes precedence over whom? Why?” Dissecting and exposing the cruel logic of this system stands a chance of being much more persuasive than continuing to shout slogans (however true they may be) like “It’s a child, not a choice.” 4. Mentor Poor Kids, Especially Boys Most abortions occur in poor communities, where stable families are not the norm. Kids who grow up without mutually supportive parents don’t know how to be mutually supportive as adults. This hurts women more than men, as it leaves them to raise children on fewer resources with less help. To repair this injustice, boys need to be taught responsibility. More specifically, they need to be taught how not to abandon women. But who will teach them? Ideally, it would be their own parents, but we know this is not always going to happen. Somehow, kids in poor communities need contact with stable, responsible adults. Teachers are already spread too thin, especially in struggling schools. Individual conservatives need to make themselves available for this kind of contact. Big Brothers/Sisters, church youth groups, and other formal mentorship programs are good avenues for this, although informal mentorship is usually more effective. But how to set up the richer, more mysterious phenomenon of informal mentorship? It’s essentially a mystery. Charles Murray points out that America’s two social classes interact with one another less and less as time goes on. One solution shows up in Joy Pullmann’s article on charter schools, where tuition-free, quality education can expose less fortunate students to teachers and parents whose example could change their lives and — perhaps more importantly — their future unborn children’s lives.

"302",302,"Florida Appeals Court Rules In Favor Of A 24-Hour Abortion Waiting Period","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-08-06"," Last week, a Florida appeals court reversed a ruling that declared a 24-hour waiting period for abortion unconstitutional. The appeals court found that the lower court’s decision in State of Florida v. Gainesville Woman Care should be reversed and remanded back to the lower court. The ruling comes nearly four years after former Republican governor Rick Scott signed the waiting-period abortion law. This is good news for Florida pro-lifers, and if this decision holds, it’s one way they can bolster the case for advocating a medical standard of care.  The case is not yet resolved, however, and the months ahead are important. A Tampa Bay Times subtitle summed up this case accurately: “The 24-hour waiting period case could eventually become a key test for the Florida Supreme Court, which has historically backed abortion rights but is now dominated by conservative justices.” Fighting for a 24-Hour Waiting Period Florida’s particular abortion waiting-period law has always courted controversy because it pits the medical standard of care against liberals’ sacrosanct issue, abortion. The latest ruling demonstrates this. In the 2-1 opinion, Judge Timothy Osterhaus, who wrote for the majority, said, “Rather than singling out and burdening abortion procedures with arbitrary requirements, the state’s evidence indicates that the 24-hour Law brings abortion procedures in Florida into compliance with medical informed consent standards and tangibly improves health outcomes for women.” Judge Harvey Jay joined Osterhaus in his opinion. Both are Scott appointees. The state of Florida argued that a 24-hour waiting period is necessary for pregnant women to make an informed, measured decision and then provide consent to doctors about such a life-altering procedure. In its evidence, the state included testimony from two medical doctors who also agreed “a 24-hour waiting period is necessary to comply with the accepted medical standard of care for informed consent.” Apparently, the state’s evidence during the first trial wasn’t nearly compelling enough, so it bolstered its evidence during the appeal, which convinced the judges to rule in the state’s favor.  Dissenting Opinions Still, Judge James Wolf dissented and agreed with the lower court’s decision that the 24-hour mandated waiting period was unconstitutional. “Discouraging people from exercising a constitutionally protected right does not constitute a compelling state interest,” he wrote. Wolf was also appointed by a Republican governor, Bob Martinez. In 2018, Leon County Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis, a Democratic governor’s appointee, ruled Florida’s 24-hour waiting period was unconstitutional three years after Scott signed House Bill 633, “Informed Patient Consent,” into law. At the time, the House passed it by a significant margin and the Senate by 26-13. The legislation required that a woman who wanted an abortion would need to seek a consultation at least 24 hours prior to her procedure, provided she had been informed of the nature and risks of having an abortion. Although Chief Circuit Judge Charles Francis issued a temporary injunction just before the law went into effect (it was lifted), the law was not that unusual. At the time, 25 other states had similar 24-hour waiting-period requirements. Still, that didn’t stop the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida and the Center for Reproductive Rights from filing a lawsuit immediately, claiming the law violated women’s right to privacy, which eventually led to the court ruling last week. The waiting-period law has not been enforced since the Florida Supreme Court issued an injunction in 2017, and it will remain that way until it is resolved once and for all.  Abortive Mothers Deserve the Same Care Standards Often, pro-choice advocates decry laws such as the 24-hour waiting period as obvious measures to delay or stop abortions. This is true, but only partially so. As with regulations for facilities that provide abortions and even “heartbeat” bills, measures like this serve at least two purposes: They are litmus tests for liberals to defend a Roe v. Wade that appears to be increasingly as bad a precedent as Justice Antonin Scalia always said it was. Tese laws also bolster the idea that conservatives — indeed, all lawmakers — should be concerned with the standard of care for mother and baby, and the legal rights of mother and baby, regardless of whether abortion is in the picture. “Abortion is a life-altering decision, and no woman should be rushed or pressured into it. Abortion advocates, with the help of the ACLU, sought to strike down this commonsense protection for women, even though the U.S. Supreme Court already upheld a similar law. The appeals court noted evidence from medical experts that the standard of care for significant, non-emergency medical procedures is that they are not and should not be done on a drop-in basis,” Alliance Defending Freedom legal counsel Denise Harle said in a statement. Indeed, standard of care was precisely the issue Osterhaus wrote about in his opinion. Among the remaining unresolved issues is the parties’ dispute about the informed consent medical standard of care. Appellees’ summary judgment motion asserted that the 24-hour Law deviates from the accepted standard of medical care in Florida by requiring the 24-hour delay and an unnecessary visit to a physician. But the State produced conflicting evidence from medical experts that the absence of such a decision-period after receiving information about the nature and risks of an abortion procedure and the procedure itself falls below the accepted medical standard of care. If the State’s experts prove correct, that the 24-hour Law brings Florida in-line with the informed consent standard of care, then the law would pass muster under the Florida Supreme Court’s decision approving informed consent in the abortion context. According to Guttmacher, at least 34 states have 24-hour waiting-period laws for abortion. Whether Florida will be the 35th state remains to be seen. Hopefully, the state’s case will be compelling enough to lift the current injunction so women can make an informed decision about abortion — one many hope results in choosing life instead.

"303",303,"Mother’s Day Is Not The Time To Justify Your Abortion","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-05-06"," Mic.com recently published an article by Jenny Kutner titled “Women Who Have Had Abortions on Why They’re Proud Not to be Moms on Mother’s Day.” Kutner relates the anecdotes of four women who have had abortions. Unfortunately, the title and article are misleading, to say the least. These four women express regret, pain, and confusion about their abortions, demonstrating both the failed feminist philosophy that drives the pro-choice movement and the powerful reasons to be pro-life. In Kutner’s article, Heather, 42, describes her abortion experience this way. “I have never doubted that abortion was the right decision for me at the time and have never regretted it since. It’s hard to be someone who knows you do not want to have children … in a world where that decision is seen as selfish or outrageous […] I don’t think about my abortion on Mother’s Day.”  Another woman in the article, Rebecca, 56, had an abortion because the baby “had a bunch of abnormalities.” She already had a child with heart defects when she learned of her unborn baby’s health problems. She said, “I don’t think about my kids on Mother’s Day; I just think about me. What we’re really fighting for is the autonomy to make these decisions. It’s not about the fetus or potential life, but about our ability to control our destinies.” The dichotomous core of the abortion debate is personhood and choice. The latter is a ruse to cover up the fact that the majority of women who choose abortion do so because they don’t feel prepared to parent or are pursuing a career—selfish reasons borne of a movement that believes motherhood is a less valuable occupation than other careers. Your Feelings Don’t Determine Reality After Kutner posted her own story about having an abortion, another writer blogged about Kutner and the relation between abortion and Mother’s Day. Kutner writes, “[My abortion] wasn’t a difficult decision. At no point did I feel like I became a mother when I got pregnant — not when I saw two lines on the pregnancy test, not when I walked into the clinic for the procedure and not when I walked out […] I’ve never felt an early, unintended, unwanted pregnancy made me a mother.” This ‘is no longer a matter of taste or opinion’: ‘each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception.’ Kutner’s feeling don’t match reality, unfortunately, since science proves human life begins at conception. As I’ve written previously, leading doctors and professors have explained the immutable reality that conception equals life. Thus motherhood is bestowed upon you once this occurs. For example, Ashley Montague, a geneticist and professor at Harvard and Rutgers universities, is unsympathetic to the pro-life cause. Nevertheless, he affirms unequivocally, “The basic fact is simple: life begins not at birth, but conception.”  Dr. Jerome LeJeune, professor of genetics at the University of Descartes in Paris, discovered the chromosome pattern of Down syndrome. LeJeune testified to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee: “after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being.” He said this “is no longer a matter of taste or opinion” and “each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception.” Further, if a woman isn’t carrying a human being before she aborts it and pregnancy doesn’t make her a mother, why are we even discussing abortion in relation to Mother’s Day? It doesn’t matter if a woman feels like she is a mom while carrying her child in utero pre- or post- abortion; she is. This may seem like semantics to the pro-choice crowd, but the abortion debate hinges heavily on this fact: personhood begins at conception. Otherwise, abortion is unnecessary. A Backhanded Reinforcement of Pro-Life Arguments While the article was no doubt published to show how far women have come, it’s also a twisted advertisement for feminist ideology: “You, too, can have an abortion and not think about it on Mother’s Day!” In that sense, it reads more like a way to grapple and justify the psychological and emotional torment of an abortion. You are a mom, and your choice does not change that; but neither do you need to live buried underneath a mound of guilt and shame. Two of the women, Jeni and Shawanna, alluded to feelings of pain, confusion, and fear in the aftermath of their abortions. In fact, the dark underbelly of the piece demonstrates just what philosophy pervades women in our society when murdering babies is not only legal but encouraged, even celebrated. These woman’s realities are far from the title, which suggests these women are “not proud to be moms” due to their abortions.  To the women who grappling with the pain of an abortion: You are a mom, and your choice does not change that; but neither do you need to live buried underneath a mound of guilt and shame. To the women who are trying to justify an abortion—or, worse, applauding, parading, or encouraging abortions—on any day, but especially Mother’s Day: Your moral relativism, flimsy excuses, and logical fallacies demonstrate that feminism’s philosophy of pervasive selfishness has left a parade of murdered babies and devastated mothers in its wake. It’s time to encourage women to fulfill their positive potential in society. If it’s not realized in motherhood, at least reject the narrow, quick, easy path of “I focus on myself first” and take a stand for the marginalized, weak, and voiceless among us. It’s intellectually honest, scientifically plausible, and morally persuasive. ","https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/06/mothers-day-is-not-the-time-to-justify-your-abortion/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"304",304,"Senate Republicans Ready An Abortion Flip-Flop In Obamacare ‘Stability’ Bill","Jacobs","Christopher",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-12-19"," As Yogi Berra would say, “It’s déjà vu all over again.” Once again, Senate Republicans are preparing to flip-flop on taxpayer funding of plans that cover abortion. In June, I discussed how unnamed Senate Republican sources claimed that their “repeal-and-replace” legislation would preserve Obamacare’s “restrictions on abortion funding,” even though Republicans have spent the past seven years arguing that the law provides taxpayer funding of plans that cover abortion. Those same unnamed sources are now trying to claim that the Obamacare “stability” bill does not need additional restrictions on abortion funding. As Politico reports:  [Senate Republicans are] stressing that Obamacare already has prohibitions on using federal funds for abortions that are not because of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life. Anti-abortion groups didn’t trust the Obama Administration to enforce those prohibitions. That prohibition could carry more weight now. ‘We have a pro-life Administration that has agreed to more stringently enforce the life protections,’ a Senate Republican source said. That claim might sound nice now, but it’s not what Republicans have argued since Obamacare passed, nor is it consistent with the facts. To claim otherwise insults the intelligence of the pro-life community, and voters at large. Let’s Go Down Memory Lane In June, I cited several floor speeches during the Obamacare debate where congressional leaders argued that Obamacare includes taxpayer funding of abortions. For instance, here’s Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), as the House prepared to vote on Obamacare: “Democrats over in the House want to approve the Senate bill without actually voting on it. These Democrats want to approve a bill that rewrites one-sixth of the economy, forces taxpayers to pay for abortions, raises taxes in the middle of a recession, and slashes Medicare for seniors, without leaving their fingerprints on it” (emphasis mine).  Astute observers might notice the wording of McConnell’s remarks. The Senate majority leader did not say that “Obamacare might force taxpayers to fund abortion coverage, depending upon how the administration implements the law.” He did not say that “We need to elect a pro-life administration to prevent Obamacare from providing taxpayer funding of abortion coverage.” He flatly stated that Obamacare “forces taxpayers to pay for abortions”—period, end of story. The current vice president, Mike Pence, said the same thing. While serving in the House, he delivered a floor speech that unequivocally equated Obamacare with taxpayer funding of abortion coverage:  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us tonight doesn’t fix anything. It doesn’t fix the fact that this is a government takeover of health care that’s going to mandate that every American buy health insurance whether they want it or need it or not. It doesn’t fix the fact that it includes about $600 billion in job-killing tax increases in the worst economy in 30 years. It doesn’t fix the fact this bill provides public funding for elective abortion for the first time in American history (emphasis added).  Law Trumps Executive Action McConnell, Pence, and many others had good reason for their statements. As Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) noted in December 2009, Obamacare’s abortion funding restrictions are “significantly weaker” than the Hyde Amendment—a provision designed to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion since 1976—making them “completely unacceptable” in Hatch’s view, and in the view of most pro-lifers.  As to Republican staffers’ claims that the Trump administration can “fix” the flawed statutory language through executive orders or more robust enforcement, here’s what pro-life Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) had to say about that in March 2010: This bill expands abortion funding to the greatest extent in history. I have heard that the President is contemplating an executive order to try to limit this. Members should not be fooled. Executive orders cannot override the clear intent of a statute….If an executive order moves the abortion funding in this bill away from where it is now, it will be struck down as unconstitutional because executive orders cannot constitutionally do that. Other House members made the same argument in March 2010, including Dan Lungren (R-CA) and Joe Pitts (R-PA). Their argument applies just as equally to Republican presidents and administrations as it does to Democratic ones. Moreover, conservatives who believe in limited government should not ask President Trump to exceed his executive authority, and a blanket funding on Obamacare’s abortion coverage would do just that. As I wrote in January, “a Republican Administration should not be tempted to ‘use unilateral actions to achieve conservative ends.’ Such behavior represents a contradiction in terms.” Not only can the Trump administration not stop funding of abortion coverage unilaterally, it should not attempt to try, if doing so would exceed its legal authority.  Don’t Insult Voters’ Intelligence Just as the Trump administration should not try to exceed its authority in shutting down federal funding of abortion coverage, Senate Republicans should not attempt to insult voters by pretending that those efforts will succeed legally, or that the “completely unacceptable” abortion “protections” Hatch described in 2009 are now sufficient. As I noted in October, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) failed even to understand the need for pro-life protections when crafting his “stability” bill earlier this fall. Leadership claiming pro-life protections are unnecessary when Alexander never bothered to consider them literally adds insult to injury.

"305",305,"Judges: Ignoring The Constitution On Abortion Since 1973","Hawkins","Kristan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-07-02"," Judges have been disappointing the pro-life movement since 1973, when seven justices reached into a magical hat and pulled out a Cconstitutional right to abortion based on a right to privacy, both of which are not mentioned in the Constitution. Writing between the lines, judges threw out abortion-related laws in all 50 states, putting themselves at the head of a virtual Abortion Legislative Task Force, with the final say on policy, despite the fact the judges are not supposed to write the laws, but enforce them. All of this makes the decision in June Medical v. Russo just one more example of how the deeply flawed legal framework of abortion is made possible by the oversized power of a few judges. Before that, the law showed respect for the pre-born, reaching back into the 1200s, holding abortionists responsible for preying on women. Despite the abortion industry’s talking points, women were not prosecuted but were treated as second victims of predatory businesses.  As Justice Clarence Thomas notes in a stinging dissent in the case, “Roe is grievously wrong for many reasons, but the most fundamental is that its core holding — that the Constitution protects a woman’s right to abort her unborn child — finds no support in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment” where such abortion rights were found to be hiding. Thomas continues: In 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, a majority of the States and numerous Territories had laws on the books that limited (and in many cases nearly prohibited) abortion. It would no doubt shock the public at that time to learn that one of the new constitutional Amendments contained hidden within the interstices of its text a right to abortion. The fact that it took this Court over a century to find that right all but proves that it was more than hidden—it simply was not (and is not) there. Before Roe v. Wade and its companion case Doe v. Bolton, the 50 states developed their own policies in the messy context of democracy, which allows for citizens to conclude what kind of country we want to be. Pro-abortion Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her own critiques of Roe, discusses the loss of that legislative process and about how women were removed from it. “Roe isn’t really about the woman’s choice, is it?” Ginsburg said at a University of Chicago Law School event in 2013. “It’s about the doctor’s freedom to practice…it wasn’t woman-centered, it was physician-centered.” That point is front and center in the Louisiana ruling in which abortionists fought health and safety standards designed to protect their customers. In his dissent, Justice Samuel Alito writes:  This case features a blatant conflict of interest between an abortion provider and its patients. Like any other regulated entity, an abortion provider has a financial interest in avoiding burdensome regulations … Women seeking abortions, on the other hand, have an interest in the preservation of regulations that protect their health. The conflict inherent in such a situation is glaring. The abortionist-centered approach grants those committing abortion unique legal protections for their deadly business. Chief Justice John Roberts, in siding with the four abortion-supporting justices, cast the vote that continued that disappointing practice, citing legal precedent. Thomas found that absurd, writing, “Those decisions created the right to abortion out of whole cloth, without a shred of support from the Constitution’s text. Our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled.” Indeed, infants in the womb receive no real attention in the case. Yet considering how many laws are passed to govern human behavior impacting everything from the environment to commerce, ignoring the pre-born is a glaring legal oversight. Respected Yale Legal Scholar John Hart Ely, who personally supported abortion, penned a critique of Roe v. Wade that still resonates:  It has never been held or even asserted that the state interest needed to justify forcing a person to refrain from an activity, whether or not that activity is constitutionally protected, must implicate either the life or the constitutional rights of another person. Dogs are not ‘persons in the whole sense’ nor have they constitutional rights, but that does not mean the state cannot prohibit killing them. Yet here we are today, in which puppies have legal protections that pre-born babies do not. The legal vulnerability of the pre-born is possible because efforts to restore direct protections have so far failed. Starting in the 1970s, multiple attempts were made to pass a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution to make it clear that human beings in the womb count as human beings under the law, so today the pro-life movement pursues a strategy of seeking legal remedies from judges. That’s clearly a faulty system. For those new to pro-life advocacy who may be disappointed, brokenhearted, shocked, and surprised by judicial overreach, welcome to the pro-life movement. We’ve been dealing with activist, abortion-supporting judges since 1973, but this is not the end. As with any civil rights struggle, there will be setbacks, but the moral necessity of defending human life from conception to natural death means confronting the faulty legal foundation of Roe, one case at a time, one judicial appointment at a time, which is why elections are so crucial. Never forget: It matters who appoints the judges. ","https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/02/judges-ignoring-the-constitution-on-abortion-since-1973/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"306",306,"Why That Princeton Prof’s Argument For Early Abortion Isn’t Entirely Stupid","Lee Anderson","Matthew",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-08-14"," Last week, the conservative Internet stumbled over a video of Princeton philosophy professor Elizabeth Harman describing her understanding of abortion. Mockery ensued. Memes were created. Conservatives instantly won the culture war. Best of all, every armchair philosopher got to pretend for one very happy moment that we were smarter than an Ivy League prof. I mean, even James Franco wasn’t buying it. EVEN JAMES FRANCO.  Only everyone was wrong. Including Jimmy F. Now, I’m going to try to articulate what Harman thinks, which is either the most ludicrous form of mansplaining ever or a form of philososplaining. Let’s go with the latter. Harman is always free to explain herself, but she probably doesn’t read The Federalist and me and all her critics do. So, here we are. Just add the qualifier “As I understand it” to every substantive claim, and we’ll get on fine. Yes, I Get You’re Already Annoyed But first, some throat clearing: I am going to try to defend Harman against the teeming masses of conservatives as someone who deeply disagrees with her view. I think it’s wrong. Really wrong. I mean, I’ve defended a narrow understanding of a “pro-life” view at The Other Place, so it’s not like I’m uncommitted on the question. Yet I don’t think her view is absurd, nor do I think it deserves the heaping barrels of burning scorn conservatives have dumped on it. It even counts as “interesting” in certain respects, and raises real issues that if we thought about for a hot minute might provide new avenues and arguments for a pro-life view.  Having now confessed my unpopular opinion, I have to say Perplexed James Franco is my new favorite Internet meme. See, something good can come out of Princeton! As I’ve said my entire life the past 24 hours, if you can’t persuade The Franco, who on God’s green earth is ever going to listen to you again?

— DJ Jenkins (@DJJenkins) August 9, 2017  Let’s take our bearings, though, from one of Harman’s strongest and most intelligent critics: My Dear Friend Joe Carter. My DFJ modestly described Harman’s argument as “likely…the worst defense of abortion ever made by a reputable philosopher,” and “one of the “most jaw-droppingly incoherent cases for abortion you’ll ever hear.” Hugs, Joe! You and I may need one when we’re through. What Harman’s View Is Not Harman’s “very liberal view” of abortion is that the decision to abort an “early fetus” can be a trivial one, and in most cases is a trivial one. It is far less significant a decision than the decision to give birth to a child, as the latter choice means there’s going to be a little human being terrorizing you indefinitely while the former choice means: nothing. Nothing happens. No person comes into existence, and so it doesn’t matter. Harman arrives at her view in part—the qualification is, in this case, essential—by suggesting that the moral status of the “early fetus” is determined by his or her actual future. So, if an “early fetus” will become a later fetus and then a large boy, it has moral status. If it won’t, either because it miscarries or is (ahem) killed, then it doesn’t have moral status. Neat trick, right?  This she dubs the “Actual Future Principle,” and in her paper on the matter she applies it pretty narrowly to “early fetuses.” As she does in repeatedly in the video as well, so viewers are without excuse. What sort of thing is such a monstrous alien? The “early fetus” is a “fetus before it has any intrinsic properties that themselves confer moral status on the fetus.” Whatever it is that makes human beings the awesomest creatures and deserving of rights, the early fetus ain’t got it. Now, it’s important to be clear on precisely what she isn’t saying: She is not in fact making an argument for abortion. In her published work on the matter, Harman is explicit about what she is and is not doing: “No argument is provided to bring someone from a conservative view about abortion” to the view that the Actual Future Principle is the correct view. Instead, she makes a number of assumptions friendly to a “moderate liberal” view of abortion then tries to argue ‘em into her camp. Her question is not whether abortion is permissible. It’s whether abortion even matters. And not just “abortion” as a general class, either. Early abortion. That’s the setting. Now, her arguments for her purpose might still be no good. They still might be incoherent or circular. But to determine whether that’s the case, we have to first grasp what they are arguments for. And contra my Dear Friend Joe (DFJ), they are not arguments designed for him. (And probably not for Franco, either, but for different reasons.) So Our Decisions Determine Morality? Much of the conservative outrage toward Harman was aimed at her claim that the moral status of the early fetus is contingent upon it having a future, and on the decision of its mother. If a mother decides to abort, the early fetus has no moral status. If the mother decides not to abort, moral status magically appears. Harman doesn’t think that moral status is wholly contingent upon his parents’ decisions. Now, I’m not going to outline all of Harman’s answers to every critique. My philososplaining has its limits. But it’s worth pointing out that Harman doesn’t think that moral status is wholly contingent upon his parents’ decisions. Note that her description of the “early fetus” is that it is an entity that lacks the relevant properties that give something moral status (like sentience, or consciousness, or really great abs). Remember, she’s not arguing for the permissibility of abortion, even of the early fetus. She’s arguing that we don’t need to have an argument about that. And that’s a different matter. Again, that view could be wrong. In fact, I think it is. But it’s still a different claim than the idea that Aunt Suzy’s moral status in the cancer ward is contingent upon Uncle Bob’s decision not to plunge a knife in her heart. And I know that this is Harman’s account because she says so in the video. Seriously. Watch until the end. Please. Grasping this would have saved conservatives a great deal of outrage (and deprived them of a good number of jokes). It also would have been a sliiiiiggghhhtllly more charitable response to Harman than we all gave her. Consider, if I may, DFJ’s approach, which seems unfair. DFJ begins his analysis of Harman’s view by teasing out the purported implications of the “Actual Future Principle” by setting up a thought experiment of two children in a hospital being treated for an illness. One is gonna live and the other won’t. “According to Harman,” he writes, the one that has the future has moral status, but the one that lives won’t. He calls this conclusion “strange,” and an example where death comes naturally “bizarre.” He presents a reductio based on what she denies, then later tells us she denies it. The problem with this is that Harman doesn’t think those implications follow at all, as her paper’s description of what grounds “moral status” indicates and as she explicitly says in the last answer she gives in the video. I am tempted to say that DFJ’s description of Harman’s argument is likely the worst description from a professional’s argument ever made by a reputable online writer. But thanks to #googlememo we have evidence this very week to the contrary. DFJ actually reads Harman correctly, anyway, which is better than she received from many of her other critics. Once you get past the thought experiment Harman explicitly blocks off, DFJ tells us that she…blocks off those implications. And once you get to the end of DFJ’s argument that Harman’s argument is likely the worst argument for abortion in the history of arguments, DFJ informs us “that’s not really Harman’s point.” AND I QUOTE: “Her argument is not meant to justify abortion…” This throws the whole premise of calling it the “likely…the worst defense of abortion ever made by a reputable philosopher” into question a little bit. My DFJ doesn’t provide a reductio based on a premise Harman accepts: He presents a reductio based on what she denies, then later tells us she denies it. It’s pretty easy to understand what happened to conservatives in their response, even smart conservatives like DFJ. It makes for more entertaining copy to lead with the bits that show someone is not only wrong but probably Just Plain Nuts, then when readers are laughing at the absurdity sneak in qualifications that show the whole reductio business doesn’t work. At least DFJ did that much. Many other conservatives did less. But a claim like Harman’s is also shocking if one doesn’t bother to account for where she’s coming from, and while her five-minute video had all the right signals and qualifications, it’s still just a five-minute video. That snapshot confirmed every prior that conservatives have about egghead, Ivy League academics and their general uselessness. It also, no doubt, reinforced to those academics the same kind of impression. And so the world turns. So I understand the laughter and the outrage, on one level. But in a world where everybody’s shouting “fake news” at each other all the time, I’d love to see conservatives do a little introspection about this one. Which is why I’m sitting here writing with Perplexed James Franco staring back at me from my screen. You and me, buddy, against the world. Say Something Good about the Actual Future Principle “Why defend Harman,” I hear myself asking on your behalf. Besides the basic good of the knowledge of truth and my principled, high-falutin’ convictions that we oughta be decent human beings and mock after we’ve made sure we understood, I find her Actual Future Principle actually interesting. Here are a few reasons I don’t think it deserves scorn, and even merits at least some careful consideration before we all rush to enshrine ourselves as Ivy League Quality PhiloStars. In the first place, it has a lot in common with a pretty famous argument against abortion, namely, Don Marquis’s argument that killing is inherently wrong because it deprives a person of the “experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments that would otherwise have constituted one’s future.” I didn’t have moral status until someone made plans to bring me from the abyss of nonexistence into this happy, tumultuous earth. Pro-lifers often meet that argument with cheers. But it’s interesting to see what happens if we change the “would” to a “will,” the alteration Harman makes (and explicitly defends in her paper). Marquis’s claim could be described as a “modal future argument.” Specifically, it indicates there is some possible world out there where the embryo grows up and beats Deep Blue at chess. Harman’s claim is that such a possible world is morally irrelevant. It matters, in a sense, while we are deciding—but once we’ve decided, the moral landscape changes. Hence, the actual future principle: the embryo that will have a future has moral status. Again, that’s wrong. But I think it’s harder to explain what role the modal shift (the “would have”) plays in moral reasoning than conservatives realize. I think moral status is in fact a feature of the ontology of the organism—“life begins at conception, and everyone has a right to life”—is right. In her own way, so does Harman. The early embryo doesn’t have the same intrinsic moral status as the Internet Comment Hero because it lacks the relevant properties. But none of that means the modals are irrelevant for moral analysis. In fact, if Marquis is right, they’re properly helpful. Second, it seems to me everybody’s moral status is contingent in a very similar way to what Harman describes. I have moral status, though you may reject that if you’ve hate-read me this far. And my moral status is contingent upon the decision of my parents. My mother, thank the good Lord, did not abort me. My parents might have even decided to create someone like me (and regretted it not long thereafter, no doubt). I didn’t have an actual future before they decided, though while they were deciding I might have had a counterfactual future (the metaphysics of “possible people” are, er, hard). But I didn’t have moral status until someone made plans to bring me from the abyss of nonexistence into this happy, tumultuous earth. Where Harman and I part ways is her presupposition that the early embryo doesn’t have the relevant properties to make it a member of the moral community. But I point out the principle that governs creation to try to show Harman’s view is neither absurd nor necessarily even circular, if we grant her that premise (which she asks for). If one grants Harman her premise about what the early embryo is, then the decision to abort or not is a lot closer to the decision my parents made regarding whether to create me. Yes, there are important differences in terms of the actions and intentions of the agents. One kills, most obviously, and the other does not. But if you reject the idea that the early embryo is a person, then the decision to let it gestate is a bit like passively creating a person. Of course, we shouldn’t grant Harman that premise! Obviously. Abortion Bad, Pro-Lifers (Almost) Always Right. But conservatives also shouldn’t deny her the premise that her argument starts from, then mock her for making an incoherent argument. It might be unsound, but, well, maybe I should have started by unpacking the distinctions everyone forgot from Philosophy 101.

"307",307,"Pro-Abortion City Councils Sued For Attempting To Silence Pro-Life Sidewalk Counselors","Bateman","Ashley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-06-13"," A federal lawsuit filed in May by Coalition Life seeks to break down unconstitutional, restrictive speech zones across the country. The suit positions pro-life advocates against the city of Carbondale, Illinois, where council members made an aggressive move to shut down pro-life sidewalk advocacy, voting unanimously to establish a buffer zone surrounding “health care” clinics in the area, including abortion facilities. Coalition Life seeks to reinstate free speech rights, as protected under the Constitution, and set a national precedent for pro-life sidewalk advocates. 



Rolling Out the Red Carpet



Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year, the city of Carbondale in southern Illinois has been rolling out the red carpet for abortion facilities. The town of around 22,000 residents welcomed its first abortion facility on Oct. 11, 2022, then a second not long after, and a third. A mega Planned Parenthood is currently under construction.



One city council member suggested in an email that abortion would be good for the hotel and restaurant business, generating more tax dollars for the city, said Brian Westbrook, Coalition Life’s executive director.



Carbondale has been lauded by leftists as the “abortion haven” of the southeast, but a steady resistance is disrupting industry profit.



Abortion-minded women driving from several hours away are responding to sidewalk counselors and turning around, said Westbrook. For these places of “death, deception, and confusion,” life advocates offer a powerful alternative. That’s bad for business.



“They’re not doing the business they thought they would do,” said Shawn Carney, co-founder and CEO of 40 Days for Life. “These abortion facilities go to state lines and … They never hit their numbers historically.”



According to Coalition Life, 82 percent of abortion clients are from out of state.



“Women come from miles away because they feel like they have absolutely no other options, yet we and [more than] 90 pregnancy centers and millions of citizens stand with them,” Westbrook said. “We provide all of our services completely free, from pregnancy testing, ultrasounds, STI testing, housing, counseling, car payments, diapers, maternity clothes, and adoption services. The abortion industry is unwilling to provide any of this to women and goes to great lengths to hide these resources from them.”



The Carbondale City Council attempts to enforce regulations, effectively creating a “bubble zone” outside abortion facilities. Sidewalk counselors offering information on free services and support to pregnant women have been told where they can and cannot stand, what they can and cannot wear, that smiling and waving are prohibited, and most egregiously that a volunteer couldn’t pass out copies of the Holy Bible.



“The ordinance is predicated on the fact that we have to protect the safety of those going in to obtain an abortion and there was no evidence there was any vice or safety issues,” said local attorney Darrel Dunham. “There wasn’t any basis for the accusations. At the council meeting [members] were making statements about how uncontrolled the abortion protesters were and none had any factual basis.”



Citizens who opposed the council’s regulations attended council meetings to express their concerns only to be lectured and ignored.



“The city council gave little justification for this anti-free speech bubble zone, but instead resorted to calling [pro-lifers] names,” Westbrook said. “When asked a simple question about how this bubble zone would be enforced the city attorney claimed that was attorney-client privilege and would be handled on a case-by-case basis.”



Overturning Buffer Zones



In Hill v. Colorado, the U.S. Supreme Court said the statute achieved the appropriate balance between pro-life advocates and abortion patients in their right to exercise free speech. The court ruled that protesters could not engage in any acts of physical violence and must stay outside of a 50-foot buffer zone.



In a post-Dobbs world, any constitutional right to an abortion has been overturned and should be dominated by the right to free speech.



“The Colorado case was trying to balance two rights — free speech and abortion,” Dunham said. “That analysis is out the window [post-Dobbs]. Most importantly, in the Colorado case, the U.S. Supreme Court took care to note that when they looked at the legislative history that would have caused them to believe that the statute was aimed or primarily concerned with pro-life protestors.”



In the Carbondale case, city council members made it clear that the goal of the zone rule is to suppress pro-lifers.



In Westchester, New York, pro-life sidewalk campaigns are currently illegal. The city successfully removed the pro-life presence outside of abortion facilities with a similar city ruling.



40 Days for Life v. Westchester seeks freedom of speech protections similar to Coalition Life’s case. If passed in favor, both cases would set a strong precedent in eliminating the perceived “right” of abortion mills to control free speech on the sidewalks and areas surrounding their facilities. 



“The city did get one thing right, we are entitled,” Westbrook said. “As U.S. citizens we are entitled to our First Amendment right to free speech identified in our founding documents. We are entitled to have our voices heard and the women and their pre-born children are entitled to know their options.”



The Carbondale City Council would not provide comment on pending litigation.

"308",308,"Congress Can Release The Blocked Abortion Videos","Krumholz","Willis","L.","Delahunty, Robert",NA,NA,"2015-08-13"," If you can’t refute them, shut them up. That seems to be the approach of Planned Parenthood and its allies in the abortion industry. Reeling from the widespread horror that has followed the release of undercover recordings made by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) – recordings that expose both Planned Parenthood’s shocking amorality as well as its possible violation of federal law – the abortion industry has turned to the courts in their efforts to gag CMP and silence other criticism. Amazingly, the pro-abortion camp has been successful so far, securing the censorship of two undercover videos.  Before turning to the legal issues surrounding this judicial censorship, simply consider what is at stake. The release of undercover videos is accepted practice in American politics and journalism – think only of the “47%” clip featuring Mitt Romney. Already the five videos released by CMP have stirred up a vigorous national debate over Planned Parenthood’s ethics and practices. Millions have watched one or more of CMP’s videos. Presidential candidates in both major parties – including Hilary Clinton, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina – have weighed in. Editorialists, commentators and columnists in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, MSNBC, Fox News and other major media outlets have been debating the issues raised by the videos. Congress is considering new legislation that would halt the trafficking of fetal body parts and cut Planned Parenthood’s federal funding, and legislators on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee are also mounting an investigation. In other words, the public interest in open and unfettered debate – and hence, in the full and immediate disclosure of all the CMP videos – is overwhelming. Information is the very lifeblood of democracy, and revealing CMP’s information is crucial to the working of our democratic process. Generally, the American legal system aids the free-flow of information by avoiding court orders meant to prevent the publication of materials with such compelling public importance. This is true when the information could threaten national security and even in time of war, as the Supreme Court affirmed in the famous 1971 Pentagon Papers Case. Five years later, when the Supreme Court struck down a lower court order that barred the media from making disclosures that might jeopardize a criminal defendant’s right to a fair trial, the Court emphasized that such a judicial “prior restraint” on publication was “one of the most extraordinary remedies known to our jurisprudence.” Echoing an earlier decision, the Court affirmed that the “main purpose” of the First Amendment was to prevent exactly such prior restraints on speech and publication. We thus face two big questions. First, how then can the current acts of judicial censorship be justified? And second, assuming that the orders don’t violate the First Amendment, what can be done, lawfully, to uphold the public’s right to know what is in the suppressed videos?  Understanding The Two Court Orders Last week, a California state court judge issued an ex-parte temporary restraining order (“TRO”) at the behest of StemExpress, a fetal organ broker, enjoining (restricting) CMP from releasing any undercover videos featuring StemExpress executives. A few days later, a federal judge followed suit for the National Abortion Federation (“NAF”), issuing an ex-parte TRO enjoining CMP from releasing any undercover videos obtained at the NAF’s national conference. A TRO has a limited life span. It freeze-frames an existing situation for a short period, and is usually the prelude to the issuance (or not) of a Preliminary Injunction that would have a more lasting effect, maintaining the status quo until a trial is completed. Information is the very lifeblood of democracy, and revealing CMP’s information is crucial to the working of our democratic process. Are the TROs constitutional? At issue in both the state and federal court case is whether the judge-issued TROs, or injunctions, are unconstitutional prior restraints on First Amendment guaranteed freedom of speech. Generally, even if prospective speech will harm another party, a court may not enjoin (restrict) the speech before a trial. If the speech is harmful, the usual remedy is to sue for damages after the harmful speech has occurred. a) Did CMP obtain the videos illegally?  The first question is whether CMP violated the law in obtaining its recordings. StemExpress’s complaint against CMP in state court broadly asserts that two wrongs occurred. First, StemExpress alleges that CMP violated California Penal Code § 632, which bars one party from secretly recording another party, as long as the unknowing party had a reasonable expectation that the conversation was not being overheard or recorded. According to StemExpress, great care was taken to ensure others in the restaurant were unable to overhear the meeting between StemExpress execs and CMP actors. For instance, StemExpress execs spoke in hushed tones and ceased discussions whenever a server approached. Second, StemExpress also claims CMP violated the terms of a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”), signed by StemExpress after the meeting occurred, so CMP could access confidential StemExpress documents that were later listed on CMP’s website. In this state court case, it seems that CMP has clearly violated § 632. However, there is a question as to whether the NDA applies to the video, and Ken White at Popehat has pointed out that the documents covered by the NDA were excluded from the state court judge’s TRO, meaning that those materials are still available on the CMP website. In the NAF case in a federal court, NAF also alleges that CMP violated § 632 along with the terms of an NDA, which was signed by CMP before entering a National Abortion Federation Conference. (Here is the NAF complaint and here is the order granting NAF a TRO). According to Eugene Volokh, one of the nation’s finest First Amendment scholars, while NAF’s § 632 claim is shaky – socializing at a large conference doesn’t provide the non-recording party an expectation of privacy – the NAF does have a valid contention as to CMP’s signing of the NDA. In other words, parties can waive their First Amendment rights through a contract, as evidenced by the 1980 Supreme Court case, Snepp v. US, 444 U.S. 507. b) Can a prior restraint be applied to CMP’s speech? So in both contexts, CMP probably obtained the videos wrongfully. But the second, much more important question is whether a judge-made prior restraint on speech is allowable in either case—regardless of the videos’ legality. But the second, much more important question is whether a judge-made prior restraint on speech is allowable in either case. Volokh writes that because both the California statute and contract law are considered “content neutral” restraints on speech, a lower standard of First Amendment scrutiny would be applied to post-trial permanent injunctions (Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U.S. 753 (1994)). Volokh opines that a pre-trial injunction on speech (a prior restraint) may then be allowable in cases of breach of contract, based on a California Supreme Court case, DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Bunner (Cal. 2003). There, a pre-trial injunction was upheld to limit commercial speech involving trade secrets. To further the possibility of a legitimate pre-trial injunction on speech, Volokh also points to a case deciding that the First Amendment does not prohibit a plaintiff from recovering damages post-trial when the press broke a promise of confidentiality, even if the public interest is concerned (Cohen v. Cowles Media Co., 501 U.S. 663 (1991)). Cohen was later used by the Connecticut Supreme Court to allow a pre-trial injunction on speech during a dispute between divorcees on the basis that the plaintiff had contracted out of her First Amendment rights by signing a NDA (Perricone v. Perricone, (Conn. 2009)). We are not persuaded by this reasoning. Madsen, the main case Volokh relies on for applying a lower standard of scrutiny in the current situation, states that when an injunction is at play, even the lower standard of scrutiny still compels courts to decide “whether the challenged provisions of the injunction burden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest” (Madsen at 765). In Madsen, the Court upheld an injunction that set a mere 36 foot buffer zone at the entrance of an abortion clinic to keep it free from protestors – hardly the far-reaching injunctions put in place by our two California judges. For example, in the federal court case involving NAF, that organization frequently cited unsubstantiated threats against abortion providers as a reason to enjoin the release of footage obtained at the conference. Even if NAF’s unproven and self-serving claims are accepted, the solution is very simple: redact names and blur faces, but allow the content to be released. But NAF’s factual claims shouldn’t be accepted at face value, as the Supreme Court has flatly declined to justify prior restraints using “factors unknown and unknowable” (Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 540 (1976)). Finally, keep in mind Madsen is only dealing with post-trial injunctions, not a pre-trial prior restraint on speech. Cohen also does not involve a prior restraint on speech. Weighing the Public Interest When a prior restraint is in question a balancing test is required, with information of public importance carrying special weight against the enforcement of a prior restraint. The crucial issue then, as we see it, is whether the disclosure of the information in CMP’s possession, even if obtained wrongfully, is of overriding public interest. The court in Perricone – allowing a prior restraint on speech in the face of prospective breach of contract – uses such a balancing test (at 687). Perricone finds that factors “weighed against the enforcement of contractual waivers include the ‘critical importance’ of the right to speak on matters of public concern” (quoting Leonard v. Clark, 12 F.3d 885, 891 (9th Cir. 1993)). In reaching its conclusion to allow a prior restraint, the Perricone court simply goes on to find that the divorcees’ dispute is of dubious public interest – in the court’s wording, the case “‘involves private litigants, and concerns matters of little legitimate public interest’” (quoting Pansy v. Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 788 (3rd Cir. 1994)). The crucial issue is whether the disclosure of the information in CMP’s possession, even if obtained wrongfully, is of overriding public interest. The California case allowing a pretrial injunction, DVD Copy Association, also carved out an exception for matters of public concern. Volokh finds this to be the wrong outcome, feeling that contract law is a likely exception to doctrine regarding prior restraints. But the standard remedy for breach of contract is post-trial damages. True, as seen above, courts have enforced prior restraints on commercial and private speech. But that seems to have been because the alleged harm suffered by the party seeking enjoinment was quantifiable and outweighed any public interest in the enjoined speech. In the alternate, where the public interest significantly outweighs the alleged potential for private harm, prior restraints are likely unconstitutional. Indeed, higher protections of speech involving the public interest exist even when that speech threatens national security, as in the Pentagon Papers case—New York Times v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)—wherein the court ruled that journalistic speech could not be enjoined pre-trial, as any prior restraint bears “a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.” And the Court later held in the Nebraska Press case that a prior restraint was unconstitutional even when prospective speech threatened the constitutional right of a criminal defendant to a fair trial – surely a weighty private interest. Does the apparent wrongdoing by CMP make the current cases different from these other cases? We don’t think so: there is a general rule not to impose a prior restraint on speech akin to investigative journalism, even if the information was wrongfully attained. (See In Re King World Productions Inc., 898 F. 2d 56 (6th Cir. 1990), where the court states “because the purpose of the first amendment press freedom clause is to allow the dissemination of information, good or bad, right or wrong, even minimal interference with first amendment freedoms causes an irreparable injury.”) The most pertinent Supreme Court case involving wrongdoing by the party subject to a prior restraint, CBS Inc. v. Davis, 510 U.S. 1315 (1994), concerning investigative journalism of a meat-packing plant in the public interest, similarly declared prior restraints unconstitutional. There is a general rule not to impose a prior restraint on speech akin to investigative journalism, even if the information was wrongfully attained. According to none other than Justice Blackmun, who wrote the Davis opinion: “Nor is the prior restraint doctrine inapplicable because the videotape was obtained through the ‘calculated misdeeds’ of CBS. In New York Times Co., the Court refused to suppress publication of papers stolen from the Pentagon by a third party. Subsequent civil or criminal proceedings, rather than prior restraints, ordinarily are the appropriate sanction for calculated defamation or other misdeeds in the First Amendment context.” Blackmun goes on: “If CBS has breached its state-law obligations (emphasis is ours), the First Amendment requires that Federal (the meat-packing company) remedy its harms through a damages proceeding rather than through suppression of protected speech” (Davis at 1318). The contracts being used to censure CMP are state-law obligations. The remedy for breaching them ought therefore to be a damages action, not suppression of free speech. In short: the release of CMP’s two censored videos is a matter of the utmost public concern. We therefore believe that the two court orders suppressing CMP’s speech violate First Amendment protections. Serving the Public Interest The public’s right to know requires that this information be released now. Americans of all persuasions across the country are repulsed by what the videos appear to show – the trafficking of the brains, livers, legs, hearts, eyes, lungs, and even reproductive organs, of fetuses, including viable babies who are able to live outside their mother’s womb. Of particular interest in both videos currently being restrained by the judiciary are the issues of late-term and partial-birth abortion. Of particular interest in both videos currently being restrained by the judiciary are the similar—but not synonymous—issues of late-term and partial-birth (D&X) abortion. Judging by the first full transcript – the one Planned Parenthood supposedly wants you to look at because the short video is supposedly heavily edited – it is possible that Planned Parenthood is violating the federal ban on D&X abortions, and violating federal law by changing the procedure to better-procure intact fetal organs. It is further plausible that one of the ways Planned Parenthood illegally changes the procedure involves inserting more dilating sticks – called laminaria or Dilapan – than would normally be required for an abortion with no organ procurement in mind. Such liberal use of laminaria can cause pre-abortion-appointment live birth, possibly implicating Planned Parenthood and StemExpress in violations of the federal Born Alive Infant Protection Act. Evidence of this is said to be contained in the judicially-restricted videos. Will the lower courts consider the public interest? Maybe not. “Ex parte” means that CMP didn’t even get to show up in court to state its case, though the TRO only lasts a short period of time because of this. The next step sought by the abortion industry is for the two courts to issue preliminary injunctions (“PI”), meaning release of the videos would be barred pending trial, a process that could take several years. As we write, the federal judge has strongly suggested he would grant NAF a PI. CMP can appeal the PI, though this process could also take several months, and the liberal Ninth Circuit would be hearing that appeal. In light of all this, we feel it is appropriate for Congress to step in. Regardless of the outcome of current litigation, Congress has a right to compel CMP to produce copies of the videos under its broad subpoena power. Congress should exercise this power. Compel the Release of the Recordings through a Congressional Subpoena The Congressional subpoena power is extremely broad, and judicial review of its exercise is very limited. Congress’s power to issue subpoenas is an indispensable adjunct of its law-making power: without access to relevant information, Congress cannot legislate wisely. And law-making is what Congress exists to do. The leading case is McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 175 (1927): “A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information — which not infrequently is true — recourse must be had to others who do possess it.” Congress’s power to issue subpoenas is an indispensable adjunct of its law-making power: without access to relevant information, Congress cannot legislate wisely. Not only is a subpoena in Congress’s constitutional power, but the means for issuing one are readily available. House Republicans have recently passed rule changes for the Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Fred Upton, allowing Mr. Upton even greater discretion to issue subpoenas without consulting the minority party. The only substantial limitation to this subpoena power is that the information sought be within the scope of Congress’s wide-ranging legislative or investigatory purpose. Here, Congress is clearly legislating. Congress has just considered a bill to defund Planned Parenthood (which commanded a majority of Senate votes, but not enough to overcome a procedural hurdle). A second round of voting on defunding may come up in the near future. Congress will also soon consider changing the law as to fetal organ sales. And the House Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating possible violations of current federal law dealing with the trafficking of fetal body parts. The House Energy and Commerce Committee should subpoena the StemExpress and National Abortion Federation recordings from the Center for Medical Progress. In the case of StemExpress in state court, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution would ensure that a Congressional subpoena trumped any injunction issued by the state court judge. Whether a Congressional subpoena would also trump the federal court’s injunction in the NAF case is a closer question, and to the best of our knowledge no case law exists on the point. Even here, however, we think a Congressional subpoena would prevail. The federal court’s purpose for issuing the injunction is the adjudication of a dispute between two private parties. The Congressional purpose for compelling the release of the NAF recording far transcends such a private dispute in its public importance. For too long has the abortion industry concealed its atrocities with the aid of lax regulators, media apologists, and abortion-friendly federal courts. But if CMP complied with a Congressional subpoena and released the video to Congress, it would appear to be in violation of the federal judge’s order. And such non-compliance could place it at risk of being held in contempt of that court. To be sure, CMP could argue that it had a legal duty to comply with the Congressional subpoena, and that that duty supplied it with a valid defense for its failure to comply with the judge’s order. But would that be a winning argument? Even if the judge’s order is unconstitutional, CMP generally has the duty to obey it – unless its duty to obey Congress took priority. We cannot say for certain that the court would not hold CMP in contempt, even though CMP did have a legal duty to comply with the subpoena. The court might insist that CMP had a higher obligation to obey its order instead, and to defy Congress (though that would subject CMP to the alternative risk of being held in contempt of Congress). But we think that in this event, CMP should be willing to take its chances and deliver the recordings to Congress. If the CMP abided by the request, when it was subject to a lawful Congressional subpoena and under potential threat of being held in contempt of Congress, such an action would constitute compliance with the will of a coordinate branch of the federal government, not civil disobedience or a gratuitous violation of the TRO. If it comes to that, let the federal judge, or even the Ninth Circuit, thumb its nose at Congress. If matters were pressed to that point, we expect that the Supreme Court would review the case. Once Congress has the two recordings, their contents could be entered into the Congressional Record, read on the floor of Congress, or viewed during a public committee hearing under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution. This constitutional provision provides absolute immunity to the legislative speech of a member of Congress, including if a member were to violate the federal court’s injunction (see Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972)). And the courts cannot question the motive behind a Congressional subpoena (see Eastland v. United States Servicemen’s Fund, 421 U.S. 491, 508 (1975)). Even if the courts surmised that Congress intended to violate the TRO, they would still be powerless to quash the subpoena. Are these measures extreme? Far from it. For too long has the abortion industry concealed its atrocities with the aid of lax regulators, media apologists, and abortion-friendly federal courts. We have discussed prior restraints extensively, but neither StemExpress, nor the National Abortion Federation, even remotely discussed that central issue in their complaints and requests for injunctions. It is time that another branch of government pushed back against these infringements on free speech. The People’s House is a good place to start.

"309",309,"Kansas Supreme Court Issues Shocking Victory For Abortion Supporters","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-04-26"," Today, in a 6-1 decision, the Kansas Supreme Court held in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt, that the state constitution guarantees a right to abortion. The named plaintiffs, Herbert Hodes and his daughter Traci Nauser, are two late-term abortionists who challenged Kansas’ ban on live dismemberment abortions—abortions which cause death by ripping the limbs and torso off of a fetus. Over the last several years, federal courts have declared similar bans on dismemberment abortions unconstitutional, but today’s decision is significant because, unlike other cases, it is based on a state constitutional right to abortion.  The Majority Opinion The majority in Hodes, held that Section 1 of the Kansas Bill of Rights enshrine a right to abortion in the state constitution, by providing “All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” This language, the Court concluded, guaranteed citizen “rights that preexisted the formation of the Kansas government,” and included in the “natural, inalienable rights” protected by Section 1 are “the right of personal autonomy, which includes the ability to control one’s own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self-determination.” The Kansas Supreme Court reasoned: “This right allows a woman to make her own decisions regarding her body, health, family formation, and family life—decisions that can include whether to continue a pregnancy. Although not absolute, this right is fundamental. Accordingly, the State is prohibited from restricting this right unless it is doing so to further a compelling government interest and in a way that is narrowly tailored to that interest.” After concluding that the Kansas constitution guarantees a right to an abortion, the state Supreme Court remanded the case for a determination of whether the Kansas Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act violates the newly defined constitutional right. While the outcome was expected, given that former Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, an abortion supporter, had appointed four of the seven Kansas Supreme Court justices, the 6-1 vote surprised some in the pro-life community. In addition to Sebelius’ appointed justices, Justices Marla Luckert and Lawton Nuss signed on to the majority opinion. The opinion was issued as a per curiam decision, thus not naming an individual justice as the author.  The Dissent The sole dissent came from Justice Caleb Stegall. In his lengthy dissent, Stegall stressed that “this case is not only about abortion policy—the most divisive social issue of our day—it is more elementally about the structure of our republican form of government.”  Continuing, Justice Stegall explained: “Here we venture onto a battlefield as old as politics itself. And as we argue about the structure of government—and ultimately delineate the proper conditions for just rule—we must never forget that we are also actively engaged in ruling.
The structural idea that gave birth to Kansas as a political community, which has achieved consensus support across most of our history, is that the proper conditions for just rule are met via participatory consent to secure and promote the common welfare. Today, a majority of this court dramatically departs from this consensus. Today, we hoist our sail and navigate the ship-of-state out of its firm anchorage in the harbor-of-common-good and onto the uncertain waters of the sea-of-fundamental-values. Today we issue the most significant and far-reaching decision this court has ever made.
The majority’s decision is so consequential because it fundamentally alters the structure of our government to magnify the power of the state—all while using that power to arbitrarily grant a regulatory reprieve to the judicially privileged act of abortion. In the process, the majority abandons the original public meaning of section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights and paints the interest in unborn life championed by millions of Kansans as rooted in an ugly prejudice.” The Kansas Supreme Court’s decision today represents the latest example of the left pushing for the expansion of abortion laws.  Earlier this year, New York’s passage of an extreme abortion-until-birth law made headlines, as did a similar law that failed in Virginia. The Kansas case is different though, as the pro-abortion decision came from the unelected judicial branch: By creating a state constitutional right to abortion, the Kansas Supreme Court has usurped the legislative branch’s authority to enact pro-life laws consistent with the conservative values of Kansans. The Pro-Life Reaction Mary Kay Culp, executive director of Kansans for Life, told The Federalist: “This horrendous ruling is due to the Court’s false claim that there exists a ‘right to abortion’ in our 1859 state constitution that despite being unstated somehow deserves to trump 45 years of citizen efforts that have cut abortions in half, increased women’s right to know protections, and resulted in the first state law to send the heinous dismemberment abortion method packing.” Over the last decade, abortion providers and advocacy organizations have quietly pushed a strategy of using liberal judges in conservatives states to invent a state constitutional right to abortion—both as a failsafe should the United States Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade and as a means of attacking state restrictions on abortion upheld by federal courts.  The strategy has proven successful, as seen by NARAL Pro-Choice America’s boast that “15 states’ constitutions provide greater protection of a woman’s right to choose than does the federal constitution.” For instance, while the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law prohibiting physician assistances from performing abortions, the Montana Supreme Court struck the law, concluding it violated the state constitution. The Kansas Supreme Court decision cannot be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court because the power to interpret a state constitution rests solely with the state’s judicial branch. That leaves pro-life Kansans with one option—amend the state constitution. To do so, both the Kansas House and Senate must approve a proposed constitutional amendment by a two-thirds majority vote, at which point the amendment is placed on the state’s next November ballot for voters to decide. With the state’s legislative session set to end next week, it is unlikely pro-life representatives will succeed in approving a proposed constitutional amendment before recessing for the summer. Absent a special election, the earliest Kansans could seek to overturn the decision, then, would be during the 2020 August primaries. Or, if delayed, the measure could be on the ballot for the November 2020 presidential election, at which time the future of Roe would also likely be on the line—as well as the lives of millions of human beings.

"310",310,"Women Won’t Be Liberated Until We’re Free From Abortion","Triller","Kaeley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-01-16"," This article contains some graphic descriptions. The boy ran his fingers across the dusty old photograph and studied it intently, tracing the lines of his grandfather’s uniform and imagining himself in the scene. When he closed his eyes, he could see himself mounted atop a dark stallion, his lips curled tightly around the trumpet’s mouthpiece, summoning the troops to order.  He escaped to this place often in his mind. It brought him comfort in the midst of a chaos he was still too young to name. Someday he, too, would wear a uniform and represent a cause and carry purpose on the shoulders that presently bore only the weight of poverty and motherlessness. The boy grew. His father, a radical (and often penniless) nationalist, taught safety in discipline, in order, in country. The boy joined a local youth organization and worked hard to achieve every merit badge and mark of honor that promised to bring him one step closer to the comfort and significance of that uniform. At 19, with the country on the brink of war, his chance arrived. He found it at a local hotel when military recruiters encouraged him to join their ranks. He signed on as a bookkeeper. He was well-trained in the art of war. It was ugly, but he was ready for that. The enemy must be defeated at any cost. So when he witnessed a fellow officer herding a large group of naked Jews into a nearby farmhouse, he thought nothing of it. Neither did he flinch when the officer locked the door, donned a gas mask, opened a can, and poured its contents down the hatch.  Oskar Groening lived an entire lifetime before confessing his crimes at the age of 93, when his conscience compelled him to come clean and apologize. He recalled the farmhouse incident with sobering detail: “The screams became louder and more desperate, but after a short time they became quieter again.” He felt nothing. “If you are convinced that the destruction of Judaism is necessary, then it no longer matters how the killing takes place,” he said. “At some point you are there, and the only thing left is the feeling: I am part of this necessary thing. A horrible thing, but necessary.” We Would Never Do That, Right? The atrocities of the Holocaust are beyond most of our comprehension. We recoil from images of emaciated bodies stacked one atop the other in shallow graves as passersby go about their business. We fixate on a singularly bewildering question, “How in the world is this kind of inhumanity possible?” We convince ourselves that we would never do such a thing. We would be different. We would say something. We would fight back. So egregious and breathtaking was the harm inflicted in Nazi Germany that, as argued in Godwin’s law, it’s essentially become the standard by which we seem to judge all other evil in the world. Very little can match it. The comparison falls short most of the time, cheapening our collective concept of just how much suffering occurred on a worldwide stage with a largely silent audience of millions.  But sometimes the comparison is actually relevant, and sometimes it needs to be drawn: Since the 1973 court decision Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in America, more than 60 million American children have lost their lives to it. That’s more than six times the number of people killed during the Holocaust. Also like the Holocaust, the visible carnage is easily accessible and often ignored. In 2015, the Center for Medical Progress released a series of devastating undercover videos that expose heinous acts of violence, greed, and exploitation that run rampant in the abortion industry. The graphic videos bring people face to face with a brutality that has legally thrived in our nation for nearly 50 years now. In one of the videos secretly recorded inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, the camera zooms in on a pie dish full of tiny hands and feet, butchered, sorted, and prepped for sale to the highest bidder. Fingers and toes, livers, and brains. “If you are convinced that the destruction of (babies) is necessary, then it no longer matters how the killing takes place,” apparently. ‘A Horrible Thing, But Necessary’ As heartbreaking as these videos are, they also represent hope for pro-lifers, that hard evidence will convict our society to reckon with the truth. The good news is, for many people, the videos have done just that. The bad (and somewhat surprising) news is that for way too many others, the means still justify the ends. Their battle cry is the same soundbite Groening employed so many years ago: “I am a part of this necessary thing. A horrible thing, but necessary.” Of course, this begs the question: What kind of desperation might need to exist in order to convince people that piles of aborted fetuses are acceptable, let alone necessary? While a popular knee-jerk response among conservatives might be to blame the sexual revolution, shake our heads, and say, “Darn hippies,” that’s ultimately lazy thinking. A better response would be to honestly ask ourselves what kind of desperation, what crisis of identity, inspired the sexual revolution in the first place? There is much to be said on this point; one need look no further than the overtly chauvinistic advertising popularized in the days of “Leave It to Beaver” to get a glimpse of what life may have been like for women who grew up knowing their lot in life was housewifery and breeding. Nothing happens in a vacuum. Why Can’t a Woman Be More Like a Man? But there’s a much more diabolical and intentional kind of mind trickery in play when, instead of encouraging females to challenge odious sex stereotypes, we are, instead, encouraged to believe that, in order to acquire power in a man’s world, we have to essentially kill the only superpower we have that men do not. Today’s girls are born into a world that convinces them that love is free, sex is casual, and hearts are Teflon. Beginning in childhood, society preys upon young girls’ vulnerability, carving out a Groening-like roadmap to a promise of happiness that relies almost entirely on the presupposition that our unborn children are nothing more than faceless blobs of tissue, hindrances to our success that can and should be discarded at will. Today’s girls are born into a world that convinces them that love is free, sex is casual, and hearts are Teflon, a world that labels marriage as unnecessary and motherhood as martyrdom, a world that insists on viewing children as burdens instead of blessings—barriers to the life we really want, a trap to keep us oppressed, a world that promises a “reset” button for every misstep. But there is no reset button for abortion, and the unspoken costs have been devastating; abortion either breaks a woman’s heart, or it hardens it. While pro-choice advocates aggressively deny the existence of abortion regret, truth is a resilient critter, and even Planned Parenthood now offers post-abortion counseling. Why would the exercise of a “basic human right” require therapy sessions? For Every Baby, There’s a Mother Let’s be honest: a large number of the pro-choice camp are post-abortive women. Like Groening, the culture exploited their emotional need and fed them a diet of propaganda and deceit. Their defense of abortion rights is so much more than we know; it’s a defense of an alternate reality carefully constructed around deeply buried grief and shame. Rage is shame’s bodyguard. It’s no wonder we see so many viral videos of abortion advocates violently destroying pro-life displays. As psychologist Dr. Dan Allender says, “Shame is a phenomenon of the eyes.” People living under its weight would rather claw out your eyes than allow you to see their nakedness. And rage is shame’s bodyguard. It’s no wonder we see so many viral videos of abortion advocates violently destroying pro-life displays. Each January, hundreds of churches around the nation observe Sanctity of Human Life Sunday to honor the lives lost to abortion and to recommit to the mission of ending legalized abortion once and for all. And every year, worldwide, the sobering body count climbs by the thousands, sparking outrage and further condemnation of “baby killing” and “infanticide.” But few people seem to remember that attached to every single one of those 60 million lives is a mother who, more likely than not, has carried the weight of that decision in ways that have never been properly grieved or expressed. Says Tracey Olsen, the assistant director of an abortion recovery program at Care Net of Puget Sound, “I didn’t know I was allowed to mourn the loss of my baby. I didn’t think I deserved the dignity of grief.” Yes, There Is Forgiveness for Abortion For many women like Tracey, the choice to bury their pain and to remain silent about their experience has kept them in bondage for years. The liberation they originally sought through abortion has only come through the intentional and open grieving of the past decision to abort. As it did for Groening, the burden eventually becomes too heavy to hold. What would it look like for the moms of the 60 million aborted babies to be healed and set free? Abortion recovery programs like Care Net of Puget Sound’s Healing Tide are a critically important and oft-neglected piece of the pro-life puzzle. When we talk about the sanctity of human life, we must do so in a way that communicates to women that we believe their lives are sacred, too. How many armies of Traceys are sitting silently in our own congregations desperately needing the healing that would free them to launch their own ministries of restoration and hope? What would the conversation about abortion look like if the women who’ve grieved it were the ones doing the talking? What would it look like for the moms of the 60 million aborted babies to be healed and set free? Those of us who are active in any capacity of the pro-life movement have an obligation to find out. True women’s liberation depends on it. We, and our children, deserve so much better than abortion. ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/16/women-wont-liberated-free-abortion/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"311",311,"Planned Parenthood Plans for Bigger Abortion Future","Paprocki","Anna",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-07-01"," Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) has suggested she wants credit for the documented decline in U.S. abortions. But as Americans United for Life exposes in its report, “The Leviathan: How Planned Parenthood has Become Abortion, Inc.,” the abortion plan Richards engineered for her affiliates has nothing to do with less, and everything to do with more. It is no accident that while abortions are down nearly everywhere in the country Planned Parenthood’s abortion business continues to grow. Planned Parenthood has a clear, intentional strategy to take over the U.S. abortion market.  Part of Planned Parenthood’s strategic shift includes building bigger facilities, “mega-centers” where technicians perform abortions at higher, deadlier rates. Since 2004, Planned Parenthood has opened these clinics, which are 10,000 square feet or greater in size, in at least 19 cities in 14 states. More Abortions, Fewer Clients Planned Parenthood’s mega-center roll-out has corresponded with bigger abortion numbers, bigger profits, and more taxpayer dollars—but at the same time, shrinking its overall number of clients and massive cuts to Planned Parenthood’s non-controversial, non-abortion services like cancer screenings. The increase in abortions has been significant. In 2004, Planned Parenthood reported that its centers performed 255,015 abortions. In 2013, its centers performed 327,653 abortions—72,638 more than in 2004. That is roughly 200 more abortions each and every day. Planned Parenthood’s most recent annual report estimates it saw only 2.7 million clients, a nearly 10 percent decline. While dramatically growing its abortion business, Planned Parenthood’s client base, as a whole, has stagnated and even declined. Planned Parenthood reported it saw 2,936,328 million clients at its centers in 2004. For several years, since 2007, PPFA’s annual reports made the vague claim that its centers served “nearly 3 million” patients. But PPFA’s most recent annual report estimates it saw only 2.7 million clients, a nearly 10 percent decline.  Taking those two trends together—more abortions and fewer overall patients—paints a compelling picture of where Planned Parenthood’s priorities lie. Compared to 2004, in 2013 Planned Parenthood centers saw about 650 fewer total patients each day, but performed 200 more abortions daily. More Abortions, Less Health Care During this era of mega-center expansion, abortion at Planned Parenthood is clearly on the rise both in terms of raw numbers and percentage of its overall operations. No matter how Planned Parenthood tries to reconfigure the way it counts “services” in an attempt to dupe the public into believing that abortion remains a mere 3 percent of what it does, the percentage of patients for which Planned Parenthood performed abortions demonstrably climbed from 8.7 percent in 2004 to, by its own admission, 12.1 percent in 2013. Cancer screening and preventions services at Planned Parenthood centers have been cut by more than 50 percent. On the chopping block at Planned Parenthood have been its non-controversial, non-abortion services like cancer screening and prevention. In stark contrast to its growing abortion business during the era of mega-center expansion, cancer screening and preventions services at Planned Parenthood centers have been cut by more than 50 percent. That decline includes “breast exams/breast care” services, which have plummeted even after 2012, when Planned Parenthood not only successfully bullied the Susan G. Komen Foundation into lowering its standards to continue grants to Planned Parenthood’s centers but also reportedly raised over $3 million in three days because of the controversy. As evidence that abortion is intentionally its core focus for the future, PPFA issued a mandate to all of its affiliates that by January 2013 they either had to perform abortions or get out of Planned Parenthood.  But how has Planned Parenthood successfully grown its abortion business when national demand for its profitable “product” has steadily declined? Planned Parenthood has pushed many of its competitors out of the market. Its ability to open mega-centers and put unaffiliated clinics out of business has been enabled by Planned Parenthood’s tax-exempt status and its hefty taxpayer funding. Planned Parenthood affiliates’ reported revenue from taxpayer dollars has increased from $272.7 million in its 2004-2005 fiscal year to an average of $536.6 million in each one of the past four years. According to PPFA’s most recently released annual report, 41 percent of Planned Parenthood’s $1.3 billion in revenue was at taxpayers’ expense. With taxpayer dollars heavily subsidizing its operations, and with its tax-exempt status providing an additional competitive edge, Planned Parenthood is building towards an abortion monopoly. In 2004, Planned Parenthood clinics performed one out of every five abortions in the U.S. By 2011, the latest year for which national data is available, Planned Parenthood performed nearly one out of every three. Richards wants to credit contraception and sex education for the national abortion decline to get her hands on more taxpayer dollars. But not only does data show that abortion has been declining while unintended pregnancies have risen, as AUL’s report shows, Planned Parenthood’s clear plans for its future are about more, not less, abortion.

"312",312,"Future GOP Victories Hinge On Positive Pro-Life Messaging, Not Ignoring Abortion","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-04-06"," Instead of throwing every ounce of effort and a competitive amount of dollars into keeping the Wisconsin Supreme Court controlled by conservatives, the RNC, the messaging and fundraising arm of the Republican party, preoccupied itself with national issues and 2024 messaging. Then, Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel had the audacity to claim it was the Republican candidates’ fault for failing to adequately address abortion during his campaign.



“When you’re losing by 10 points, there is a messaging issue and abortion is still an issue,” McDaniel said on Fox News this week. 




RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel on liberal Supreme Court victory in Wisconsin:""There is a messaging issue, and abortion is still an issue…I'm a suburban woman. I know this is an issue."" pic.twitter.com/CC28kiGeWS— Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 5, 2023
Up McDaniel’s Fox hit, the RNC was largely silent on the Wisconsin race. It was only after former state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, a Republican, lost in a landslide to Judge “No Jail” Janet Protasiewic that McDaniel finally spoke up about the race.



“We can’t allow the Democrats to define Republicans and put millions of dollars up in lies, and you have it go unanswered. Because the lies become the truth if they go unanswered,” McDaniel explained. “We have to put the Democrats on the defense on this issue. Talk about the fact that they support gender selection abortions and due date abortions.”



McDaniel’s response isn’t just tone-deaf; it’s a poor attempt to explain why RNC support for the GOP candidate faltered during one of the most expensive and heated state supreme court races in history. Only using defensive talking points to address Democrats’ abortion lies severely undersells the resilience and efficacy of the pro-life movement and will only get Republicans so far.



As the chairwoman accurately noted at the conclusion of her interview, voters will keep abortion at the top of their polls for years to come. 



“This is not an issue that’s going away for our party in a post-Dobbs world and we can’t put our head in the sand and think it’s going to, heading into 2024,” McDaniel said. 



What she failed to address is that for the GOP to be successful in this endeavor, pantywaist Republicans’ noncommital approach to abortion must go.



If the RNC is serious about addressing abortion, it will stop complaining and blaming GOP losses on a lack of effective abortion messaging and start engaging voters with enticing and communicative education about pro-life policy.



The Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision changed the landscape of the abortion debate forever but that didn’t hinder the pro-life movement from keeping its messaging and legal resources fresh. Republicans, on the other hand, are still trying to dance around abortion instead of using the momentum of the end of Roe to advance pro-life priorities.



During the 2022 elections, many of them, like Mehmet Oz, tried to run away from communicating solid support for the pro-life agenda. He paid the price for his silence and other incompetencies with a big loss.



Republicans like McDaniel were made well aware that avoiding abortion during the midterm campaign cycle was a blunder when Kansans voted to reject a pro-life amendment to their state constitution the August before the election. It became even more clear when the red wave that so many GOP insiders inaccurately predicted turned into Republicans, many who took a non-stance on abortion, barely winning back the House.



Republican politicians who boldly went on offense by passing pro-life legislation and allying themselves with grassroots activists for the unborn, however, successfully warded off legal and political challenges and smears from the Biden administration and corrupt corporate media in the Fall of 2022. As a result, they were rewarded with double-digit victories.



Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed protections for unborn children with detectable heartbeats into law in 2019, accrued 25.6 percent more of his state’s votes than his pro-abortion opponent. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, similarly, won his state by a whopping 19.4 percent mere months after he signed legislation outlawing abortions starting at 15 weeks gestation.



Just a year and a half after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed his state’s heartbeat abortion ban into law, he won reelection by 11 percent. With a 7.6 percent lead, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who rubber-stamped a heartbeat law since his last election, kept his seat from preborn heartbeat denier Stacey Abrams.



If it wasn’t clear before, it is now. The best way for the GOP to harness pro-life momentum for future elections is to ask the D.C. outsiders doing pro-life work on the ground to help craft messaging.



Most Americans support publicly funding pregnancy centers. If Republicans consulted pregnancy centers about messaging, they would be better equipped to communicate the wide-ranging police solutions pro-lifers offer to a clearly receptive public. The organizations smeared by the corporate media and Democrats as “fake clinics” actually serve millions and save thousands of babies’ and mothers’ lives a year. Republicans automatically put themselves at a disadvantage if they fail to convey that.



Shortly after the 2022 election, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said in a statement that “The approach to winning on abortion in federal races, proven for a decade is this: state clearly the ambitious consensus pro-life position and contrast that with the extreme view of Democrat opponents.” Republicans and Republican strategizers who don’t take this advice to heart are fools. 



Over and over, the propaganda press and their allies in the Democrat Party lie about the physical and emotional harms of abortion. They also lie about Republicans’ pro-life position to try to justify Democrats’ radical aim to legalize unregulated abortion through birth. 



Republicans like McDaniel and even former president Donald Trump buy into these lies when they pretend that Republicans are incapable of skillfully handling the “abortion issue.”



American voters are on the side of limited abortions and funding pregnancy centers. If McDaniel, the RNC, and future Republican candidates are wise, they will harness this public support to fuel future GOP victories.

Corporate media gladly used the unanimous decision, which was largely procedural and did not offer a moral or legal judgment on the actual use of abortion pills, as ammo to fuel their abortion allies’ attempts to expand baby-killing even in the dozens of pro-life states that have restricted or banned it.  Only a few were willing to admit that the true nature of the opinion penned by Justice Brett Kavanaugh leaves the door wide open for a stronger challenge to make its way to the high court. Kansas, Idaho, and Missouri, whose attempts to join the SCOTUS case were declined, already appear teed up for more viable legal action over the abortion pill. SCOTUS’s refusal to rule on the merits of the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine’s case, however, also leaves the door open for abortion activists and their elected allies to do everything in their power to solidify mifepristone’s presence in their post-Dobbs v. Jackson baby-killing schemes. Especially because the court’s instruction for those worried about the pill to take it up with the administrative state will likely fall on the FDA’s deliberately deaf ears. Shortly after the court’s ruling last week, President Joe Biden’s White House issued an official statement signaling its continued commitment to advancing its abortion-for-all agenda. “Today’s decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues,” the comment begins.  The four-paragraph statement frames criticism of the pill responsible for a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits as “attacks on medication abortion” that are “part of Republican elected officials’ extreme and dangerous agenda to ban abortion nationwide.” The Biden administration’s quest to keep promoting abortion pills that can cause hemorrhage, “fast, weak pulse,” “shortness of breath,” diarrhea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, “pain” across the back, arms, neck, and abdomen, and myriad other risks to both mothers and babies is joined by states that not only entertain deceptive abortion ballot measures but also abuse their power to squash pro-lifers. New York Attorney General Letitia James, for example, is using lawfare to target pregnancy centers in her state that promote lifesaving abortion pill reversals, which several studies have determined are “safe and effective” and resulted in “no apparent increased risk of birth defects.” Mifepristone, on the other hand, cuts off the hormones babies in utero require to grow and flourish, essentially killing the child via starvation. Then, the pill induces a form of labor that causes the likely deceased baby to exit the body amid profuse bleeding that may last weeks or even months. In some cases, the chemical abortion drug has led to the deaths of mothers.  The people behind the popular yet dangerous abortion pill have since raked in tens of millions of dollars for selling a drug designed to kill unborn babies. The Biden administration and abortion activists’ efforts to expand means for abortion through all nine months of pregnancy regardless of pro-life prohibitions on the practice have only made the tangled web of investors and shell accounts that manage mifepristone’s market presence more profitable. If one thing is certain after Thursday’s ruling, it’s that the fight over chemical abortion via mifepristone is far from over.

"314",314,"New York Magazine Is Right: Every Pregnancy Center Is A Threat To Big Abortion","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-05-08"," Tune up the world’s smallest violin to bemoan the plight of the last remaining abortion business in Mississippi, which pays the rent by ending 2,300 unborn human lives every year. Tonight’s tiny-stringed orchestra conductor, New York Magazine, set off a cacophony of pro-abortion sorrow Thursday in an article entitled, “A New Threat to Mississippi’s Only Abortion Clinic Moved in Across the Street.”
Soon, Mic.com and Romper.com followed with similar pieces, decrying a new neighbor to Jackson Women’s Health Organization, an abortion clinic that has been a darling of the Left and is the stomping grounds to self-styled Christian abortionist Willie Parker. As first reported by Pregnancy Help News, the clinic now has a pro-life neighbor just 100 yards away, dedicated to giving a woman one last chance to save her baby and reject abortion.
While a free ultrasound is the main tool the pro-life Center for Pregnancy Choices will use to help women choose life for their babies in the shadow of the pink-painted abortion mill, that fact is conveniently absent from the coverage by New York Magazine and friends.
We’ve Heard These Lines Before
In place of the facts, New York Magazine trots out old, baseless talking points from abortion fanatics at NARAL Pro-Choice America, accusing pregnancy centers of luring and lying to women “to persuade women into their center instead, often claiming that their centers can offer the services they may need.”
Along with NARAL’s trope, the author points to numbers pulled from the pro-abortion 2016 National Clinic Violence Survey in attempts to show that a pregnancy center’s proximity to an abortion clinic poses an actual physical threat to clinic staff. Compiled by the Feminist Majority Foundation, the survey is deeply flawed, drawing self-reported responses from 319 abortionists around the nation and failing to include any crime statistics whatsoever.
Far from putting abortionists at risk by locating near a clinic, pro-life pregnancy centers put themselves in harm’s way to give their clients a true choice. While women are indeed often persuaded to go into a pregnancy center rather than an abortion clinic, there’s no question that decision has everything to do with what’s inside each type of facility.
At a pregnancy help center like Center for Pregnancy Choices, a woman will find free pregnancy testing, a free ultrasound, and free options consulting that has zero profit motivation. Choices, in other words.
At an abortion clinic like Jackson Women’s Health Organization, however, what a woman will find is anything but choice. All she will find is an abortion, because that’s all the clinic offers. That’s what keeps the lights on and the money flowing in, after all.
Which Organization Profits from Abortion?
While clients at abortion clinics often regret their decision to abort—some are physically harmed and even die—more than nine in 10 clients at a pro-life pregnancy center report the highest levels of satisfaction with the care they received.
Those women, like Ashleigh, who chose life for her son thanks to a central Ohio pregnancy center, go onto become outspoken proponents of the help they received, contributing to the reality that the No. 1 way pregnancy centers attract new clients is word of mouth.
“Hands down, I’m so much better off because I chose life,” Ashleigh said in early April. “When I went there, the lady there was 100 percent non-judgmental and my decision wasn’t going to make them any profit. That’s what I was looking for, someone to talk to who wasn’t going to profit off me or my baby.”
In the final analysis, that is why a pregnancy center poses such a threat to the abortion industry. The threat has everything to do with the abortion clinic’s bottom line.

"315",315,"Abortion Activists Try To Fool Ohioans Into Constitutional Amendment Threatening Unborn Lives And Parental Rights","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-05-23"," Pro-abortion groups want to enshrine abortion in the Ohio state constitution via a proposed amendment that will not just threaten the lives of unborn babies but would also pose a risk to the rights of parents. 



The initiative, proposed by Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom — a coalition of eight pro-abortion and LGBT groups — and Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights, would ensconce abortion under the premise that “every individual has a right” to ending life in the womb and other “reproductive decisions.” 



The ballot initiative claims abortion could still be banned by the Ohio legislature after fetal viability, which occurs around 20 weeks gestation, but carved out an exception for any abortions deemed necessary by a doctor to “protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.” 



Abortion shills in Kansas used a similar playbook to deceive voters into rejecting a proposal that would have declared there is no constitutional right in Kansas to abortion, taxpayer-funded or otherwise. With the help of out-of-state donors and outside groups, opponents of the pro-life amendment raised millions to fund lies and expand Midwestern abortion operations. 



To prevent the same kind of duplicity from wreaking havoc on their state, Ohio Republicans passed a resolution on May 10 that let will voters decide in an August special election if constitutional amendments should only pass with a supermajority, 60 percent threshold vote. 



GOP legislators’ efforts to enable voters to prevent the flippant passage of constitutional changes were smeared by local news outlets, with paid Planned Parenthood activist and chair of Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom Lauren Blauvelt accusing the lawmakers of “working overtime to dismantle democracy as we know it.”



“This entire effort slaps voters in the face and betrays our democracy,” The Columbus Dispatch’s editorial board agreed. 



“Ohio Republicans try to change rules to defeat abortion rights amendment,” The Washington Post alleged. 



Ohio law currently states voters can amend the state constitution with only a simple majority vote, something that abortion activists desperately want to keep ahead of the expected vote on the abortion amendment in November. 



Several opponents of the GOP have tried to stifle the August election but their attempts have been rejected by Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Republicans who say the current simple majority doesn’t protect Ohioans or the state constitution from the influences of special interest groups. 



The proposed supermajority amendment “merely asks Ohioans if they want to approve a 60% threshold or not by voting in a free and fair election,” Rep. Brian Stewart said. “If that is really someone’s idea of an attack on democracy, they need to turn off cable news, log off Twitter and come back to reality. It’s not the end of the debate.”



Several pro-life groups have warned voters that the vagueness of the abortion amendment opens the door for not just an assault on unborn lives, but also on parental rights. 



One advertisement from Protect Women Ohio specifically asserts that the amendment’s language barring the state from interfering with an individual’s “right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions” could easily “cut” parents “out of the biggest decision” of their child’s life, including abortion or even the deforming genital surgeries and chemical castration that transgender activists promote to vulnerable teens.




🚨NEW: In response to the for-profit abortion industry’s new anti-parent amendment in Ohio, Protect Women Ohio has launched a $5M ad campaign to keep Ohio safe for women, girls, and babies. pic.twitter.com/GGYCFey9Gy— Protect Women Ohio (@ProtectWomenOH) March 15, 2023
 



A local news “fact-check” of the advertisement deemed PWO’s claim false because the amendment “says nothing about transgender or parental rights.”





Besides the fact that “reproductive decisions” could reasonably be interpreted to include transgender interventions that have a direct effect on a person’s reproductive abilities, the article also failed to mention that the explicit goal of several of the amendment’s proponents is to eradicate laws that require minors to obtain parental consent before undergoing an abortion. 



In February, an attorney for the ACLU of Ohio, a member of the ORF coalition, confirmed that if the constitutional amendment passes, laws requiring parents to consent before their teen daughter gets an abortion would not necessarily be enforced. 



“When you pass a constitutional amendment, it doesn’t just automatically erase everything and start over. But it would mean that laws that conflict with it cannot be enforced, should not be enforced,” Jessie Hill said.



Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity, another member of the ORF coalition and proud supporter of “sex-positive, gender-expansive, and abortion positive” policies, also openly opposes parental consent legislation. 



In fact, in 2021, an Ohio state coordinator with URGE lambasted the Buckeye State specifically for requiring a minor to “obtain parental consent or go through a cumbersome and traumatizing process of getting a judicial bypass from the state” to end her unborn baby’s life. 



For years now, the group has repeatedly advocated for abolishing laws that require parents to sign off on minors’ weighty decisions, including getting abortions. 



“Your daily reminder that parental involvement laws are unethical and must be abolished. Every pregnant person deserves full autonomy over their body and pregnancy, regardless of their age or family situation,” URGE tweeted in July 2020. 



In 2019, the group painted parental rights rules as “unnecessary restrictions” that contribute to the “unique barriers” minors seeking abortions might face. URGE specifically committed to “mobilize on state and local levels” to ensure their anti-parent agenda would be accomplished. Planned Parenthood also claimed parental consent laws put “youth at heightened risk.”



Similarly, in 2021, URGE posted a tweet claiming that “young ppl cannot be free until we’re given the freedom to make decisions about our own bodies, lives, & futures.”



“Parental involvement laws block this & violate our humanity,” the tweet concludes. 



To this day, URGE’s website features several articles promoting the end of parental rights when it comes to abortion.

"316",316,"The Left Loves Abortion So Much, It Endangers Women With Lies About Emergency Care","Harned","Mary",NA,"Skop, Ingrid",NA,NA,"2022-08-18"," In the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, abortion activists, with the assistance of the Biden administration, are unconscionably sowing confusion among the medical profession and the public. While purportedly advocating for women, they question whether health-care providers are still permitted to provide life-saving care to pregnant women facing medical emergencies in states with strong pro-life laws.  



This inquiry is disingenuous and dangerous; abortion activists know every state that is enforcing or seeking to enforce these laws permits abortion when it is necessary to save a pregnant woman’s life. Further, none of the states restrict treatment of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage management, neither of which are abortions. Yet abortion activists’ animus toward pro-life policy is so great that they are willing to espouse disinformation that will lead to poor outcomes for women and their unborn children.  



Banning Abortion Doesn’t Ban Life-Saving Care



In a Wall Street Journal article, Louisiana abortion activist Dr. Rebekah Gee questioned how close to death a pregnant patient must come before doctors may save her life under Louisiana’s new law. To be blunt, Gee does not need more guidance from the state to answer this question—rather, she needs to recall her medical training. Louisiana’s statute permits health-care providers to exercise “reasonable medical judgment” when determining if a pregnancy poses a threat to a patient’s life. This standard is very common in the medical profession and is used in medical malpractice litigation.  



State pro-life laws do not designate the precise diagnoses or prognoses that are necessary for a physician to determine that abortion is necessary to save a mother’s life. Such parameters would be impossible to legislate and would effectively replace credentialed physicians with lawmakers. Instead, physicians will continue to use their best judgment and training, with guidance from professional medical organizations, to care for patients, just as they always have. 



The reality is that most women facing potentially life-threatening emergencies caused or exacerbated by pregnancy do not want to have abortions. They urgently seek care that protects both their lives and the lives of their unborn children. Medical professionals share this goal, and under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), both the mother and unborn baby are patients entitled to care. 



Respecting Fetal Life and Giving Women Emergency Care



In fact, “medically indicated separations,” or pregnancy terminations that are necessary to protect the life of the mother, can often occur through labor induction or cesarean section, potentially resulting in a viable baby if he has reached an appropriate gestational age. While the laws in every state permit induced abortion (with the intent of ending fetal life) if needed to protect the mother’s life, compassionate care and respect for fetal life would dictate that the fetus should be delivered intact and alive if possible.  



How does this work in practice? A pregnant woman presents in the emergency room in a medical emergency, where a doctor evaluates and stabilizes her. For example, if she is suffering from kidney failure, her care will include labs, medications, and possible intensive care unit admission for dialysis. An obstetrician/gynecologist will be called who will determine if the cause of the patient’s emergency is related to her pregnancy and appropriate recommendations will be made. 



Even in dire circumstances, there is generally time for a multi-disciplinary consultation before it is determined if an abortion is necessary. In most circumstances, such as preeclampsia/eclampsia (uncontrollable high blood pressure and possibly seizures), previable preterm premature rupture of membranes (water breaks before labor at an early gestational age), or cardiac decompensation (inadequate maternal heart function), an induction or C-section may be performed by a woman’s own obstetrician, rather than an induced abortion. Even when a patient is hemorrhaging from a placenta previa (placenta lying over the cervical opening), a C-section is the quickest and most effective way to stop the bleeding. 



In those tragic circumstances where a baby too young to survive is delivered by induction or C-section, perinatal hospice provides the family an opportunity to hold her, express their love, and say goodbye. This compassionate outcome can help the mother and family’s emotional healing, but it is not possible with an induced dismemberment abortion. 



Miscarriage Is Not Abortion



Misrepresentation of state laws surrounding treatment for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy is even less justified. State laws do not need to “exempt” miscarriage management or ectopic pregnancy treatment from abortion bans because they are not abortions. Some states explicitly exclude these treatments from their definitions of abortion, but those exclusions, while providing more clarity, are superfluous. 



Ectopic pregnancy means the baby has implanted outside the uterus, inevitably resulting in internal bleeding and miscarriage, and is a leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States. Treatment of an ectopic pregnancy is not considered abortion because the intent is not to end the embryonic life, but to protect the mother’s life. Actions to remove a fetus after miscarriage (also known as spontaneous abortion) are also not considered abortions under state pro-life laws, because the unborn baby has already died.  



Bad-faith confusion over whether health-care providers may continue to use their best medical judgment to treat life-threatening pregnancy complications, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage is unjustified. Health-care providers should continue to provide life-affirming obstetric care for their patients and reject pro-abortion falsehoods designed to stoke fear in those states that affirm the value of both moms and their unborn babies.

"317",317,"5 Things The Right Can Learn From Abortion Supporters At Yale Law","Rendleman","Daniel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-05-25"," Twenty-one percent of the American electorate are one-issue voters who will only pull the lever for a candidate who sees abortion in the same way they do. I am among them. I believe that a fetus is a human being with all the rights that I possess (well, I can vote and they can’t). It follows that abortion is murder and, therefore, by far the greatest moral failing of our times. It’s not the only moral failing, of course. I do not want to diminish the grave importance of eliminating racial discrimination or supporting environmental stewardship or any other important issue. But 700,000 murders every year, performed by doctors at the behest of parents, overwhelms any other moral or political consideration on the ballot each November.  Yale University has long been a hotbed of the pro-choice movement. Griswold v. Connecticut, the case that eventually undid Connecticut’s contraception laws (and laid the groundwork for direct assaults on abortion bans) centered around a Planned Parenthood clinic right here in New Haven. Nowadays, Yale Law School hosts the likes of Reva Siegel, a paragon among pro-choice legal scholars. So I knew what I was getting into when I enrolled in the Reproductive Rights and Justice Seminar at Yale Law School, a whole semester dedicated to just this issue, surrounded by pro-choice students, reading pro-choice arguments. I knew I would be spending hours each week reading pro-choice apologia and listening to justifications for abortion. The Value of Listening to Your Opposites Most of my conservative friends asked me why I would put myself through it. To be honest, I did it in part because they asked me why. It does not take a keen political mind to notice that conservatives and liberals have stopped talking to each other. Our Facebook feeds keep us in comfortable echo chambers and, instead of reading what the other side thinks, we read what our side thinks about what the other side thinks. But in politics, none of our opponents are as evil as we believe them to be. Pro-choice advocates do not hate babies. Something, however, motivates them to believe as they do. There is some value or set of values behind their votes; something that leads millions of men and women to condone (or at least ignore) the destruction of human life. Do I have any common ground with these people? Well, if I did, it would come out in this seminar. And it did.  In a small room with a professor and about a dozen students, I was the only male. I was the only conservative. I did not allow my personal views to make it into the discussion very often. I was not attempting to be some sleeper agent, nor did I pretend to be a fiery pro-choice advocate. I was there to listen. Besides, standing up every 15 minutes to shout, “But it’s a baby!” would not have served either the professor’s purposes or my own. The professor was knowledgeable and inviting, the consummate leader of a seminar. She often presented both sides of the argument. She pressed the students to consider their own logical conclusions and forced us to confront our own assumptions. My classmates, too, were impressive. Where I half-expected lazy thinking, I found precise logic and nuance. Where I expected coldness, I found warmth and concern for children and women and families. This is what I learned. 1. Pro-Choice Advocates Notice When Opponents Compromise During a discussion, one of the students called out, “We all know that anti-abortion laws are about controlling women’s sexuality.” The women around the table responded with affirming nods and “mm-hmms.” I was flabbergasted. I had heard this line before, but assumed that only the crassest political hacks could believe it. I have no interest in anyone’s sex life. But here was a room full of smart women who all thought otherwise. The student went on. “That’s why rape and incest exceptions exist. Those are the situations where the woman has no choice.” I let that sink in. It is true. Those are instances where we say the mother did not give consent. That is where pro-life advocates fold the quickest. If the fetus is a child, why are we willing to give up its life because the mother was not a willing party to its creation? To an outsider, it would appear plain that pro-life advocates who are willing to make these exceptions only care about the life of the fetus if the mother chooses to have sex. What we really care about is not the created being, but the fornication.  What answer can we give? If we say we are only willing to grant these exceptions as a matter of political compromise, then we admit there are good reasons to value the mother’s trauma over the baby’s life. Because many of us draw the line here—at consensual sex—we say essentially that the mother’s promiscuity determines whether we will stand to protect the child. That is not a good look. If we say that we do not want to force an unwilling woman to go through the stress, anxiety, and danger of childbirth without having some choice in the matter, then are we really holding the fetus’s life always as valuable as anyone else’s? Or, as one student said in class, “What is so popular about the emotional stress from rape and incest? What is special about those situations as opposed to the stresses of poverty or abandonment?” 2. Pro-Choice Advocates Care About Women It is not just a ploy. One of the readings in class was a testimony by Norma McCorvey, the one-time plaintiff in Roe v. Wade turned pro-life activist. Parts of McCorvey’s testimony touched on the moral lie of abortion, the great subterfuge that surrounds the euphemistic language about “terminating pregnancies” and “products of conception.” Those parts hardly registered with the class. McCorvey also talked about how her lawyers treated her. She claimed that when the case was finally decided, she heard about it through the newspapers, not from her attorneys. Several women in the class were appalled. If true, instead of serving this woman, her lawyers were using her as a pawn in their own cause. My classmates were upset about this even though it was a cause they deeply believed in. Time and again their concern turned towards the disadvantaged. They viewed every law from the prism of the most vulnerable. If the government is not going to fund medical procedure X, then how are women in prison going to get it if they need it? If Catholic hospitals can opt out of procedure Y, must minority women in the Southwest drive four hours away to see a doctor? Their concern is not just a proxy for crass political calculation. For example, we learned that surrogacy contracts often require the surrogate to have an abortion if the donor couple no longer wants the child. This might happen because of a divorce or because a disease has been detected in the fetus. Some students were disgusted by this, but not because of the cheap value it puts on the fetus’s life. Instead, they saw these contracts as interfering with the woman’s freedom: “I’m concerned about the surrogate who is made to have an abortion she doesn’t want.” (Thankfully, such clauses have never been upheld in court, but the pressure they must put on women is immense.) But there was a line that cannot be crossed. The class read various testimonies and statistics about women who regret their abortions and wanted to speak out against it. “Isn’t this feminist?” the professor asked. This is, after all, women speaking up for themselves. But the reception was mixed. One student replied that, “You have to look at content and how it affects other women.” This was essentially code for saying: I will only support you when you agree with me. Another lamented that, “One difficulty with dismantling the patriarchy is that women and men perpetuate it.” That is, if you speak out against what these women see as the true cause of their sex, then your own personal womanhood will not save you. 3. Some Pro-Choice Advocates Are Really Afraid of Pregnancy These are women who have the world ahead of them. For earthly success, it is hard to do much better than a slot at Yale Law School. Potential is a hard thing to measure, but one of Yale Law School’s alumna came within a few thousand votes of the presidency just last November. You can’t blame these women for dreaming big. Everything in our culture tells these women that the worst thing you can do with a sex drive is repress it. A pregnancy can really change that. Sure, many women juggle the stresses of raising a child and the brutal grind of elite success in America. But that doesn’t make it sound any easier. After one set of assignments, a student came into class and announced, “These readings terrified me. I never want to get pregnant.” Yes, we have answers to this fear that make sense to us. They sound like, “Then wait until you are married.” As someone who got married young and comes home to a small army of children every day, I think this is pretty great advice. But these women grew up with a different mindset. They prize their sexual autonomy as an important element of their identity and one of the great pleasures of life. Frankly, who can blame them? Everything in our culture tells these women that the worst thing you can do with a sex drive is repress it. So when they are faced with the specter of Roe v. Wade being overturned, consider the scenarios that go through their head. “What if I get pregnant? What if I get raped? What about my friend who is barely making it as it is? What if she gets pregnant?” For more than 40 years now, our society has offered them an out: abortion. This is not an easy out or a simple decision, but it does mean that if everything goes against a woman’s plan for her future, she can reset the clock. We—I—want to get rid of that safety valve. They see that as an attack, and that makes sense. The political climate is more turbulent today than it has been in some time, so it is foolish to make predictions. But there is a good chance Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is one of us. If the pro-life movement finds itself poised to make significant gains in the near future, we must keep in mind the real trepidation that our countrywomen feel. It is not enough to simply dismiss them. 4. Pro-Choice Advocates Have Their Doubts These pro-choice women are not a monolith. Although they are united, there are a thousand lines of disagreement within the pro-choice camp. It even starts with the name. Some think “pro-choice” is not inclusive enough and represents a movement concerned primarily with the troubles of rich, white women. Many prefer “reproductive justice.” Abortion supporters found themselves arguing against higher safety and sanitation requirements. That is an awkward position to be in. The differences of opinion don’t stop at the name. One student expressed doubt about whether there was a “fundamental constitutional right to abortion” at all. She thought it was good public policy to allow abortions, but she was not sure the Constitution was the right source of authority. Another student felt that the pro-choice movement was more radical than she wanted it to be. Live Action videos force Planned Parenthood to defend the practice of harvesting a fetus’s organs. This was a step further than a woman’s right to control her own body. And abortionist Kermit Gosnell’s parade of horrors in Pennsylvania give the pro-life crowd an avenue to restrict abortion further: medical standards. As a result of these attacks, abortion supporters found themselves arguing against higher safety and sanitation requirements. That is an awkward position to be in, and the women in my class know it. “The pro-choice movement has been pushed into extreme positions all the time.” These “all or nothing” positions continually push any real moral choices out of the picture. When they think about it dispassionately, maybe abortion is a weightier decision than its advocates proclaim. When the professor pushed hard on the distinction between “fetus” and “baby,” many admitted the demarcation was unclear. “Where do we draw the line? Cutting the umbilical cord?” But this uncertainty was not enough to break any of them. Without a clear moral truth to cling to, the students fell back on something solid: bodily integrity. Nobody has a right to tell them what to do with their own bodies. Bodily integrity was the fortress that stopped the doubts from getting too strong. For some time now, the pro-life movement has tried to push on that moral murkiness. We talk about heartbeats and pain and fetal development. At some point, we need a stronger answer to the pro-choice fallback position. We need to make an argument that bodily integrity is not absolute. We do want to make women undergo childbirth even when they do not want to. We have to be able to address our assault on bodily integrity in a way that appeals to people who do not share our views about sexual morality or the beginning of life. Until we help them get past the mental and emotional hurdle of bodily integrity, they will not be able to directly confront the moral consequences of abortion. It is the tower to which they run. 5. The 2016 Election Terrified Them We had class the day after Donald Trump won the election for president of the United States. I was two minutes late that day (there was a lot of emotion in the hallways at Yale). When I walked in, it was just like a funeral. Faces downcast. Worry in every expression. This was supposed to be a day of triumph—their triumph. The first woman president. Many of these women had put in countless hours over the past year and a half to make President Hillary Clinton a reality. They had reservations at their favorite restaurants to celebrate what was supposed to be their day. But now? They didn’t have a plan for this. “I was so sure we were going to win that I did not even look at Trump’s list of Supreme Court nominees.” If this election does turn out to be a victory for pro-life America, we need to be ready for the counterattack. What had happened? Nobody had a good answer. Some of them were in no mood to give Trump’s voters the benefit of the doubt. “I think this election was about women in power.” That is, Trump was elected because of sexism. Others directed their anger more broadly. “I feel betrayed by . . . [Sanders supporters] who voted for Trump or stayed home.” What happens if Trump gets two nominations to the Supreme Court? Three? Trump may or may not care about abortion issues, but people around him certainly do. They were in shock, but this shock will not last long. Before class was over, these smart, resilient women were looking for a way forward. They were searching their souls for a way to pick up the pieces. They had a lot of ideas. “How do we separate the pro-life voter from the Rust Belt voter?” “Now is the time to expand the movement.” “We need to stop just talking about ‘choice’ and find common ground with more people.” “Maybe we should turn away from the courts for a while and look to make in-roads in the culture.” All across America, pro-choice advocates are having these discussions. If this election does turn out to be a victory for pro-life America, we need to be ready for the counterattack. It will come, and, if the plan comes from the creative and capable women I met last semester, it’s going to be a good one. But if they can find opportunities in this turbulent and polarized political climate, so can we. If we want to win some of these women over, if we want to keep picking at their doubts and building on shared values, I suggest we start by listening to them.

"318",318,"Unlike Those 113 Lawyers, I Didn’t Have An Abortion To Further My Career","Joy Hays","Sarah",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-01-11"," When you think of a woman who finds herself pregnant and single, you think of a poor, uneducated woman, probably under 21 and needing vast amounts of support. This is the prime candidate to scare into having an abortion, the kind of person Planned Parenthood “helps.” She’s supposedly the reason abortion is a beacon of light is for the underserved woman. When you think of a woman who finds herself pregnant and single, you probably don’t think of an educated woman with a burgeoning career, like that of the 113 lady attorneys who recently declared that having abortions had furthered their careers. You don’t think of a woman who is white, early 30s, her entire life ahead of her, and a committed Christian.  Why don’t you think of the latter? Because it feels like an anomaly. But that’s the category I fell in just two years ago. I had turned 30 in July, was about to make a move halfway across country to work in a new city with a new start. Instead, I landed in Dallas and realized I was pregnant just two weeks later. I was a prime candidate to have an abortion. My career was ahead of me, with a brand-new, exciting job on the horizon, and I would have to make major adjustments if I was going to be a single mom. Having a baby at this juncture of my life would no doubt hurt me socially in a new town, I knew. It would probably make finding a home in a new church much more challenging. It could destroy my career, especially as a conservative woman. And what would my family say? My close friends? The father? Career Women Are an Abortion Demographic My demographic is part of what keeps the abortion industry in motion. Planned Parenthood and other pro-abortion groups like to think they are in place to serve the poor woman, the women who find themselves pregnant without support, the woman without resources. They are going to save that woman from a life she shouldn’t have to live.  I can’t be the only single 30-year-old with a college degree who found herself pregnant. Yet I am the only single mom I know in that category. I am wholly convinced, however, that those aren’t the only abortions stealing away generations of children. It is also the 30-somethings, the career women who make their own life decisions without consideration for the lives they might create or the consequences of their actions. I can’t be the only single 30-year-old with a college degree who found herself pregnant. Yet I am the only single mom I know in that category. Some statistics published by the abortion-supporting Guttmacher Institute help explain why I am the only one “like me” I know. According to a 2008 study, 49 percent of abortions are conducted on women over 25 and 31 percent of women who chose abortion make 200 percent or more than the poverty level, which is approximately $23,000 per year for a single woman with no children. What’s crazy about that is when I discuss my situation with people who are pro-abortion or pro-Planned Parenthood, they like to remind me that I am privileged. They often don’t realize I was unemployed and alone in a new place when I found out I was pregnant. Then, my situation got worse: I told my parents, who are Christians, and active in a local church and in the pro-life movement. A bunch of tears and hard phone calls later, I got the email. My dad let me know that I was about to bear a child into a life of negative statistics. He would be poor, probably a criminal, and live a life of pain. Therefore, my only option was adoption.  Three-Quarters of Women Who Abort Are Thinking of Work Why was that so hurtful? Statistics on single parenting largely reflect a population who are under 21 (while that population represents roughly 18 percent of abortions), without college degrees, and bearing a baby into poverty. I defied all of those demographics. Is abortion serving the poor, or the women who don’t want their lives interrupted? Given all the talk about banning abortion and how abortion serves an underprivileged group of people, I began to think, is abortion serving the poor? Or is it serving the women who don’t want their lives interrupted? As I told more friends of my pregnancy, I began to hear abortion stories. For the first time in my life, people told me about their personal experiences. I realized that in all of our pro-life talk, we overlook exactly the people that the abortion industry targets. Seventy-five percent of women say they chose abortion because they thought having a child would affect their work or schooling. Should we reach out to poor women who might think they can’t afford a child, or another child? Yes! Of course we should! But we are missing women like me, the adult women who “can’t be pregnant right now.” My Lonely, Public Choice Well, you know what, I was pregnant. And as much as I didn’t want to be inconvenienced, I couldn’t choose abortion. It was sheer will, trust in Jesus, and coming face to face with convictions about my pro-life background that saved my son. If I could have made my decision in a vacuum, I might not have chosen life. If I could have made my decision in a vacuum, I may not have chosen to parent. I had to make a choice, and I would have to live with it. But life isn’t lived in private. It is lived alongside people. Even if those people are strangers at a coffee shop or nosy neighbors or distant co-workers, life isn’t lived alone. I had to make a choice, and I would have to live with it. The irony of this choice being so public is that it was so lonely. Again, loneliness is seemingly something I shouldn’t have experienced. I had support from my friends, from my church (I moved back to DC shortly after realizing I was pregnant—Dallas ended up being “home” for all of two doctor’s visits and six weeks), and eventually from my parents. As you read this, if you have ever been pregnant, you know what I’m talking about. You are experiencing something so unimaginably special and amazing that forever alters your body, your life, your plan—and I was doing it without one person. There was nobody to go buy more bagels and apples when that was all I could stomach, nobody to help me tie my shoes when I couldn’t bend over anymore. I didn’t have a loving husband to explain the magic to or commiserate with. I didn’t have that person who would be a part of every phase and stage of my baby’s life. There was nobody to go buy more bagels and apples when that was all I could stomach. I had friends. Friends who listened. Friends who were at the hospital when he was born. Friends who sent me gifts from all over the country (quite literally). Friends who held him when I needed to shower and pump or go to Target. I had all of this because I wasn’t shy about asking for help, and I let people help me when they offered. I had chosen to have sex, and there was a consequence. I was no longer making decisions just for me. The decisions, even if I chose adoption, were for me and this tiny thing inside of me. How to Help Women Like Me The pro-life movement eagerly targets and attempts to care for young women who aren’t educated and have no means to provide. But we need to find a new and better way to care for the women who “shouldn’t become pregnant” and therefore end their pregnancies in silence, the women who need help understanding perspective and consequences, the women who should be rising in their careers, not inconvenienced by a baby. We need to find a new and better way to care for the women who ‘shouldn’t become pregnant’ and therefore end their pregnancies in silence. These might be harsh stereotypes, but if I weren’t one of them, I wouldn’t know that this is a demographic to be served. Now the question: how do we do serve this group of women? We make ourselves available. We help women see hope. We offer to throw baby showers and help them register. If you are single or not a parent, give your time or cook a meal! Free babysitting is the greatest gift a new mom (single or not) could ever be given. So, where are we now? My son is 18 months old. I have a fantastic and flexible job that allowed me to work at home with him until he was about six months old. My son just started full-time childcare at 13 months old, which is definitely not the norm. I work, save, and spend the first $1,000-plus of my paycheck on a combination of childcare, diapers, and other kid things. No one has made me any GoFundMe accounts. I have paid more than $5,000 in medical bills between delivery, a re-hospitalization, and a couple of ER visits. A lot of people around me were far more than just pro-birth, and if your conviction lies in the pro-life column, find a way to be that. I do this alone. I do this without his dad. I do this surrounded by a community of friends and family who don’t really get the hardships that come with being a single parent—but they try to help! I am extremely committed to helping other women find the hope that I found when I chose life, when I chose to parent. The pro-life movement can be frustrating for some. The pro-choice crowd loves to taunt that we are only “pro-birth.” Well, a lot of people around me were far more than just pro-birth, and if your conviction lies in the pro-life column, find a way to be that. Find a local crisis pregnancy center. Let local high schools, middle schools, or youth groups know that you are available to talk. If you are reading this while single and pregnant, you can do this. It will be hard, it will be expensive, and you will have to defy a lot of “normal.” But defying normal with a little human is far better than the alternative.

"319",319,"The Viral Halsey Story Is A Typical Pro-Abortion Lie To Scare Women","Harle","Denise",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-07"," Pop singer Halsey recently made headlines by claiming that abortion saved her life following three miscarriages. This is supposedly a problem in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. But the real problem is this: What saved her life wasn’t an abortion, because, as most people understand, abortion only involves the killing of a live baby. The dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure Halsey received following her miscarriages is just as obtainable for that purpose today in all 50 states as it was before. Surely, the media and the abortion lobby both know this, but that hasn’t stopped them from engaging in relentless fearmongering for the sake of their social and political agendas since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization on June 24.That, in turn, has resulted in speculation on social media that has mounted to hysteria about the fate of women’s health care. In truth, the notion that women will no longer receive adequate care for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies in states that limit abortions is a myth.In a miscarriage, the unborn child is no longer living; a procedure to complete a miscarriage therefore does not terminate a pregnancy or end a life in the womb. So, treatments for miscarriage — and any possible side effects, including sepsis — would never fall under the definition of abortion. Again, an abortion procedure is one with the sole intent to produce a dead baby.Medical experts and lawmakers agree that laws protecting the lives of the unborn from abortion do not in any way prevent pregnant women from receiving life-saving care. The abortion laws of every single state have an exception for medical emergencies to save the life of the mother.  Ectopic pregnancy, for example, is one of those exceptions: It’s a life-threatening condition in which an embryo has implanted outside the uterus and so won’t survive. Because ectopic pregnancies are considered medical emergencies, under all existing state laws — even those with the most rigorous protections for the unborn — women have access to the health care they need. Treatment for Ectopic Pregnancies Isn’t Abortion Planned Parenthood itself has long recognized that treatment for ectopic pregnancy, although it results in terminating the pregnancy, is not an abortion. Its website says explicitly, “Treating an ectopic pregnancy isn’t the same thing as getting an abortion…. The medical procedures for abortions are not the same as the medical procedures for an ectopic pregnancy.”Dr. Christina Francis, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, clarifies why in an Instagram video.“Treating ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages or life-threatening conditions in pregnancy is not the same thing as an abortion,” she says, adding that, within medicine — particularly pro-life medicine — the distinction is crucial. “That’s because the only intent of an abortion is to produce a dead baby,” she says. “That’s not the intent when we intervene to save a woman’s life if she has a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or she’s going through a miscarriage.”“As a pro-life ob-gyn who’s practiced my entire career in hospitals that did not do abortions, I have never been prevented from being able to provide excellent health care to my patients and take care of these kinds of conditions in pregnancy,” says Dr. Francis in her video.Pregnant moms know that suffering a miscarriage is different from choosing to abort your baby. And everyone from Planned Parenthood to pro-life doctors knows that providing life-saving care in a medical emergency is not the same thing as aborting a baby. In both cases, the intent is to treat the mother, not end the baby’s life. Stop the Lies As we all figure out the landscape of a post-Roe America, it’s harmful to lie to women about the care available to them in an emergency. State officials and physicians alike agree that pregnancy emergencies are not abortions, and treatment for them should never be restricted.Media figures like Halsey and other abortion advocates who peddle this claim are playing on the fears of women, and they should be called out for it, especially since it is the modus operandi of many in the pro-abortion lobby. What our nation needs, now that states can at last determine their own policies on abortion, is a factually grounded conversation about women’s health care. Abortion was never health care, and that should be more clear than ever.

"320",320,"Why Do The Media Keep Helping Nancy Pelosi Avoid Abortion Questions?","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-10-02"," Luke Russert, a journalist with NBC News, tweeted the following yesterday: A conservative journo asked Pelosi abt what constitutes a baby being alive: Pelosi, “I’m a mother of 5, I think I know more abt this than u”
Luke Russert (@LukeRussert) October 1, 2015  I’m not sure why there was the need to qualify journalist (or “journo”) with conservative, here, but it does highlight the fact that liberal journalists such as Russert seem incapable of asking pro-choice politicians even slightly challenging questions about ending human lives after those human lives have begun.  Asking Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a hardline defender of the practice of killing unborn children even in the latest stages of development in the womb (she calls late-term abortion “sacred ground“), what constitutes a baby being alive is a question any journalist should ask, and not just conservative ones. Journalists love asking tough questions about abortion … so long as the recipient of those questions is pro-life. Journalists love asking tough questions about abortion … so long as the recipient of those questions is pro-life. When the politician is pro-choice, they just can’t imagine even the first question you might ask. That’s because, it seems more than safe to say given the last two months of deferential coverage of Planned Parenthood, they are pretty big fans of abortion themselves. For just one recent example of this, see how the media completely censored an independent report showing that the videos about Planned Parenthood’s human organ trafficking were not deceptively edited. This just weeks after running hundreds of stories on a Planned Parenthood-commissioned report from a Democratic opposition research firm saying otherwise. In any case, deflecting the question about what constitutes a baby being alive with a statement about how many children she has should not be treated as totes awesome, y’all, as Russert and other journalists did. It should result in follow-up questions from other reporters who should treat abortion as a serious policy issue requiring tough questioning.  Or note this triumphant tweet from The Hill: WATCH: Pelosi shuts down reporter on abortion: ""I know more about this subject than you"" http://t.co/gI8iX8j68z pic.twitter.com/NttjIlBMhRThe Hill (@thehill) October 2, 2015  By “shuts down” they mean, of course, “could not answer.” From this exchange, the Washington Post wrung a piece headlined:  I screencapped it so that if they develop any shame and change it, like they did this piece of pro-Planned Parenthood puffery by Amber Phillips, we’ll have a record. Oh look at that! The URL tells the story of the original headline, but they did, in fact, change the headline, however many hours later. Now it says “Nancy Pelosi shut down a reporter’s abortion question in a press conference.”  This piece, by Kelsey Snell, seems to view asking reasonable questions of pro-choice politicians as something that journalists should not do. Snell doesn’t know enough to tell us the name of the journalist asking the question, but she does, somehow, know that he or she is an “abortion protester.” Except, as the correction to her piece now admits, she didn’t know the reporter was an abortion protester. He wasn’t. She just assumed, I guess, since all the journalists in the mainstream outlets are so supportive of abortion and wouldn’t dare ask a question that casts even a moment of skepticism on the practice, that he must be a “protester.” The original story began: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was not interested in entertaining questions Thursday from an anti-abortion protester who shouted a question to the California Democrat during her weekly press conference.
The brief exchange came as Pelosi answered questions about a long-term budget and spending bill. The protester sat in the first row of the presser and spoke up over several other reporters vying to ask a question of the Democratic leader. It was unclear who the questioner was and for which news organization they worked. “Protester?” “Shouted?” Simmer down, Snell. Asking tough questions and being tenacious is called journalism. And the reporter, Sam Dorman of CNS, was credentialed and was asking completely on-point and important questions about the most important human rights issue in the country. See, reporters haven’t been covering the story, but Planned Parenthood has been shown — repeatedly — to believe that the human lives they end have monetary value in the form of the body parts that can be gleaned from abortions. And Planned Parenthood, which is not only a massive supporter of the Democratic Party, is a recipient of $500 million in taxpayer funds annually. Just because many in the media love Planned Parenthood and love abortion with a passion that is truly intense doesn’t mean that they should completely lose all journalistic credibility in devotion of same. The reporter asked: “In reference to funding for Planned Parenthood: Is an unborn baby with a human heart and a human liver a human being?” How can the humanity of the organs be so obvious and repeatedly affirmed by Planned Parenthood officials but the humanity of the life that was ended to get them be in question? See, throughout those videos that the media refuse to cover, Planned Parenthood officials talk about the human hearts and the human livers that are so valuable to the purchasers of said organs. So an unborn baby (say “fetus,” a Latin word we use, if that helps you work through this question) has a human heart and a human liver, is it a human being? How can the humanity of the organs be so obvious and repeatedly affirmed by Planned Parenthood officials but the humanity of the life that was ended to get them be in question? That’s kind of the entire point of these Planned Parenthood videos. It’s actually a really good question, albeit one well beyond a press corps obsessed with not covering the videos. Pelosi said, “Why don’t you take your ideological questions–I don’t, I don’t have—.” And then she offered the testimony about being a mother (Hey! So am I! And it’s awesome! It also has absolutely nothing to do with the reporter’s question!). She finally said, “And I do not intend to respond to your questions, which have no basis in what public policy is that we do here.” Yes, everyone knows that the question of whether we should help subsidize Planned Parenthood while it ends 330,000 human lives after they’ve begun, followed by chopping up those bodies for parts for sale, has “no basis” in the “public policy” we do here. Nosiree. Oh wait. The opposite. The question is, though, why do reporters think they need to be so supportive of Pelosi avoiding answering these questions? But why do reporters think they need to be so supportive of Pelosi avoiding answering these questions? I linked above to a report of Pelosi saying that late-term abortion is “sacred ground.” Nevermind that Pelosi’s support of abortion all the way to the birth canal is a very radical position outside of the Democratic Party and American newsrooms. Late-term abortion is deeply unpopular in this country and mostly unheard of in the rest of the civilized world. She gave that answer when a reporter asked her to explain the moral difference between what Kermit Gosnell did to babies born alive vs. aborting those same infants moments before birth. But the most fascinating part of the exchange with the reporter and Pelosi is how reporters erupted in laughter at her first deflection. Here’s video confirmation of what I’m talking about:  Around 40 seconds into the video, you hear reporters erupt with laughter in support of Pelosi. I’m sure it will shock you to learn that Jeremy Peters of the New York Times, who covers politics in the Washington bureau of the news paper, is one of the ones guffawing. It will shock you even more to learn that Russert was another one of the liberal bro journalists to bust a gut. Why in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks should a “reporter” be laughing at Pelosi’s attempt to skirt a tough question about abortion? That’s simply not journalism. Neither is Russert’s supportive tweet mentioning Pelosi’s standard statement when asked tough questions about abortion (“I’m the best Catholic in the world and I had babies. No follow-ups.”). Neither is Snell’s denigration of the reporter as an “abortion protester.” If you can’t think of about 25 follow-up questions to one of the most powerful pro-choice politicians in the country when she repeats her line about her religion and uterus for the hundredth time, you are a bad journalist. Stop your laughing. Stop your stupid praise-tweets. Stop your erroneous stories that allow politicians on only one side of the aisle to get away with avoiding tough questions. Start doing some journalism. ","https://thefederalist.com/2015/10/02/why-do-the-media-keep-helping-nancy-pelosi-avoid-abortion-questions/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"321",321,"YouTube Suspends Abortion Pill Reversal Explainers As ‘Harmful,’ ‘Dangerous’ Content","White","Danielle",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-05-02"," Last week, YouTube suspended the Abortion Pill Reversal (APR) account for “repeated or severe violations of [the] Community Guidelines.” Four videos were posted to the account. The “offending” videos included one webinar explaining APR in scientific and medical terms. The remaining three told the stories of women who chose life for their babies using the APR protocol. Below is one of the videos YouTube deemed “harmful or dangerous.”


Citing its policies on “harmful or dangerous content,” YouTube opted to suspend the APR account entirely, explaining that it “doesn’t allow content that encourages or promotes violent or dangerous acts that have an inherent risk of serious physical harm or death.” Examples of videos that violate this policy are videos about “instructional bomb making, choking games, hard drug use, or other acts where serious injury may result.”
The move comes mere weeks after a new study found the abortion pill reversal protocol is both safe and effective for women who change their mind after beginning a chemical abortion. The study, which followed 754 women who wanted to stop their in-progress chemical abortions, reported a 68 percent success rate in reversing the effects of mifepristone, the first pill in the two-part chemical abortion process.
The APR protocol involves administering progesterone to counteract the first abortion pill. Progesterone, a natural hormone, is Food and Drug Administration-approved and has been used to prevent miscarriage since the 1950s. Since 2007, more than 500 women have used the APR protocol to save their babies from chemical abortion. Today, the protocol is backed by a network of 350 medical providers.
Heartbeat International, which took the reins of the APR Network and Hotline (1-877-558-0333) just weeks ago, has begun the formal appeal process with YouTube. Heartbeat is no stranger to efforts to silence the life-saving APR message. Despite its safety and efficacy, the protocol has come under fire from abortion advocates, who oppose a woman’s right to choose not to finish an unwanted abortion. Since early 2016, Heartbeat International has successfully defeated multiple efforts by California bureaucrats to prevent nurses from learning about the life-saving protocol.
“It’s hard to understand why YouTube would treat the rescuing of babies from an abortion pill the same as terrorism videos,” said Jor-El Godsey, president of Heartbeat International. “On closer investigation, we believe YouTube will find that these videos in no way resemble such dangerous or harmful content.”
Since the protocol’s inception in 2007, abortion advocates have derided it as “junk science,” even though some doctors who support abortion acknowledge that abortion pill reversal is built upon a sound scientific foundation. Speaking with The New York Times this July, for instance, Yale School of Medicine’s Dr. Harvey Kliman said the protocol “makes biological sense,” and went as far as to say he would recommend the treatment to his own daughter.
Although abortion pill reversal is credited with saving hundreds of lives, Planned Parenthood, the world’s most aggressive and largest provider of abortion, still has its YouTube account.
Heartbeat International initiated YouTube’s formal appeal process on April 30. They are hopeful that, rather than taking sides in the abortion debate, YouTube’s decision was a mistake.
“We are confident that YouTube did not intend to silence a woman who was merely telling her own abortion story, simply because that story ended with a healthy baby boy,” said Godsey. “We look forward to the account being restored quickly.”

"322",322,"Lawsuit Could Force The FDA To Rescind Approval Of Abortion Pills That Endanger Mom And Baby Alike","Corso","Sophia",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-11-23"," Thanks to the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, pro-life protections in states around the country have led dozens of abortion facilities to close their doors. But the pro-abortion industry is working overtime to fill the gap with another version of the deadly atrocity: the abortion pill. Even though the abortion pill delivers a painful death to unborn babies and also poses significant risks to mothers, it’s still approved by U.S. health officials. But that needs to change, argues a new lawsuit.  Four pro-life medical organizations and four doctors filed a lawsuit in a Texas federal court last week against the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Department of Health and Human Services to reverse the approval of the abortion pill called mifepristone, which currently allows mothers to kill their unborn child up through the 10th week of pregnancy. They are represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, which also played a key role in the Dobbs case. “[T]he FDA failed America’s women and girls when it chose politics over science and approved chemical abortion drugs for use in the United States,” the complaint states. “And it has continued to fail them by repeatedly removing even the most basic precautionary requirements associated with their use.” As The Wall Street Journal summarized, the lawsuit argues that “the FDA exceeded its authority to approve the drug because the agency used a process meant for treatments of serious or life-threatening illnesses, and there wasn’t scientific evidence to support the approval and other decisions.” When a woman takes an abortion pill, commonly known as a chemical abortion, she first takes mifepristone to stop him from receiving nutrients, consequently starving him. Then, the mother takes misoprostol, “which induces contractions to expel the dead or dying child,” as Tara Sander Lee and Michael Valley explained in these pages. The pill is not treating “serious or life-threatening illnesses,” but by approving it, the FDA has rubber-stamped the murder of unborn children throughout the nation.  While pro-abortion circles push the narrative that the pill designed to end the life of an unborn child is “safe and effective,” multiple reports point to the opposite conclusion. In a study meant to analyze abortion pill reversal, researchers actually had to halt the study due to “safety concerns” for those who did not take the reversal medication, progesterone, after taking mifepristone. Forty percent of the women who took the abortion pill “and did not take progesterone, required emergency surgery, and one required a transfusion.” Additional data points to, as The Federalist’s Jordan Boyd reported last year, a “500 percent increase in emergency room visits due to complications with chemical abortions”–the antithesis of what abortion proponents would describe as “safe.” And the FDA itself has admitted that the approved abortion pill is deadly. Updated data from the FDA concluded there have been at least 26 reported deaths of women as of June 30, 2021 “associated with mifepristone since the product was approved in September 2000, including two cases of ectopic pregnancy.” To make matters worse, the FDA under the Biden administration decided last December that women are no longer required to visit a physician in person to receive their abortion pills but instead can get the prescription from a supplier through a telemedicine appointment– all under the guise of Covid.  Dr. Ingrid Skop, senior fellow and director of medical affairs at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, knows the harmful realities of the abortion pill all too well, after having operated on at least a dozen women who had abortion pill-related complications. “I’ve cared for several women who took mifepristone and misoprostol and required blood transfusions or treatment for severe infections,” she said. “And I’ve counseled women who experienced significant emotional distress after viewing the body of their easily identifiable child in the toilet.” That’s not a scenario the FDA should be recommending to women, the lawsuit contends — much less allowing them (or, in some cases, abusers who might secretly slip them the drug to end an unwanted pregnancy) to order such a disastrous outcome over the phone.

"323",323,"Supreme Court Hears Challenge To FDA’s ‘Reckless’ Approval Of ‘Unsafe’ Mail-Order Abortion","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-03-26"," The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Tuesday about a drug regimen responsible for more than half of the nation’s abortions. The justices are tasked with determining whether to let a decision from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found the Food and Drug Administration likely violated the law when it approved the abortion pill for mail order and other expansions stand.



U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar introduced the case by claiming that the plaintiffs, a coalition of pro-life medical professionals, had no standing to bring it.



Federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk previously established that the plaintiffs had standing based on their own experiences and on behalf of their patients. As Federalist Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland noted in her analysis of his ruling, “The Supreme Court has allowed abortion doctors to represent the interests of women seeking abortions, notwithstanding the conflict of interest between the two — with the abortionists often seeking to scrap laws designed to protect their patients.”



When pressed by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, however, Prelogar could not name anyone, including pro-life doctors, states, and women harmed by the drug, who the government believed would have judicial recourse to sue the FDA over the abortion pill. 



“So your argument here is that it doesn’t matter if the FDA flagrantly violated the law, didn’t do what it should have done, endangered the health of women, it’s just too bad? Nobody can sue in court? There’s no remedy — the American people have no remedy for that?” Alito asked. 



“Well, I think that it would be wrong to suggest that if the FDA had made a mistake and a drug were actually producing safety consequences that there was nothing to be done,” Prelogar replied.



She concluded that Alito’s suggestion that “unsafe drugs could somehow remain on the market” is “incorrect,” despite data showing mifepristone is responsible for a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits for complications such as hemorrhage, “fast, weak pulse,” “shortness of breath,” diarrhea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, and “pain” across the back, arms, neck, and abdomen, and a myriad of other risks. Even the FDA admits in the mifepristone label that 1 in 25 women who down the drug will end up in the hospital.



The justices’ question-and-answer volley over standing quickly devolved into a debate about conscience objections.



Prelogar, representing the most hostile administration to conscience objections regarding abortion, repeatedly argued that medical professionals, even those who work in emergency rooms, have the federally guaranteed space to abstain from aiding or abetting a chemical abortion.



As Roger Severino, the Trump-era director of the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, noted, however, President Joe Biden has not only worked overtime to undo these protections, but his Department of Justice has also refused to pursue legal recourse for healthcare workers whose conscience rights were verifiably violated.



Erin Hawley, the Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel representing the plaintiffs, repeatedly noted that even pro-life doctors like OB-GYNs Ingrid Skop and Christina Francis, who register their conscience objections ahead of time, could face emergencies hampering their ability to object to continuing a chemically-induced abortion.



“The FDA’s decision to weaken commonsense safeguards, removing doctors from the process, shows they prioritize ending unborn life over the health and safety of women. As a practicing OB-GYN with over 30 years of experience, I have seen how abortion drugs have harmed my patients, both mothers and their unborn children. I have cared for many of these women in the ER, even though abortion advocates pretend they don’t exist. Their stories must be heard, but abortion advocates, working with corporate media, have gaslighted them into silence. I hope the Supreme Court holds the FDA accountable for their reckless actions,” Skop said in a statement.



Yet, Democratic-nominated justices continually dismissed these concerns. Justice Sonya Sotomayor even implied that because the risk of harm for doctors like Skop and Francis is so “infinitesimally small,” their objections are not necessarily relevant to the case.



A Two-Decade Fight



Prelogar concluded oral arguments by claiming that the case against the FDA “harms the agency,” “harms the pharmaceutical industry,” and “harms women who need access to medication abortion.” Her conclusion that the FDA’s approval alone means mifepristone is “safe and effective,” however, is not present in data about the drug. 



For more than two decades, pro-life doctors repeatedly asked the FDA to repeal its approval of chemical abortion drugs because the agency used accelerated drug approval authority to fast-track pills that can cause dangerous and sometimes fatal complications. The FDA repeatedly stonewalled petitioners’ requests despite its legal obligation to address concerns.



The FDA claims to limit the pill use to 70 days gestation. Yet, it does not require prescribers to conduct an ultrasound verifying the unborn baby’s age or location in the woman’s body, leaving some patients with ectopic pregnancy more susceptible to complications.




About 1 in 50 pregnancies are ectopic. Our doctors should be able to screen and serve their patients for serious issues and complications like this before prescribing drugs. #FDAdoyourjob and recognize that #WomensHealthMatters pic.twitter.com/p975PiL2Ig— AAPLOG (@aaplog) March 26, 2024
Thanks to the radically relaxed policies introduced at the bidding of the Biden administration and the manufacturer of mifepristone Danco Laboratories, the drug regimen is readily available via mail order and sale in pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS and could easily be obtained by women well beyond that 70-day limit.



Under the Biden administration, the FDA quietly modified its already debated regulation to accommodate the White House’s post-Roe activism and open the door for the nation’s pharmacies to become abortion pill dispensaries. That was after it permanently allowed abortion pills via mail in 2021.






Before that, under the Obama administration in 2016, the FDA expanded when girls and women could take the pill, changed its dosing, reduced the required number of doctor visits to obtain the drug, allowed more people than licensed doctors to prescribe the pill, and eradicated reporting standards for non-fatal complications from the pills.



Just a few weeks after the court faced threats from Biden over its latest abortion decision, New York’s Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul publicly attempted shortly before Tuesday’s arguments to sway justices away from siding with the plaintiffs in the abortion pill case. 



“Don’t underestimate the rage of women in this country. They will march; they will take to the streets; they will protest and there will be electoral consequences,” Hochul claimed

"324",324,"Supreme Court Reinforces Role As National Abortion Control Board","Paprocki","Anna",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-06-29"," This week, five justices on the Supreme Court announced they have every intention of continuing to legislate from the bench about important social issues, especially abortion. Ditching separation of powers in favor of designating themselves as the one-stop-shop for abortion rules, they also proved they take their political cues from the abortion industry. The result of their controversial decision to strike down duly enacted health and safety standards for abortion clinics is clearly a lowered standard of care for women seeking abortions in Texas. What remains to be seen is how the court’s most recent iteration of its already muddled “undue burden” standards impacts the ability of all 50 states to enact and enforce medically appropriate health and safety requirements.  The court’s opinion in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt troublingly suggests that any language from its prior cases indicating states can regulate abortion to best protect maternal health are merely “feel-good” statements. The real sham against women is the court’s false promises of protection. ‘Undue Burden’ Is Whatever We Think It Is While the court recites language from the 1973 case Roe v. Wade that states have a legitimate interest “in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient,” it quickly caveats that “maximum safety” guarantee with a big “but”: its 1992 plurality decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Casey, the Supreme Court held that laws that admittedly further the states’ valid interest—the legitimate end of maximum patient safety—may be deemed unconstitutional if the court decides the law imposes an “undue burden” or in other words “has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of the woman’s choice.” This unique-to-abortion “undue burden” standard the court created in Casey has been rightly criticized since its inception. Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissent in Casey shrewdly foreshadowed that “the joint opinion’s verbal shell game will conceal raw judicial policy choices concerning what is ‘appropriate’ abortion legislation.” This week’s opinion takes the “undue burden” language to new heights of malleability for courts to engage in future legislative power grabs. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas describes “[w]hatever scrutiny the majority applies to Texas’ law, it bears little resemblance to the undue-burden test the Court articulated in [Casey] and its successors.”  Significantly, the court retreated from the deferential standard it gave Congress in Gonzales v. Carhart: a 2007 opinion written by Justice Kennedy that upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortion. It rejected the idea that it meant to put any constraints on its own policy-making, baldly stating that “[t]he statement that legislatures, and not courts, must resolve questions of medical uncertainty is also inconsistent with this Court’s case law.” In other words, the Supreme Court insists on remaining the National Abortion Control Board. It can and will substitute its preferred policy judgment whenever and however it wants. Bad People Will Ignore Safety Laws, So Why Bother The Hellerstedt decision was rife with the court’s substitution of its judgment for that of Texas policymakers. Contrary to the consistent testimony in the legislative record, the Supreme Court held there was a “virtual absence of any health benefit” for the health and safety laws. The court also dangerously rested its “undue burden” judgment on whether an abortion regulation interferes with mere access to abortion clinics or threatens the number of clinics in the state. Notably, “fewer doctors, longer waiting times, and increased crowding”—the rationale the court offered Monday—are all true when predatory providers, such as convicted abortionist Kermit Gosnell, close. Clearly, shoddy, substandard, and incompetent abortionists provide mere “access” to abortion. The court paid lip service to the problem of dangerous abortionists that the Gosnell trial highlighted. It acknowledged that “Gosnell’s behavior was terribly wrong.” However, it bizarrely concluded that “[d]etermined wrongdoers, already ignoring existing statutes and safety measures, are unlikely to be convinced to adopt safe practices by a new overlay of regulations.”  Deterrence is only one purpose of the law. Moreover, the argument that “bad people do bad things, therefore we cannot enhance our laws” is utterly absurd. It is hard to imagine the court would seriously consider such an argument against otherwise-permissible regulation of guns. The court’s abortion distortion is, of course, not new. Monday’s decision, as Justice Thomas notes in dissent, “exemplifies the Court’s troubling tendency ‘to bend the rules when any effort to limit abortion, or even to speak in opposition to abortion, is at issue.’” There is no perceptible silver lining to today’s decision, but the pro-life movement has always been resilient and resourceful. Despite today’s troublesome opinion, the pro-life community will remain committed to protecting the lives of both mothers and their babies.

"325",325,"Congressional Republicans Need To Stop Hiding And Start Fighting On Abortion","Mangold-Lenett","Samuel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-01-22"," Amid high-profile losses at the ballot box since the overturning of Roe, it’s becoming increasingly clear that people seeking to protect the rights of the unborn need to get serious about the unbalanced nature of American politics.



At the 51st annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., enthusiasm for protecting the rights of the unborn was tangible. Thousands of young people were in attendance, with some accurately describing the moment as a “spiritual battle” and “civil rights issue of our lifetimes.” Yet what is being done to effectively hinder the slaughter of the unborn?



Other than waxing poetic about America’s “national creed” and “speak[ing] the truth in love,” as he did at the March for Life, what has Speaker Mike Johnson done to advance life-saving policies in the House? What have Senate Republicans done other than kneecap Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s protest of the Pentagon’s illegal policy subsidizing military members’ travel to receive abortions?



Besides endlessly investigating government weaponization, they’re doing nothing of significance. Congressional Republicans have so far refused to push back in any meaningful way on the left’s anti-life radicalism, opting to fund Democrats’ spending requests instead and sabotage one of the few people in the Senate working to protect the unborn and raise awareness of the federal government’s illegal support for killing them.



Yes, some Republican officials in both chambers have tried several times to pass legislation protecting the unborn, but those fall flat due to lack of support. Their Democrat colleagues, on the other hand, frequently pass widely unpopular policies. Congressional Democrats ruthlessly pursue their goals through the negotiation process, ensuring the satisfaction of their base. Republicans don’t.



Most Republicans at the national level appear unfazed by the federal government’s persecution of pro-life activists and unwilling to take a stand on the ever-expanding abortion industry. The median voter may be ambivalent about abortion, but the Republican base most certainly is not.



Short of restricting and banning abortion, Republicans can do more to support life issues. Currently, congressional Republicans have the power to protect the rights of health care providers to not perform abortions against their consciences, strip funding from federal agencies that fund groups such as Planned Parenthood, and support colleagues like Tuberville when they stand against illegal abortion subsidization. This can all be accomplished now, but Republicans refuse to act despite the demands of their supporters. (Perhaps their inaction and routine capitulation betray their apathy.)



Subsequently, actual work protecting pro-life interests has been largely forfeitted to activists and private organizations.



Solidarity HealthShare is a health care-sharing ministry that, according to its website, “provides an alternative way to fund health care costs while protecting and practicing” its network’s Catholic beliefs. Its cofounder Chris Faddis spoke to The Federalist about the issues facing pro-life doctors under the Biden administration. The American Board of Obstrecis and Gynecology “that credentials OB-GYNs came out and said that doctors who speak out against abortion or the abortion pill should be should have their licenses removed” right after the Dobbs decision, he said.



The federal government is not just on board with this but accelerating it. The Biden administration is forcing so-called “non-discrimination rules, which would include abortion services and gender services, [that] would force doctors, hospitals, medical professionals, and clinics to participate in all of these practices, or they won’t receive government funding. They won’t be able to participate in Medicare,” Faddis pointed out.



Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told The Federalist the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is trying to “require doctors in emergency rooms to perform elective abortions, which was never a part of the EMTALA regulation.”



Faddis and Francis’ organizations work to provide tangible solutions for pro-life Americans while elected Republicans twiddle their thumbs. This is why many are turning to state legislatures for results.



March for Life president Jeanne Mancini told The Federalist her organization was “laser-focused on growing our state [outreach and March for Life programs]” to educate more voters about the gruesome reality of abortion.



“We’ve had a lot of states enact [before 20-week bans], which they couldn’t do under the Roe regime. But we’ve had our fair share of losses, too,” she said.



Despite lamenting the left’s deceptive use of language to push abortion ballot referendums, Mancini remained adamant that “abortion is such a winning issue” and suggested Republicans need to hone their abortion messaging. 



“There are so many positive ways to message about it … what we’ve seen in elections is that when candidates seem kind of nominal about this, so they bury their heads in the sand, and they don’t win. But when they lean into this, they’re competent, and they know what they’re speaking about, we win. So my advice would be to lean into [the abortion argument].”



Political action at the state level is effective at protecting the unborn. 



“The overturning of Roe gave us the opportunity to really advocate for our position and bring people to our side. Instead of relying on the heavy hand of the judiciary prohibiting our ability to move the limits on abortion, now we can really advocate and bring the state legislatures to our side,” said Penny Nance, CEO of Concerned Women for America.



An incredible amount of work still needs to be done. The American people reject Democrats’ abortion extremism, but they too often don’t hear about it.



The most powerful government in the history of the world and its acolytes view abortion with religious fervor. Yes, pro-lifers need to raise awareness about how abortion kills the innocent while harming women, but the federal government and the left’s vast nonprofit apparatus are committed to eroding this awareness and the power of states.



Without meaningful action at the federal level, the abortion industry will continue to grow, and countless more lives will be lost. Red states cannot fight this fight alone.

"326",326,"New York’s New Law Is Abortion’s John C. Calhoun Moment","Sammin","Kyle",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-01-31"," New York’s legislature last week passed a bill that drastically expanded access to late-term abortion in that state. Although ghoulish, it was unsurprising. It fits neatly within the mainstream opinion of the 21st-century Democratic Party. Neither was Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s signature a surprise, since the governor has followed the well-worn path of fake-Catholic Democrats on the subject. Vermont and Virginia are considering similar laws. The shift has been building for some time. The radical fringe that pushes abortion rights has dropped all pretense that abortion has any downsides.  From the “safe, legal, and rare” formulation Hillary Clinton famously pronounced during her husband’s presidency and again offered as recently as 2008, we have somehow arrived at a point where abortion advocates want women to “shout your abortion.” Cuomo decreed that the lights of the state-owned One World Trade Center (née the Freedom Tower) be lit in pink to exclaim the triumph of “women’s rights.” It has become common to compare the fight over abortion to the fight over slavery, and rightly so. Like abortion advocates, slavery supporters based their position on denying the basic human rights of a certain subset of humans. Even when they recognized such people as fully human, they subordinated their human rights to the rights of other, more powerful people. We can learn from the 19th century’s fight for freedom, especially as the fight for life in our own time parallels it in so many ways. Moving from Moderate to Principled As with the debate over abortion, the debate over slavery began in America mostly among moderates. Partly this was because, then as now, the people most deeply harmed by the institution were not consulted. Among the voices that were allowed to be heard, most wanted gradual changes if they wanted changes at all. By the time the Constitution was written, slavery had already declined in the Northern states. Partially this was because their climate and terrain did not lend themselves to the South’s large-scale plantation economies, but there was more to it than that.  Slave owners could still benefit from slavery on a small scale: anyone who had servants could certainly save money by not paying them. But the moral case against slavery was beginning to take hold. Beginning with the 1688 address from the Germantown Quaker Meeting in Philadelphia, there slowly grew a sentiment that enslaving our fellow humans was wrong. This sentiment was not restricted to the North. Much as they enjoyed the fruits of other people’s involuntary labor, the owners of the great estates of the South could not help but see the problem. As Americans fought for their freedom and the natural rights of mankind in the Revolution, only through willful blindness could anyone fail to see that their slaves could turn the same arguments back on them. As in the North, many Southerners favored a gradual emancipation. No drastic changes, as the Quakers and other abolitionists proposed (and as the slaves would certainly have preferred), only a smooth transition away from an economy that nearly all of the Founding Fathers understood was a relic of the past. George Washington typified this view in planning to free his slaves, but only after his and his wife’s death. More typical were slaveowners like Thomas Jefferson who, paraphrasing Suetonius, famously said of slavery, “We have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.” Despite limited action by the remaining slaveholders, the general sentiment even among its supporters was that slavery was a necessary evil that someday would disappear.  From Necessary Evil to ‘Positive Good’ That trajectory toward freedom was not maintained. Part of the reason was economic. Historians used to point to the invention of the cotton gin as the change that made slavery so profitable that slaveowners never again considered giving it up. That is partly true, and other economic changes added to the problem. The closing of the international slave trade in 1808 made existing slaves more valuable, meaning their owners were even more reluctant to let them go free. What would happen after slavery began to concern slaveowners, too. The bloody revolution in Haiti and smaller slave revolts in the United States weighed heavily on their minds. If the people held in bondage were freed and granted equal rights, what would be the fate of those who had unjustly held them in chains for so many generations? At the same time, the traditional justifications for slavery began to wear thin. At one time, Christian slaveholders considered owning Africans to be moral because the slaves were heathens, but by the 1800s most slaves worshiped the same God—often in the same Christian denomination—as their masters, and even had slave preachers spreading the Word. Likewise, claims of Africans’ inherent inferiority could not be taken seriously as black slaves learned trades and performed them at the same level as white tradesmen. By mid-century, the literary and rhetorical accomplishments of ex-slave Frederick Douglass showed that a black man’s mind could be every bit as lively as a white’s. As these justifications faded away, some might have taken it as a reason to end the practice altogether. Instead, a new generation of slavery advocates arose that supported the institution even more than their fathers and grandfathers had. Sen. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina was foremost among these. In 1837, Calhoun gave a speech in the Senate that marked the transition to a new, more aggressive pro-slavery ideology: I hold that in the present state of civilization, where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other physical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, instead of an evil, a good–a positive good. … I may say with truth, that in few countries so much is left to the share of the laborer, and so little exacted from him, or where there is more kind attention paid to him in sickness or infirmities of age. Compare his condition with the tenants of the poor houses in the more civilized portions of Europe–look at the sick, and the old and infirm slave, on one hand, in the midst of his family and friends, under the kind superintending care of his master and mistress, and compare it with the forlorn and wretched condition of the pauper in the poorhouse. A Turning Point in History That phrase—“a positive good”—signaled that Calhoun and others like him were committed to their cause, and no reason, science, or moral suasion would divert them from their chosen path. Slavery advocates now proclaimed the institution as actually superior to any other sort of labor arrangement. They still had Jefferson’s wolf by the ears, but now they liked it just fine and had no intention of letting the wretched thing go. The speech was an inflection point of history. From then on, the debate was irrevocably changed. Advocates of a managed decline of slavery diminished, and pro-slavery fire-eaters gained in prominence. Increased attention to the issue made Northerners more extreme, too. Where many had opposed slavery but been content to ignore it now that it was gone from their backyards, increasing debate and popular literature—including Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”—forced them to confront the hateful thing directly. Once their eyes were opened, many did not like what they saw. The two sides soon had no common ground, and only war would resolve the issue. The parallels to the abortion debate are unmistakable. Although Cuomo lacks Calhoun’s rhetorical skill, his devotion to an unjust cause matches the South Carolinian’s. The #ShoutYourAbortion campaign began in 2015, and in 2019 it has only increased in reach. Abortion’s defenders now see that unholy act as a positive good in the world, not just a necessary evil. The lights of the World Trade Center were a burnt offering to Moloch, a pledge of allegiance to the cause of infanticide. This is abortion’s Calhoun moment. What Now? Comparing abortion to slavery is only meaningful if we can learn something from it. Sadly, the course of the 19th century’s great debate does not foreshadow a simple end to our current dispute. It is a mistake to say that our Civil War was inevitable, but once the Slave Power began to embrace slavery as a positive good, once they began to see it as an end in itself and not merely the means to achieve financial comfort, the two sides were no longer aiming at the same eventual result. A negotiated solution became a lot less likely. With the ancient right to life on one side and the right to abortion invented in the 1970s on the other, there can be no compromise. So it is with the passage of New York’s Reproductive Health Act. That act and the jollification that followed it mark a turning point, just as Calhoun’s speech did. No representative of the Abortion Power anymore wishes to portray their actions as necessary evils. You don’t “shout” something you wish you hadn’t done. You shout in jubilation. At the same time, the pro-life side is not weakening in its resolve. Just as “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” made abolitionists out of the slavery debate’s bystanders, films like “Gosnell: The Trial of America’s Biggest Serial Killer” force moderates to see the true horror of the thing they desperately wish to be indifferent about. Modern science likewise demolishes the dismissive “clump of cells” justification that abortion advocates of the 1970s told themselves to soothe tender consciences. We know now, more than we ever have, that the unborn are living human beings. As they did in Calhoun’s time, the moral workarounds needed to accept injustice are becoming threadbare. Does this mean an armed conflict is inevitable? No, but it does mean that now that the two sides are aiming at different goals, and now that erstwhile moderates are being force to think through their positions and join a side, the idea of a negotiated compromise is unlikely. Many European countries have struck the balance by allowing first-trimester abortions and banning all others, but that is a solution that is more difficult in America because of our rights-based jurisprudence. With the ancient right to life on one side and the right to abortion invented in the 1970s on the other, there can be no compromise. Cuomo’s light show in New York is a signal that the battle is joined. It will not end until one side prevails.

"327",327,"Hillary Needs To Meet More Women Who Have Had Late-Term Abortions","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-24"," “Trump did great. He is going to appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices.” “Hillary spoke to women.” These were sentiments voiced on social media following the latest presidential debate’s exchange on abortion, but as I sat watching, I felt angry and frustrated. The soundbites were filled with the usual lies and certainly missed opportunities. Although Hillary Clinton may have been speaking to women, she certainly did not speak to all women.
I am a post-abortive woman. I minister to women suffering from a past abortion. Our small program serves about 200 new women every year who seek help from the devastation of a past abortion. Most have suffered in silence, alone, because they do not want anyone to know of their abortion. Many of the suffering sat on their couches during the debate waiting for a word spoken to them. Sadly, not one was heard.
The Guttmacher Institute, a former arm of Planned Parenthood, admits at least 10 percent of women who have an abortion are adversely impacted. With 60 million abortions in our country since Roe vs. Wade, even by their standards, millions of women have suffered adversely as a result of abortion. Think about it — we all know someone who is suffering: a relative, a friend, a co‑ worker. We are quite literally surrounded by the walking wounded.
Abortion Is Not a Solution for Women’s Problems
Hillary fed us her usual misinformation and lies, like the familiar rant about late-term abortion being done for the health of the mother. I have worked with many couples who have had late-term abortions, and not once was the abortion for the health of the mother. The devastation they experienced when they realized the reality of what they had done and the lies they were told is appalling. Perhaps Hillary should speak with them.
While she would like to everyone to believe that abortion is a free choice, she does nothing to protect countless women who have been coerced and threatened by boyfriends, husbands, and parents. In fact, she works against any legislation to inform or protect such women. She denies the adverse impact millions of us have experienced and the fact we were lied to and deceived by the abortion industry. I know. I am one of them.
The truth is, Hillary is a pro-abortion extremist. She’s comfortable with termination at any point, for any reason, and would not only continue to support the Planned Parenthood that has been caught on tape harvesting fetuses, but will increase their power and finances if she is elected president.
Don’t Drive People to Justify Their Abortion Choices
Donald Trump missed a great opportunity. While he addressed late-term abortion and the unborn, he said nothing of Planned Parenthood’s harvesting of baby body parts. Nor did he speak to the millions of women out there who sat on their couches listening, or to their friends and families, who will continue to support Roe vs, Wade because in their eyes, not to do so would be judging the people they love who have had abortions.
By saying he would reverse Roe vs. Wade without giving hope of healing or understanding about what drives people to abort, he left such people with no place to go but to Hillary because they need to justify their decision if there is no way out of the pain. There is a huge disconnect and lack of understanding in our society regarding the very real fallout from abortion. Most Americans do not know the truth and sadly, the only voices that are heard are the extremes.
Yes, Trump said he would appoint Supreme Court Justices to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but without speaking to the hearts of the millions out there who suffer and feel judged and alone, and the people who love them, they were left feeling like the abortion extremists want them to feel in order to get their votes.
Hillary spoke to some women, but not all. She clearly supports killing the unborn during all nine months of pregnancy and Planned Parenthood, an organization that lies and exploits women and sells baby parts. Sadly, no matter how I look at it, I think we all lose this election regarding abortion—especially women and babies.

Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights (OURR), the pro-abortion campaign behind this ballot initiative, has received millions of dollars in financial support to do so from national, out-of-state organizations.



According to NBC4, OURR has “raised more than $39.2 million this year through mid-October and spent $26.2 million,” including more than $20 million in expenses for digital and broadcast advertisements favoring the ballot initiative.



This includes multimillion-dollar donations from prominent groups such as the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a leftist group based in Washington, D.C., that works to “advanc[e] equity and racial justice” and “[confront] climate change,” which donated $5.3 million. Open Society Policy Center, a lobbying group connected to leftist billionaire philanthropist George Soros, donated $3.5 million to the campaign.



Other donations include $2.2 million from the ACLU, $2.2 million from The Fairness Project, $1.5 million from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and $1.5 million from Oklahoma billionaire Lynn Schusterman of the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation.



OURR has received donations from other individuals, including New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who donated $1 million back in September. Oklahoma billionaire Gwendolyn Sontheim, Abigail Wexner — the wife of Ohio billionaire Les Wexner — and Gov. Jay Pritzker of Illinois are among the other prominent figures to shell out money for this campaign.



Enshrining Abortion in the State Constitution



So what exactly are these organizations and individuals supporting when they donate to the campaign favoring Issue 1? As The Federalist’s Jordan Boyd explained, this initiative “is a deliberately vague ballot proposal that decrees ‘every individual has a right’ to ‘reproductive decisions’ regardless of age or trimester.”



Some argue that should the proposal pass, Ohio still could “prohibit abortion after fetal viability.” But due to the general language of the proposal, it “nullifies any such limit so long as a doctor deems abortion necessary for a woman’s health, a standard that is left open to interpretation,” Boyd explains.



In other words, these organizations are donating millions of dollars to a campaign pushing for a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion into Ohio’s Constitution, including after viability so long as it’s framed as “necessary for a woman’s health.” 



Intertwined Abortion Network



What’s even more staggering is that these out-of-state donors will not even see Issue 1 on their own ballot come Election Day. As previously mentioned, Sixteen Thirty Fund is based in Washington, D.C., and The Fairness Project, Open Society Policy Center, and the ACLU are based in D.C. and New York too.



Knowing that these groups and individuals are donating millions to a campaign in support of a ballot initiative they will not even vote for shows how intertwined the pro-abortion network is (Kansas experienced the same massive out-of-state funding for a pro-abortion initiative last year). Whether the Ohio proposal passes will not affect their own states’ outlook on abortion.



Groups based in New York are already located where radical abortion policy reigns. As stated plainly on the New York state website, “you can get an abortion up to and including 24 weeks of pregnancy. After 24 weeks, you can still get an abortion if your health or pregnancy is at risk.”



In supporting Issue 1, which would successfully spread this sort of policy to Ohio if passed, these organizations and prominent figures are neglecting to recognize the dignity of the human person that begins at conception. Abortion after viability, under the guise of a doctor’s discretion, violates the right to life preborn children have and brings them to a violent, painful death.



Taking this into consideration, it is up to the pro-life movement to educate those in Ohio — and throughout the nation — on the realities of abortion, the dignity and rights children have in their mother’s womb, and that women facing unplanned pregnancies have a community that will show them true love and support them when they need it most. Through this, accompanied by prayer, we move closer to when ballot proposals like Issue 1 will never see the light of day.

"329",329,"Kansas Supreme Court To Rule On Dismemberment Ban In Important Abortion Case","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-11-02"," As early as tomorrow, the Kansas Supreme Court could issue a decision in an important but widely ignored case, Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt. The named plaintiffs in the case, Herbert Hodes and his daughter Traci Nauser, are two late-term abortionists who sued Kansas’ Attorney General Derek Schmidt following the state’s passage of the Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act in 2015. That law criminalizes abortions performed by dismembering live fetuses and requires doctors to assure “fetal demise” prior to completing a dilation and evacuation abortion, also known as a D&E abortion. A D&E abortion entails a doctor dilating a woman’s cervix, then inserting surgical equipment to grasp and pull the fetus apart, removing the unborn baby piece by piece.  The attack on the Kansas dismemberment ban is but one of four cases pending in the courts. Abortion providers in Alabama challenged that state’s dismemberment ban in federal court, and just one week ago today, district court judge Myron Thompson held the statute violated a woman’s federal constitutional right to an abortion and entered a permanent injunction barring its enforcement. Alabama has 30 days to appeal that decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals recently ordered briefing in Arkansas’s appeal of a lower federal court decision, preliminarily enjoining that state from enforcing its dismemberment ban. And next door in Texas, Attorney General Ken Paxton’s team heads to federal court today when trial begins over the constitutionality of the Lone Star State’s dismemberment abortion ban. The Kansas Case Is Trying to Generate a State Foothold Hodes and Nauser’s challenge to the Kansas dismemberment abortion ban differs from these cases in one significant respect: The plaintiffs who challenged Arkansas, Alabama, and Texas’ laws all filed suit in the federal court system and alleged the state statutes violated their federal constitutional right to abortion under Roe v. Wade and its progeny. Conversely, Hodes and Nauser filed suit in the state court system and presented a claim based solely on their rights under Kansas’s constitution—even though the Kansas Supreme Court has never held that the Kansas constitution guarantees a right to abortion. The abortionists’ litigation tactic was no mere happenstance. Instead, it represents the continuing, and often overlooked, strategy of abortion-rights activists to circumvent the democratic process and seek refuge in the rulings of activist state court judges. Here’s how the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion-rights advocacy organization, put it:  Where the state constitution recognizes rights to privacy or gender equality that are more extensive than those recognized in the federal constitution, state constitutional challenges can provide an effective strategy for defending and expanding reproductive rights. . . . Although claims that state constitutions provide greater protection than the federal constitution are not always successful, this strategy remains an important tool for securing reproductive rights in many states, and may become even more important given the uncertainty over whether the U.S. Supreme Court will continue to weaken the protections afforded by the federal constitution. To date, according to NARAL Pro-Choice America, “15 states’ constitutions provide greater protection of a woman’s right to choose than does the federal constitution.” For example, when abortion activists challenged a Montana law prohibiting physician assistants from performing abortions, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld that law, rejecting a federal constitutional challenge, while the Montana Supreme Court struck the law, concluding it violated the Montana constitution.  While the Kansas Supreme Court could overturn the appellate court decision and uphold the legislative ban on dismemberment abortions, the composition of that seven-justice court makes that outcome unlikely. Former Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, an abortion-rights supporter, appointed four of the justices—enough to declare by fiat that abortion (but not life) is an inalienable natural right. Should a majority of the Kansas Supreme Court follow this predictable course and invent a state constitutional right to abortion, it would decimate the will of the people, who have consistently elected one of the most pro-life and pro-active state legislatures in this country. Sadly, in this case, it would not just be democracy that dies in the dark.

"330",330,"Planned Parenthood Director Who Flipped Pro-Life After Seeing An Abortion Gets Her Own Film","Shepherd","Josh",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-12-18"," Last spring, comedian John Oliver aired a 21-minute exposé about pregnancy help centers on his HBO show “Last Week Tonight.” Such centers have come under fire from national media for offering counseling, ultrasounds, job training, and other free services to needy families. These nonprofit groups encourage couples to keep rather than abort their developing babies in the womb. When Oliver wanted to put a face to the “anti-abortion movement,” as the show termed it, his producers did not look far. They pulled quotes from a speech delivered by Abby Johnson, a best-selling author who often speaks at events to benefit pregnancy centers. The show’s takedown of nonprofit, volunteer-based centers never mentioned her recent career history.  “I really wasn’t bothered by it,” said Johnson in a recent interview. “But I did respond to a lot of nasty emails. With some of them, we actually had real dialogue. One lady really came at me — all the ugly names you can call somebody. I responded by talking about my experience.” Since 2001, she’s gone from an idealistic college student, to a motivated medical professional, to an abortion industry whistleblower. The HBO viewer soon wrote back in an email: “Oh, wow, I didn’t even realize you used to work at Planned Parenthood. I guess you have some credibility after being there for eight years.” Transformation Story Coming to the Big Screen In fall 2001, following a Planned Parenthood student recruitment drive on campus at Texas A&M University, Johnson signed up to be a volunteer abortion facility escort. She joined their full-time staff once completing degrees in psychology and counseling. Her positions at the abortion center in Bryan, Texas included media spokesperson and, by fall of 2009, clinic director. Eight years after first walking in to help women, Johnson abruptly resigned her position at Planned Parenthood after witnessing an ultrasound-guided abortion. Several mainstream media outlets have regarded her with disdain ever since, seeking out any inconsistencies as if the mother of seven were an archenemy.  Attacks grew louder when her memoir released in 2010. Over the past four years, the best-selling book has been developed as a motion picture. Producers announced in September that “Unplanned,” an independent biopic funded in part by conservative activist and My Pillow founder Michael Lindell, will open in theaters on March 22, 2019. Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman, known for the Pure Flix-produced “God’s Not Dead” franchise, adapted her book for the screen and helmed the project. The film stars Ashley Bratcher (“War Room”) as Johnson, along with Robia Scott, Brooks Ryan, Tina Toner, and Emma Elle Roberts. “Unplanned” was shot over 31 days this summer in the small town of Stillwater, Oklahoma. The co-directors teamed up with producers Daryl Lefever and Joe Knopp, whose faith-based March release “I Can Only Imagine” earned $83 million. “Daryl and I filmed ‘Imagine’ in Oklahoma City over a year ago,” said Knopp. “It was a Texas story, and this is a Texas story. The state incentives for filming are better in Oklahoma than in Texas.” Released October, crime drama “Gosnell” was also shot in the Sooner State. This May, select media were invited to the Stillwater film set of “Unplanned,” where directors, actors, and their real-life counterparts such as Johnson shared about the story and its cultural implications. A strict embargo on the project was lifted this fall, following concerns that pro-choice factions would attempt to disrupt the production.  The crew are confident their biopic, filmed on a $6 million budget, will find an audience. “No one in Hollywood has the track record that we have,” said Solomon. “When Daryl joined forces with us, we have a stellar résumé. Studios and investors have spent about 30 million dollars on the ten or so movies we’ve done collectively. Those films went on to make over 300 million dollars.” Interviews reveal how “Unplanned” intends to navigate the most divisive issue in American society. It comes only months after “Gosnell” faced resistance for depicting the abortion industry’s dark side. After earning $3.6 million on a $2 million budget, the true crime drama is slated to hit Netflix in 2019. On set, insights into “Unplanned” came from surprising voices. Their role in Johnson’s story and the movement she champions speak beyond typical movie junket promotion. The Day She Switched Sides When Johnson decided to quit her job as clinic director at Planned Parenthood, she drove a few doors down to a small nonprofit. She had long known this team from a distance. They prayed outside her abortion clinic constantly and often pleaded with women to change their minds. Johnson parked in the back of the small Coalition for Life office, where a volunteer team provided pregnancy tests and counseling. Heather Gardner was at the front desk. (In recounting the story, she withheld some last names due to privacy concerns.) “I saw this flash of red in the window, out of the corner of my eye,” says Gardner. “We knew Abby drove this bright red Mazda. Strictly as a joke, I yelled down the hallway: ‘Hey, I think Abby Johnson just pulled into our parking lot!’ Really, I thought it was a client coming in.” Seconds later, she realized it was no joke when Johnson called from her cell phone and asked to enter the back door. Gardner walked down the hall to her coworker Bobby. “So Abby Johnson is on the phone right now and she really is in our parking lot,” she told him. “She wants to come inside.” He pushed away from his desk at the news and turned to Gardner. “Okay, what did you tell her?” he asked. “I put her on hold — I didn’t know what to say!” “Well, let’s let her in.” They escorted Johnson, still crying and with her scrubs soaked from tears, back to their counseling room. Coalition for Life staff members Shawn Carney and Karen soon joined them as Johnson “spilled her guts for two hours” according to Gardner. She confessed her feelings of guilt about Planned Parenthood’s work, including details of the abortion industry the pro-life advocates had never heard. Although Carney and others embraced the conversion, Gardner was skeptical. “I didn’t believe Abby when she first left the clinic,” she said. “I figured she was a spy, or just trying to pull our leg.” Gardner recalls seeing her coworker Karen write her cell phone number on a slip of paper and give it to Johnson. “I saw her doing that and I thought, ‘You are crazy! What are you doing? She could be totally BS’ing us.’” It took months for Gardner’s concerns to be dispelled, while Johnson and Carney figured out how to find her a job so she could quit. Once Johnson did, she and Carney appeared on a local interview that set off a national media firestorm interested in the story. Facing Media Bias, Then and Now Ironically, slanted reporting kept even Gardner — the former abortion clinic director’s own ad-hoc media scheduler — second-guessing the pro-life conversion Johnson experienced. “At the time, I was still a baby in the pro-life movement and didn’t know about media bias,” said Gardner, who has been with Coalition for Life for now a decade. “I didn’t have preconceived notions about the New York Times or Salon and set up interviews when they called to talk with Abby. Then I would go and read the stories. The one in Salon was a total smear campaign against her and us.” The mainstream media provides air support to increasingly uncivil pro-choice protestors. The narrative Planned Parenthood put forward about Johnson’s experiences caused Gardner’s doubts to resurface. “Is she a Trojan horse — is she lying?” Gardner recalls asking herself. “Because that’s what I’d been thinking this whole time. I didn’t how to refute it.” Months later, joining Johnson on a road trip to a pro-life prayer rally in Houston finally convinced Gardner of her integrity. When the Bryan, Texas clinic closed in 2013, local pro-life advocates shifted. Nonprofit director Shawn Carney ultimately became president of a national pro-life prayer campaign known as 40 Days for Life. The group bought Johnson’s former clinic, which serves as their headquarters. Gardner moved to Austin, where today she leads the Central Texas Coalition for Life. She describes the liberal-leaning region as a “battleground,” and has become keenly aware of how the mainstream media provides air support to increasingly uncivil pro-choice protestors. “As sidewalk counselors, we have a big target on our backs,” said Gardner. “We get attacked all the time, face to face with clinic workers or people flipping us off. It’s a sign of initiation. But the John Oliver hit piece certainly led to an influx of new attacks online.” Her team tracks social media feedback for 20 area pregnancy help centers, and noticed a wave of negative reviews over the past year. One recent campaign, targeting donors of pregnancy centers and claiming to expose deceptive tactics, backfired on pro-choice activists. “Many people doubled down when told to boycott these centers,” she said. “They told activists: ‘We’ve been donating two thousand dollars a month to this group. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. We’re now going to donate four thousand per month.’” Battles Yet To Come As for Johnson, since 2012 she has led And Then There Were None, which assists workers who desire to leave the abortion industry. She considers the nonprofit group based in Round Rock, Texas––about 30 minutes north of Austin––an important part of a multifaceted movement. The ministry has documented stories of 475 former workers (and counting) who, due to their outreach, have left the abortion industry. “What I found disheartening at Planned Parenthood was the only option we provided a woman in crisis was an abortion,” said Johnson on the movie set. “We didn’t do anything to help her get on her feet. In the pro-life movement, we’re focused on life from conception to death. Some groups focus on women who have faced abuse, others on adoption, on the elderly — or on abortion industry workers, as we do.” She defends pro-lifers’ focus on lives in the womb. “If we can’t even bring these children into the world, there’s no hope of actually fixing the crisis a woman is in,” said Johnson. “That just compounds the problems already taking place in her life. Why not help fix the crisis, rather than abort the pregnancy?” After years of research on Johnson, the co-directors enthusiastically praise her work. “They’re getting hundreds of people to leave the abortion industry,” said Solomon. “They say, ‘I know you’re stuck in your job. You come out and we’ll set you up with a new life,’” His co-writer Konzelman finishes the thought. “We’ll pay rent on your apartment. We’ll handle your car note. We’ll give you money for groceries for the months between jobs.” The ministry has documented stories of 475 former workers (and counting) who, due to their outreach, have left the abortion industry. It’s one of many such altruistic efforts to save lives. Yet Johnson hardly expects slanted media coverage of the movement to let up — particularly with “Unplanned” slated for a spring 2019 release nationwide. She believes even “fake news” can raise awareness of what they do. “The reason they continue to go after pregnancy centers is that they are a threat to [pro-choice] beliefs,” concluded Johnson. “In the U.S., we have almost four times the number of pregnancy centers as abortion clinics. Planned Parenthood sees that as a threat to their bottom line, monthly quotas and revenue goals.” “They are going to try to do everything they can to discount the beautiful work these centers are doing.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2018/12/18/planned-parenthood-director-flipped-pro-life-seeing-abortion-gets-film/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"331",331,"Why Abortion Clinics Are Going Out Of Business More Quickly","Payton","Bre",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-02-25"," Abortion clinics across the United States are closing at the quickest rate since 1973. Is this the result of tougher regulations or a shifting industry dynamic?
Since 2011, 162 abortion clinics nationwide have closed or have ceased terminating pregnancies, according to a Bloomberg analysis. Roughly one-third of these clinics were operated by Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, which performed more than 300,000 abortions last year.
Bloomberg attributes this trend to tougher state regulations on abortion. As highlighted in the report, more abortion clinics have closed in Texas than in any other state, due largely to newly enacted laws.
Bloomberg reports that at least 30 have closed since the state enacted regulations requiring abortion clinics to adhere to the same health and safety standards as a hospital. Texas also requires abortionists to have hospital admitting privileges to a nearby emergency room, which means that if something goes wrong, they can get their patient to an ER quickly.
Pro-abortionists are quick to decry these regulations as an organized attempt to limit a woman’s desire for an abortion, claiming that these requirements burden women. However, several women have died or nearly died from botched abortions in clinics that didn’t have competent clinicians, adequate facilities, or sanitary conditions. If these clinics closed because of these regulations, that would mean they had previously been cutting women open without adhering to the same sanitary standards and building codes as a hospital.
BloombergHowever, new regulations aren’t the only reason abortion clinics are closing their doors. As Bloomberg pointed out, about a dozen abortion clinics have closed in California, which is known to be a very liberal state and more abortion friendly than most. In fact, the Golden State has no major types of abortion restrictions, according to the Guttmacher Institute. This means, unlike in many other states, there are no waiting periods, no ER admitting requirements, and no mandated parental involvement for minors seeking abortions.
So why are abortion clinics shutting down in a blue, coastal state like California?
It seems like the business model of the abortion industry is changing. Many of the clinics that have closed in the past five years no longer make enough money to cover expenses. In fact, almost 40 of the clinics that have closed since 2011 cited business or financial reasons for closing. Decreased demand is part of the reason why. Between 2010 to 2014, the abortion rate has dropped by 12 percent.
A closer look at the numbers Bloomberg provided appear to show that abortion clinics are consolidating. About 19 percent of the clinics that closed were located in areas with fewer than 100,000 people. Looking at Bloomberg’s map, it appears that all of the 21 clinics that have opened in recent years are located in urban areas. Planned Parenthood owns three-fourths of these. In short, abortion clinics are moving out of the country and into the city, and most of these are operated by Planned Parenthood.

"332",332,"No You Can’t Keep Your Plan And Yes You Have To Pay For Other People’s Abortions","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-06-04"," How can a government claim to derive its powers “from the consent of the governed” when it deliberately deceives the people whose consent it supposedly requires? The case of a Connecticut family forced to pay a fee to be used to fund others’ elective surgical abortions or face fines under Obamacare is the latest demonstration that the law is a Rube Goldberg machine of impenetrable statutory language designed to confuse. Barth and Abbie Bracy are pro-life Catholics living in Connecticut with their four children. Last fall, like millions of Americans, the family was informed that their health insurance plan was being cancelled “due to requirements of the Affordable Care Act.” But Good News!  If they wanted to avoid thousands of dollars in fines over the next few years and provide for their family’s healthcare they could just purchase a plan on the Connecticut exchange – the vaunted model of how an Obamacare exchange is supposed to function. But when the Bracy family investigated their options they couldn’t find any plan that didn’t both cover elective abortions and require a surcharge solely for that purpose.  As Executive Director of Rhode Island Right to Life, Barth has long warned that some exchanges may offer no plans without elective abortion and that Obamacare secrecy clauses forbid insurers or exchanges from telling customers the truth. Now it is personal. There are no known abortion free plans on the Connecticut exchange. For the Bracys and every other consumer buying plans in Connecticut, this means that in order to buy an Obamacare-compliant exchange plan they will be required to pay a separate surcharge that the insurer must use solely to pay for abortions. There are indications that people seeking coverage on the exchanges in Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wyoming may face the same dilemma. And every exchange (and insurer) is forbidden to answer the very basic questions of many prospective customers: (1) Does this plan cover abortion? And (2) How much would I be paying for others’ abortions? The abortion surcharge is the centerpiece of Obamacare defenders’ claims that the law doesn’t allow taxpayer funding of abortion. While federal subsidies offset the cost for much of the premiums for many Obamacare plans, the insurer must calculate the actuarial value of abortion in the plan and charge a separate surcharge to the insured. That abortion surcharge must be kept in a separate account and used exclusively to pay for abortions. However, the insurer is prohibited from ever disclosing how much the abortion surcharge is. They separate it out behind the curtain, but the customer whose money it is cannot be told how much of their premium goes into the abortion account and how much pays for everything else they actually want coverage for. And all of that deception comes after the exchange and the insurers are prohibited by law from telling a customer up front whether the plan even includes abortion at all.  It has been a successful deception. When Dr. James Dobson recently warned about abortion surcharges he was told by a Fox News interviewer “that didn’t become law.” The confusion is understandable. Even Supreme Court Justices and the Solicitor General have spoken about the possibility of compelled surgical abortion funding as a hypothetical under Obamacare instead of the current reality that it is. What could possibly be the purpose of such an intentionally confusing morass? Obamacare would not be law today if subsidies directly paid for elective surgical abortions. Americans overwhelmingly oppose taxpayer funding of elective abortion. So instead, the law required that anyone with a plan that includes abortion must pay a special surcharge to be used to pay for abortions. But knowing that not only pro-lifers but even others who simply don’t plan to have an abortion wouldn’t willingly pick a plan charging this surcharge over plans without this extra fee, Obamacare’s architects, including the abortionists themselves, wanted it all kept secret. But while abortionists will profit, consumers on both sides of the abortion debate are hurt. Both women looking for an abortion-covering plan and pro-lifers looking to avoid paying for those same abortions are denied the information they seek. The Guttmacher Institute and NPR have both highlighted this problem from the perspective of women looking for abortion plans.  But our “leaders” have decided to keep us in the dark for our greater good. Nancy Pelosi famously said of Obamacare that we had to “pass it to find out what’s in it.” She has been rightly pilloried for such a distorted view of how lawmaking is supposed to work. But it turns out that wasn’t even honest. Pelosi’s intent was a promise that there would be time for detailed reading of the enormous bill after it passed. But that’s cold comfort when the law is crafted specifically to ensure that we do NOT find out what’s in it. Like so many other aspects of the law, the abortion surcharge for Obamacare exchange plans and the related secrecy provisions are like a shell game in which fundamental freedoms are the hidden ball.

"333",333,"Abortion Industry To Supreme Court: Women Don’t Need Safety Standards When Their Wombs Are Being Scraped Out","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-03-06"," On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in its first abortion case since the confirmation of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. While outside the high court Sen. Chuck Schumer stoked the anger of abortion apologists by threatening the newest justices, inside the courtroom the lawyers representing the abortion providers cemented a new reality: that the abortion industry doesn’t want “safe, legal, and rare,”—it wants “unsafe, legally.” That reality became clear in an exchange with Justice Kavanaugh about the Louisiana law under review in June Medical Serv. v. Russo, Sec. LA Dep’t of Health. That law requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.  A lower court had struck the Louisiana law, holding the Supreme Court’s 2016 decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt controlled. That decision held a Texas law requiring abortionists to maintain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic was unconstitutional. But on appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals set aside Hellerstedt, reasoning that unlike the situation in Texas, the Louisiana law would not create an unconstitutional burden on a women’s “right” to abortion. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the abortion providers argued that the Louisiana law, like the Texas law, placed an undue burden on women’s ability to access abortions. But Kavanaugh pushed their attorneys in a different direction: “If a state passed an admitting privileges law there, and suppose a state had ten clinics and two doctors for each clinic, but all 20 doctors could easily get the admitting privileges, so that there would be no effect on the clinics, no effect on the doctors who perform abortions, and, therefore, no effect on the women who obtain abortions,” Justice Kavanaugh hypothesized, “would a law be constitutional in that state?” At first, Julie Rikelman, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights arguing on behalf of the abortionists, deflected: “That law would have no benefit, Your Honor, and it may pose a much harder question than this case.” But when pushed, Rikelman made clear that abortion advocates see no valid purpose for admitting-privilege laws of the kind at issue and thus all similar laws would be unconstitutional. Such an argument is shocking because, as Elizabeth Murrill, the attorney who argued on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, made clear, Louisiana requires doctors who perform a dilation and curettage (D&C) after a miscarriage—a procedure Justice Ruth Ginsburg declared “very much alike” the typical surgical abortion—to have admitting privileges at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of the clinic, unless the doctor held “a residency in the proper scope of care.”  So, while states can and do regulate doctors who perform a D&C following a miscarriage to ensure patients’ safety, abortion advocates maintain similar laws are unconstitutional when the D&C is performed on a woman carrying a still living human being. Yet, as the record in this case shows, such admitting privileges benefit women who suffer complications, such as the patients of Doe 3—one of the unnamed plaintiffs—who testified he had to transfer four patients to a nearby hospital for treatment of punctured uteruses and hemorrhaging. Doe 3, who held admitting privileges, provided the care at the hospitals. Further, if anything, the facts of this case show the state has an even stronger interest in regulating the other abortion doctors involved in this case. For instance, one of the doctors, anonymously named Doe 1, is not an obstetrician or a gynecologist, but a graduate of the Saba University medical school in the Dutch Caribbean, where he studied “Family Medicine and Addiction Medicine,”—although he also has never actually practiced family medicine.” Additionally, “Doe 1 conceded he had no training in abortion practice during his medical school or residency; instead he was principally taught on-the-job by Doe 3.” Doe 3 also “admitted he hired a radiologist and an ophthalmologist to perform abortions.” These are the doctors the abortion industry wants women to see unimpeded by state regulations. No wonder Justice Samuel Alito found it “amazing” that the abortion providers would claim they had standing to challenge the Louisiana law on behalf of the women of the state, when their interests “are directly contrary to those of the—those individuals on whose behalf the plaintiff is claiming to sue, . . ” But, as the liberal justices pointed out during argument, the Supreme Court has long allowed abortion providers to challenge laws regulating abortions on behalf of their patients.  Yet the Supreme Court has never directly addressed whether that should be the case given the conflict in interests at issue. Alito seemed the only justice gravely concerned by this conflict, although Kavanaugh made a passing comment in concurrence of the concern. The remainder of the right-leaning bench stayed silent on the issue of standing. While the right of t he bench remained reticent, clear from oral argument was that the four liberal justices remain in lockstep. And should they lock up one more vote, the abortion providers will score a victory—but it will be a loss to life and to women’s health.

In May, Rusty Lee Thomas, director of OSA, along with 10 determined associates, had chosen to sit down in front of EMW, blocking the entrance to the abortion mill and violating FACE for the first time in over a decade.  Their prompt arrest for trespassing was followed this month by federal charges for 10 of their number (the eleventh, a 17-year-old girl from Virginia, was excluded). Last week’s buffer zone was put in place by District Judge David J. Hale, a battle-tested Democrat and Obama nominee, in order to deter any repeat of OSA’s efforts to physically bar entrance to EMW. The move, however, may have misjudged the nature of OSA’s rally.  Sitting in the back of their nightly gatherings at Evangel World Prayer Center last week, it was hard not to notice the numerical preponderance of families with young children—a five-year-old playing with her father’s big beard, a boy, about seven, climbing his little brother’s stroller, a mother in the back nursing her infant child. Suffice it to say, no attempt was made last week to block entrance to EMW. But other means were used—and are continuing to be used—to make Kentucky the first abortion-free state.  What’s Happening Right Now In Kentucky Seven states, right now, have only one abortion facility: North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia—and Kentucky.  Activists on both sides of the abortion issue have had their eye on these states for some time, knowing full well that if one of them succeeds in shutting down its last abortionist, the national impact would be enormous. In the past six months it has become clear that the battle for the first abortion-free state is going to be fought this year in Kentucky. The reason is mostly a matter of Kentucky’s last two election cycles. In 2015 Matt Bevin was elected governor. Bevin is a strong social conservative with four adopted children in his family of 11, and no hesitation about describing himself as “unapologetically pro-life.” Last year swept in a Republican majority in the state legislature; in the first week of their session (usually used for organizational purposes), it jumped to pass a 20-week abortion ban and an ultrasound requirement. Matt Bevin called it a “no-brainer” and promptly signed them both.  What is more, in the past two years, Bevin’s administration has dogged abortion mills on regulatory laws to the point that every single mill in Kentucky, except the Louisville EMW, has stopped performing abortions.  In fact, if Bevin’s administration had its way, Kentucky would have become abortion-free at the end of March when the Governor ordered EMW to stop performing abortions until it improved its emergency transfer agreements. Kentucky law does, indeed, require abortion mills to have signed agreements with hospitals and ambulance services to ensure the safety of mothers should something go wrong during an operation. But Bevin’s administration is enforcing this rule rigorously, requiring, among other things, that the hospital be within 20 minutes of the clinic and that the ambulance service be in the same county as the clinic. This creates real problems for an abortion mill in a state where many hospitals do not want to associate with “healthcare providers” that specialize in the intentional destruction of human life, and others find themselves under “incredible’ outside pressure” (likely from pro-life groups) not to do so. Stuck in this kind of predicament, EMW ended up suing in federal court, attempting to keep itself open on the argument that it would be unconstitutional for its patients to have to seek care in another state. U.S. Judge Greg Stivers, another Obama appointee, backed EMW up, and temporarily blocked Bevin from enforcing Kentucky law. What Pro-Lifers Hope To Achieve It was at this point—with EMW still operating and a stack of Federal lawsuits working their way through the courts—that Operation Save America decided to sit down in front of the brown brick abortion mill at 2nd and West Market Street. While they had no intention of reviving Operation Rescue, they felt, at the end of much prayer and fasting, that a “line needed to be crossed,” and that the place to step over it was in Kentucky. Thus, they acted, in their capacity as private citizens, with the hope of inspiring Governor Bevin to go toe-to-toe with the federal government on the issue of abortion. Thomas argues that Matt Bevin ought to “interpose” for Kentucky by rejecting Roe v. Wade outright. “On the federal books, it’s against the law to smoke dope,” director Rusty Thomas told Slate, “But what did Colorado do as a state? They told the federal government go pound sand… And then of course you have other states that love sanctuary cities. That’s against the federal government and the laws on the books.” The analogy Thomas draws is not altogether accurate.  There is a large and important difference between refusing to use state police to enforce federal edicts and actively putting people in jail or quarantining their property in defiance of federal court rulings. The former simply recuses the state from enforcing federal law. Federal agents are still allowed to enforce their will insofar as they can do so on their own. The latter (nullification) must involve a direct conflict between federal and state agents in any instance when both arrive at the same clinic—a recipe for civil war. But, leaving aside the debate over nullification vs. passive non-cooperation, there is a strong general sentiment in Kentucky that it’s time to begin pushing back against clearly unlawful acts of judicial legislation like Roe v. Wade.  Matt Bevin has indicated that he holds a favorable view of interposition in private, and Lieutenant Governor Jenean Hampton has espoused it in public—during an election campaign that ended in a comfortable victory. This means that the fight to close Kentucky’s last abortion mill is not likely to end when EMW finds a hospital willing to sign or Judge Greg Stivers discovers a penumbra’s emanation in the shadow of the U.S. Constitution which forbids Kentucky to require transfer agreements of abortion mills. And if the avant garde of the pro-life movement keeps its attention on Kentucky, we could well have our first abortion-free state by 2018.

"335",335,"Watch: Radical Pro-Abortion TikToker Unknowingly Makes Incredible Case For Life","Duffy-Alfonso","Evita",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-09-30"," A pro-abortion TikToker by the name of Paris Glass uploaded a series of three videos discussing the emotional and physical trauma she experienced from recently aborting her unborn child. The videos have since gone viral, garnering more than 5 million views. While the creator intended her TikToks to promote abortion, she actually unintentionally made the greatest case for life by revealing the excruciating physical pain, emotional horror, and agonizing guilt that comes with ending preborn life. 



Glass began the first video by saying “f-ck you” to anyone who would discourage her from divulging the “filthy f-cking details” of her abortion because they want abortion stories to stay a “private matter.” 



“I didn’t know what to expect because nobody told me,” she said. Glass told viewers she decided to open up about her abortion because there is “too much cutesy language surrounding reproductive health.” She wanted to get real so people could “learn,” adding that she particularly wants to educate conservatives because they “literally have no idea how this sh-t works.” 



The ‘Filthy F-cking Details’



Glass divulged in her first video that “within 10 minutes” of taking the abortion-inducing pill, she was “on the toilet sh-tting [her] guts out and vomiting at the same time.” Glass said she was given nausea medication but it did nothing to protect her from the excruciating pain she experienced as her cervix was “forced open,” adding that it was “so bad my body did not know how to react.” “This stage lasted for four hours,” she said.



“…At about the four-hour mark, I feel the lining of my uterus slough off,” Glass stated. She described the following four hours as a cycle of on-and-off pain. “I would go through a cycle of intense unbearable pain,” until “a piece of tissue about the size of a lime [came] out of my body.” Then she’d experience about 15 minutes of relief, and the pain would come back. “Rinse and repeat.”



“I don’t remember a lot of that day because I spent most of it trying not to pass out,” said Glass. “It is one of the most traumatizing things I have ever experienced.

Mental Manipulation



In her second video, Glass admitted she one day wants children, just not now, explaining that she wants to be in an ideal financial situation before having a baby. “I want to give my children no less than the world, and I wouldn’t be able to do that If I had a child this early,” she said. “If I had a baby right now, I would never gain that financial footing.”



Glass presented her abortion as a sort of sacrifice for the sake of her future children. “Absolutely everything I do at this point in my life is with the goal in mind of raising my children to be healthy, functioning, happy adults, and that includes my recent abortion because the quality of life I want for my children would never be attainable if I started having kids now.”



Glass also mocked anyone who would suggest she put her child up for adoption, saying her child would come out “damage[d]” due to medications she’s on, implying that somehow means her baby wouldn’t be adoptable. It’s unlikely Glass knew whether her unborn child had any mental or physical disabilities because birth defect screenings take place as early as 11 weeks and Glass aborted her baby at six weeks. Glass also said a pregnancy would force her “to stop my medications, which would cause me to have chronic seizures and I don’t think that’s great for a pregnancy…” Ultimately, her message was clear: An unhealthy, disabled, or “damaged” baby doesn’t deserve to be raised by her or anyone else. 



“If the quality of life that you want for children — for other human beings — is simply existence,” said Glass, “that is a you problem that you are now making everybody else’s.”



These are odious reasons for someone to abort a child, but Glass’s rhetoric is not original. It strongly echoes the eugenic origins of the so-called reproductive rights movement. During the early 20th century, social Darwinism was gaining momentum and widespread acceptance among American and European elites. Around the same time Adolf Hitler was implementing laws for the sterilization of “defectives,” Margaret Sanger, founder of the largest U.S. abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, was working closely with eugenic leaders to eliminate the offspring of poor and disabled “undesirable” women. 



Sanger wrote over and over that she did not want poor and disabled women to reproduce. In contrast to other eugenicists such as Hitler, however, Sanger sought to achieve her goals not through force but by convincing women to dispose of their own children.




 @glassmenagerie I’m not alone and that means neither are you #roevwade #advocacy #education #queer #humanrights #healthcare #findyourgrace #nourisheveryyou ♬ original sound – Paris Glass  
Glass is a radical progressive who also claims to be an advocate for the “deaf and disabled community” (she herself is deaf). Her leftist ideology, which allegedly emphasizes defending and championing the “underprivileged,” simultaneously provided her with a twisted eugenic justification for her abortion, reaching back to the era of Hitler and Sanger. 



It first appears the irony is lost on Glass, but I don’t think it is. Glass isn’t dumb. She is thinking very deeply about what she has done and trying to process the trauma she experienced. The mental manipulation the left used to justify Glass’s abortion is undeniably difficult for her to admit. Glass can’t fully articulate why, but she’s angry. She’s in pain. And in the last video, she falls apart. 



‘Nothing Could Make Me Hate Myself More’



In the third and final video, Glass said she had to “mentally and emotionally separate [herself] from this pregnancy” because she claims (again) that she somehow knew her baby “wouldn’t have been viable.” 



To cope with the abortion, Glass said she and her partner decided to use humor. “[W]e just mentally decided that it would have popped out a full-grown Republican man with a five o’clock shadow named Dave.” Envisioning her unborn child as someone she hates  — a stereotypical adult Republican man — didn’t work. 



“I was not prepared,” said Glass, “to meet Dave.” She explained that because embryos burrow themselves into a woman’s uterine lining, it took a few days “for the embryo to actually come out.” And when it did, she crumbled. 



“And even though logically I know it’s a clump of cells — it never felt anything — every emotional defense I had crumbled in one second,” Glass confessed. “And that is the moment that I decided to talk about this publicly.” 



Her heartbreaking message continued: “…Nothing and no one can make me hate myself more than I did in that moment.”




 @glassmenagerie You’re not alone #roevwade #advocacy #education #queer #humanrights #healthcare #findyourgrace ♬ original sound – Paris Glass  
It took a lot of maturity for Glass to so vulnerably admit her guilt. That’s why, deep down, I think Glass knows who she’s really mad at, and it’s not conservatives. 



Glass trusted the left. “It’s a clump of cells,” they told her. “It won’t feel anything.” In trusting her own side, Glass was physically traumatized and mentally manipulated into killing her own child. At the end of it all, as she looked her deceased baby in the face, no abortion activists were there to rush to her side and hold her as she fell apart. Glass was alone. 



Her videos inadvertently displayed in powerful detail the gory horror of abortion and the deep betrayal one feels after the fact. Leftists are the ones who don’t want Glass’s story out in the world, even if she doesn’t completely understand why. 



I hope Glass keeps speaking out, though, and maybe even inspires other women to do so too for one simple reason: Truth is the bane of the abortion lobby but the greatest strength of the pro-life movement. That’s why, despite her pro-abortion framing, Glass’s story holds incredible persuasion power for life.

"336",336,"Associated Press Poll Is Corporate Media’s Latest Language-Twisting Exercise In Advancing Abortion Extremism","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-07-14"," Corporate media is not interested in telling Americans the full story — which is why the nation’s trust in outlets remains near record lows and at least half of the country believes the press deliberately misleads them. The media’s flailing track record on abortion polls proves to be no exception. The Associated Press is the latest corporate media outlet to twist abortion poll results in favor of Democrats’ abortion extremism. Its new poll claims that, just one year after the Supreme Court’s landmark Dobbs v. Jackson decision, “most adults still believe that abortion should be legal and most are in favor of Congress guaranteeing access to legal abortion.”  The outlet maintains that “most Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while most Republicans think it should be illegal in most or all cases.” What the AP’s coverage of its survey barely mentions is that a majority of U.S. adults are not on board with Democrats’ radical legalization of abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, despite the left’s incessant attempts to normalize their belief that abortion should be available on demand and taxpayers should fund it. In fact, according to a Gallup poll, slightly more than half of Americans support a 15-week abortion ban like the one Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced last year, not Democrats’ abortion-up-until-birth extremism. Only later in the AP’s article does it admit that Americans are split on whether abortion should be legal at 15 weeks of gestation. That number drops to 27 percent at 24 weeks, mere weeks after viability begins. Despite Americans’ true and consistent feelings about ending life in the womb, something 41 percent of Americans say is morally unacceptable, corporate media use many tactics in polling to advance the left’s abortion agenda. “The media generally frame their coverage in a way that lines up with Democratic messaging, labeling any protections for the unborn as an outright ‘ban,’” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser recently wrote for The Hill. “Even laws that allow for abortions for any reason for five full months get the absurd misnomer ’20-week ban.’ In case they missed it, the dictionary definition of ‘ban’ is ‘to forbid someone to do something.’ In no state are all abortions forbidden. Every state that has enacted life-affirming laws makes some exceptions.”  The same scheming occurs when corporate media refuse to call deadly abortion procedures and policies what they are. In its poll, AP not only circumvents the scientifically proven reality of life in the womb, but it also dehumanizes women by using terms like “pregnant person.”  The AP’s language swaps are a deliberate dilution of the issue designed to distract voters from the real consequences of abortion. Since Dobbs, tens of thousands of unborn babies have been saved. If congressional Democrats, with the help of corporate media, legalize abortion through all nine months, that number would decrease significantly. Not only that, but the majority of Americans who want abortion restricted at least to the first trimester will be overlooked in favor of partisan radicalism.

"337",337,"Abortion Advocates Are Losing. Don’t Give Them A Lifeline","Harsanyi","David",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-05-16"," The case for life is a moral, philosophical, scientific, and political one. The last of these, however, only has traction when the others are persuasive. It’s true that Alabama’s new abortion law takes a philosophically consistent position in establishing the legal personhood of unborn children without exception. Abortion in cases of rape and incest are fraught with questions of personal autonomy and mental anguish, but, if you believe an unborn child is a human being deserving of protection from violence, it’s morally consistent to also believe that one tragedy shouldn’t compound another.  As a political matter, however, the Alabama bill creates a situation that allows pro-abortion advocates to concentrate their pushback on the approximately 0.5 percent of procedures rather than the 99.5 percent. In turn, pro-lifers, now accused of protecting slack-jawed incestuous child rapists, are impelled to make the most challenging arguments about the rarest cases rather than make the most convincing arguments about the most common ones. So while debates over rape and incest exemptions shouldn’t be treated flippantly or dismissed, the Alabama law has given abortion advocates a reprieve from defending the barbaric practice of discarding thousands of viable and near-viable fetuses every year for convenience’s sake. The law itself, as Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey noted when signing, is probably unenforceable, and will almost surely be stopped by the courts. In the worst-case scenario for pro-lifers, the law might even wind up strengthening Roe v. Wade. If your goal is to save lives, not merely make pronouncements, this seems counterproductive—especially considering the fact that abortion advocates have been on the defensive for years. When your opponents are compelled to defend the sale of body parts of unborn children for profit—as gruesome as the situation is—you are winning the debate. When your opponents are forced to support a Virginia governor who describes, in detail, how to commit negligent homicide when a baby survives an abortion attempt, you’re looking down from the higher moral ground.  Nearly every Democratic presidential candidate defended Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, and every one of them opposed a Sen. Ben Sasse bill that offered protection to newborns who were lucky enough to survive abortion attempts. Every Democratic Party presidential hopeful—although, to be fair, there are so many I might be missing someone—also supports unlimited abortion on demand for any reason until the ninth month of pregnancy. (Ask anyone who claims this contention is false to provide you with a single restriction supported by any of these candidates.) These are radical, anti-humanist positions that not only remind us of the eugenicist roots of the progressive movement but are also far outside the mainstream. Nearly every poll—other than those paid for by Planned Parenthood—find that Americans support bans on post-20-week abortions in large numbers. An Washington Post/ABC News poll, for example, found that 56 percent prefer restrictions after 20 weeks over 27 weeks. And though Democrats like to pretend abortion is a patriarchal effort, poll after poll shows that women are just as likely to be pro-life as men. Abortion advocates, more importantly, are also losing to science. And technological advances are intricately connected to the efficacy of the ethical argument. The earliest premature baby to ever survive after delivery was 410 grams, 21 weeks and four days. She’s now a healthy toddler. She won’t be the last. And she won’t be the earliest for long. The survival of every one of these children chips away at the notion that abortion is a victimless process stripped of consequences.  The fact that abortion touches two lives has always been why activists have larded up the debate with misleading euphemisms like “reproductive rights” and “women’s health care.” It’s the reason abortion advocates detest talking about fetal pain and like to use medical terminology to rhetorically anesthetize the procedure and dehumanize the unborn baby. It’s the reason abortion advocates like Alyssa Milano demand the media stop referring to “heartbeat bills” and start calling them “fetal pole cardiac activity bills.” They know nearly every parent who’s listened to an ultrasound of a heartbeat understands what it means. And it’s also the reason abortion advocates want to talk about the 0.5 percent of tragedies, and not the central catastrophe of abortion. Georgia’s “heartbeat bill” and the 20-week bans that have been passed elsewhere move the movement forward in ways the Alabama law does not. While incrementalism might not come naturally to conservatives, especially in this era, it’s worth remembering that, in the end, the way to win the fight is to convince Americans that abortion is morally repugnant. To that end, science and decency are on your side, whether the law is or not.

"338",338,"Why Everyone Should Be Terrified By The GOP’s Abortion Bill Debacle","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-01-22"," Today marks the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court legalizing abortion on demand throughout pregnancy. The pro-life movement commemorates this day with marches, worship services and lobbying for bills to protect unborn children. Pro-lifers were promised by the Republican leaders they just helped elect and re-elect that the House of Representatives would pass a bill today banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, a point after which infants can feel pain and survive if born prematurely. The legislation has been passed by the House in the previous Congress and is extremely popular in national polling. “One of the clearest messages from Gallup trends,” the polling firm reported, “is that Americans oppose late-term abortion.” A Washington Post/ABC survey showed that 64 percent of Americans favor limiting abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy or earlier. When just women were asked, the figure jumped to 71 percent. Such measures are popular among independents and Americans of various income levels.  Quinnipiac even asked detailed questions about the bill last go-around: As you may know, in 2013 the House of Representatives approved legislation that would ban virtually all abortions nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape and incest that are reported to authorities. Would you support or oppose such legislation? Sixty percent of voters said they would support it, while 33 percent said they were opposed. Even Democrats were evenly divided (46 percent to 47 percent) on the question. We’re one of just a small handful of countries, including notorious human rights violators North Korea and China, that allow late-term abortion. And yet somehow the Republicans managed to make a disaster of passing the bill. Instead of passing the legislation and sending it to the Republican-controlled Senate, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act was pulled at the last minute and replaced with a bill that bans taxpayer funding of abortion. What in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks just happened? It takes a special combination of incompetence and cowardice to miss an easy lay-up like this, but apparently the new Republican Congress has it in spades.  Even if you’re not one of the majority of Americans who want to protect these children in the womb, this debacle should concern you. Here are a few reasons why. They don’t have the cojones to fight. If Republicans can’t pass wildly popular legislation protecting innocent unborn children, what’s going to happen when they face difficult legislative battles? It’s best to view this as a very simple test for House Republicans. A test they failed miserably. In an essay at National Affairs, Michael Needham looks at the contrast between the grassroots and party establishment. He talks about the fight over the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a fund for corporate welfare. The establishment fought against the grassroots tooth and nail in order to keep the bank. There have been similar fights over agriculture subsidies and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s influence in the housing market. The moneyed interests fight against the conservative insurgents — and the donor class usually wins. Needham asks: Given the enormous challenges facing the nation, why bother with ""small"" issues like corporate welfare and concomitant insider politics? Why pick these fights with the donor base?

As the Tea Party sees it, if conservatives can't stand up for sound policy on ""easy"" fights like these — despite their relative insignificance compared to issues like entitlement reform — the Republican Party is unlikely to have the fortitude to take on the greatest challenges the country faces. More importantly, any party that contemplates cutting back welfare for needy individuals and families but embraces corporate welfare for the powerful lacks the moral authority to urge sacrifice of any sort. Exactly. How will the Republicans lead the battle to fight against Obamacare if they’re not willing to go against the insurance lobby on even a small issue? Whether the issue is a legitimate campaign against the dehumanization of the unborn, higher education reform or an actual attempt to thwart the growth of the administrative state, a Republican Party unable to accomplish an easy task is a Republican Party that will be completely incompetent and worse than useless in a big battle.  Sabotaging entire movements for nothing Two of the representatives who caused the biggest stink about the bill were Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina and Jackie Walorski of Indiana. Last week, Ellmers said she didn’t think it was a good idea to vote on the legislation so early in the session (an argument that makes no sense, but let’s put that aside). Yesterday the women pulled their sponsorship of the bill over what they said were concerns over the rape reporting requirement. And yet here are both women speaking in favor of this exact same legislation two years ago: Here's Renee Ellmers in 2013 speaking in support of bill identical to one she just helped scuttle https://t.co/hMlY9ZMIwX
John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) January 22, 2015  Here's Jackie Walorski, who withdrew cosponsorship of bill with Ellmers, speaking in support of that bill in 2013 https://t.co/ZMbNRSS7sh
John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) January 22, 2015  These women are claiming to all of a sudden be concerned about the reporting requirement — the requirement that has nearly two-to-one support among voters and the one they had no problem with just a couple of years ago. This reporting requirement would keep late-term abortion doctors like Kermit Gosnell or Leroy Carhart from simply checking a box before going ahead with the procedure. Besides, it’s one thing to seek an exception to abortion laws for victims of rape, and entirely another to think that exception must be extended until the baby exits the birth canal. This bill wouldn’t have a reporting requirement for abortions in the first five months of pregnancy. In fact, even Democrats who think late-term abortion should be legal with no restrictions didn’t make an issue of the reporting requirement in the last two elections. Last year, support for late-term abortion hurt Democratic candidates. But now Ellmers created a controversy where none existed, hereby handing Democrats a way to fight a broadly popular bill. This sabotage of the pro-life movement over what may have been a power struggle happens at a time when many pro-life activists have grown weary of being used by the GOP for electoral victory only to be forgotten weeks later when it’s time to vote. The idea that GOP is a party of moneyed interests posing as a culturally conservative party is, um, not always without empirical support.
Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) January 22, 2015  Pro-lifers aren’t unfamiliar with such betrayals but as more and more grassroots voters are learning that the Republican Party is loyal to corporate interests when it counts while giving weak lipservice to the base when it doesn’t, the rift widens. They have zero public relations skills. It’s not news to anyone that our media are supportive of abortion rights and biased against those who support the rights of the unborn. The media carry quite a bit of water for the pro-choice movement. So, for example, we didn’t see any articles about how radical and extreme — relative to popular opinion — opposition to the bill is. But as soon as Ellmers pulled her stunt, here were the headlines: National Journal: GOP Leaders Pull Abortion Bill After Revolt by Women, Moderates Washington Post: Abortion bill dropped amid concerns of female GOP lawmakers MSNBC: GOP women reject abortion bill, end debate CNN: House GOP leaders cave on abortion bill Politico: GOP stumbles over abortion bill Huffington Post: GOP Congresswomen Get Cold Feet On Anti-Abortion Bill As the kids used to say, “Smooth move, Ex-Lax. What are you going to do for an encore? Gargle peanut butter?” (NB: This made us laugh in the 1980s. I can’t explain.) But seriously, it’s one thing to have to fight a hostile media that loves abortion. It’s entirely another to score a deciding own goal against a weak opponent. Only Republicans could take a bill with two-to-one support and manufacture headlines about it being controversial and opposed by women. As a bonus, these stories include reports that Ellmers was worried about how the bill would play among women and millennials. Want to do better with young voters? Don't botch an issue where they're more on your side than any other age group. #prolife
David Freddoso (@freddoso) January 22, 2015  Newsflash to the geniuses in her policy shop: there are few issues the Republicans can have with as much support, much less as much passionate support. If you’re cowering in fear on popular stuff, what are you going to do when the going gets tough? They have no strategy for everything that needs to be accomplished. It’s hard to tell exactly what caused the breakdown but it’s easy to see the leadership had no coherent strategy for passing this legislation. I don’t care if the folks who fought the bill at the last minute were inventing excuses, had completely legitimate grievances, or were just bored. At some point, it’s the job of leadership to not have hugely embarrassing debacles that destroy goodwill between key constituents and lawmakers. At some point leadership shouldn’t reveal to the world that it couldn’t organize a shoe closet. The job of leadership is to make sure disasters like this don’t happen. If they let it happen on easy legislation that is broadly popular (outside of American newsrooms, at least), what are they going to do when they need to really whip a vote on something unpopular in member districts? If leadership isn’t giving female legislators the authority and influence they seek on this issue, rectify that. But everyone needs to get their act together and to get it together quickly. If this really was just a completely botched power play at the expense of unborn children and their supporters, the people responsible should pay consequences. Names should top a short list of incompetent politicians who should be kindly asked not to run for any office ever again. Those on the short list should be given the full understanding that failure to heed this warning will result in a vigorous primary fight. The leadership needs to fix their internal and external communications and do some remedial training for members who need basic advice such as, “do not shoot yourself in the foot,” and “do not needlessly anger the one group of Americans not livid with us at the moment.” Maybe even, “learn how to do a power play that doesn’t take down your whole party with you.” As my colleague David Harsanyi has noted, we have a Republican Congress that doesn’t believe it’s competent enough to make a case against infanticide.

"339",339,"Why The Abortion Industry Wants To Ban Funerals For Miscarried Babies","Paprocki","Anna",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-11-14"," Abortion advocates have recently released a flood of outlandish and deceptive claims intended to defeat and discredit efforts to ensure that deceased infants receive dignified and respectful treatment. Many in the media have joined the abortion industry’s hysterical crusade, castigating these infant dignity laws as clandestine abortion regulations designed to shutter clinics and deny women choices. Even in death, unborn infants receive no respect from an abortion industry anxious to portray such human beings as trash. In reality, these laws do not address, much less regulate, a woman’s access to abortion. Infant dignity laws give families more choices when grieving the loss of their tiniest members.  The Need for Infant Dignity Laws States began considering “infant dignity” laws in response to diverse and tragic occurrences—some of which followed abortions, and many that did not. Hospitals refused to release miscarried infants’ remains to their mothers for burial, families were unable to obtain certificates of stillbirth because their infants were miscarried too early, and, not surprisingly, deceased infants’ body parts were discovered in dumpsters behind abortion clinics. Americans United for Life’s Unborn Infants Dignity Act, which state legislators frequently consult, addresses these tragedies by regulating the actions of health-care “institutions,” not patients. The model law requires abortion clinics, hospitals, and other medical facilities to offer women the opportunity to bury or cremate their deceased unborn children when the children have reached a stage of development where they have recognizable body parts. If a woman does not choose to make these arrangements, the institution must simply obtain her consent before disposing of her infant’s remains. The institution is then required to ensure that an infant’s remains are cremated or buried—not incinerated, tossed in dumpsters, or flushed through a sewer system with medical waste. A mother who suffers miscarriage or stillbirth has the additional option of donating her infant’s remains in compliance with her state’s Anatomical Gifts Act. Pretty straightforward, right? In fact, most accusations against infant dignity laws disappear when one takes the time to actually read the language. Women are not required to collect tissue in their homes following early miscarriages or chemical abortions. Families need not plan funeral services against their wishes—a simple signature agreeing to the final disposition of their infant’s remains is all that is required.  For many families, however, the laws provide a welcome, official recognition of their loss, and an opportunity to make the same choices for their deceased unborn infants that they may make for any other deceased family member. Opposition Arguments Are Mostly Falsehoods Undeterred by the facts, abortion advocates falsely claim that crematoriums are unable to accommodate the tiny bodies of deceased unborn infants. Such an assertion is ludicrous, given that crematoriums already cremate the bodies of infants who die prematurely and miscarried or stillborn infants at certain gestations. Infant dignity laws ensure that families of unborn infants who die at younger gestations are able to cremate or bury their children. Abortion advocates’ contentions that they cannot comply with infant dignity laws because they are vague or too costly are also patently ridiculous. The Eighth Circuit rejected a claim that an infant dignity law in Minnesota was vague because, at times, it might be difficult to determine the need for compliance (i.e., in some first-trimester abortions). Like the AUL model, the Minnesota law requires burial or cremation once an infant has “cartilaginous structures” and “fetal or skeletal parts.” The court held that, while these cases may present challenges, “marginal cases cannot defeat the statute.” The AUL model does not specifically designate who bears the cost of final disposition when families do not request the release of their infants’ remains. Logically, the institution, which already bears the costs of disposing of fetal tissue, should pay for a more dignified final disposition. While abortion advocates argue this cost will be passed on to patients or will heavily burden clinics, institutions can enter arrangements to ensure that any cost increase is nominal. The Eighth Circuit provided a useful example—a hospital individually packed and stored infant remains, then boxed them for group disposal. The cost was $50 per box.  Fundamentally, infant dignity laws serve two purposes. First, they provide families closure and the opportunity to grieve. Second they ensure that the remains of unborn infants are not treated the same as discarded blood, tissue, or body parts removed from medical facilities, bedding, bandages, or syringes. Human beings deserve to be treated with dignity and respect at death. Human bodies should not be intermingled with waste at their final resting places. Infant dignity laws do not regulate abortion, but the abortion industry’s vehement opposition to their enactment is telling. Abortion providers have spent decades striving to convince women—and themselves—that an abortion removes nothing but a “product of conception.” But you do not bury or cremate a placenta or umbilical cord. The enactment of an infant dignity law recognizes the scientific fact that an infant who dies from abortion is no different than an infant lost through miscarriage. That acknowledgement eviscerates the heart of many arguments abortion advocates use to justify their grisly trade.

"340",340,"Why This Isn’t The Right Time For Republicans To Propose An Abortion Heartbeat Bill","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-11-03"," On Wednesday the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on H.R. 490, better known as the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017. Although pro-life legislators mean well sponsoring a bill that would essentially ban abortions at six weeks’ gestation—near when most women discover they’re pregnant—it’s not the best focus for them right now. That’s not just because the bill won’t pass, but because Republican legislators are better off spending their time, energy, and funds on other methods that still encourage more women to carry pregnancies to term. Here are a few points where legislators might consider focusing.  Other Ways to Inform and Educate One of the bill’s effects pro-life advocates are passionate about is that its text encapsulates a central pro-life argument. As early as six weeks (and often even earlier), doctors can detect a baby’s unique heartbeat. Therefore, the “fetus” is a baby who has intrinsic value and should not be aborted. Many staunch pro-life advocates, including me, often use the “life begins at conception” argument to draw moral and legal conclusions, and this is no different. That said, because the likelihood of this bill passing is 14 percent, according to the GovTrack website, this bill isn’t a good priority right now. Some have posited that even if it won’t pass, its ability to inform the public about fetal development by generating discussion is important, but there are other ways to inform people about the science of babies. This coincides with the idea that abortion should be left up to the states to decide. So should education on the matter. While abortion is a politics-heavy issue, it doesn’t explain nationwide polarity on the matter. This year a judge ruled Arkansas can block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and a new Texas law restricts insurance coverage of abortion. Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, and abortions have dropped since these restrictions took place. However, policies are drastically different in states like Oregon, where the governor signed a bill that requires insurance companies to pay for abortions, regardless of circumstances. What explains the disparities? How about State and Local Sex Ed Policies For one, sex education and education about abortion typically begin in grade school. The Population Institute gave the state of Oregon an “A+” grade on sex education, birth control, and reproductive rights. The state mandated “comprehensive and medically accurate sex education in public schools that discusses HIV prevention, contraceptive methods and abstinence.” Yet Oregon has an “unintended pregnancy rate” of 46 percent.  In Texas, data about unintended pregnancies varies. Guttmacher claims Texas has a higher rate of unintended pregnancies than Oregon does, but an article in the Texas Tribune argues that since the number of abortions has been steadily falling while the birthrate has remained nearly the same, “it seems reasonable to say that the unintended pregnancy rate in Texas fell after Planned Parenthood was defunded.” A quarter of public schools in Texas use an “abstinence-only” program for sex ed. The two seem linked. If we want to educate people about when a baby has a heartbeat or when life begins, pro-life legislators are better off working to influence sex education in schools. That’s where the heart of the issue lies and that’s where the next generation will be influenced. Or Try Virginia’s Example Trying to legislate people into halting abortions in 2017 is kind of like William Wilberforce trying to stop the slave trade at its peak in the 1700s. The country is still highly opinionated and divided on the issue, despite—or one could say because of—decades of legal abortion. That said, conservatives have made strides in this area doing everything but banning abortion at the state level. Conservatives have had the most success lowering the number of abortions by using an old Wilberforce tactic I call strategy. After decades of offering a bill in Parliament that banned the slave trade, Wilberforce had found little success. Eventually, he decided to get shrewd and offered a bill that didn’t ban the slave trade outright, but had that same effect over time. As I wrote in a column here a couple years ago:  [Wilberforce] and like-minded comrades, including politicians and lawyers, estimated that 80 percent of all slave ships sailing to the British New Indies were flying the American flag, thus being protected from privateers. In 1806, the Foreign Slave Trade Bill removed that protection, stopping much of the slave trade by default. (The Slave Trade Act passed one year later.) These were shrewd strategies when political subtleties were necessary. In 2011, following the horrifying story of Kermit Gosnell, an abortionist who butchered babies and women in a back-alley-like atmosphere in Pennsylvania where he kept human body parts in jars, Virginia required abortion facilities to meet health and safety regulations similar to those in hospitals. According to Guttmacher, “there was a 23% decline in the abortion rate in Virginia between 2011 and 2014, from 16.3 to 12.5 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age.” Now, after the Supreme Court’s ruling in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt last year, which basically said such regulations “place an undue burden” on women who “need” an abortion, the regulations in Virginia were loosened, but they still were very effective for several years. This strategy, and other similar pieces of legislation that enforce restrictions of some kind on Planned Parenthood or abortion in general, has been effective. In the last five years alone, “states enacted 338 new abortion restrictions, which account for nearly 30% restrictions enacted by states since Roe.” While offering bills with some kind of strategic measure perhaps aren’t as direct, they can often be more effective because they can actually get passed. In the Meantime, Defund Planned Parenthood Already To hear the GOP tell it, 2017 was supposed to be the year conservatives, with a majority in the House and Senate and the presidency, turned their principles into legislative action. As far as I can see, Congress has struggled to do one of the easiest tasks on abortion: defund Planned Parenthood. If they want to ban or reduce abortion at all, they could start by doing this. I say easy because there is so much evidence Planned Parenthood has partaken in illegal activities and does not need or deserve federal funds. Following the Center for Medical Progress’ undercover videos that demonstrated Planned Parenthood was illegally harvesting and profiting from the sale of aborted baby parts, the House Oversight Committee found Planned Parenthood did not need taxpayer dollars. Yet they still operate with a robust federal stipend. With a conservative majority, defunding Planned Parenthood should not only be possible, but probable. Yet so far, nothing of substance has happened. Forgive me if I don’t empathize with a bill that proposes an abortion ban but will never actually go into effect, while a genuine chance to defund Planned Parenthood—and fulfill a major GOP campaign promise—comes and goes before our very eyes. Conservatives are sick of electing Republicans into office on promises they fail to deliver. Instead of offering a showpiece bill that will never pass, defund the mammoth organization behind the largest proportion of abortions in this country, and abortion as an industry, like the slave trade in Wilberforce’s day, will decline.

"341",341,"Bill Clinton: Late-Term Abortion Should Be Illegal","Davis","Sean",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-12-02"," Newly uncovered audio recordings of a long-time Clinton family confidante and presidential biographer show that former President Bill Clinton believed late-term abortions should be illegal.
In the audio recordings, which were released on Wednesday by the Washington Free Beacon, Taylor Branch recounts conversations he had with the former president in 1997 about the issue of abortion. Branch, who shared an apartment with Bill Clinton in the 1970’s and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1989 for his historical research, wrote a critically acclaimed book in 2009 detailing eight years worth of his conversations with the 42nd president.
According to Branch, Clinton was no fan of late-term abortion and believed that extremist rhetoric from abortion activists made them look cruel and insensitive. Clinton also believed that extremist positions from abortion activists, such as the belief that abortion should be legal up until birth, were political losers: 
Clinton said that pro-choice activists “framed the question selfishly by putting it in terms of a woman’s right to do whatever she wanted,” making it seem like they were fighting for a “selfish woman’s right to crush her baby’s skull.”
Clinton saw some of the pro-choice stances as extreme, such as the belief that third-trimester abortion should be legal.
“I believe that if you can’t make up your mind in the first six months, you don’t have the right to have an abortion,” Clinton said according to Branch.
“He said the pro-choice people have essentially allowed their own insensitivities to push them into a losing political situation and make a statesman out of Rick Santorum, which he rolled his eyes at,” said Branch.
Polls have consistently shown that most Americans agree with Clinton that late-term abortions should be banned. Although Bill Clinton specifically referenced a ban on abortion after six months, a clear majority of voters also support bans on abortion after 5 months. As Slate noted in 2014, “Even the most pro-choice people aren’t sold on abortion rights beyond the first trimester.”
Bill Clinton’s comments about the extremism of abortion activists are especially noteworthy given new claims from abortionists that pro-life rhetoric leads to violence and might even be considered a form of domestic terrorism. Planned Parenthood proponents have specifically targeted pro-lifers who highlighted undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood abortionists discussing the harvesting and sale of unborn baby body parts.
“We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part,” a senior Planned Parenthood abortionist tells prospective unborn baby organ buyers in one of the videos. “I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”
According to Taylor Branch, Bill Clinton specifically cited the push by abortion activists for an unfettered legal right to “crush [a] baby’s skull” as evidence of pro-abortion extremism.
Clinton’s comments, as recounted by Branch, raise serious questions about whether Planned Parenthood would consider him to be a domestic terrorist using rhetoric to incite violence against abortionists. The comments also suggest that Clinton, the first Democrat since FDR to be elected to two full terms as president, might not even be able to win a Democratic presidential primary in 2016 given the party’s lurch to the left on issues like abortion. Whereas Clinton said during his presidency that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” many modern abortion activists belief the procedure should be unfettered, heavily subsidized by taxpayers, and available up to the point of birth.

"342",342,"Leftists Say They Don’t Like Late-Term Abortions But Then Lament They Can’t Kill More Babies After 34 Weeks","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-02-16"," Sin stays hungry. For proof, just look at a recent New Yorker puff piece on a Maryland abortion facility that specializes in late-term abortions — up to 34 weeks of pregnancy. Sometimes mothers want abortions even after that, which led one of the facility’s founders to lament, “Turning people away is the worst part of our entire jobs.” So it’s not the baby-killing but the limits on the baby-killing that is the worst part?



And they are killing babies. We all know it. These abortionists are killing babies who are long past the threshold of viability. If they were delivered alive, they would readily be cared for in the NICU, often with excellent odds in their favor. These are babies being killed, which is why none of the many pictures included in the story showed their remains. 



No one at the New Yorker seems to have been perturbed by the abortionists’ bloodlust. Instead, they included the complaint about insufficient baby-killing in an apparent bid for sympathy for the abortionists. Whining about not killing enough babies demonstrates how evil deeds sear the conscience, numbing people to wickedness while driving them on toward more. This is illustrated clearly as the New Yorker’s reporting demolishes the usual pro-abortion justifications for, and obfuscations about, late-term abortions.



There are brief nods toward the usual arguments for late-term abortions (health risks to the mother, a grim diagnosis for the baby), but the article quickly moves past them to justify late-term abortion on demand for healthy mothers with healthy babies. As one of the abortionists put it, expectant mothers might, for example, discover that “the person who got you pregnant turns out to be an abuser who beats the sh-t out of you.” That is terrible, but why is it presumed that a man’s wrongdoing justifies killing the child he fathered? Old Testament warnings about the sins of the father being visited upon the children have nothing on modern leftists.



Other supposed justifications for killing healthy, viable babies include suggesting that if a woman has difficulty obtaining an abortion earlier in pregnancy, she is somehow entitled to a late-term one, as if abortion were something just to get a rain check on. Another excuse is that some women may not know they are pregnant until well along in the pregnancy. The piece closes with a profile of “Amanda,” who did not realize she was pregnant until she was about 30 weeks along. Several weeks later she got an abortion because neither she nor the father wanted a child. There were no health risks, no fetal anomalies, just an elective abortion of a healthy baby that was months past viability.



Abortion advocates sometimes claim that late-term abortions are only done in the most dire and tragic of circumstances, but as this New Yorker piece shows, they are lying. Late-term abortions are done for all sorts of reasons, including, as in Amanda’s case, that “she’d never wanted kids” and the father “had no interest in a baby.” So they had their baby killed.



There is no hiding this killing, though the article sometimes tries to obscure it behind indirect or clinical language, such as describing an injection “to stop the fetal heartbeat” and quoting the abortionist as saying, “We induce demise.” What a polite way to say they kill babies. Similarly, the article explains, “A later abortion can resemble going into labor.” Yes, because the mother is still delivering a baby, just a dead one.



These verbal obfuscations do not really hide anything. Rather, they highlight the dishonesty of the excuses and justifications offered by pro-abortion activists — and if pro-abortion activists balk at being described as pro-abortion, this New Yorker article has them dead to rights on that as well. As it explains, this particular abortion business began with a six-figure GoFundMe campaign. And there is a continuous stream of funding from pro-abortion groups eager to cover the costs of providing late-term abortions. People who donate to pay for late-term abortions are, in fact, pro-abortion. 



Pro-lifers pay for diapers, baby clothes, and prenatal care while abortion supporters pay for dead babies, which are what they really want. After all, a late-term abortion still requires delivering a (dead) baby, so why not let the babies live and be adopted — unless killing them is the goal? There are far more people willing to adopt babies than there are babies to adopt. But the dead baby, rather than just handing the responsibilities of parenthood off to someone else, is the point. 



And the New Yorker, its sympathetic readers, and the entire cultural and political class they represent applaud this killing. Their support for abortion has atrophied their consciences to the point that they cheer elective abortions of healthy babies even in the third trimester. It turns out that once you begin the toboggan ride down the slope of killing people because they are inconvenient, it is hard to find the brakes.



Evil never ends where we want, but as the old saying has it, sin always takes us further than we wanted to go, keeps us longer than we wanted to stay, and costs more than we ever wanted to pay. In short, sin stays hungry.

"344",344,"NY AG Letitia James Sues Pregnancy Centers Over Life-Saving Abortion Pill Reversal","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-05-13"," New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has a history of using lawfare to target people who want to protect unborn babies, is furthering her campaign against pro-lifers by suing nearly a dozen pregnancy centers for offering women abortion pill reversals. In a complaint filed at the beginning of May, James alleged Heartbeat International and 11 pregnancy centers, including one firebombed by abortion terrorists following the leak of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson draft decision, made “false and misleading statements” about life-saving treatments used to reverse attempted abortions induced by mifepristone. She said that offering women who decided they did not want to complete their chemical abortions a safe way out amounts to “fraud, deceptive business practices, and false advertising under New York law.”  The timing of James’ lawsuit is no coincidence. She not only sued the defendants in question after they sued for relief from her “politically motivated campaign,” but she also timed the lawsuit to make headlines as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) likely violated the law when it approved abortion pills, which are responsible for more than half of the nation’s abortions, for mail order and other expansions. “Based on NY AG Letitia James’ irresponsible record of protecting big abortion, it appears that her lawsuit against us is a smokescreen to obscure the rampant malpractice and fraud that is the chemical abortion industry ahead of an anticipated June Supreme Court decision on that very subject,” CompassCare CEO Rev. Jim Harden said in a statement. James also falsely claimed abortion pill reversal (APR) is not “backed by science and does not meet clinical standards” because the “only clinical trial conducted to evaluate APR had to be halted due to concerns about patient safety.” Several studies have determined that increasing intramuscular and high-dose oral progesterone in women who ingest the abortion drug regimen and regret it is “safe and effective” and resulted in “no apparent increased risk of birth defects.”  James is correct that the University of California, Davis researchers who conducted a 2019 study on abortion pill reversal canceled their work, citing the “risk to women.” The “risk” in question, however, came after three of the 12 women who took mifepristone, the abortion drug, for the sake of the study “required ambulance transport to a hospital for treatment of severe vaginal bleeding.” Two of them hadn’t ingested any reversal drug. James’ targeting of pregnancy centers over a life-saving treatment that she says lacks “safety and effectiveness” is ironic given the abortion pill’s proven history of causing dangerous and sometimes fatal complications. Mifepristone is responsible for a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits for side effects such as hemorrhage, “fast, weak pulse,” “shortness of breath,” diarrhea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, “pain” across the back, arms, neck, and abdomen, and myriad other risks. The FDA even admits on the drug’s label that nearly 1 in 25 women who take it will end up in the emergency room or hospitalized. A peer-reviewed article published this month found that the FDA used “flawed studies with significantly undercounted complications” when it quietly modified its regulation to allow abortion pills via remote prescription, mail-order, and chain pharmacy pickup to accommodate the Biden White House’s post-Roe activism.  “This will increase the risk of complications due to failure to adequately determine the gestational age or rule out ectopic pregnancy by ultrasound or physical exam, failure to perform labs to document whether RhoGAM is indicated, and failure to obtain appropriate informed consent to prevent unwanted abortions, among other concerns,” the article’s authors warn. As James continues her conquest against pro-lifers and pregnancy centers that give women the hope and support they need to nurture and raise surprise babies, New York is preparing to earmark $36 million of the state’s 2025 budget to advance Democrats’ abortion agenda. The budget, approved by Gov. Kathy Hochul at the end of April, sets aside $25 million in taxpayer dollars for abortion nonprofits to expand their efforts to kill preborn babies. The governor also appropriated $10 million in security grants to abortion facilities “to help ensure the safety of the providers performing this vital care.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2024/05/13/ny-ag-letitia-james-sues-pregnancy-centers-over-life-saving-abortion-pill-reversal/",0.8361,0.1639,"male",2012,2012
"345",345,"John Roberts Sides With Abortion Profiteers In June Medical Services Supreme Court Case","Griswold","Kylee",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-06-29"," In a 5-4 decision Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana abortion law requiring abortionists to have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital. In keeping with a string of other unconstitutional maneuvers, Chief Justice John Roberts joined once again with the bench’s leftists in June Medical Services v. Russo, authoring his own concurring opinion that cut against the Constitution, life, and women.  Abortion advocates said the Louisiana law placed an “undue burden” on women seeking the barbaric procedure. The law, however, simply held abortionists to the same standard as other medical practitioners, protecting women by requiring abortionists to have an agreement with a nearby hospital where they could admit patients in case of emergency.  This is a reincarnation of the ""abortion distortion"": applying a different set of rules to abortion than to other issues. This was a common sense regulation mean to protect women and avoid Kermit Gosnell nightmares.  (2/x)
— Carrie Severino (@JCNSeverino) June 29, 2020  Roberts appealed to precedent or “stare decisis” in his opinion, drawing from Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, a Supreme Court case that struck down a similar law requiring admitting privileges in Texas because it allegedly created too great an obstacle to women’s contrived “right” to obtain an abortion. “I joined the dissent in Whole Woman’s Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided. The question today however is not whether Whole Woman’s Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case,” Roberts wrote. “The legal doctrine of stare decisis requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike. The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore Louisiana’s law cannot stand under our precedents.” June Medical Differed from Hellerstedt Pro-life leaders maintain not only that am abortionist’s lack of admitting privileges actively harms women, but that the Louisiana case differs from Texas.  “One of the differences between June Medical and Hellerstedt is that the record out of Louisiana is full of instances where women suffered greatly because doctors did not have admitting privileges,” Denise Harle, legal counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, told The Federalist in an interview at the March for Life. “There was a woman, for example, whose uterus was perforated, and she ended up sitting in the ER for three days hemorrhaging, and they ultimately had to do a hysterectomy and she lost her ability to have children just because the abortion doctor didn’t have admitting privileges,” Harle said. “So that was just one example of several on the record.” The Louisiana law also differs from the Texas law in practice, resulting in no substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions. Texas hospitals, for example, require doctors to admit a minimum number of patients each year to keep their admitting privileges, resulting in more abortion facilities closing, but few Louisiana hospitals require such minimums. In fact, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said there is no evidence the Louisiana law would result in any abortion facility closures, since only one doctor at a single facility in Louisiana was unable to obtain admitting privileges. While the Texas law resulted in a 350 percent increase in women having to drive more than 150 miles to get abortions, the Louisiana law did not cause driving distances to increase.  Supreme Court Leftists Ignore ‘Third-Party Standing’ Another question at issue in the June Medical Services case was whether abortionists, as an unharmed third party, had legal grounds to challenge the Louisiana law on behalf of their female patients. In his dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the majority “all but ignore[d] the question.” “For most of its history, this Court maintained that private parties could not bring suit to vindicate the constitutional rights of individuals who are not before the Court,” Thomas said, implicating Roberts’ blind adherence to precedent when it is politically expedient. Thomas continued: The plurality and THE CHIEF JUSTICE ultimately cast aside this jurisdictional barrier to conclude that Louisiana’s law is unconstitutional under our precedents. But those decisions created the right to abortion out of whole cloth, without a shred of support from the Constitution’s text. Our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled. Because we have neither jurisdiction nor constitutional authority to declare Louisiana’s duly enacted law unconstitutional, I respectfully dissent. Pro-life advocates have maintained that the question of “third-party standing” is a crucial issue of women’s rights, as the abortion lobby, a behemoth profiting off murder of the innocent and the exploitation of women, is purporting to represent women’s interests before the law. “It’s wrong for the abortion industry to be bringing these cases,” Harle told The Federalist. “Abortion clinics are bringing a lawsuit to avoid complying with a standard of care that applies to all doctors at ambulatory surgical centers throughout Louisiana, so the abortion industry is coming in and asking for a special exemption so they don’t have to abide by health and safety standards.” Justice Samuel Alito agreed, noting in his dissent that precedent cannot justify the majority’s decision, “which clashes with our general rule on third-party standing. And the idea that a regulated party can invoke the right of a third party for the purpose of attacking legislation enacted to protect the third party is stunning.” Planned Parenthood and the abortion lobby have long sold women the lie that being pro-woman is incompatible with being pro-life. The Supreme Court, with Roberts at the helm, just affirmed that falsehood by refusing to acknowledge the fallacy inherent within third-party standing, choosing to side with abortion profiteers rather than the Constitution and vulnerable women. As Louisiana state Sen. Katrina Jackson, a pro-life Democrat, said, this “tragic decision” continues the Supreme Court’s “practice of putting the interests of for-profit abortion businesses ahead of the health and safety of women.” She’s right.

"346",346,"Two Mothers With Disabilities Face The Abortion Question In Europe, With Opposite Outcomes","Mullarkey","Maureen",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-07-17"," In our heterogeneous, relentlessly secularizing culture, increasingly fewer of us inhabit the same moral universe. Those of us who share a traditional abhorrence of killing the unborn find ourselves speaking mainly to each other. The fallacies of “a woman’s right to choose” dominate pop culture and public policy. The burden of persuasion remains with the pro-life movement. And it is all uphill. Over the past month or so, the press carried two separate articles spotlighting opposite sides of the abortion debate. The most recent, datelined London, described the judicial reasoning behind a court-mandated abortion despite a pregnant woman’s wish to keep her child. The story parallels and, at the same time, inverts Pope Francis’ widely covered address at the end of May to attendees at a Vatican-sponsored anti-abortion conference.  At the center of both stories was a mentally deficient woman. In both situations that deficiency served the judges’ conflicting convictions. The decisions were antithetical, but taken together they illustrate the frailty of pro-life arguments in a culture that mistakes progressive politics for morality. However much we might deplore one ruling and applaud the other, there is no comfort in papal utterances that fail to persuade beyond the choir. Court-Mandated Abortion on Unwilling Mother Begin in London. The May 21 ruling, covered first by British media and the Catholic News Agency, hinged on the rhetoric of choice. An ugly decision, its inhumanity fed on the falsity of pro-choice euphemism and came cloaked in the language of compassion. Justice Nathalie Lieven divined that “termination” was in the woman’s “best interest.” Pro-choice advocates had posed the case as a threat to the options of “the many women who willingly choose to end their pregnancies.” This particular doomed child was 22 weeks in the womb and with no sign of impairment. Still, the absolutism of rights discourse prevailed. It is the genius of ideology to render facts irrelevant. Here, facts included the pregnant woman’s mother, a former midwife, who sued to save the child and wanted to care for it. No matter. As an abortion-rights spokeswoman declared, to permit this one baby to live was “to attack a woman’s right to choose.”  In effect, a female judge extinguished an individual woman’s choice in order to safeguard “a woman’s right to choose” in the sacred abstract. Her reasoning bears analogy to the logic behind that infamous quote from the 1968 Tet Offensive: “It became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it.” That destructive logic is reinforced by politicians, celebrities, and entertainment venues as a guiding moral principle. We do not yet have a Disney princess who has had an abortion. But she is not far off. Killing Is Okay If I Hire Someone Else to Do It Backspace to the Vatican conference in May. Pope Francis’ stern recitation of the Catholic Church’s condemnation of abortion under any circumstances was widely reported. Not only the Catholic press, but also major national media, seized on his most quotable line:  “Is it licit to eliminate a life to solve a problem? Is it permissible to hire a hit man to solve a problem?” Relating abortion to contract killing was a stark reminder of what abortion entails. It illustrates why it was considered a crime until 1973. If only Francis had stopped at that. Instead, he followed with a facile recollection that lent tooth to feminist charges that strictures against abortion derive from patriarchal oblivion. Or callousness.  The hit man reference made livelier press than Francis’ sunny flashback, which was largely ignored. Sandro Magister’s blog, Settimo Cielo, did broadcast the papal anecdote, but only in Italian. It is worth reading in full. I am reminded of a story that I met in my other diocese. There was a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant and her parents went to the judge to ask for permission to abort. The judge, a truly upright man, studied it and said: ‘I want to interrogate the child.’ ‘But she has Down syndrome. She doesn’t understand…’ ‘No no, let her come.’ So the 15-year-old girl went. She sat there, started talking to the judge and he said to her: ‘But do you know what happens to you?’ ‘Yes, I am sick.’ ‘Ah, what is your illness?’ ‘They told me I have an animal inside that eats my stomach, and for this they have to do an intervention.’ ‘No…you don’t have a worm that eats your stomach. Do you know what you have there? A child!’ And the Down syndrome girl [la ragazza down] said: ‘Oh, how nice!’ With this, the judge did not authorize the abortion. Mom wants it. The years have passed. A baby girl was born. She studied, grew up, became a lawyer. Since that little girl understood her story because they told her, every birthday day she called the judge to thank him for the gift of birth. The things of life. The judge is dead and now she has become a promoter of justice. But look what a beautiful thing! Abortion is never the answer that women and families seek. I wince at that anecdote. The brutish impregnation of a developmentally and intellectually diminished girl is far larger than a mere problem. By showcasing a teenager with sorely limited understanding of her condition and its consequences, Francis drops a sentimental veil over the revulsion, fear, and humiliation of sexual assault made all the more anguished by pregnancy. The story floats airily above recognition of soul-murdering repercussions that can stalk a fully cognizant young victim of sexual assault into her adulthood. Its detachment is of dubious benefit to the pro-life movement. How this 15-year-old girl became pregnant goes unmentioned. Clearly, whether violence played a role or not, the girl’s incapacity had been preyed upon. She showed no grasp of pregnancy, or the cruelty implicit in her situation. She only knew, as young girls do, that babies are “nice.” As told, this gave the judge no reason to pause. Her insufficiency was as useful to his purposes as to the man who had violated her. Should Abortion Depend on a Mother’s Choice? Mom wants it. A deceptive phrase. Given the inadequate level of understanding on display before the judge, the girl can scarcely be said to have chosen motherhood. It is reasonable to think her parents, heartache notwithstanding, raised her baby. They, not the judge, provided resources for the child, protected and counseled her, taught her to function. The biological mother was likely present more as a playmate than a parent. Please understand; I do not mean to say that the Italian jurist made the wrong decision. Possibly his talk with the girl had been more nuanced than the version Francis recited. Perhaps the papal rendition was a calumny of simplification. I mean only to suggest that the account, taken at face value, undermines pro-life positions. By rinsing in rosewater any tragic dimension to pregnancy wreaked on a girl through violence or misuse, it stokes the bitterness of women susceptible to feminist mantras of male dominance. A cognitively impaired teenager is hardly a convincing emblem of the courage to refuse abortion. Moreover, blunt repetition of censure is not an argument. Fiat does not convince. Neither does a cloudless anecdote insensitive to the sorrow of a situation fraught with difficulty. There do exist hard cases, formidable ones that resist easy application of predetermined judgment. Some diffidence is due to the grievous reality that right answers sometimes evade right formulas. Complicating the Tale If I am leery of the pope’s happy tale of abortion averted, it is because I am also reminded of a story. In a 2016 interview with Corriere della Sera, Pope Francis lauded Italy’s most notorious hit man—Emma Bonino—as “among the greats of today’s Italy.” His praise was not for her triumphant history as an abortionist and abortion-rights activist, or her fanatical embrace of a stew of left-wing causes—from abolition of the armed forces to same-sex marriage and transgenderism. It was her militancy on behalf of mass migration from Africa that raised her into the pantheon of European statesmen. In the interview, Francis likened her achievement as Italy’s foreign minister (2013-14) to that of such “great forgotten figures” as Konrad Adenauer and Robert Schuman. Charged with ethical import, the accolade was unnecessary, provocative, and pastorally puzzling. Viewed in relation to Bonino’s advocacy of mass migration—a goal Francis championed—her lethal campaign against the unborn was discountable. The woman’s substantial contribution to Italy’s demographic decline could be sealed off, removed from the dock in service to the pope’s politics. Relativity reigned. Francis’ praise for Bonino lingers on Catholic ears. It blurs the consciences of women struggling to keep their bearings amid the wreckage of the moral traditions the woman gladly undermined. And it prompts questions about the sincerity of his pro-life declarations. By contrast, London’s Justice Lieven ruled unambiguously in concert with the assumptions of the pro-choice camp. Anna Bonino would approve. ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/17/two-mothers-disabilities-face-abortion-question-europe-opposite-outcomes/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"347",347,"4 Ways Hillary Clinton Will Increase Abortion As President","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-19"," The 2016 election is weeks away. With both major presidential candidates at historic lows in approval ratings, Christians and other pro-lifers are reconsidering their long-held default options for the nation’s top executive. Eric Sapp of the American Values Network recently argued in The Christian Post that Hillary Clinton and her party’s policies are the best fit for pro-lifers who prefer life-affirming action to mere talk. Blogger Rachel Held Evans posited a similar position in an early August post, titled “So you’re thinking of voting for a pro-choice candidate…”  I have responded to Held Evans, and prominent pro-life advocate Ryan Bomberger responded directly to Sapp elsewhere—Bomberger’s piece in particular bears reading. But it’s clear many Christians are wrestling with this question. As we wrestle and dialogue, here are four ways Hillary Clinton plans to make our abortion problem much worse if she’s elected. 1. Tax Dollars Will Pay For Abortions Shortly after the Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions were announced in January of 1973, Congress passed two riders ensuring that taxpayer funds—with exceptions for the life of a mother, and later, rape and incest—would not be used for abortions. The Hyde Amendment, adopted in 1976, prevents federal taxpayer dollars from directly funding abortions in the U.S. The Helms Amendment, adopted in 1973, prevents taxpayers from funding abortions overseas.  Renewed alongside the Helms Amendment every year by both houses of Congress, the Hyde Amendment turned back an immediate trend that saw the federal government pay for 300,000 abortions with taxpayer funds every year from 1973 to 1977, when Hyde took effect. According to a study published last month by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, roughly 2 million children have been born who would otherwise have been aborted if not for the Hyde Amendment. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have expressly promised to repeal the Hyde and Helms Amendments, diverting taxpayer funding to pay directly for abortions for the first time in 40 years. According to page 37 of the 2016 Democratic Party Platform, “We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.” Page 46 highlights the Party’s intention to repeal Helms: [W]e support the repeal of harmful restrictions that obstruct women’s access to health care information and services, including the “global gag rule” and the Helms Amendment that bars American assistance to provide safe, legal abortion throughout the developing world. In addition, Clinton—the first-ever primary candidate endorsed by Planned Parenthood—has championed the federal government’s overruling of state attempts to cut ties with Planned Parenthood. This sets a precedent of federally backed state-level funding to an organization that performs 330,000 abortions every year.  Since this money—$500 million per year total—is fungible, funds are freed up from other services Planned Parenthood may perform in order to allow for more abortions, even when they are not directly paid for by taxpayers. Finally, 32 states currently fund abortions through their Medicaid offices—including 17 for any reason—a revenue stream not covered by Hyde. Clinton’s proposed repeal of Hyde would essentially change that number from 17 to 50 overnight. Unfortunately, the arguments advanced by both Sapp and Held Evans completely omit this reality. 2. Citizens Will Be Forced To Promote Abortions A year before her more recent accusation that half of Donald Trump’s supporters were a “basket of deplorables” and “irredeemable,” Hillary Clinton compared pro-life Americans to jihadi “terrorist groups,” in open hostility to 58 percent of all Americans who oppose abortions in all or most situations. Clinton’s intolerance toward pro-life Americans aligns with new state laws in California and Illinois that require pro-life citizens, including those working at pregnancy help centers and medical clinics, to share a state-sponsored message that favors abortion. Last Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the California law, overriding a challenge that it violates Constitutional rights to free speech and free exercise of religion. Two lawsuits attempting to stop the Illinois law—set to take effect January 2017—are in the works. The Illinois law is particularly troubling. In addition to requiring medical providers to “inform his or her patient of… the risks and benefits of treatment options”—which include abortions, medical providers are then bound to several conditional requirements, including Section 6, Paragraph 3: (3) If requested by the patient or the legal representative of the patient, the health care facility, physician, or health care personnel shall: (i) refer the patient to, or (ii) transfer the patient to, or (iii) provide in writing information to the patient about other health care providers who they reasonably believe may offer the health care service the health care facility, physician, or health personnel refuses to permit, perform, or participate in because of a conscience-based objection. At least 51 pregnancy help medical clinics will be directly affected by the law, which had previously been held as the “gold standard” of state-level conscience and freedom of expression protections. Heartbeat International, an affiliation network of pregnancy help organizations, has urged its Illinois affiliates to refuse compliance with the law. While Republican Governor Bruce Rauner signed the Illinois law, he’s the only non-Democrat elected official to support the new laws in both states. As Clinton acknowledged in the second presidential debate October 9, she is committed to not just holding the line on abortion, but to expanding its reach and prevalence. 3. Religious Hospitals Will Be Forced to Choose Between Conscience and Existence While medicos involved with explicitly pro-life nonprofits are in the crosshairs of the Illinois law, they’re not alone. In fact, the genesis of the law—first introduced to the state’s legislative body in 2015—was an attempt to force Catholic hospitals in Illinois to refer for abortions, as well as birth control, physician-assisted suicide, and transgender reassignment surgery. Originally opposed by the Catholic Conference of Illinois, that body conceded its position in April of 2015, paving the way for the bill’s eventual passage a year later. Patrick Cacchione of the Illinois Catholic Hospital Association called the law “a bill in search of a problem.” But his organization dropped its resistance as well, while Erica Laethem of OSF HealthCare—the state’s largest Catholic healthcare system—rested her group’s complicity in the bill’s passage on a bizarre moral distinction between a referral and a referral written “on a prescription pad.” Meanwhile this April, Trinity Health Corp., which operates 86 facilities in 21 states, won a lawsuit filed by the ACLU that would have forced the Catholic healthcare group to not just refer for abortions, but to perform them. All this in addition to the Obama administration’s attempt to force The Little Sisters of the Poor—a group of (must we clarify?) celibate nuns—to provide contraceptive and abortifacient coverage through their healthcare, despite their deeply held religious objections. Lamenting the Supreme Court’s decision to send the case back to a lower court this May, Clinton indicated her desire to see even Catholic nuns forced to pay for contraceptives and abortifacients via Twitter, saying, “Every woman, no matter where she works, deserves birth control coverage. This shouldn’t be a question.” Every woman, no matter where she works, deserves birth control coverage. This shouldn’t be a question. #SCOTUS -H
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 16, 2016  If this response doesn’t convince, perhaps last week’s WikiLeaks revelations will do the job. Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, plotted a “Catholic spring” with other high-ranking officials in her campaign. Clinton’s animus toward religious Americans is on full display here, as is her campaign’s plan to force “backward Catholics” out of the “medieval dictatorship” and into these enlightened times. It is these enlightened times, lest we need reminding, that have given us Clinton and Trump. 4. Attempts To Regulate Abortion Will Be Opposed On Principle In his article at The Christian Post, Sapp argued that Republican lawmakers have done nothing to meaningfully fight abortion. But Bomberger’s response tells a different story—as does Clinton herself. To Sapp’s “And what did Republicans [during the George W. Bush administration] do to overturn Roe or in any meaningful way limit abortion? Nothing,” Bomberger responds: “Well, here’s a whole lot of ‘nothing,’ I guess”: Partial Abortion Ban of 2003
Reinstituted the Mexico City Policy
Born-Alive Infant Protection Act
Prolife Justices Roberts and Alito appointed to the Supreme Court
Launched national adoption awareness campaign and increased tax credit for adoption-related expenses from $5,000 to $10,000
Significantly increased federal funding for abstinence-based education through HHS (see this HHS-commissioned pro-abstinence study now hidden by that federal department)
Issued federal regulation allowing states to include unborn children in the federal/state S-CHIP program to help provide pre-natal care to poor women
Annually recognized Sanctity of Human Life Day
Thwarted every UN effort to promote abortion as an international right And this is just on the federal level. Republican-controlled state legislatures have enacted legislation to whittle away at the egregious unconstitutional Roe decree. Constitutional foes, in the form of pro-abortion Democrats, fight every single prolife effort. Perhaps Sapp has never heard of pregnancy resource centers—you know, those thousands of facilities across the country (CareNet, Heartbeat International, NIFLA) that care for mothers and their children. Many are medical. Some even provide prenatal care. All offer their services, including parenting classes and maternal and baby supplies, at no cost to their clients. These centers are a threat to Big Abortion, rescuing mothers, fathers and their children and offering help and hope. Clinton celebrated the reversal of a Texas state law this summer that had required abortion clinics to hold admitting privileges to a hospital within 30 miles, and to comply with ambulatory surgical center standards in the Supreme Court’s Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. She is an unabashed opponent of any conceivable regulation on abortion. While praising the court’s decision, Clinton reiterated her intention to oppose any law or restriction on abortion: Our fight is far from over. In Texas and across the country, a woman’s constitutional right to make her own health decisions is under attack. In the first three months of 2016, states introduced more than 400 measures restricting access to abortion. We’ve seen a concerted, persistent attack on women’s health and rights at the federal level. While some in pro-life camps point to potential Supreme Court nominations as the decisive factor for voting for Donald Trump despite his flaws, others argue that the Democratic Party is the preferred way forward for those who place a premium on the sanctity of life. Christian and pro-life voters no doubt face a difficult decision in 2016. As we weigh our options, however, it seems implausible to include Hillary Clinton on that list.

"348",348,"Want To Know Who Is Really Empowered By Abortion? Sex Traffickers And Abusers","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-20"," Abortion is marketed to Americans by activists and the corporate media as empowering for women. But it’s really an industry that not only profits off of the death of babies in the womb, but the sexual exploitation and abuse of women and girls. 



One amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent Dobbs v. Jackson case noted that even though “abortion is typically promoted as an expression of autonomous freedom, as if abortion represents an ideal of the self-possessed woman determining her future,” it is often used as “a tool for others to achieve their nefarious goals at the expense of women (and the children they carry).”



“Abortion is beloved by sexual traffickers and predators, by irresponsible males, by heartless employers, by parents placing their own reputation over their daughter’s wishes and their grandchildren’s lives, and by eugenic and racist population planners. For pregnant women and girls, in these contexts at least, abortion is a bane, not a boon,” the brief states. 



The abortion industry makes money off of ending the lives of babies in utero. Lots of it. According to a recent report, abortion industry revenue “has increased at an annualized rate of 2.0% to $3.7 billion over the five years to 2022” and become a $4 billion market. Not only do abortion giants such as Planned Parenthood rake in cash based on the lies that women must have “a right to choose,” but they also help keep another profitable, illicit industry alive: sex trafficking. 



With more than 40.3 million victims globally, human trafficking is a big business worth at least $150 billion that just keeps growing. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime recently acknowledged that the pandemic made trafficking “even harder to detect” and has left “victims struggling to obtain help and access to justice.” 



That type of sexual exploitation is only helped by the covert practices used in the abortion industry to end lives in the womb undetected. When trafficked women and young girls get pregnant, they lose their marketability and become liabilities to their pimps. When abused women and young girls get pregnant, they could open their abusers up to investigations and prosecutions. 



For years, pro-life organizations and activists have raised questions about the role abortion facilities such as Planned Parenthood play in exacerbating this type of sex trafficking, exploitation, and abuse. After all, investigations have yielded plenty of evidence showing Planned Parenthood is notorious for enabling predators, ignoring child abuse, and covering up child trafficking for profit. 



Abortion activists and even Planned Parenthood have repeatedly written off these concerns as “dangerous claims” but the statistics show otherwise. 





A 2014 study from the Health Policy and Law Review of Loyola University Chicago found that more than half, 55.2 percent, of the 67 trafficking victims surveyed had at least one abortion (presumably forcibly) while they were being sold for sex. At least 29.9 percent said they had multiple abortions. Overall, the study found that there were 114 total abortions among the 67 victims.



Researchers noted that a “majority of survivors sought healthcare at some point during the time they were trafficked.” Nearly 30 percent of those victims went to Planned Parenthood, which apparently did not pick up on signs of abuse.



“Many providers were unaware of the fact that they were treating a trafficking victim, and unaware of the force, fraud, and coercion involved in trafficking,” the study concluded. 



Yet, Planned Parenthood is still happily handing out abortions to girls 18 and under in Alaska, California, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington without many questions asked. 



As a matter of fact, Planned Parenthood advertises those states that don’t require parental consent for minors to get abortions and encourages girls to call them for advice on how to circumvent their state’s notification mandates. The Biden White House similarly recommends teen girls to sources that encourage them to conceal their pregnancies, which are likely the result of some form of sexual abuse according to state consent laws, from their parents.



To be fair, Planned Parenthood was founded with bad intentions in mind. Planned Parenthood recently tried to disavow its founder Margaret Sanger and her racist past but that hasn’t stopped them from profiting off of the system of on-demand abortions she created — a system that deliberately and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. 



Sound familiar? Because that’s what sex trafficking does too. While sexual exploitation is found in every state, sex, race, and age group, it disproportionately affects “runaway and homeless youth,” those with abuse-laden and traumatic pasts, and people struggling financially. 



Those are the same kinds of young people Planned Parenthood targets with their abortion propaganda. As a matter of fact, Planned Parenthood proudly profits from it.



Planned Parenthood is known to perform abortions on trafficking and abuse victims, women and girls who are likely candidates for forced abortions, plain and simple. Not only that, but Planned Parenthood’s incessant attempts to solidify no-questions-asked abortions as a normalized practice in the U.S. opens the door for traffickers to keep up business. 



The profit-motivated trafficking industry repeatedly uses unregulated abortions as a way to keep sexually exploiting victims and reinforce the idea that women are commodities who lose their value when they aren’t “working” and are having children. 



That damaging narrative doesn’t just drive the sex trafficking industry. It’s also present in some of the biggest workplaces in America. Shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, some of the nation’s largest companies offered to subsidize abortions for their female employees to stay barren. For Bank of America, BlackRock, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Disney, Goldman Sachs, H&M, Macy’s, Nike, Nordstrom, and Snap, it is easier to pay to end lives in the womb than offer support for mothers and children after birth.



As if the abortion industry hasn’t hurt women enough already, it possesses a big role in sustaining the sex trafficking industry in the U.S. No matter how much abortion activists and the corporate media try to dismiss it, abortion is a tool to enable sexual exploitation and end lives, not empower women.

"350",350,"The United Kingdom Prosecutes Women For Abortion, And It Works","Williams","Peter","D.",NA,NA,NA,"2018-04-27"," As a British right-to-life advocate, it’s been strange to read of the recent U.S. debates over The Atlantic firing Kevin Williamson due to his past belief expressed on Twitter and podcast—since clarified—that women who have abortions should be subject to the death penalty, and the similarly excoriated view articulated—then mitigated—by Robert Nonino, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in Idaho. The concept of applying capital punishment to post-abortive women is shocking. The condemnation of this view however, has extended not only to this hypothetical lethal sanction, but to the more general idea of penalties against women for contriving feticide.  Just as after last year’s remarks by presidential candidate Donald Trump on this issue, the apparently universal assumption, including by mainstream right-to-lifers, is that such criminalization would necessarily be cruel and unusual, deriving from a lack of compassion and potentially even leading to mass incarceration. From this Englishman’s experience, that is a striking non sequitur, and a gratuitous and un-nuanced judgement. Britain (for present purposes, I feel obliged to drop the “Great”) is globally infamous for having one of the most permissive abortion regimes in the world. This is one reason why, to our shame, we are rightly characterized as the “geopolitical epicentre of the culture of death.” Less well known is that British law also allows for prosecuting women who have illegal abortions (as indeed, consequently, do the laws of former British colonies such as New Zealand, and the states of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia). In Great Britain, Abortion Happens Under an Exception In fact, the great irony of British abortion law is that it is predicated on abortion being a crime. “Procuring a miscarriage” is normatively illegal in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland, under section 58 of the Offences Against The Person Act 1861, a statutory consolidation of English—and at that time, Irish—criminal law which still forms part of the bedrock of our legal system. After 28 weeks gestation, it can also be prosecuted under the crime of “Child Destruction” under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 or the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 1945. In Scotland, abortion is illegal throughout pregnancy under Scots Law, the common law of that historic kingdom.  These provisions were largely neutered when the Abortion Act of 1967 gave exemptions from prosecution under the 1861 statute and Scottish penalties, to doctors who performed abortion on ostensibly very circumscribed conditions. In practice, this led to de facto abortion on demand, due to the appallingly normalized misapplication of “mental health” grounds under which almost 97 percent of Britain’s more than 200,000 abortions annually take place. These exemptions were extended to “Child Destruction” in 1990. Despite the institutionalized hypocrisy of a “restrictive” law that actually gives us one of the laxest abortion laws in Europe, and indeed in the world, on rare occasions women have in fact been prosecuted and jailed in the U.K. for illegal abortions. If this shocks anyone, it is worth looking at the cases in question. Women Prosecuted for Illegal Abortions In 2012, a 35-year-old mother of two, Sarah Catt, was tried under section 58 for causing herself to have a miscarriage at 39 weeks, due to her belief that the father was a co-worker with whom she was having an affair. This was discovered through her failure to register the birth of her child after a hospital scan confirmed her pregnancy a few weeks earlier. Online, she bought prostaglandins to use as abortifacients, and she gave birth to a stillborn son, whose body she buried. The judge at Catt’s trial said she “had robbed the baby of the life it was about to have.” Both he and the inspector dealing with her case noted that she had “shown no remorse.”  Three years later, a 24-year-old woman called Natalie Towers was also prosecuted under section 58 for an illegal abortion. Like Catt, she had procured heavy prostaglandins online. Ingesting them caused her to experience severe contractions. This led to her son suffocating to death before she gave birth to him in the toilet. Towers was at 32-34 weeks gestation when this took place; for context, the “upper limit” for most abortions in the U.K. is 24 weeks. Trying to fake a natural miscarriage, Towers called emergency services, who attempted to revive the baby boy they posthumously named “Luke.” When the cause of death was found to be oxygen starvation, Towers confessed to the police what she had done. Later investigation into her web history and research on how to delete it demonstrated her malice aforethought. While asserting that the case had “nothing to do with the general immorality or otherwise of the termination of unborn foetuses,” the judge at her trial considered her actions so serious that he directly sentenced her to two-and-a-half-years in prison. One more case, but this time with a different outcome. In 2016, an unnamed 21-year-old Northern Irish girl was given a suspended sentence after she had procured abortifacients and miscarried her baby at 10-12 weeks. She was only found out when her two female housemates, one of whom had recently naturally miscarried, discovered the discarded body of the baby in a towel thrown in the bin. One of the women recounted, “He had fingers, little toes. Even now I just have a picture in my mind of it. Its wee [an Ulster Scots word for ‘little’] foot was perfect. Even now I feel sick… I didn’t want to throw a baby away. I didn’t know what to do.” The other said, “You would never want to see it in your life. It was a full wee proper baby… About a week went by, the guilt of a baby in the bin was eating us up.” After being so understandably traumatized, they called the police. The clear callousness of the mother notwithstanding, she was spared prison because by the end of her trial she had given birth again, and the judge discerned that her new child needed her. He recognized the wickedness of what she had done by finding her guilty, but exercised prudence in letting her go free. Despite Prosecution Being Allowed, It’s Rare In the last 50 years, these three cases are the only convictions of post-abortive women in the U.K. The other applications of our criminal penalties against abortion have been against men who have cruelly caused women to miscarry, often by brutal violence, as in the vicious cases of Kevin Wilson, Tony McLernon, and Carl Whant. Prosecutions of women are this rare because, importantly, they take place when women have performed abortions, and not merely procured them. Only directly causing an abortion—a woman doing it on herself, or an abortionist on a woman—has ever been a crime in British law. Even then, it is only applied to self-aborting women in the most callous cases, usually in late pregnancy. This is entirely just because it is morally serious and consistent in its treatment of the unlawful killing of human beings. This is entirely just because it is morally serious and consistent in its treatment of the unlawful killing of human beings. By contrast, a bizarre blanket refusal to prosecute any mother who directly causes the death of her own unborn child is either naïvely sentimentalistic or cravenly political ad hoccery. Crucially however, where there are extenuating circumstances, U.K. law also possesses the flexibility to act in an appropriately caring manner. This is why the judge in the Northern Irish case delivered practical clemency alongside legal integrity. Such a balance mirrors the wisdom of our laws against assisted suicide and euthanasia, which allow for cases where someone has been involved in either enabling or causing the death of another to be investigated thoroughly, but for people acting out of what they perceive to be “mercy” to be treated differently than someone with darker motivations. Whilst disturbing miscarriages of justice may occur in places like El Salvador, the practical examples from English and Northern Irish jurisprudence demonstrate that applying legal penalties to women who self-abort demonstrably does not lead to mass incarceration, regular inequity, or a lack of benevolent humanity. Quite the contrary, they are rarely and prudently applied, and illustrate the possibility of maintaining the ideal balance of applying justice and compassion with judicious sagacity. To create a false dichotomy, between locking up (if not executing!) all post-abortive women and never criminalizing women who abort their babies, is thoughtlessly simplistic. The abortion penalties in British law allow U.K. courts to prosecute that minority of women who perform abortion, not the majority who simply procure it, and give them the flexibility to adjudicate which cases involving post-abortive women deserve conviction, and which do not. Whether commentators or legislators, Americans engaging in controversy over this issue would do well to consider whether, if it is possible for the “mother country” of Anglophone common law and ordered liberty to achieve this equitable state of affairs—even in her currently bioethically degraded state—it might not also be possible for her constitutional descendants to do likewise.

"351",351,"NBC Spewed Abortion Lies In DeSantis Interview, Then Cut Off His Answer Exposing Them As Bunk","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-08-08"," NBC News’ Dasha Burns is the latest corporate media mouthpiece to try to con Americans into tolerating Democrats’ radical abortion agenda by pretending it doesn’t exist. 



In an interview with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis this week, Burns repeatedly lied about Democrats’ nationwide attempts to legalize ending the lives of preborn babies through all nine months of pregnancy. 



Burns kicked off the interview by questioning whether DeSantis would veto national pro-life legislation that would limit or effectively ban abortion in all states. 



“We will be a pro-life president, and we will support pro-life policies,” DeSantis reassured her. “I would not allow what a lot of the left wants to do which is to override pro-life protections throughout the country, all the way up really until the moment of birth in some instances, which I think is infanticide.”



Burns claimed DeSantis’ answer was a “misrepresentation of what’s happening” since only a small percentage of total abortions happen in later trimesters. 



“There’s no evidence of Democrats pushing for abortions up until [birth],” Burns insisted. 




Let's talk about how NBC's Dasha Burns is lying here.@RonDeSantis notes he'd oppose what ""the left wants to do, which is to override pro-life protections"" & allow abortions"" up to birth, but Burns says ""that's a misrepresentation"" & only ""1.3% of abortions"" are late-term. pic.twitter.com/GAO5E045hT— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) August 7, 2023
“But their view is — their view is, is that all the way up until that, there should not be any legal protections —” DeSantis began. He was quickly interrupted by Burns who once again claimed “there’s no indication of Democrats pushing for that.”



The interview, against DeSantis’ better judgment, was pre-taped, meaning the televised segment ended there. Thanks to a premature splice by producers, viewers were primed to accept Burns’ matter-of-fact fib as reality instead of hearing the governor’s further rebuttal to her lies. 



An extended cut of the conversation, which was posted hours after NBC highlighted DeSantis’ answer in clips, proves DeSantis accurately diagnosed Democrats’ extremist abortion agenda. DeSantis pointed to states like California, which amended its state constitution in 2022 using a vaguely worded proposition that would easily allow for abortions through all nine months of pregnancy.



California isn’t the only state that attempted to legalize abortion through the third trimester with legislation and ballot measures. Maine, Minnesota, Colorado, New York, Alaska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont all have laws or constitutional amendments that include language allowing abortions throughout gestation. Oftentimes, the provision is subjectively hinged on a medical professional’s judgment.



In some states like Virginia, Republicans were able to stop their leftist counterparts’ plans to enshrine abortion up to and during birth in the state’s constitution. Other states such as Ohio are fighting off outsiders’ attempts to allow for sweeping pro-abortion laws. 



Federal legislators, too, have tried to codify unlimited abortion for all states. Some Democrats even urged their colleagues to ignore the restraints of the filibuster so the measure would pass. 



Yet again, Burns insisted that Democrats “have not instituted that policy.”



“Yeah they have,” DeSantis retorted. “They’ll use like different ways to really have a wide exception for it.”



Burns quickly switched gears to claim that abortions well into gestation are “extremely rare.” DeSantis acknowledged that late-term abortion may not be the norm now but doubled down on the fact that Democrats desperately want to make it that way.



“The left in this country has moved on from a position that said ‘you know what, we do want to discourage abortion, it’s not something that’s a good thing,’ to now viewing it more as a positive good for society,” DeSantis said. “And I think most Americans, regardless of how they feel on legal protections, I don’t think most Americans think it’s a positive good for society. It’s obviously a tragic circumstance.”



DeSantis is right. Only about 10 percent of Americans support demands to legalize abortion up until the moment of birth. The majority of voters, on the other hand, think abortion should at least be restricted to the first trimester. Forty-one percent say abortion is morally wrong. And slightly more than half of Americans support a 15-week abortion ban like the one Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced last year.



Americans’ trust in corporate media like NBC has plummeted to record lows. In fact, at least half of the country believes the press deliberately misleads them. That trust is further hampered when outlets twist abortion polls, lie about abortion laws, and enable Democrats’ extremism.

"352",352,"Women Deserve To Be Empowered By Doctors, Not Rushed To Medical Abortion Without Them","Bane","Susan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-04-03"," Picture this: A woman has an episode of chest pain. Another has numbness in her right arm and leg. A third woman finds a lump in her breast. And another has an unexpected positive pregnancy test.



Each of these women likely has questions: Am I having a heart attack? Am I having a stroke? Do I have breast cancer? Should I deliver my baby or have an abortion?



Each of these women deserves to be empowered with information. And in today’s health-care system, the first three patients are unanimously told “go see your doctor.” Yet, the one with the unplanned pregnancy is frequently told to do just the opposite. Instead, minimal federal requirements encourage her to seek a self-managed chemical abortion and obtain drugs online, by mail, or by other means that remove her from the doctor-patient relationship.



But expecting mothers deserve attentive medical care too.



I’ve helped women deliver thousands of babies in my 25 years as a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist. In my current role as the medical director at a medical clinic in Wilson, North Carolina, I care for women of all backgrounds facing unplanned pregnancies. My goal with each patient is to support and empower mothers and their families with compassionate and professional medical care.



Biden Pushes Dangerous At-Home Drugs



Chemical abortions involve the use of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol to induce an abortion. Sadly, this abortion regimen is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use up to 10 weeks of gestation. What’s worse is that use of these abortion drugs is increasing. 



Just this year the Department of Justice announced the U.S. Postal Service can continue to deliver prescribed abortion drugs, even in states where abortion access has been restricted. Similarly, the FDA changed a rule to allow abortion drugs to be dispensed at retail pharmacies, and state laws restricting the dispensing of the drugs have been challenged in court.



These developments do a great disservice to women by removing the opportunity for them to receive information that can empower them to make informed decisions. This is especially true when the dangers of self-administered abortion are considered.



Risk of No Ultrasound



“Treating” an unintended pregnancy by self-managed chemical abortion not only kills an unborn child but can have life-threatening consequences for the mother. Two health risks associated with abortion drugs come from a lack of ultrasound screening, something easily accessible at a pregnancy resource center medical clinic like the one where I see patients. Women can often obtain same-day appointments and free ultrasounds at these clinics. 



Ultrasounds are necessary to accurately date pregnancies. Women often do not accurately recall the date of their last menstrual period, causing many to miscalculate how many weeks pregnant they are at the time of their positive pregnancy test. The problem is chemical abortion drugs are intended for use only within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. Those who use the drugs beyond that time unknowingly risk severe hemorrhaging and other complications.



Ultrasounds are also needed to screen for ectopic pregnancy, a condition that endangers the life of the mother. The drugs used to induce an abortion do not treat ectopic pregnancy. Instead, women who self-administer their chemical abortion drugs without an ultrasound also risk delayed detection and treatment of ectopic pregnancies, increasing the risk of greater internal bleeding and death.



Women deserve holistic care from a doctor who can discuss their history, perform a physical exam, order tests, and discuss treatment options, including the risks, benefits, alternatives, side effects, and costs involved. Medical practitioners can and must provide better care for women who look to them for guidance. Denying them thorough care is nothing more than a disservice to women, who deserve excellent medical attention that empowers them with more information and solutions, not fewer.

"353",353,"Wife Of Judge Blocking Pro-Life Videos Is A Proud Abortion Supporter","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-08-03"," The federal judge who late Friday granted a temporary restraining order against the release of recordings made at an annual meeting of abortion providers wasn’t just appointed by President Barack Obama, the most extreme proponent of abortion ever to hold the White House. He was also one of President Obama’s top fundraisers, a bundler who raised at least $200,000 for Obama and donated $30,800 to committees supporting him, according to Public Citizen.
Judge William H. Orrick, III, granted the injunction just hours after the order was requested by the National Abortion Federation.
Orrick’s wife, Caroline “Linie” Farrow Orrick, is a clown and artist with an interest in outdoor athletic endeavors. She partners with her husband in their political decisions and she is his co-bundler according to Public Citizen. She’s also a public supporter of extreme abortion policies.
Her YouTube user page shows that the first video she ever “liked” was from an extreme pro-abortion group called the Center for Reproductive Justice. The slick, celebrity-laden video called for people to sign a “bill of rights” that asserts a right to abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy, a position shared by very few Americans. It further calls for taxpayer funding of contraception, abortifacients and abortion. And, finally, it says that all health care plans should be required under penalty of law to cover abortion, abortifacients, and other anti-reproductive services — even if they have religious objections such as those held by the Little Sisters of the Poor.

Was that a stray “like”? Well, her Facebook page also shows a pattern of liking other extreme groups. Here’s her current profile picture, which is designed to show support for the Supreme Court’s Obergefell ruling that declared same-sex marriage is a Constitutional right.

Among the groups she “likes” on Facebook is one called “Keep America Pro-Choice.” The pro-abortion Facebook community page appears to be an “astroturf” operation, such as the ones known to be set up by Planned Parenthood’s crisis public relations firm SKDKnickerbocker. No official group is affiliated with it and the only identification of the group is a Yahoo.com email address. Recent posts include a call for taxpayer funding of abortion, support for Planned Parenthood, defenses of harvesting organs from aborted babies (the very subject matter of the videos in Judge Orrick’s order), attacks on Scott Walker, attacks on pro-lifers, and general extreme support for abortion.

Mrs. Orrick is also a fan of Obamacare, which is a Facebook community run by “BarackObama.com,” otherwise known as Organizing for Action. When Obamacare was debated, supporters claimed the massive legislation would not support abortion. They may have argued that in part because taxpayer funding of abortion is one of the least popular ideas around. At the time Obamacare was being debated, one poll showed voters opposed it 72% to 23%. But it turns out that Obamacare does subsidize abortion, according to the Government Accountability Office, which is one reason why Planned Parenthood was such an ardent supporter of the legislation. Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the country, performing more than 300,000 abortions each year.

One of the more alarming “likes” on Mrs. Orrick’s Facebook page is of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, which are basically a campy gay version of Westboro Baptists. The group has been around San Francisco for 35 years, beginning when a few men obtained nun habits under false pretense. Members adopt profane names and blaspheme Jesus Christ and the Christian church. Some twenty years ago, the group began an Easter Sunday pub crawl parodying the stations of the cross, and sending up the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and other saints revered by Christians. They end the event by mocking the Eucharist with vanilla wafers and Jägermeister. They also hold a “Hunky Jesus” contest where men compete to be the sexiest Jesus look-alike. The group also supports abortion and has partnered with Planned Parenthood in the past.

Many of Mrs. Orrick’s other social media affinities are of the standard liberal variety, such as Rachel Maddow, Vox and Greenpeace.

"355",355,"Indiana Mayor Blocks Pregnancy Center From Site Near Abortion Clinic","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-05-01"," In 1984, in a little blue house tucked quietly across the street from St. Joseph’s Hospital in downtown South Bend, Indiana, Notre Dame Professor Janet Smith opened the Women’s Care Center to serve women facing unplanned pregnancies. Since then, the Women’s Care Center has grown to be the nation’s largest pregnancy resource center, now with 28 locations in ten states. The Women’s Care Center still calls South Bend home, though, with the organization’s full-time volunteer president, Ann Manion, leading the growing nonprofit’s operations from the downtown location that years ago replaced the tiny house where the vision of providing tangible help to pregnant women began. For its latest expansion, the Women’s Care Center looked closer to home, seeking to open its newest facility in South Bend near the planned establishment of an abortion clinic to be run by the Texas-based Whole Women’s Health Alliance.  As is often the case when the Women’s Care Center opens a new location, it must jump through bureaucratic hoops, including zoning issues. Occasionally, when the Women’s Care Center moves into a state unfamiliar with the nonprofit’s reputation, city officials will sometimes push back against the pregnancy and family resource center, wrongly believing they intend to politicize abortion. But given the Women’s Care Center’s history with South Bend, one would be less likely to think its efforts to serve pregnant women and their babies would be thwarted by its own mayor. Yet that is exactly what happened on Friday when South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg vetoed a vote by the city’s Common Council to rezone the property intended to house the Women Care Center’s latest pregnancy and family resource center. The council’s vote to rezone the property followed the recommendation of the city’s Department of Community Investment staff, which concluded “a use more intense than single-family residential would be appropriate.” In a letter explaining his veto, Buttigieg portrayed his decision as guided by apolitical land-use principles, but he quickly exposed that politics—and lobbying by the abortion clinic—had driven his decision: “In my judgment, the neighborhood would not benefit from having the zoning law changed in order to place next door to each other two organizations with deep and opposite commitments on the most divisive social issue of our time.” He added, “Whole Women’s Health Alliance has written to express the view that they would be harmed by such a re-zoning. They cite research indicating that clinics in close proximity to crisis pregnancy center(sic) experience significantly higher rates of violence, threats, and harassment (21.7%) than those not near such a center (6.8%).”  Giving Babies Diapers Is Not a Threat It is beyond unfortunate that Buttigieg swallowed the slander that a neighboring Women’s Care Center location raises the risk of a threat to Whole Woman’s abortion facility. As a pregnancy and family resource center, Women’s Care focuses solely on providing concrete help to women facing unplanned pregnancies, offering pregnancy testing, ultrasounds, counseling, and baby supplies, such as cribs and diapers. The staff also assists clients with obtaining prenatal care and other necessary social services. But the care doesn’t stop when the baby is born: The Women’s Care Center offers bilingual parenting classes and books to fill homes with literacy, and provides goals counseling that allows parents to complete school, obtain jobs, and become self-sufficient. It also rewards parents with free shopping sprees in the Crib Club “stores,” stocked with new clothing and supplies for their fast-growing children. The Women’s Care Center also does not preach or proselytize—or judge or condemn—which is why most of its new clients come from word of mouth referrals from past or present clients. As stressed in a Friday statement condemning Buttigieg’s veto, University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins, who serves on the Women’s Care Center board, explained that “[i]t doesn’t engage in political advocacy, but provides compassionate, non-judgmental loving care to women most in need.” This reality, though, is even better expressed in the words of women helped by the Women’s Care Center. A woman named Auchanti wrote the council members to support the rezoning decision: “Women’s Care Center is a place that immediately makes you comfortable. My counselor talked to me about all my options. This was so important. I didn’t even realize I had options. All I knew was I could either abort or not. Nobody ever tells you what else is out there, what else you can do.”  “They were so helpful. You know, I’ve lived in a lot of cities, and they don’t have places like this. Ones that really help you. That tell you all your options. Most women in these situations have to keep it themselves, do it all on their own. But here, I had a counselor to listen and lots of support and help. Women’s Care Center even threw me my first baby shower! Please support this important organization for the west side.” No Violence Has Ever Materalized Nor has there ever ”been an instance of violence” in the resource center’s 34-year history, even though “they’ve been open right next to 22 abortion clinics,” as Jenny Hunsberger, the vice president of the Women’s Care Center, told WNDU. To assuage the mayor’s purported concerns, the Women’s Care Center provided a written commitment that it would prohibit protesting on its property. As several council members noted, the Women’s Care Center cannot prevent protests from the city’s right of way, but that goes to show opponents of the rezoning are disingenuous about their concerns because protestors can target the abortion clinic with or without the nearby presence of the pregnancy center. Instead, what Whole Women’s Health Alliance really fears is competition, because whenever the Women’s Care Center opens near an abortion clinic, the abortion provider’s bottom line suffers. For all the talk of being pro-“choice,” abortion activists such as Pro-Choice South Bend, which launched a last-minute petition campaign to push for the mayor’s veto, want to deprive women of the choice the Women’s Care Center offers: A choice for life. As Jenkins put it, “[f]ar from enhancing the harmony of the neighborhood,” Buttigieg’s veto “divides our community and diminishes opportunities for vulnerable women to have a real choice.” By locating next to abortion clinics, the Women’s Care Center is ideally situated to help young women when they are most in need or feel as if they have no choice. Sometimes they don’t, as one abortion clinic staff member discovered when slipped a note: “I AM BEING FORCED TO HAVE AN ABORTION. I WANT TO KEEP MY BABY.” Luckily, in that case, there was a Women’s Care Center across the street. The clinic worker, not sure where else to turn, came there. From there, the Women’s Care Center counselor took over followed their “protocols, including helping the young woman work it out with her family who was pressuring her. . . The next day, the [abortion clinic employee] called to say how impressed she was with the way our counselors handled the situation. She asked if she could turn to us again should the need arise.” ‘Let’s Judge Them on the Merits’ Common Council Vice President Oliver Davis also took issue with the mayor’s veto, telling the South Bend Tribune, “I’m concerned…now that a group can come before a zoning board and say, ‘We don’t like that group…so we don’t want them next to us.’” Davis is a self-described liberal who stressed during a Saturday afternoon interview that he participated in the Women’s March. For him, the issue is one of fairness. The zoning law must be applied equally, Davis said, explaining that’s his understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment and his guiding principle. If the Women’s Care Center “didn’t qualify [for the exemption], fine,” he said, “but they did,” adding that he’s a Democrat, but it isn’t a matter of party, but fairness—“let’s judge them on the merits.” If they sell out to national abortion politics, they may find themselves the victim of local politics. The Common Council could still override the mayor’s veto and Davis anticipates the issue to be revisited at the May 14 council meeting, at which he expects a packed house. Whether the Common Council will overturn the veto, Davis doesn’t know, noting he hasn’t talked with his colleagues yet about the issue, but he said he is open to an override vote. Whether all five yea votes stay yea, or all four no votes stay no, “Who knows?” He also noted there is still a remedy available in a court of law. But it might not come to that. It is an election year and the local backlash over Buttigieg’s veto has already begun. In addition to the condemnation from Notre Dame’s president, the bishop of the Fort Wayne-South Bend diocese, Kevin C. Rhoades, issued a statement criticizing the mayor’s decision, writing: “How unfortunate that the Women’s Care Center has been denied in its own hometown the opportunity to expand their compassionate services to a location where it could best reach the women who could benefit most.” Buttigieg may soon find he misjudged his local Democratic base, having spent the last year cultivating a national name by, among other things, running for chair of the Democratic National Committee, in pursuit of his end goal—something locals will readily tell you is the White House. But the extreme Left’s abortion-at-all-costs position that has overtaken the Democratic Party doesn’t resonate in the friendly confines of the working-class northern Indiana community where old-timers still bemoan the shuttering of Studebaker some 60 years ago. And the Common Council members who make their home in South Bend must live with their votes. If they sell out to national abortion politics, they may find themselves the victim of local politics. “We are deeply saddened that care for women and children in South Bend got caught up in politics,” said Women’s Care president Manion. “Two out of every three babies born in the city now start with Women’s Care Center. We know that whatever the council ultimately decides, we will continue to love and serve moms and babies who need us.” Disclosure: From 1996 – 2003, I served in various roles for the Women’s Care Center, including on its Board of Directors and as the nonprofit’s treasurer and secretary. From 2002 – 2008, I served on the Executive Advisory Board of the Women’s Care Center Foundation.

"356",356,"Why Abortion Clinics Hate Burying Aborted Children","LeCroy","Colin",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-12-12"," Beginning December 19, the irrepressible state of Texas will require hospitals and abortion facilities to provide for the “interment” of the “products of . . . induced human abortion.” In normal English, Texas will now require abortion clinics to bury the babies they killed. Previously, state regulation required abortion facilities treat the remains like other medical waste, such as tissue that was removed in surgery. And what seems a rather obvious requirement to so many Texans has the pro-abortion community—which exists in a near-constant state of outrage—fuming. Again.  Abortion advocates complain that the symbolism of the regulation is an effort to insert politicians’ “personal beliefs” into women’s health care decisions. The regulation certainly requires dead pre-born humans be treated like toddlers, teenagers, and senior citizens. Texas is recognizing that, at least for the purposes of burial, pre-born persons are equivalent to people with a birth certificate. Of course, this perception shouldn’t really be characterized as a “personal belief,” but more an observation of reality. If Aborted Babies Deserve A Burial, They Deserve A Life The law cuts through the sophistry that the pro-abortion community concocts to deny the obvious scientific reality that abortion is the premeditated killing of a living human being. Fetuses, prior to abortion, are 1) living, 2) human, and 3) separate persons. They’re not dead. They’re not clumps of tissue. And they have a physical and genetic existence separate from their mothers’. So they shouldn’t be treated like needles and bandages and tumors and ingrown toenails. The glaring shortcoming—and irony—of the law is that it recognizes the dignity of pre-born humans after they’re dead, while failing to take the more important step of recognizing their humanity while they’re still living. But this is the sort of intellectual imbecility our current jurisprudence produces. The problem is that the Supreme Court has determined the pre-born have no meaningful rights, preventing Texans from using our traditional democratic processes to reach a consensus about what rights of pre-born persons should be recognized and protected. Will the Roe v. Wade decision one day look like the Dred Scott case, the now-repudiated decision in which the Court determined that a slave had no meaningful rights? Many Texans had a visceral, reflexive reaction to what they saw in the Planned Parenthood videos last summer. They saw an abortion clinic owner joking about storing aborted fetuses in the freezer, putting them in a bonfire, and flushing them down the garbage disposal. But many see these as real, actual humans being aborted. Their humanity is undeniable. And we’re justifiably infuriated and in disbelief that any American could treat the weakest and most innocent of our society with such cruelty.  Will This Encourage More Conversations About Life? Of course, public support for the new regulation isn’t going to determine whether it remains in place. Abortion advocates assert that the new Texas regulation imposes a costly obstacle for women seeking an abortion and have indicated they will challenge it in court.  It’s impossible to know, at this point, whether such a challenge would work. The constitutional question is whether the regulation would present an “undue burden” on the ability of the mother to obtain an otherwise-legal abortion.  We will have to see how the state enforces the regulation and how clinics respond. How much will interment cost?  Will the required interment cost more than the sterile waste disposal procedures currently in place? The state, for its part, says the regulation won’t make an abortion cost more because it just changes the way it requires remains to be handled. Will the clinic pay that bill, or will it pass the cost on the mother?  If to the mother, does the cost prevent her from obtaining an abortion?  And if there’s a burden on the mother, is it “undue”?  That answer largely depends on the preconceptions of the judge making the decision. This regulation once again demonstrates we have a significant disagreement in this country about whether preborn persons have a right to life that should be protected, even against their mothers’ “right to privacy.” This isn’t a disagreement several Ivy League-educated, unelected lawyers should decide for the rest of us.

"358",358,"Poll: Majority Of Americans Still Reject Democrats’ Unlimited Abortion Agenda","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-06-16"," Democrats and their allies in the corporate media like to pretend that abortion polling offers a larger commentary on the state of the pro-life movement and the laws that ban ending life in the womb. In reality, those polls are often twisted by these same institutions to skew public opinion and obscure just how radical their abortion beliefs are. Take this Gallup abortion poll, conducted in May and released on Thursday, for example.  You wouldn’t know it from the headline, which boasts “Broader Support for Abortion Rights Continues Post-Dobbs,” but only 37 percent of U.S. adults believe abortion should be allowed during the second trimester. Despite Democrats’ incessant attempts to normalize their belief that taxpayers should fund abortions up until birth, only 22 percent of those polled said they supported ending life in the womb in the third trimester. Overall, a majority of Americans, 55 percent, think ending life in the womb in the second trimester should be “generally illegal.” An even bigger number, 70 percent, think abortion in the third trimester should be outlawed. “Democrats are the only group saying it should generally be legal in the second trimester,” the poll noted.  Corporate media, Democrats, and even some Republicans make a point to smear heartbeat laws and European-esque first-trimester limits as unpopular and ineffective. Yet, even Gallup’s poll accurately reflects that most Americans support a 15-week abortion ban like the one Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced last year, not Democrats’ abortion extremism. “Most Americans oppose abortion later in pregnancy,” Gallup admits. The pollster tried to couch this finding with reassurance that “within this broad framework, Americans have shifted toward more acceptance of abortion,” but even that isn’t completely accurate. It’s true that 69 percent of Americans reportedly think abortion should be legal in the first three months of pregnancy, which is up two percentage points after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision was leaked to the press. The biggest increase, however, happened within those who identify as “pro-life.”  In 2022, Gallup found that 39 percent of Americans identified as pro-life. Now, 44 percent do. Similarly, 38 percent of U.S. adults told Gallup last year that they believed abortion was “morally wrong.” This year, after nearly one year of post-Dobbs momentum, 41 percent of Americans say ending life in the womb is morally unacceptable. It’s important to remember that polling, especially on abortion, is far from perfect. As Federalist Senior Editor David Harsanyi once succinctly put it, “Abortion polls are garbage.” Questions about popular heartbeat bills are sold by pollsters as near-total bans on a woman’s so-called right to choose. When that framing is stripped, American opinions, specifically among Democrats, shift drastically toward the kinds of abortion limits Republican states and European countries have — the limits Democrats like President Joe Biden despise.

"359",359,"Report: U.S. Government Gave $1.89 Billion To Abortion Businesses Like Planned Parenthood","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-12-12"," Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to fund ending life in the womb, but a new report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) says the federal government shelled out Americans’ hard-earned money to subsidize the domestic and global abortion industry.



GAO initiated the 60-page report at the request of nearly 150 congressional Republicans led by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Rep. Chris Smith, and Rep. Vicky Hartzler in January 2022. The agency’s previous report, spanning fiscal years 2016 to 2018, tracked nearly $2 billion in government spending directly to the pockets of several abortion activist groups.



The latest GAO report obtained by The Federalist that abortion organizations like Planned Parenthood, International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), MSI Reproductive Choices, and at least four U.S. abortion facilities received a combined total of $1.89 billion through grants, agreements, loans, and programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance between 2019 and 2021.



At Home



Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), the nation’s largest abortion business, which committed 1.11 million murders in utero between 2019 and 2021, collected the largest share of funds, $1.78 billion.



Most of PPFA’s funding, $1.53 billion, came from Medicaid, Medicare, and Children’s Health Insurance Program reimbursements, with another $148.5 million coming from “cooperative agreements” and grants like those from the Title X Family Planning Program. It wasn’t until the Trump administration enacted its Protect Life rule in 2019, prohibiting taxpayer dollars from funding programs that refer or provide abortion or share a physical space with abortionists, that PPFA stopped accepting Title X grants.



This protest continued until 2021 when the Biden administration rescinded the Trump policy and promised 373 percent more funds to Planned Parenthood in 2022.



The report found that the remaining $90.41 million in taxpayer dollars funneled to Planned Parenthood was pulled by the federal government from the Paycheck Protection Program to keep the abortion provider in business during Covid lockdowns. More than three dozen Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country took advantage of the program “designed to provide a direct incentive for small businesses to keep their workers on payroll.”



When the Small Business Administration asked the affiliates to return the funds because they were “ineligible for a PPP loan under the applicable affiliation rules and size standards, consistent with Congressional intent,” some Planned Parenthood branches refused to return the money. The SBA continued approving loans for other Planned Parenthood affiliates even after acknowledging that PPFA did not qualify for the loan program because its networks of tens of thousands of employees far exceed the 500-employee limit set by Congress.



Four unnamed domestic, regional abortion businesses also received a combined $107.74 million in taxpayer dollars to continue their services, including ending life in the womb.



Abroad



An overwhelming majority of Americans across all political affiliations say they oppose funding overseas abortions, but that didn’t stop the federal government from handing Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger’s global abortion activist organization and MSI Reproductive Choices millions of dollars.



IPPF received $2.03 million from 2019 to 2021. The money fueled IPPF’s mission to “supply and support safe and legal abortion services and care,” including thousands of chemical abortions around the world.



Democrat administrations are good for abortion advocates like IPPF, which is why it raked in millions of tax dollars during President Barack Obama’s last year in office alone. Federal funding to IPPF, however, fell drastically after the Trump administration reinstated a rule barring the transfer of taxpayer dollars to organizations that touted ending life in the womb in 2017. 



The abortion organization reported forfeiting close to $100 million in federal funding, which contributed to a 42 percent decrease in “member services” such as abortions because it refused to abide by the rule.



Funding for organizations like IPPF is only expected to increase since President Joe Biden rescinded the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, more commonly known as the Mexico City policy, during his first month in office. Now, organizations like IPPF no longer have to choose between millions in grants and performing abortions in 146 countries across the globe.



MSI Reproductive Choices, known for promoting and committing abortions in 37 countries, also received $1.35 million in tax dollars in 2019 to fuel its global strategy goal of fulfilling 1 in every 3 abortions.



MSI did not receive federal funding in 2020 or 2021 but continues to thrive off of the millions of dollars funneled to it previously.



“It is appalling that big abortion providers are continuing to receive billions of dollars in federal taxpayer funding,” Blackburn said in a statement. “While small businesses struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic, Planned Parenthood illegally siphoned over $90 million from the Paycheck Protection Program, specifically designed to help our mom and pop shops keep their doors open. The American people want their tax dollars spent responsibly and in line with our nation’s values — not on the Left’s abortion-on-demand agenda. I will never stop fighting to protect the unborn and end taxpayer-funded support for the abortion industry.” 



“Federal taxpayer dollars should not be funneled to big abortion corporations like Planned Parenthood, which has killed over 9.3 million unborn children since 1970, including 1.11 million between 2019-2021,” Rep. Chris Smith, co-chair of the House Pro-Life Caucus, added. “This money would have been better spent helping the businesses that were forced to close or providing comprehensive medical support for both women and children.”

"360",360,"Biden’s State Of The Union Will Feature Abortion, IVF Lies Designed To Hide Democrats’ Extremism","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-03-07"," President Joe Biden and his Democrat allies in Congress plan to use his 2024 State of the Union address to advance their abortion and assisted reproductive technology for all agenda by fearmongering about pro-life policies.



A White House memo published on Thursday warned that Biden’s Thursday night speech in the House chamber will be laced with lies designed to distract from Democrats’ extremism on life in the womb.



“President Joe Biden wants abortion rights to be a centerpiece of his rematch with Donald Trump this fall,” Politico confirmed in its SOTU preview on Thursday morning.



‘Abortion For All’



During his 2023 State of the Union, Biden tried to paint life-saving legislation in Republican states as “extreme” because it limits women’s ability to kill their unborn babies. He also mischaracterized congressional Republicans’ attempt to bring U.S. abortion law up to speed with other civilized countries by outlawing abortion beyond 15 weeks gestation as a “national abortion ban.”



Introducing an abortion limits bill that nearly 7 in 10 Americans agree with is not extreme. But what is extreme would be voting on sweeping legislation that goes far beyond “codifying Roe v. Wade,” as Biden promised during the 2022 midterms, to legalize unlimited, on-demand abortion through all nine months in all 50 states.



Yet, Biden plans to make the same claim, that “millions of Americans are living under extreme state abortion bans,” on Thursday night.



Part of his strategy is inviting Kate Cox, a Texas woman who left the state to abort her unborn baby who received a daunting medical diagnosis in the womb, to be the First Lady’s honored guest during the address.



Cox’s presence is supposed to give Biden the ammo he needs to spread lies about current and future pro-life states and policies. He’s likely going to claim that Republicans want red-state residents like Cox to endure “forced pregnancy,” a manipulative and inaccurate term.



Every pro-life law on the books permits medical professionals to treat ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, or any other potentially fatal complications. Even after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling, which Democrats often blame as a catalyst for pro-life policies, 48 of the 50 states maintain clear exceptions for induced abortion if a mother’s life is in serious jeopardy. At least 15 of those states also have exceptions for abortions in the case of rape, incest, or if the baby in the womb has been diagnosed with a condition that will likely prove deadly.



Yet, Biden will use Cox’s story to scare voters into believing they will be tossed aside if they have any pregnancy complications. He will claim that, even though 96 percent of abortions end the life of a healthy unborn baby for an elective, not medically necessary, reason, pro-life laws are “putting women’s health and lives at risk and threatening doctors with jail time, including life in prison, for providing the health care they have been trained to provide.”



Cox decided to selectively abort her unborn baby, who received a Trisomy 18 diagnosis, a sometimes fatal genetic condition that leads to an array of mental and physical complications, in 2023. She argued that carrying a child who might not live past birth put her at risk of “infection” and “uterine rupture” that could impair or prevent future pregnancies.



Texas law permits abortions to save the mother’s life or to prevent “substantial impairment of major bodily function.” When Cox’s doctors refused to grant her request to abort, they effectively confirmed that carrying a baby girl to term, even if she would not survive, did not put Cox’s life in imminent danger.



Cox partnered with abortion advocacy group Center For Reproductive Rights to challenge Texas’ pro-life law, which bans abortion beyond six weeks gestation. The Texas Supreme Court quickly ruled Cox did not qualify for an abortion under the Lone Star State code. By then, Cox had already traveled across state lines to find someone who would end her unborn child’s life without scrutiny.

ART For All, Too



Biden won’t stop his blame game with abortion. After touting “abortion for all,” Biden also plans to lament the Alabama Supreme Court, which recently determined embryos qualify under the state’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, as the culprit for an industry-wide halt on in vitro fertilization in the Cotton State.



“Republicans’ extreme out-of-touch agenda has put access to fertility treatments at risk for families who are desperately trying to get pregnant,” the White House wrote. 



Contrary to the White House’s claims, the Alabama court’s controversial ruling never addressed how Big Fertility in the state should approach ART or embryo creation. In reality, fertility facilities chose to pause their IVF operations after independently determining that serially creating and discarding unlimited embryos might put them on the legal hook for negligence.



Yet, Biden will use Jill Biden’s State of the Union guest Latorya Beasley, a woman whose embryo transfer was canceled by their Alabama provider, as justification to eviscerate pro-life decisions that “disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.” 



He will invoke Democrats’ radical ART legislation, which was blocked last week by Republican Sen. Cindy-Hyde Smith, in an attempt to shift more ire to state and national Republicans’ pro-life policies, even if they have nothing to do with IVF.



By inexplicably linking the abortion fight to the recent controversy over ART, Biden is doing pro-life Republicans, if they choose to grasp it, a favor. He’s not only exposing the hypocrisy of Democrats’ extremism on unborn babies, but he’s offering ultimate confirmation that this fight isn’t about caring for women or children. It’s about allowing the murder or creation of children at whatever whim and cost.

"361",361,"Florida Supreme Court Rules To Allow Deceptive Abortion Amendment On November Ballot","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-04-02"," The Florida Supreme Court ruled this week to allow a deceptive abortion amendment that calls for the codification of unlimited abortion through birth in the state’s constitution on the ballot in November. Attorney General Ashley Moody asked the state court last year to weigh in on the amendment touted by baby-killing ballot measure advocates like the ACLU and abortion giant Planned Parenthood.  The amendment titled “Limit Government Interference with Abortion” states, “No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” A ballot summary claims, “This amendment does not change the Legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.” Moody, however, warned the amendment’s vague reference to viability and undefined use of the terms “health” and “healthcare provider” could easily deceive voters who overwhelmingly oppose the legalization of killing unborn babies throughout all nine months of gestation. “The ballot summary here is part of a … design to lay ticking time bombs that will enable abortion proponents later to argue that the amendment has a much broader meaning than voters would ever have thought,” Moody wrote in her brief. Several local and national pro-life groups — including Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, the National Center for Life and Liberty, Florida Voters Against Extremism, and the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops — filed support briefs expressing similar concerns.  “The ballot language incorrectly implies that the amendment will not impact parental rights when their children seek abortions. Currently, Florida requires parental consent, with limitedexceptions, before a physician can perform an abortion on a minor,” SBA Pro-Life America wrote in its brief. “If the proposed amendment passes, this statute will likely be another casualty. The loss of parental consent is obscured in the ballot language, which highlights that the proposed amendment will not change the constitutional right to parental notification—leading voters to assume that the right to parental consent will be similarly untouched.” In a 4 to 3 ruling split by sex, the Florida Supreme Court’s male justices ignored concerns about abortion activists’ deceptive practices, including submitting fraudulent signatures to reject Moody’s request. Thanks to the court’s rubber stamp, a proposed amendment littered with confusing language threatens not only Floridians’ parental rights but also the state’s ability to regulate abortion will go before voters in seven months. In her dissent, Justice Meredith Sasso, joined by Justices Jamie Grosshans and Renatha Francis, criticized the proposed amendment as “vague and ambiguous” and said sponsors failed to “‘explain’ the material legal effects of the proposed ballot amendment” per state law.  “Instead, the Sponsor has punted, leaving the legal effect to be revealed by the eye of the beholder. The Sponsor’s statutory obligation, as explained by this Court’s precedent, demands more,” she wrote. Sasso is right. Loose terms like “viability” can easily be exploited to ensure the subjective judgment of a doctor gets the final say. If the proposed amendment passes in November, medical professionals in Florida could deem abortion at any stage of pregnancy necessary for a woman’s “health,” physical, emotional, or other. [RELATED: Abortion Radicals Will Expand Their Schemes From Ohio To Your State. Here’s How To Be Ready] The state Supreme Court’s actions this week weren’t a complete loss. Justices also issued a ruling allowing Florida’s 15-week abortion limit, which a strong majority of Americans support, to stand. A heartbeat law, which passed last year, is expected to lower that extend that limit to six weeks gestation on May 1. That law, however, will mean nothing if the proposed amendment passes in November. “We must oppose Prop 4. Not only will this measure bring dangerous late-term abortions back to Florida, but it will allow girls who aren’t old enough to get their ears pierced on their own get an abortion without a parent’s okay,” SBA Pro-Life America’s State Policy Director Katie Daniel said in a statement. “Those girls and the women who have abortions will be put at risk when this measure eliminates every abortion health regulation on the books. In a state where 25% of abortion centers failed inspections it’s no surprise they want to be completely unregulated to increase their profits at the expense of women, girls and babies.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2024/04/02/florida-supreme-court-rules-to-allow-deceptive-abortion-amendment-on-november-ballot/",0.8361,0.1639,"male",2012,2012
"363",363,"Texas Sues Biden Admin For Using Pharmacies As Pawns In Its Illegal Abortion-For-All Scheme","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-02-09"," Texas is suing the Biden administration for using pharmacies to sidestep pro-life laws in red states and further its abortion-for-all agenda. 



The lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Tuesday, seeks to combat the Biden administration’s “war against Dobbs v. Jackson” by blocking the Department of Health and Human Services from forcing drug vendors such as Walgreens and CVS to fill fatal abor­tion pills — especially in states where those pills are illegal. 



“The Biden Administration knows that it has no legal authority to institute this radical abortion agenda, so now it’s trying to intimidate every pharmacy in America by threatening to withhold federal funds,” Paxton said in a statement. “It’s not going to work. Texas and several other states across the country have dutifully passed laws to protect the unborn, and we are not going to back down just because unelected bureaucrats in Washington want to create illegal, extremist federal policies.”  






Mere weeks after the Supreme Court released its Dobbs v. Jackson decision in June 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services debuted guidance to the “roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies,” claiming that refusal to fill prescriptions like abortion pills would violate federal civil rights laws. Pharmacies that failed to comply with the Biden administration’s attempt to execute its abortion-on-demand agenda, HHS warned, could lose their federal funding. 



This year, the Food and Drug Administration, at the behest of the White House, also worked to match the Biden administration’s post-Roe activism by quietly scaling back its regulation of the abortion pill, which includes myriad safety concerns. 



Abortion pills such as mifepristone, which are responsible for more than half of the nation’s abortions, are known to cause a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits. One longitudinal study revealed that, in at least 17 states with taxpayer-funded abortion, many of which have relaxed chemical abortion laws, emergency room visits within 30 days following chemical abortions grew to nearly 34 percent of all ER visits as of 2015. The same study concluded that “chemical abortion is consistently and progressively associated with more postabortion ER visit morbidity than surgical abortion,” and the risks have been increasing year after year.



Now that the FDA and HHS have opened the door for CVS, Walgreens, and others to dispense the dangerous drug, those numbers are only expected to rise. 



During his recent State of the Union address, President Joe Biden smeared states like Texas for “enforcing extreme abortion bans” and promised to do “everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy.”



Texas, however, says the Biden administration’s attempt to do dirty work through federal agencies not only “usurps pharmacies’ duty to comply with Texas law” but “is both procedurally and substantively illegal.”



“Whether the Biden Administration likes it or not, the question of abortion is up to thepeople’s elected representatives—not unelected bureaucrats,” the lawsuit states. 



Paxton’s office noted in a press release that federal anti-discrimination laws have never been used to force companies to participate in the process of ending an unborn child’s life. 



“Rather, these protections have cut in the opposite direction by prohibiting any person or entity from being compelled to aid in the provision of abortions,” the release states. 



Paxton was also one of the 20 state attorneys general to sign a letter on Feb. 1 warning CVS and Walgreens against cooperating with the Biden administration’s “bizarre interpretation” of a federal law that actually prohibits the mailing of abortion drugs.



“We emphasize that it is our responsibility as State Attorneys General to uphold the law and protect the health, safety, and well-being of women and unborn children in our states,” they wrote in the letter reminding companies the mailed medication is illegal. “Part of that responsibility includes ensuring that companies like yours are fully informed of the law so that harm does not come to our citizens.”

"364",364,"The Real Reason Planned Parenthood Trashes OTC Birth Control","Krumholz","Willis","L.",NA,NA,NA,"2015-06-10"," “While there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion as justifiable if recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization.” — Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood (Planned Parenthood performs about a third of the 1.1 million abortions that occur in the United States every year). GOP Sens. Cory Gardner and Kelly Ayotte have recently proposed a bill that provides incentives for birth-control pill manufacturers to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter (OTC) status. Oddly enough, Planned Parenthood objects.  Planned Parenthood claims that the proposed bill would gut the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) birth-control mandate. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said, “This bill is a sham and an insult to women… It would give women fewer birth control options and force women to pay twice for their birth control.” In response, Reason’s Elizabeth Nolan Brown aptly pointed out that the bill was no such thing: (1) just because one type of birth-control pill is available OTC doesn’t mean all forms of the pill will be; (2) just because a drug is OTC doesn’t mean it can’t also be available via a prescription (think of allergy drugs); (3) there’s no reason to think the birth-control mandate doesn’t cover OTC contraception (it already covers Plan B, which is OTC); and (4) the ACA’s birth-control mandate does nothing for poor uninsured women, who have the most to gain from OTC access (women on Medicaid already had full birth-control coverage, and the mandate only applies to private insurance). In short, despite Planned Parenthood’s rhetoric about looking out for women, its opposition to the Gardner-Ayotte bill appears baseless. Brown muses that the mere possibility of removing the ACA’s mandate makes a highly-politicized Planned Parenthood reject the proposed bill. S.E. Cupp believes Planned Parenthood is rejecting the Gardner-Ayotte proposal because Republicans authored it. National Review’s Jillian Kay Melchior believes Planned Parenthood opposes the measure because it “makes” $1.2 billion per year from contraceptive services (actually, the organization’s total revenue is about $1.2 billion a year). But there is a much deeper explanation, driven by the rational behavior of an organization seeking to maximize financial gain. To begin to understand why Planned Parenthood opposes OTC birth control, one must look to an obscure New York Times article from the mid-90s, which details post-Soviet Romania’s miserable abortion-culture.  The Romanian Connection In 1995, Romania had 2.2 abortions for every live birth. Minimal consumer-choice at the state-run system, coupled with low payouts to health professionals when they provided birth control and high rewards when they provided abortions, allowed the state-run system to undersupply birth control and oversupply abortion, causing untold misery for Romanian women. That same foul cocktail applies to poor, disproportionately minority women in urban areas attempting to access family planning in today’s America. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), a government agency, says that between 2007 and 2010, nearly 36 percent of all abortions in the United States were performed on black fetuses, even though blacks make up only 12.8 percent of the population. Overall, more than half of American abortions between 2007 and 2010 were of minority fetuses.   Poverty alone is not the explanation: there are almost twice as many poor whites as there are poor blacks in America, yet black women who live below the federal poverty line contribute to 14 percent of the nation’s abortions, while poor white women contribute to only 11.7 percent of the nation’s abortions. The real explanation is found in identifying this group’s family-planning provider, and that provider’s incentives. Inadequate Contraceptive Access The Left always reminds us of the correlation between unplanned pregnancies and the abortion rate, and points out that greater birth-control access among the poor would stem the tide of abortion. After billions of dollars funding contraceptive access for poor women with high unintended pregnancy rates to show for it, the Left now says that if conservatives really cared about abortion, we would advocate for greater use of Long-Acting-Reversible-Contraceptives (LARCs), such as the intrauterine device (IUD).  According to the Left’s story-telling, poor women deal with unique stresses that make it hard for them to rely on traditional forms of birth control, and this explains why traditional birth-control methods have been relatively ineffective for poor women, as compared to their better-off peers. If these devices carry a prohibitive cost and destroy human embryos, too bad for taxpayers, and too bad for religious conservatives. Yet the Left (as usual) has a problem. This line of analysis doesn’t begin to explain why the rate of unplanned pregnancies among America’s poor rose dramatically in the mid-90s (see chart). Did the stress associated with poverty dramatically increase?  As well-off women saw rates of unintended pregnancies continue to decline, women of lesser means saw their unintended pregnancy rate skyrocket. According to the American Prospect, the average abortion patient used to be “[a] middle-class, white high-school or college student with no children whose bright future could be derailed by motherhood,” while today she is more likely “a twenty something single mother of color.” An unexplained “[l]oss of [birth control] access for poorer [minority] women” occurred in the 1990s. What if the primary provider of that birth control access is to blame? According to The Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood’s research arm, “minority women, women who are poor, and women with little education are more likely than women overall to report dissatisfaction with either their contraceptive method or provider.” Oddly enough, Planned Parenthood is the primary provider of family planning for poor, disproportionately minority, urban women. In other words, the Left is right about birth-control access being substandard among certain populations, but wrong about everything else. What if the primary provider of that birth control access is to blame? Remember the high rate of black abortions in America? If poor black women disproportionately rely on a certain provider because they are disproportionately located in urban areas (due to federal housing policies of the ’50s and ’60s that concentrated poor blacks in urban areas), it would make sense that this provider’s actions would disproportionately affect poor blacks. So Planned Parenthood’s veiled opposition to OTC birth-control pills would be rational, if it depended upon reduced consumer choice among its target market. The following details the similarities between mid-90s Romania and Planned Parenthood’s services to poor women in modern-day urban U.S.A. How Planned Parenthood Reduces Consumer Choice Romanian women in the mid-90s faced little consumer choice, and Planned Parenthood’s target market experiences reduced consumer choice. 1. Planned Parenthood Dominates Urban Areas After Roe v. Wade, abortion became one of the most unregulated areas of American commerce. Low barriers to entry and high profit margins led providers to flood the market. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, decided in 1992, allowed states to regulate the abortion industry more closely, to ensure that women made more informed decisions before having abortions, and also to better protect women’s health. After Casey, Planned Parenthood’s abortion market share increased dramatically, to commanding a third of the U.S. market today. When states began regulating abortion within the limits Casey had defined, the fixed costs associated with providing abortions began rising in the early ’90s. This pushed many non-specialized providers out of the market, and gave Planned Parenthood a dominant position in abortion market-share. Before Casey, Planned Parenthood’s abortion market share was flat year-on-year, holding less than a tenth of the market. After Casey, Planned Parenthood’s abortion market share increased dramatically, to commanding a third of the U.S. market today (or 40 percent of all reported abortions). Planned Parenthood’s revenues reflected this growth: though flat in the early ’90s, it saw a consistent yearly uptick after the Casey decision. Amy Hagstrom-Miller, operator of an independent chain of abortion clinics in Texas and Maryland, was quoted saying, “This is not the Planned Parenthood we all grew up with… they now have more of a business approach, much more aggressive… [t]hey’re not unlike other big national chains… They put local independent businesses in a tough situation.” According to The Wall Street Journal, “Ms. Hagstrom-Miller competes with Planned Parenthood for abortion patients – and finds it deeply frustrating… She does not receive the government grants or tax-deductible contributions that bolster Planned Parenthood, and says she can’t match the nonprofit’s budget for advertising or clinic upgrades … She has carved her own niche by touting her care as more holistic — and by charging $425 for a first-trimester surgery at her Austin clinic, compared with $475 at the local Planned Parenthood.” As the number of abortion providers dropped, more providers located in densely populated urban areas, where fixed costs could be offset by higher volumes. Consolidation in the U.S. abortion industry also had geographic consequences. As the number of abortion providers dropped, more providers located in densely populated urban areas, where fixed costs could be offset by higher volumes. Title X also assists Planned Parenthood’s focus on urban areas (no matter whether a Planned Parenthood clinic provides actual abortion-services or just abortion referral). Passed by Congress and signed by President Nixon in 1970, Title X offers grants for organizations that provide birth control to low-income women. Title X creates a further incentive for urban location, as grant amounts are predicated on the provider’s proximity to poor populations (the closer a Title X grantee is to the greatest number of poor people, the larger the grant amount). Almost a third of Title X expenditure goes to Planned Parenthood, its biggest recipient, to the tune of $70 million as of 2010. 2. Planned Parenthood Targets Poor Women Who Depend on Publicly Funded Care Poor and minority women in urban areas—the women experiencing high rates of unintended pregnancies—are Planned Parenthood’s customer base. Seventy-nine percent of Planned Parenthood patients have incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. The “vast majority” of the organization’s female patients lack private health insurance, meaning they rely on Medicaid (federal and state-sponsored health insurance for the poor) or are uninsured. Planned Parenthood brags that “only 3% of Planned Parenthood patients can afford the full cost of their care and, for many, Planned Parenthood functions as their primary care provider.” In many urban areas, Planned Parenthood is one of the few providers that accepts Medicaid. For a poor woman who is uninsured, her primary hope of family planning services is a Title X-funded clinic. This clinic is likely to be a Planned Parenthood affiliate, as Planned Parenthood receives the largest portion of Title X funding. This means uninsured women have little choice about where they receive family planning services. A Guttmacher study found that 6 in 10 women who visited a “specialty contraceptive clinic” (a Title X grantee) considered the clinic their “usual source of medical care.” Four in 10 women surveyed considered the clinic their “only source of health care.” The study (which included 22 clinics) only targeted communities known to have multiple Title X grantees, or “safety-net providers.” This means the proportion of women for whom Planned Parenthood clinics are their only avenue to healthcare is probably much higher nationally. If a poor woman of childbearing age doesn’t have private insurance but is insured, she receives Medicaid. In many urban areas, Planned Parenthood is one of the few providers that accepts Medicaid. The absence of competition here is due to two factors. First, Medicaid’s under-compensation of doctors and hospitals leads most medical providers to reject Medicaid altogether. In urban areas, where there is likely to be a higher-than-average concentration of Medicaid recipients, a provider’s incentive to not accept Medicaid is magnified. (By the way, this inherent flaw in Medicaid explains recent stories of emergency-room visits rising after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion). Planned Parenthood can uniquely afford to accept Medicaid because it also receives Title X, a funding source other potential providers either don’t receive or don’t receive to the same degree. Second, Planned Parenthood can uniquely afford to accept Medicaid because it also receives Title X, a funding source other potential non-specialized health providers (hospitals, etc.) either don’t receive or don’t receive to the same degree. Some conservatives have long accused Title X of freeing up more money for abortions. More accurately, Title X serves as an extra incentive for Planned Parenthood to accept Medicaid. Title X tops-up Medicaid’s subpar payouts by not only covering fixed costs but also allowing Title X grantees to receive special Medicaid pricing. Planned Parenthood lobby groups specifically point out that Title X is necessary because Medicaid doesn’t provide adequate compensation for their services. So both Title X and Medicaid are necessary for Planned Parenthood to remain viable. Planned Parenthood, a billion-dollar organization, receives almost half of its yearly funding from government: $540 million in fiscal year 2013, of which $70 million (as of 2011) comes from Title X and $387 million (as of 2011) comes from Medicaid. Abortions Generate Higher Profits Than Birth Control Does As a rational economic actor that seeks to maximize financial gains, financial incentives drive Planned Parenthood’s actions. Some will stop here and point out that Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit organization. First, this is a legal classification only (the National Football League was a nonprofit until last year). Just because an organization is a nonprofit doesn’t mean it will not behave rationally, attempting to reduce costs and increase revenue. Instead of rewarding financial gains to a shareholder, a nonprofit plugs its financial gains into higher salaries and bigger benefits for its employees (Richards makes half a million dollars every year as Planned Parenthood’s president). Instead rewarding financial gains to a shareholder, a nonprofit plugs its financial gains into higher salaries and bigger benefits for its employees. Second, though the national organization is flush with cash, many local Planned Parenthood “affiliates” (Planned Parenthood operates a franchise model) are highly cost-sensitive, to the point where several have fraudulently overbilled Medicaid. Because of the franchise model, clinics must be independently financially-viable. In mid-90s Romania, health workers who provided family planning made little offloading contraception, but were heavily compensated when providing abortion. Planned Parenthood clinics’ near-monopolistic power over poor urban women provides an overwhelming incentive to undersupply birth control. In doing so, its affiliates push their high-margin product—abortion. 1. An Incentive to Undersupply Birth Control Planned Parenthood has an incentive to undersupply birth control to its captive market of poor urban women who depend on publicly funded care. For uninsured women, the organization’s clinics face a marginal (per service rendered) loss when supplying birth control under Title X’s grant-based system. Although Planned Parenthood may make money when supplying birth control under Medicaid, margins are often razor thin. Title X’s grant-based funding means that, after a certain point—conceivably when Planned Parenthood feels it has given out enough birth control to satisfy the government and ensure future grant awards—the marginal cost of distributing birth control hugely outweighs the marginal benefit. Although Planned Parenthood may make money when supplying birth control under Medicaid, margins are often razor thin (the exact compensation rate depends on the state, but note here that Planned Parenthood’s real interest in the ACA is Medicaid expansion). This explains contraception mailer programs that attempt to eliminate the administrative costs of a clinic visit—costs that prevent a customer from returning for another supply. If the mailer program does accept Medicaid, it is better than undersupplying the market, but many Planned Parenthood affiliates’ mailers do not accept Medicaid—again, because Medicaid may barely cover costs, and because some states disallow such a program because it is open to waste, fraud, and abuse. Further, for all Planned Parenthood’s hype about preventative birth control, the organization does a subpar job at putting preventative birth control in the hands of its customers. In 2012, 40 percent of the “contraceptive services” provided by Planned Parenthood consisted of emergency contraception (such as Plan B, which most likely carries higher margins than ordinary birth control). Even left-leaning blogs lament stories of young women being pressured to make costly “donations” for basic contraceptive services. They also note that financial incentives could lead Planned Parenthood to offload forms of birth control that are less effective or safe compared to other alternatives. So Planned Parenthood loses money distributing birth control to uninsured women, and gains little by distributing birth control through Medicaid. Planned Parenthood’s failure to meet demand for birth control reduces costs, and also stimulates demand for abortion. When Planned Parenthood doesn’t adequately meet customer demand for birth control, its customers, with nowhere else to turn, come back for the high-margin product. 2. Abortion Is Planned Parenthood’s Premium Product Planned Parenthood makes a good deal of money, on the margin (per service rendered), when providing abortion services. Abortion is usually paid for out-of-pocket, to the tune of around $500, and carries high margins for providers. According to Guttmacher, around 65 percent of women who receive abortions lack private insurance (they are either uninsured, 33 percent, or received Medicaid, 31 percent). The vast majority of abortions Planned Parenthood sells are paid out-of-pocket. How do poor women afford to pay for abortion themselves? When an unplanned pregnancy is only a remote possibility, women are cost-sensitive towards expensive, but effective, contraception (especially when they can receive less-effective contraception at little to no cost). But when women face an unplanned pregnancy, they are less cost-sensitive. Also, while the male involved typically does not contribute to the birth-control bill, he will contribute to an abortion, as he is on the hook for support payments if the unplanned pregnancy is brought to term. The vast majority of abortions Planned Parenthood sells are paid out-of-pocket. While Planned Parenthood claims that only 3 percent of its services are abortions, the organization calculates this number by counting every little thing it does as a separate “service” (a pack of pills, a sexually transmitted disease test, and an exam are three separate services). In fact, 1 in 10 Planned Parenthood customers receive abortion services. Again, the organization is the clear market-leader in abortions, commanding about 30-40 percent of the U.S. abortion market. Yet, even more important than the volume of abortions compared to other services, Planned Parenthood makes the most money, on the margin, when it provides abortions. In criticizing Planned Parenthood’s claim that only 3 percent of its services consist of abortion, Slate calls abortion Planned Parenthood’s “premium product,” likening it to a store that sells luxury watches, and refers to Planned Parenthood’s “3% number” as “the most meaningless abortion statistic ever.” Slate calls abortion Planned Parenthood’s ‘premium product,’ likening it to a store that sells luxury watches. Media Matters and PolitiFact have pointed out that abortion services, which bring in about $165 million per year, only make up “less than 15 percent of Planned Parenthood’s annual revenue.” But this analysis is overly simplistic. Looking at the national organization as of several years ago, around $320 million in revenues comes from clinics, of which $165 million is due to abortion services. Private donations provide $223 million, and $487 million comes from Title X and Medicaid. The portion of this revenue generating the greatest boost to the bottom line, aside from donations, is abortion-services. And the national organization’s revenue from abortion matters little. As mentioned above, Planned Parenthood follows a franchise business model—like Burger King and McDonalds—so clinics must be self-sustaining apart from the national organization. This is important, because this means incentives and financial concerns at the clinic level have the greatest sway on organizational behavior. Around 50 percent of the organization’s clinic revenue is generated from abortion (a more conservative estimate puts this figure at 37 percent, which is high nonetheless). If you factor in Title X grants and Medicaid billings, the figure is brought down to 20 percent, yet Title X and Medicaid are sources of revenue that don’t provide much income after costs. Again, keep in mind that, compared to other clinic-level revenue-sources, abortion contributes the most to the bottom line after costs are factored in. Abby Johnson, a former director of Planned Parenthood’s clinic in Bryan, Texas, and Planned Parenthood “Employee of the Year” in 2008, claims that Planned Parenthood clinics projected the same number of female customers year to year, but consistently called for an increase in abortion sales. Johnson recounts that, one year, the organization doubled its abortions target over the previous period (while the market size and customer base was largely expected to stay the same). Because franchisees must be completely self-sustaining, local clinics face immense pressure to cut costs. And Planned Parenthood is highly cost-sensitive regarding abortions. Because franchisees must be completely self-sustaining, local clinics face immense pressure to cut costs. When Johnson was an employee, a visiting abortion doctor used an ultrasound device to identify ectopic pregnancies and prevent perforating the uterus. This was a first for Johnson because Planned Parenthood does not use an ultrasound device unless state law requires it. When Johnson asked her superiors why Planned Parenthood didn’t use ultrasound, her superiors contended this was too costly, and would add an extra five minutes to each procedure. Her clinic needed to do between 25 and 50 abortions per day to remain profitable. Johnson also recounts how, ideally, an experienced physician could perform 75 abortions per day, and how the clinic wanted to have a woman on and off the table in no more than five minutes. Planned Parenthood’s Conflicting Interests At the end of the day, Planned Parenthood has a business model, very much akin to HP or Apple, and abortion is essential to it. Just as HP sells its printers at cost so it can make huge profits on printer ink, Planned Parenthood provides most of its services at cost, but profits when customers need abortions. Just as HP sells its printers at cost so it can make huge profits on printer ink, Planned Parenthood provides most of its services at cost, but profits when customers need abortions. Just as Apple uses its stores not as profit centers, but as extenders of the Apple brand that give potential customers hands-on knowledge about Apple products, most Planned Parenthood clinics only provide abortion referral and function at cost, but refer abortions to the profit-generating clinic that provides them. Yet an organization that carries both contraception and abortion faces an inherent conflict of interest, as abortion and birth control are, to some extent at least, competing services. A monopoly magnifies this ability to push one service over another, as the case of Romania shows. Just as a single gas station in a remote area can get away with selling only premium gasoline, while gas stations with competitors must offer more choice, so is it with Planned Parenthood. Because poor urban women have nowhere else to receive birth control, they are forced to frequent an organization that has a vested interest in seeing them eventually pay more to have abortions. Planned Parenthood can’t have it both ways. The organization consistently decries the lack of family planning access for rural women while its customer base experiences the highest rate of unplanned pregnancies in America—a far worse rate than that among rural women who supposedly don’t have any family planning access at all. The Solution: More Consumer Choice Advocates for abortion have long contended that we need more birth-control access and education if we want to stem the tide of abortion. What if they are right, but their chosen agent of birth-control distribution is doing a terrible job? Planned Parenthood then steers this captive market towards its abortion services by not providing adequate birth-control choice and access, because abortion is Planned Parenthood’s premium product. In Romania in the mid-90s, a government-run health monopoly meant consumers had little choice. And Romanian doctors were poorly compensated when providing birth control, but heavily compensated for performing abortions. The result was a higher rate of abortions than live births, and misery for Romanian women. In America, many poor urban women have little choice aside from Planned Parenthood, and abortions make the most money for Planned Parenthood franchisees, after costs. This also helps to explain the high black abortion rate in America. Poor black women disproportionately reside in urban areas, and in urban areas a poor woman’s primary avenue to healthcare is Planned Parenthood, which disproportionately services poor black women. Planned Parenthood then steers this captive market towards its abortion services by not providing adequate birth-control choice and access, because abortion is Planned Parenthood’s premium product. Planned Parenthood’s quest for financial gain drives the high black abortion rate. What is to be done? Poor, urban women need more choice. Bill Clinton said abortion should be “safe, legal and rare,” and that women should always have the “choice” of abortion. For many poor American women, abortion is not safe, it is not rare, and there is little choice. Next Steps for Policymakers The solution must be to break Planned Parenthood’s monopoly over the lives of poor urban women, providing poor urban women with greater choice. First, Congress should reform Medicaid, so poor urban women have more medical choices. Doctors should be compensated fairly so more providers accept Medicaid payment, and recipients should have more health-care choice and ownership. Even better than just reforming Medicaid, which doesn’t cover all of America’s poor, Congress should pass the American Enterprise Institute’s comprehensive health-reform plan (“The Best of Both Worlds”). This plan would cover all Americans faster than Obamacare, while sticking to market-based principles. Planned Parenthood should be hauled in front of Congress and questioned about its birth-control programs and incentives. Second, Title X should be completely shifted away from a grant system to a fee-for-service program. As part of this, grantees should be rewarded for good results. For example, Title X funds used for family planning should be predicated on a female patient receiving consistent (not one-time) birth-control services and not experiencing an unplanned pregnancy by a specified later date. Further, because of the inherent conflict of interest involved in birth-control distribution and providing abortion-services, policymakers should consider a Glass-Steagall regime for family planning: in other words, the same reproductive care provider can’t offer both abortion and birth control. This would stop Title X dollars from going to abortion providers, or at the very least would vet Title X recipients who also sell abortion-related products and services (through increased record-keeping and disclosure requirements). Third, Planned Parenthood should be hauled in front of Congress and questioned about its birth-control programs and incentives. If subsequent congressional investigation finds Planned Parenthood is placing profit over its patients health needs, it should no longer receive assistance from taxpayers. ‘ Finally, Congress should pass the Gardner-Ayotte bill, and do everything possible to increase the prospect of OTC birth control. This could reduce unintended pregnancies dramatically, especially among uninsured women, and would allow poor women choices outside of Planned Parenthood. Ironically, the greatest enemy to Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest “pro-choice” advocate, might be more consumer choice for its customer base. States have a role to play, as well. California is still in the process of implementing a law allowing pharmacists to prescribe the birth-control pill. A Republican legislator has just introduced a similar measure in Oregon. More states should follow suit. This so-called “behind the counter access” would increase consumer choice, damaging Planned Parenthood. This is not a partisan issue or a pro-life issue. If Planned Parenthood’s behavior is harming women, something should be done about it. As Thomas Jefferson said about American slavery: “Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that His justice cannot sleep forever.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2015/06/10/the-real-reason-planned-parenthood-trashes-otc-birth-control/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"365",365,"Proponents Of Ohio’s Abortion Amendment Don’t Want You To Know How Barbaric It Is","Mailman","May",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-11-03"," On Nov. 7 (formerly known as Election Day), my fellow Ohioans and I will conclude our month of voting on “Issue 1,” which proposes a constitutional right to make “reproductive decisions.” Ohio would join only three other states (California, Vermont, and Michigan) that mention abortion in their constitutions.



As a lawyer for women’s issues and former deputy solicitor general for Ohio, I see what this amendment aims to do: require abortions to be provided throughout pregnancy, remove Ohio’s laws governing parental notification and unethical abortive procedures, and create constitutional requirements for transgender procedures for minors.



But that’s not what Ohioans are hearing.



I first saw the ads. They advertise that Issue 1 will overturn Ohio’s “heartbeat” law, which curtails abortion after six weeks, without exception for rape or incest. I then saw identical messaging hit local and corporate media. The Ohio Capital Journal, for example, explained that Issue 1 would merely bring back the pre-2022 “status quo.” The Plain Dealer (Cleveland’s paper) explained that while the amendment would overturn Ohio’s six-week abortion law, “other laws, such as whether minors generally need their parents’ permission to get an abortion, could stay in place.”



It sounds perfectly reasonable. But it’s a complete lie.



As a starting point, constitutional amendments are superior to regular statutes, meaning Ohio’s laws (and local government policies) can only stand if they comply with them. The proposed amendment provides an “individual” with the “right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” The term “reproductive decisions” is left undefined, so it means (to state the obvious) decisions related to one’s reproduction, including decisions involving puberty blockers or irreversible transgender interventions for minors. This is no guess. In Vermont, the ACLU is already using the state’s “reproductive liberty” constitutional language to protect transgender procedures. “Individual” is also not defined, and therefore not limited to “adults.”



This Is Not a Return to Pre-2022



The proposed amendment then says Ohio may not directly or indirectly interfere with or discriminate against this broad and undefined “right” unless Ohio can prove its policy is the “least restrictive means” to further the “individual’s” health. That’s a lot of legalese. In simpler terms, it means that any law or even local policy that affects abortion or “reproductive decisions” is banned, unless the government can prove it absolutely needs the law to protect the patient. So, presumably, a law requiring that abortion tools be kept in working order would be OK: The state has a serious interest in the mother’s health, and the law directly relates to its interest. But beyond that, an enormous basket of policies, from limits on Medicaid funding for abortion to rules governing sex education, is at risk.



That’s because the proposed legal test is miles away from the “status quo,” meaning pre-2022, legal framework. For decades, the Supreme Court said that state laws serving a valid purpose that indirectly burdened abortion were valid and recognized that the state had legitimate interests in things beyond a woman’s health, such as the baby’s life, medical ethics, or permitting family decision-making.



That meant, even under Roe v. Wade, Ohio could require parental consent, because the Supreme Court accepted the “state’s interest in encouraging a family rather than a judicial resolution of a minor’s abortion decision.” Ohio could also ban particularly unethical medical procedures, such as “partial-birth abortion” (a term for birthing a child until the baby’s head won’t fit through the birth canal, and then smashing the head to finish the procedure). The Supreme Court accepted the state has “an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession” in approving a “ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of a living fetus.”



But say goodbye to those laws under Issue 1. Because the proposed amendment only permits state laws that promote the mother’s health and that are extremely tailored to that end, laws like parental consent and partial-birth restrictions would fall.



Another line I commonly hear is that Issue 1 allows abortion to be prohibited after “fetal viability.” Even if true, that’s still much later than Americans are on board with. But it’s not true. The amendment provides an exception so broad that it eats the rule: Abortion must be allowed if the doctor thinks it would be “necessary” for the patient’s “health.” 



That’s not physical health, but undefined “health,” which courts have long interpreted — in Doe v. Bolton, for example — to be a sweeping term including “all factors” “relevant to the well-being” of the mother, which includes considerations of family size. Permitting abortion for one’s “well-being” means no restrictions at all, which is extremely unpopular among Americans.



Issue 1 Will Exacerbate Suffering



I get the appeal of Issue 1. Ohioans are reasonable creatures. We empathize with the young women suffering due to rape, or who receive news that their babies won’t make it outside the womb. And these sympathies draw us to disfavor Ohio’s heartbeat bill, even if we understand abortion and believe it’s morally wrong. 



But Issue 1 will exacerbate suffering, not alleviate it. It authorizes abortions hidden from parents, enabling perpetrators to continue their violence. It delays decision-making to a stage when mothers can feel their babies dancing around, when doctors hold a live, partially born baby in their hands.



Whether you’re pro-life, pro-abortion, or somewhere in between, you deserve to know the monumental, untested, and dangerous changes Issue 1 would bring to Ohio. There are ways to change Ohio’s heartbeat law (which is enjoined for the time being). Ohio legislators can pass a law, or citizens can propose a ballot-initiative law, changing the date to 15 weeks, which would be more permissive than Europe. Or the law can be changed to add exceptions, such as for rape and incest. We deserve to consider these options, with our most vulnerable in mind.



But Issue 1 takes these decisions out of the hands of Ohioans and their representatives entirely. That immobility, anchored far beyond what supermajorities of Americans believe is best, is no way to protect Ohio women or children.

"366",366,"The Supreme Court’s Abortion-Affirming Decisions Aren’t As ‘Settled’ As Some Say","Forsythe","Clarke","D.",NA,NA,NA,"2020-08-14"," Below the surface of the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this summer in June Medical Services v. Russo — which invalidated Louisiana’s health and safety regulations for abortion facilities — the justices are tensely divided over their 47-year-old self-appointed role as the national abortion control board. Although some media happily reported a 5-4 loss for Louisiana’s safety regulations that protected women’s health, the real starting point for understanding what happened is the badly fractured 4-1-1-3 decision, with six opinions totaling 133 pages.  Justice Stephen Breyer wrote an opinion for the four leftists, while Chief Justice John Roberts concurred but did not join Breyer’s opinion. The chief justice technically decided that Louisiana’s law could not stand because he thought it was the same as the Texas law the court struck down in 2016 in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. Yet Roberts also indicated that in the future, he will be the fifth vote, along with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, to apply more lenient standards for reviewing state abortion limits that the court adopted in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. Casey shifted Roe’s trimester framework, establishing instead that states are prohibited from enacting legislation that places an “undue burden” on a woman’s so-called right to abortion. The four dissenters issued three powerful opinions. First, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh were united in saying they would overrule Whole Woman’s Health expressly and reinstate the more lenient 1992 Casey decision for purposes of examining the Louisiana statute. But they couldn’t get Roberts to do that. Second, Thomas wrote, for himself alone, that Roe v. Wade should be overturned entirely, returning the abortion issue entirely to the states.  Then Alito wrote a 34-page dissent, joined in the essential parts by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, that would have upheld Louisiana’s law. He concluded, “[T]here is ample evi­dence in the record showing that [hospital] admitting privileges help to protect the health of women by ensuring that physicians who perform abortions meet a higher standard of compe­tence than is shown by the mere possession of a license to practice.” Gorsuch wrote a dissent that gave numerous reasons the court’s abortion doctrine is unworkable, closing with the sentence: “[I]t is a sign we have lost our way.” The 4-1-1-3 decision reaffirms that Roe is radically unsettled. There are many reasons for that: the widespread use of obstetric ultrasounds that have humanized unborn children for four decades, legislative limits on abortion in more than half the states, a significant drop in the abortion rate, public opinion, as well as other social, political, and legal reasons. Virtually nothing has settled Roe since 1973. Many Americans will be surprised to know the Supreme Court took a mulligan for its abortion doctrine in 1992. The justices threw out the original rationale for the abortion right when they ruled in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a decision that was badly divided by at least five different opinions among the justices. Two justices said in 1992 they would keep Roe as originally decided, three justices threw out two past abortion decisions and radically overhauled Roe, and four justices said they would have overturned Roe altogether.  June Medical shows that 47 years after Roe, the court still can’t agree on the standards for state abortion limits. Five justices at the very least aren’t committed to abortion on demand, a hopeless mess that wasn’t solved by Casey nor Whole Woman’s Health. In the nearly 30 years since Casey, no majority of the court has ever given Americans an alternative constitutional reason for imposing Roe on the nation. A majority of the justices have simply imposed the result without announcing a principle that roots Roe in the Constitution or in American history and tradition. Further, no majority has explained why the court continues to dictate one nationwide rule of abortion for any reason, at any time of pregnancy, from coast to coast. Roe, and every Supreme Court abortion decision since then, has always lacked a constitutional justification. Numerous justices throughout history have said they would never accept certain court decisions they believed to be wrong, even if a majority of the court repeatedly reaffirmed them. Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall said that about capital punishment, and Justice Elena Kagan has said that about partisan electoral gerrymandering. These justices didn’t accept those decisions to be settled. Roe v. Wade, and every decision built on it, is unsettled. Stare decisis, or respect for precedent, doesn’t apply to radically unsettled decisions. That’s why judges and scholars since the Supreme Court was established have emphasized the importance of settled law, settled doctrine, and settled precedent. As any homeowner can tell you, everything built on an unsettled foundation will forever remain unsettled.

"367",367,"Ben Shapiro Is Wrong About Prosecuting Women Who Get Abortions","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-09-20"," A young, self-identified liberal woman presented this question to Ben Shapiro during the Q&A following his much anticipated speech at the University of California at Berkeley last Thursday: “Do you believe women who get abortions even when their lives or the child’s life isn’t in danger, should be put on trial for murder?” “No, I think abortionists should be put on trial,” Shapiro replied.  I don’t think that women should be put on trial for a couple different reasons. One is, I don’t think it is effective in deterring abortion for women to be put on trial for the killing of the unborn. The second reason is because unfortunately I think that we as a society have gotten to such a point that an entire generation have been indoctrinated to believe that a baby is a polyp and so when they remove it, I’m not sure there’s the necessary mens rea, the criminal intent necessary for prosecution. The typical pro life position is that the women is a victim in abortion nearly as much as the baby is. There is an entire abortion industry that is geared toward teaching women that babies are not babies and that getting a baby aborted is in fact a betterment of their life. So no, I am not in favor of prosecuting women for abortions. The student pressed the issue, saying that some women do “have intent.” “You’d really have to show me a case of a woman who went [into the abortion clinic] and said, ‘I know this is a baby, cut its brains out,’” Shapiro answered. “Like, if that’s happening, that is infanticide.” Shapiro then presented the hypothetical of a mother of a one-day-old infant who asked for it to be killed. “Wouldn’t you put her on trial?” he asked. Shapiro may have a point that prosecution wouldn’t be an effective deterrent, but deterrence is not the main reason we prosecute. We seek justice for the victims, and that should remain the chief goal of the courts. The pursuit of justice is worthwhile in itself, and I would argue, a moral imperative. Pro-Lifers’ Cognitive Dissonance His second reason is also extremely weak, and it gets to the heart of a deep-rooted hypocrisy within the mainstream prolife movement. Shapiro says these women don’t have the mens rea (Latin for “guilty mind”), or intent, that the prosecution must demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt. Is that really the case? Most states use the Model Penal Code to determine mens rea. Its first classification of intent is “acting purposely” where “the defendant had an underlying conscious object to act.”  Obviously, if abortion were to be legally categorized as murder, a mother who orders the hit on her preborn child fits this definition of intent. A minority of states do employ a “malice distinction,” where the stricter definition is “Express malice,” in which the crime is committed “with the deliberate intent to bring harm to the victim.” Here again, it seems clear that someone who commissions the destruction of a preborn person has demonstrated “express malice.” Shapiro does not hold murder as purely a moral distinction, in which case nobody would be prosecuted; he plainly believes someone has culpability under the law since he says abortionists should be put on trial. If the hit man is guilty, so is the person who ordered the hit. Being removed from the situation to not actually see the blood or watch the life leave the eyes of the victim does not exculpate the one who ordered the deed to be done. Yet even Shapiro cannot make it all the way to the conclusion of his own argument. As he admits, Shapiro is not unique among pro-lifers in saying women should not be prosecuted, even for what most believe is murder. This insistence that the prosecution must demonstrate moral intent (and that they would be unable to) is an excuse to double back on the moral case on which the law would be founded. In the hypothetical pro-life world, we would build this moral truth that abortion is murder into our laws. Should we then reject this foundation and assume the morality of abortion is in question, assuming the plain intent to harm a victim is what matters, regardless of the perpetrator’s underlying ideology or rationalizations?  I understand that the prospect is unpalatable. The debate over the political feasibility of classifying abortion as first-degree murder is a valid but separate discussion. But unpalatability does not a legal or moral argument make. Ignorance of the Law Is No Excuse Critics of my position argue that since the preborn are unseen and in early development, one might argue they are “unrecognizable” as human beings, and therefore as victims. But these distinctives of obscurity and prematurity cannot logically support a defense of mothers who abort. If the law plainly states that the preborn are to be treated as persons entitled to the rights of persons, and beyond that widely known scientific facts testify to the preborn’s humanity, then how can ignorance be a defense? It never is in murder trials of humans who have been born. Intent largely plays in when it is time to consider the perpetrator’s charges and sentence. But even when an accidental killing has been committed there are legal consequences in our system, and for good reason. Pro-lifers say they are concerned about justice for the preborn. Despite Shapiro’s assertion that women are “almost as much a victim” as the baby, the focus of the vast majority of prolife rhetoric is almost exclusively on demonstrating the humanity and preventing the killing of the preborn. The fundamental reasoning is that the preborn are people, and to kill them would be unjust. If prolife advocates merely thought abortion was “tragic,” as many on the Left believe, they would not be picketing outside abortion mills every day of the week, or pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into lobbying anti-abortion legislation. No, abolitionists call for banning abortion on the grounds it is unjust. They insist abortionists are guilty and should stand trial for murder, even while they avoid dealing with the guilt of the women who commission their murders. Either Women Are Sentient and Responsible or Not This is where conservative pro-lifers’ views of women, too, are revealed as utterly incoherent. Abortionists have blood on their hands, they insist. They know the tiny limbs they pull apart with forceps belong to a baby, and that the medication they prescribe will kill a baby. When it comes to women in general, social conservatives largely agree with the Left that women are smart, capable autonomous agents—until it comes to abortion. Motherhood, beset with fierce protective instincts and a nurturing disposition, is a revered calling for which social conservatives praise women. Where they would have celebrated the ‘mama bear’ instincts and conscientious choices of expectant mothers, here we are to believe they are ignorant incubators. Yet when the mother does not want to be a mother, indeed is pressured by friends, family, a boyfriend not to be a mother, then these conservatives pivot to the position that these women are ignorant, weak, dependent victims who lack even the requisite faculties for agency. Where they would have celebrated the “mama bear” instincts and conscientious choices of expectant mothers, here we are to believe they are ignorant incubators. It is true that abortionists try to obscure the facts of the matter, and it is true that many women face a lack of resources and severe pressure to abort, and are sometimes coerced. These instances should be exposed and those who coerce women to such a barbaric act should face the full force of the law; they are not an excuse to pardon all women who abort. A woman need not be of the morbid “please rip my baby to pieces” mindset to be found guilty of murder. There is no excuse for ignorance at this point, especially in this country. Information from meiosis to mens rea is at our fingertips, or at the very least at the nearest library. A high school student who has taken even the most pathetic science class knows that sex makes babies, not polyps or tumors, and that the life growing inside of her has distinct human DNA that makes it an individual separate from her body. Even the signs and scripts of the anti-abortion picketers outside the abortion mills, as distasteful as some find their tactics, declare the truth to these women. To insist that the abortion industry has a monopoly on the education of our young people is to present a false narrative and perpetuate a culture of victimhood and denial of personal responsibility, which are exactly what I thought Shapiro was dedicated to ending. If you cannot see the guilt of women who abort even with the ubiquity of accurate pictures of life in the womb presented via ultrasound, and even after the Center for Medical Progress famously and explicitly exposed horrific scenes from the abortion industry that included the sale of baby body parts, then you must believe the moral degradation of our culture is beyond remedy, and that we will never get to a point where abortion is illegal, much less where women will be held accountable for their decisions. If such a point exists, pro-lifers need to tell us what that looks like. Shapiro says a woman must be of a morbid, rip-my-baby-apart mindset. Should that be the standard? Whether he means to or not, Shapiro is telling women they are incompetent. But they are not brainwashed, they are self-determining agents with full consciousness of their actions. It’s past time for mainstream pro-lifers to confront their hypocrisy. The simple, correct answer to the young liberal’s question is, “Yes, of course women should be prosecuted.” It’s not politically or culturally palatable, but it is the truth.

"368",368,"Yes, The Princeton Prof’s Argument For Early Abortion Is Stupid","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-08-14"," A recent episode of Philosophy Time—a YouTube series starring actor James Franco and philosophy professor Eliot Michaelson—has been making the social media rounds. The reason? Recent guest and Princeton University philosophy professor Elizabeth Harman shared a synopsis of her moral theory supporting what she calls “early abortions.” And it was nonsensical. Here’s her thesis in short:  In some of my work I defend a liberal position about early abortion. I defend the view that there is nothing morally bad about early abortion. . . .And I think if a fetus hasn’t ever been conscious, it hasn’t ever had any experiences, and we aborted it at that stage actually nothing morally bad happens….But, what I think is actually among early fetuses there are two very different kinds of beings. So, James, when you were an early fetus, and Eliot, when you were an early fetus, all of us I think we already did have moral status then. But we had moral status in virtue of our futures. In virtue of the fact that we were the beginning stages of persons.But some early fetuses will die in early pregnancy due to abortion or miscarriage. And in my view that is a very different kind of entity. That’s something that doesn’t have a future as a person and it doesn’t have moral status. In other words: There is nothing “morally bad” about an early abortion because, since the fetus is aborted, it never becomes a person. But this is not the well-worn “the fetus is not a person and thus has no moral worth” argument. Rather, Harman contends fetuses who are not aborted and thus grow into persons possess moral worth while still fetuses. Fetuses who will end up aborted, on the other hand, do not. Confused? You should be. But I promise you it is not my lack of clarity (or charity) or deceptive or selective quoting. Her argument truly is that asinine. You can judge for yourself by reading more excerpts in the Free Beacon article discussing the segment. Or better yet, just watch the brief five-minute YouTube video yourself.    Actually, This Idea Has Been Around for a While As many have commented on Twitter, Franco’s facial expressions alone are worth the view; although watching Michaelson’s amazing nonplussed restraint in the presence of such twaddle coming from a peer might lead one to question who is the better actor. If you watch the video, you’ll also notice around the three-minute mark an added graphic of two arrows chasing each other in a circle. It’s visual clue to the philosophical neophytes tuning in that yes, her entire theory is circular: Aborting an early fetus is morally licit because the early fetus has no moral status; and he has no moral status since he will be aborted. Is Harman’s proffered moral justification for abortion merely the latest innovation in pro-choice rhetoric? Have others already picked up this line of argument? Will we soon be inundated with this line of attack, along the lines of the gaining momentum of a “post-birth abortion” justification for infanticide?  A quick Google Yahoo search revealed the answer: Harman’s thesis isn’t the newest wave in the abortion rights movement. Rather, in this discussion she merely rehashed for the camera a theory she devised back in 1999 and published under the title of “Creation Ethics: The Moral Status of Early Fetuses and the Ethics of Abortion,” for the peer-reviewed (emphasis and outrage added) journal Philosophy and Public Affairs. A quick read of Harman’s article reveals several additional flaws in her theory, which she christened the Actual Future Principle. First, she cordoned off the most obvious deficiencies her argument—its question-begging and unbounded breadth. For instance, she defines an “early fetus” as “a fetus before it has any intrinsic properties that themselves confer moral status on the fetus,” thus begging the more difficult question of whether, when, and why any human being lacks moral status. She then further “assume[d] that there is a nonnegligible period of time in which fetuses are early fetuses in my sense; it may be as short as a few weeks or as long as several months, depending on which intrinsic properties can themselves confer moral status.” But she doesn’t attempt to define those supposed “intrinsic properties,” although she posits one plausible view is “that an early fetus is a fetus before it has any conscious experience and before it can properly be described as the subject of experience.” Harman also adds: “Someone might believe that up until the moment of birth, or for some time after, an individual has no intrinsic properties that themselves confer moral status on it. While the arguments I make about early fetuses might be put forward about fetuses at any stage of development or about young babies, they are not written with such application in mind.”  We’ll Just Sideline All My Argument’s Weaknesses Equally as revealing is the one deficiency Harman does not sidestep but instead embraces: her reasoning’s circularity. Here she summarizes this criticism as follows: “According to the Actual Future Principle, you just can’t lose! If you abort, then it turns out that the fetus you aborted was the kind of thing it’s okay to abort. If you don’t abort, then it turns out that the fetus was the kind of thing it’s not okay to abort.” In her paper, Harman expands: “The objector is right that ‘you just can’t lose’ if you have an abortion. As I have argued, the Actual Future Principle implies the very liberal view on abortion. Therefore, according to the Actual Future Principle, no moral justification is required for an early abortion.” But if “no moral justification is required for an early abortion,” which is Harman’s position and which she acknowledges could include “abortions” “at any stage of development” and even “young babies,” than why does Harman even bother to formulate a theory? The answer is clear: To assuage the cognitive dissonance of the pro-choice community, personified in her peer-reviewed article as the hypothetical Katherine: Katherine contemplates the early fetuses that die in early abortions. She has the intuition that these early fetuses have no moral status; their deaths simply do not matter morally. She thinks that nothing morally significant happens in an early abortion, and that no moral justification whatsoever is required for an early abortion. However, then Katherine goes on to contemplate the early fetuses that are carried to term and that become persons. She thinks of a couple who want to have a baby. A woman in the couple becomes pregnant, and the couple decides that she will carry the pregnancy to term. Very quickly, the couple starts to care about and to love the fetus, while it is still an early fetus. Katherine believes that such an early fetus is the appropriate object of love. This very thing, the early fetus, is the beginning stage of the child of this couple. Because it is itself the beginning of their child, their love for it seems appropriate. Because this early fetus is the kind of thing it is appropriate to love, Katherine believes that it has some moral status. Katherine appears torn by two conflicting views of the moral status of early fetuses. She has the intuition that early fetuses that die in early abortions lack moral status; she generalizes to the view that all early fetuses lack moral status. She has the intuition that early fetuses that will become persons have some moral status; she generalizes to the view that all early fetuses have some moral status. It seems that Katherine must give up one of her intuitions. But rather than force Katherine and pro-choice adherents to abandon their faulty premise—that “early fetuses” lack moral status—Harman offers a philosophical salve in the form of the Actual Future Principle: She invents a moral paradigm to justify holding two incongruent dogmas. This may make “Katherine” feel better for a while, but only because it’s burying rather than resolving the incoherence of her positions.

"369",369,"Wendy Davis Hypes Abortion At Notre Dame On Feast Of The Annunciation","Cassandra","Adam",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-04-06"," Catholics celebrated the Feast of the Annunciation on Monday, when the Virgin Mary said “yes” to God and Christ was conceived in her womb through the power of the Holy Spirit. But at the University of Notre Dame, a number of students spent Monday night on campus listening to former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis describe the benefits for women of choosing abortion or using contraception. During Mass on Monday, Pope Francis encouraged the faithful to open their hearts to God and to say “yes” to his message of salvation. “Mary’s ‘yes’ opens the door to Jesus’ ‘yes’: I have come to do Your will, this is the ‘yes’ that Jesus carries with him throughout his life, until the cross,” he said. “Today,” he said, “is a beautiful day in which to thank God for showing us that path, but also for thinking about our lives.” The Feast was transferred to April 4 because it would have fallen on Good Friday.  Davis’ message ultimately taught students at the nation’s most recognizable Catholic university that saying “no” to God’s plan for the creation of life and to the Catholic Church’s teachings on human dignity can help women achieve worldly success. Davis — who rose to stardom in the political world following her 2013 filibuster of pro-life legislation in Texas — ran the gamut of pro-abortion, anti-Catholic talking points during an event Monday hosted by the University of Notre Dame Department of Gender Studies. The department co-sponsored the event in coordination with the College Democrats of Notre Dame, the Progressive Student Alliance, Notre Dames, Women in Politics, and bridgeND. The Notre Dame Department of Gender Studies touted Davis’ abortion advocacy in a description of the event posted on the department’s website, calling her “a modern-day Texas heroine”: Former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis is widely recognized as a passionate advocate for women’s healthcare and other national issues which threaten our individual freedoms. Sen. Davis prides herself on the ability to see an issue from multiple perspectives, while forging a path to consensus and compromise. She skyrocketed to near celebrity status after her historic 13 hour filibuster in the Texas Senate to stop a legislative effort that would have dramatically reduced women’s access to healthcare services in her state.
Wendy Davis, a modern-day Texas heroine, appeared on the national scene as a State Senator during her 2013 filibuster that temporarily blocked devastating legislation seeking to limit women’s access to abortions and reproductive healthcare in the state of Texas. Before that, Davis fought tirelessly in the Texas legislature to further equality for women through education, fair lending, and equal pay initiatives. A single mother from humble beginnings who worked her way to Harvard Law, Davis shares her inspiring story of overcoming adversity, fear, and self-doubt to reach these incredible heights and underscores the importance of how every woman’s story can make a difference. The event description was removed from the department’s website Monday afternoon, but a cached version is available here, and The Cardinal Newman Society captured an image of the web page. The College Democrats of Notre Dame used a similar description for their Facebook event promoting Davis’ talk.  A question and answer segment was moderated by Notre Dame Professor Candida Moss, who has “built herself a reputation for making outrageous statements about the Church,” as noted in the Newman Society’s previous reporting. During her talk, titled, “Rising Up: From Single Mother to Harvard Law, How Every Woman Stands to Make a Difference,” Davis referred to abortion as a necessity for the advancement of women, praised Planned Parenthood, and said the U.S. Supreme Court decided when human life begins. Davis told the gathering of students it would be wrong for them to ‘impose’ their ideas about abortion on others. Davis told the gathering of students it would be wrong for them to “impose” their ideas about abortion on others. “The issue of [abortion] is not to impose our ideas on other people — particularly when we may not understand the position a person is in, and the decision she is making,” she said, according to the Notre Dame student newspaper The Observer. Her position is similar to the one held by Vice President Joe Biden, whom Notre Dame is awarding its Laetare Medal — the “oldest and most prestigious honor accorded to American Catholics” — despite his support for abortion. Bishop Kevin Rhoades of Fort Wayne – South Bend, Ind., provided an excellent response to this scandal on March 14, but so far, The Observer has yet publish any reports online exploring the bishop’s statement.  In a personal moment, Davis told students she aborted her more than 20-week-old daughter “out of love.” “[I was] post-20 weeks of pregnancy of a much-wanted pregnancy that I had waited years to have, and … our very much-wanted child was suffering from a fatal fetal brain abnormality,” she said.  “What we were told was that if our child survived delivery, which she would likely not, that she would live a life of tremendous suffering — if she lived long at all — and we made a decision out of love.” The legislation Davis filibustered in Texas was intended to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, when children can feel pain. Davis told students her abortion was the reason she started the filibuster. ‘It is easy to love the perfect; but how much we are willing to give to the imperfect is the true measure of love.’ The Catholic Church teaches that all human life, including unborn children with disabilities, “must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception,” and that abortion is never permissible. The Catholic pro-life group Human Life International (HLI) describes the abortion of children specifically because of their disabilities as “nothing more than eugenics, discrimination of the basest kind.” “Those who abort a preborn child with genetic abnormalities are saying by their actions that a baby with disabilities has less of a right to live than a baby without such disabilities,” according to HLI. “A truly humane society would not kill its weakest members, but would rather love them and support them, even if their disabilities are incompatible with life.” “Even if a baby will die shortly after she is born, what is a more civilized response — to hold and love her in the short time she has on this earth, or cut her apart with a vacuum curettage machine?” the pro-life group continued. “It is easy to love the perfect; but how much we are willing to give to the imperfect is the true measure of love.” Turning to issues of education and jobs, Davis told students that the “connection between reproductive autonomy and economic opportunity in this country” is “very important.” Praising Planned Parenthood, Davis said the various services provided by nation’s largest abortion provider “allowed her to climb the ranks her mother and grandmother could not.” The Observer editor tweeted that Davis received a standing ovation at the conclusion of the event. “Without my access to [Planned Parenthood], it was very likely I would have found myself with a second unplanned pregnancy,” Davis said, according to a tweet from an editor of The Observer. She also linked her views on abortion and “reproductive autonomy” to an embrace of feminism, an argument pro-life feminists absolutely reject. Taking questions from the crowd, Davis was asked, “At what point do you believe life begins and at what point do you think it should be protected?” “I think the Supreme Court has had made that decision for us,” she responded. Davis reportedly responded to another question saying, “Let’s remember that abortion is a protected right in this country.” Davis’ answers were clearly not in line with church teaching, but there is no indication from reports on her comments that Catholic teaching was ever discussed during the event. Laws legitimizing abortion are considered immoral and should be opposed, according to the Catholic Church. Saint John Paul II wrote in Evangelium Vitae: “To claim the right to abortion, infanticide and euthanasia, and to recognize that right in law, means to attribute to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: that of an absolute power over others and against others. This is the death of true freedom.” A few minutes later The Observer editor tweeted that Davis received a standing ovation at the conclusion of the event. Responding to the event announcement, the Notre Dame alumni group Sycamore Trust stated in an email on Sunday: “A supporter also of same-sex marriage, Ms. Davis is a state version of Vice President Biden. There could scarcely be a more obvious contravention of the bishops’ declaration that ‘Catholic institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles’ and that they ‘should not be given awards, honors or platforms which would suggest support for their actions.’” Considering Notre Dame’s honor of Biden with the Laetare Medal, Sycamore Trust Chairman William Dempsey said, “[I]t is unsurprising that faculty units and student clubs don’t hesitate to put forward Ms. Davis as a model for modern women, a ‘Texas heroine,’ for championing ‘reproductive rights.’ … Those in governance who should check this sort of misadventure are themselves causing scandal of the same sort.”
But Dempsey added, “[L]et us not forget that Notre Dame is home to many faculty, students and organizations dedicated to the school’s Catholic mission. They are really the front line victims of these blows at the school’s Catholic reputation, and they deserve the prayerful support of all who love Notre Dame.” This article originally appeared at the Cardinal Newman Society’s Catholic Education Daily.

"370",370,"Telling People God’s Okay With Abortion Is A New Low For Abortion Supporters","Rinehart","Paula",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-08-29"," The old argument that defends abortion now has a new twist. This time, it’s wearing a clerical collar. It’s not enough these days to champion abortion by mere reason. Trying to convince women that ending a pregnancy is actually a shame-free “positive good” is starting to ring hollow as well. So now the latest wave in promoting abortion comes from a most unlikely source. A social ethics professor of religious studies at Elon University makes her case for declaring that abortion can actually be considered Christian.  Rebecca Todd Peters writes in her new book, “Trust Women: A Progressive Christian Argument for Reproductive Justice,” that we should trust women to decide what is best for them in matters of childbearing. She claims that if Christians “truly value women and healthy families,’ they must accept that not wanting a baby “is an imminently appropriate reason to end a pregnancy.” Letting the woman herself be the final arbiter is “reproductive justice.” Peters is an ordained Presbyterian minister (PCUSA) who holds a MDiv and a PhD from Union Theological Seminary in New York. What’s unique here is not her argument, which has been around a long time, but her attempts to wring actual Christian virtue out of the traumatic act of ending life in the womb. Perhaps progressives are getting desperate. You have to wonder if the public exposure of Planned Parenthood’s practice of disassembling baby parts in abortion clinics has taken such a toll that they must now distort church history and Judeo-Christian apologetics to bolster a weakened defense. Using Christianity to shred the last little pieces of a conscience rooted in faith is, shall we say, rather unprecedented. Rebecca Todd Peters Hijacks Plenty of Words Much of Peters’ argument rests on the theft of language. She commends women for the “moral courage” of choosing abortion when they aren’t prepared to parent. (Missing in the conversation is what justice might look like for the child in the womb).  It’s a matter of “justice” to make a woman’s choice preeminent, she says, attributing to the notion of choice what theologian David Bentley Hart calls “an almost mystical supremacy over all other concerns.” That well-known Christian staple called “sin” is not your sin and my sin—no, for Peters, sin is located in external power structures of oppression. Men don’t fare too well in her book, either. They aren’t so much fathers, brothers, and load-bearers, but the faces of a misogynous patriarchy hell-bent on controlling women’s sexual lives. They serve as donkeys you can always pin the tail on, and thereby silence discussion. This convolution of concepts began for the author when she was in seminary in New York and facing an unwanted pregnancy. That is a challenge for thousands of women who see a pregnancy test’s little pink line appear completely unexpectedly. For Peters, this experience led to prayer and a moral quandary: “I knew I didn’t want to have a baby at that point in my life. I loved my husband, but things were bad between us. I was in seminary, and having a baby right then would seriously interrupt my studies and my future career. I believed that my work on issues of social justice was important; it was my calling…I knew that this was not the right time for me to become a mother.”  It’s an unspoken testimony to the effect of the supposedly neutral act of abortion on a woman’s life that the author has devoted her professional career to its defense. Nowhere is the hijacking of language and concepts more sobering than in the author’s description of what Christians and orthodox Jews alike call the unborn child. For Peters, however, this is not the makings of a baby per se—it’s a prenate. In this separate moral category, the author’s own invention, all bets are off: “Since the prenate is not a person, no rights are at stake.” This prenate becomes a child when he or she can exist and take a breath on his or her own. His or her personhood is not a given. Rather, it’s “called into being” by the larger community, especially by the woman herself if she makes the choice to parent. Peters never addresses the elephant in the room: How does a woman’s sex privilege her to treat the life she carries in such a dissembling manner, as though she, by virtue of being a woman, can be the final arbiter of someone else’s worth? Trust Women or Love Women? Anyone well-versed in the Old or New Testament realizes this religious studies professor had to don hiking boots with metal cleats to run roughshod over a vast terrain of church history and scripture. Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Augustine—none of these early church fathers considered intentionally destroying life in the womb as anything other than grave sin. That’s not to mention Jesus, who claimed that to care for “the least of these” was to care, in fact, for him. For both Christian and Jew, the defining reality and the one that makes abortion a tragic, nearly unthinkable option is the belief that each person, from conception to last breath, carries in his or her being the Imago Dei—the image of God. This is powerful truth. It eventually broke the back of slavery, in spite of centuries of willful ignorance from even religious slave owners. The glory of God embedded in a human being is the theological hill that pro-life advocates are willing to die on. Perhaps no theologian in modern times has explained the concept of Imago Dei more succinctly than Pope John Paul II in his “Evangelium Vitae”: “Man is called to a fullness of life which far exceeds the dimensions of his earthly existence, because it consists in sharing the very life of God. The loftiness of this supernatural vocation reveals the greatness and the inestimable value of human life even in its temporal phase.” Then, of course, Mother Teresa combined truth and compassion for women with unplanned pregnancies as only Mother Teresa could. She told us straight up, no-chaser, that the supremely Christian notion of love is “to be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave even his life to love us. So the mother who is thinking of abortion, should be helped to love—that is, to give until it hurts her plans, or her free time, to respect the life of her child. The father of that child, whoever he is, must also give until it hurts. By abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kill even her own child to solve her problem.” It has never been a Christian path of wisdom to cut something out of oneself (literally) because it disrupts plans, causes angst, or seems, in the moment, like an insurmountable problem. In the Christian pattern of death and resurrection, a problem is often the prelude to a new beginning. It’s seen as a potential blessing that can, initially, appear well-disguised. Blessings Can Come in Secret, Even Scary Ways The testimony to the sanctity of human life has been most concretely seen in a tiny beating heart that appears on an ultrasound screen, evidence of life as early as seven weeks, before a woman even feels pregnant. For all the world a living someone appears there—and if you return in about three months, she might just wave. The visual reality of the child-in-utero mutes esoteric discussions about “prenates” with naked truth the eye can see. An actual Christian defense of unborn life will prevail long after this latest assault from the clergy within. Christians have a commendable historical habit of dealing with physical reality as it actually is. For those possessed of Judeo-Christian conviction, the body has meaning and purpose. So Christians have tended to intervene in concrete ways—most notably in founding and funding more than 2,000 pregnancy care centers in the United States designed to come alongside pregnant women. The newest pro-life effort, Love Life,  reflects a younger generation repulsed at the thought of dismembering babies. This group connects a specific church with a specific pregnant woman in both having and raising the child she carries, or finding adoptive parents. Christians see embodied compassion as that which leads a person into richer, unfolding life, in which children can only be construed as a blessing. Abortion is a threat to the humanity of the woman herself. Christians follow logic much like Mother Teresa’s because the cross and the resurrection are at the heart of their beliefs, and blessing that follows even difficult obedience is ancient Hebrew wisdom. In that spirit, as a woman with surprise pregnancies herself and the stretch marks to show for it, let me attest to a reality all women know: pregnancy is a privilege, to be sure, but bringing a child into the world always disrupts. Always. Sometimes it costs plenty. But then, how many women through the ages have confessed in hushed tones to a trusted friend or advisor that the pregnancy they “didn’t exactly want or plan to have” became a child they can’t now imagine being without, whose life fills them with gratitude? The truth is that an actual Christian defense of unborn life will prevail long after this latest assault from the clergy within. Progressives have an uphill battle in their efforts to enlist Christianity, in the name of justice, as a means to baptize abortion.

"371",371,"Left Demands That Big Business Boycott States That Don’t Want Abortion","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-06-15"," They think they own us. The managerial oligarchy, along with its enablers, advocates, and hangers-on, believes that it has the right to rule the rest of us — government by the wealthy and connected, for the wealthy and connected, and of the wealthy and connected. If voters and their representatives won’t go along with this, then the oligarchs and their allies will use their wealth and power as weapons to force us.  They aren’t even trying to hide it. For example, New York Times columnist Linda Greenhouse recently lauded corporate CEOs for using the economic clout of the businesses they manage to push states around on election security and LGBT issues. In Greenhouse’s view, managerial corporate oligarchs deciding social and political issues of the country is awesome, and we need more of it. After praising their previous interference in our democracy, she then begged the “executive class” to impose more economic sanctions on conservative portions of the country, this time targeting states that are trying to restrict abortion. This is instructive. The Democratic Party, and far-left activists in general, are embracing rule by the CEO class instead of the common man. They want government by the affluent and educated, justified by the mantle of expertise. They presume that the rich and powerful have a right, even a duty, to enforce their moral vision on the country, with the rule of law as an optional extra. There is hypocrisy here, insofar as the same corporate class that is staking a moral claim to rule the United States is also eager to do business with the evil regimes elsewhere. They are sanctimonious at home while cozying up to tyrants and relying on slave labor abroad; apparently, social justice stops at the water’s edge.  But pointing out their hypocrisy will not make them change. They care about profits and social prestige, not moral consistency. This sets conservatives at a disadvantage in responding to our would-be oligarchs. We have little influence over the social status they crave, which is much more under the sway of people such as Greenhouse, who want them to be even more active in using oligarchic means to rule the nation. And free-market ideology has conditioned conservatives to be suspicious of government intrusions into business, leaving many on the right reluctant to use political power to combat woke capital. Nonetheless, there are reasons for hope. First, though there have been some pro-abortion corporate efforts, many CEOs remain hesitant to aggressively engage in abortion politics. There are still limits beyond which left-wing activism can hurt companies; for most businesses, becoming the oligarchic champion of abortion on demand is probably a poor branding decision. At least for now, enthusiasts for oligarchy such as Greenhouse are out ahead of what actual oligarchs are willing to do. Second, conservatives are overcoming their libertarian conditioning and are increasingly willing to use political power for the task of preservation. There is nothing conservative about allowing the country to slide into a woke corporatist oligarchy, especially when the government is helping push us down the slope.  Though conservatives recognize the need for humility and prudence in deploying government power, we do not abjure political power as a matter of principle. Thus, conservatives are learning to respond to the excesses of woke corporations and institutions, and the political backlash to concentrated oligarchic pressure on abortion would likely be fierce. We may hope that these factors keep business leaders from heeding Greenhouse’s plea. Nonetheless, her call for pro-abortion oligarchic intervention in American democracy is the logical end of the left’s capture of the upper class and concomitant abandonment of solidarity. More than any other issue, abortion illuminates how the Democratic Party, and the left in general, have rejected solidarity in favor of materialist individualism. A political movement that supports abortion will never produce genuine solidarity or social justice. Thus, it is to be expected that the Democrats’ embrace of abortion has been followed by a shift from being the party of the working class to the party of Wall Street. Though women from all classes procure abortions, the justifications for elective abortion are steeped in the sins of the rich: ambition, self-indulgence, the love of money, and indifference to the weak. Care for the least among us begins in the womb. Abortion is a turning away from human need and vulnerability in its most elemental form, and a breaking of the primordial social bond of mother, father, and child. Abortion is an assertion of “I” that violently excludes the “Thou” and “We” of interpersonal responsibility. In urging oligarchs to intervene against states that restrict the violence of abortion, Greenhouse has done us a favor. It’s not just that this highlights the oligarchic tendencies of the left, which have already been apparent on other issues — it’s that there could be no better evidence of the relationship between abortion and exploitation than a New York Times columnist urging the rich to subvert representative democracy in an effort to protect abortion on demand. We must prepare to resist such efforts, in order to protect both human life and self-government.

Thousands of women I have worked with over the past 25 years have suffered because of abortion, which all too often is not presented to them truthfully before their decision. They wrongly believe the lie that “life will go back to normal.” A woman I know is right now experiencing suicidal ideation because she still cannot believe she took the life of her baby.



Other women are pressured by boyfriends, husbands, and even parents to abort their unborn children only to deeply regret it and grow angry at themselves for not being stronger and standing up to them. Some women are left unable to have other children.



And although for decades we have been told abortion is a decision to be made between a woman and her doctor, doctors are suddenly no longer deemed necessary. Women are left to abort at home, facing any complications that arise alone.



Hochul Is Wrong



Hochul would have us believe she is a hero, “proud” to “protect and expand” abortions. But abortion isn’t “reproductive health.” It’s the intentional killing of vulnerable human life in the womb. Hochul and those who support this legislation are no heroes!



But New York can never really be a safe harbor for those “in need of care,” because abortion is not safe — never for the baby and countless times not for the mother as well.



One only needs to do an honest, thorough search to find the deaths of women across the country because of these abortions, but somehow these women never make it into Hochul’s narrative “for those in need of care.” She instead is intent on forcing taxpayers, in a state already in financial trouble, to promote abortions by allotting $35 million to providers and forcing insurance companies to cover abortions. She gives no thought to the trauma those who have suffered from abortion feel when their tax money goes to the killing of the unborn.



Hochul boasts about seeking to pass the Equal Rights Amendment to “enshrine” abortion in the state of New York, bragging that it will be a model for other states — as if killing the most unborn babies is something to boast about.



She says 81 percent of college students care about the ease of getting an abortion in choosing a college. Yet instead of being appalled that this is such a priority in choosing an education path and addressing that problem, she proudly proclaims New York would help them access their darkest desires.



As she stockpiles enough misoprostol to abort 150,000 unborn babies over the next five years, she does absolutely nothing to assist the countless women harmed by the action she seeks to enshrine, nor to provide for those college women who want to keep their children while continuing their education.



A Traumatized Nation



As director of a ministry for those suffering from abortion for more than 20 years here in the state of New York, where Hochul professes to be “fighting back” for women, I have seen thousands of women who learned way too late the harm abortion causes.



This legislation will leave us a nation with even more people wounded than the 63 million abortions our country has already left us with. It will seep deeper into all aspects of our society as more and more women, men, and siblings are physically and emotionally harmed as a result of abortion.



Hochul and others chose to ignore this aspect. She calls other people extremists yet is blind to her own extreme actions. Pro-abortion leftists do all they can within their power to silence the voices of those of us who have been there, because it does not fit into their extreme abortion agenda.



How many women will see their own babies lifeless in their toilets? How many of those college girls who take her up on her offer will be unable to complete college because of depression, anxiety, and an inability to handle what they have experienced through these abortions? How many thousands of unborn children will be flushed with no care nor regard for a “woman and her doctor”?



No, Hochul, your legislation is not something to be proud of; it is something to be ashamed of. It does not truly care for women. It cares for abortion and it is self-centered. In the end, it will lead to the destruction of New York and make it impossible to ignore the bloody truth of what abortion is and does.

"373",373,"Does The Heritage Foundation’s Health Plan Include Taxpayer Funding For Abortion?","Jacobs","Christopher",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-05-24"," When lawmakers write legislation, little details matter—a lot. In the case of a health plan that the Heritage Foundation and former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) are reportedly preparing to release in the coming days, a few words indicate the plan has not considered critically important details—like how Senate procedure intertwines with abortion policy—necessary to any substantive policy endeavor. A few short words in a summary of the Heritage plan leave the real possibility that the plan, if enacted as described, could lead to taxpayer funding of abortion coverage. Either Heritage and Santorum—both known opponents of abortion—have undertaken dramatic changes in their pro-life positions over the past few months, or they have failed to think through the full import of the policies they will release very shortly.  The details came via a summary Topher Spiro leaked on Twitter late last week. Spiro works at the liberal Center for American Progress—not exactly a group aligned with the cause of Obamacare repeal—which on its own would make his document of dubious provenance. However, multiple individuals participating in the Heritage meetings told me that the concepts and policies Spiro’s document discusses align with Heritage discussions. Spiro may have created that document based on verbal descriptions given to him of the Heritage plan (just as the New York Times’ list of questions Robert Mueller wants to ask President Trump likely came via Trump’s attorneys and not Mueller). But regardless of who created it, people in the Heritage group told me it accurately outlined the policy proposals under discussion. What Cost-Sharing Reductions Do The summary describes many policies, but one in particular stands out: Under “Short-term stabilization/premium relief,” the plan “Adopts the [Lamar] Alexander and [Susan] Collins appropriation for CSRs [cost-sharing reductions] and state reinsurance/high risk pool programs for 2019 and 2020.” On one level, this development should not come as a surprise. Party leaders often incorporate recalcitrant members’ pet projects (or, in the old days, earmarks) into a bill to obtain their votes: “See, we included the language that you wanted—you have to vote for our bill now!” Given that Collins as of last week had not even heard about the Heritage-led effort, one might think she would need some incentive to support the measure, which attaching her “stability” language might provide.  But on another level, the development seems shocking. As I spent the past eight months noting, providing CSR funds to insurers amounts to taxpayer funding of abortion coverage. By March, Republican leaders desperately wanted to pass a “stability” bill bailing out Obamacare, but controversies surrounding abortion funding prevented them from doing so. Why does anyone involved with the Heritage effort think that dynamic has changed in the past 6-8 weeks? About the Hyde Amendment and Byrd Rule The reference to CSRs takes on more importance because of the way Congress would consider Heritage’s plan. As with the Graham-Cassidy bill and other “repeal-and-replace” bills considered last year, the Senate would enact them using expedited budget reconciliation procedures. Those procedures theoretically allow all 51 Senate Republicans to circumvent a Democratic filibuster and pass a reconciliation bill on a party-line vote. However, as I outlined last year, the reconciliation process comes with procedural restrictions (i.e., the “Byrd rule”) to prevent senators from attaching “extraneous” and non-budgetary matter to a bill that cannot be filibustered. “Hyde amendment” restrictions—which prevent federal funding of abortion coverage, except in the cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother—represent a textbook example of the “Byrd rule,” because they have a fiscal impact “merely incidental” to the policy changes proposed. Former Senate Parliamentarian Bob Dove said as much about abortion restrictions Congress considered in 1995:  The Congressional Budget Office determined that it was going to save money. But it was my view that the provision was not there in order to save money. It was there to implement social policy. Therefore I ruled that it was not in order and it was stricken. In theory, the Senate could decide to waive the “Byrd rule” regarding the abortion coverage restrictions, but passing such a waiver requires 60 votes. Of course, Republicans don’t occupy 60 seats in the Senate. And if there were 60 votes in the Senate to pass abortion restrictions, Alexander (R-TN) and Collins (R-ME) would have succeeded in passing their “stability” package, which included funding for CSRs, back in March. After pushing for a vote for months, Collins suddenly backed off and didn’t force the issue on the Senate floor. She knew she didn’t have the votes—everyone knew she didn’t have the votes—because Democrats wouldn’t support a measure that restricted taxpayer funding of abortion coverage. Exactly nothing has changed that dynamic since Congress considered the issue in March. Why We Can’t Fund CSRs Republicans recognize the problems the abortion funding issue creates, and the Graham-Cassidy bill attempted to solve them by providing subsidies via a block grant to states. Graham-Cassidy funneled the block grant through the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), largely because the SCHIP statute includes the following language: “Funds provided to a state under this title shall only be used to carry out the purposes of this title, and any health insurance coverage provided with such funds may include coverage of abortion only if necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.” Because SCHIP already contains full Hyde protections on taxpayer funding of abortion, Graham-Cassidy ran the block grant program through SCHIP. Put another way, Graham-Cassidy borrowed existing Hyde amendment protections because any new protections would get in a budget reconciliation bill. It did the same thing for a “stability” fund for reinsurance or other mechanisms intended to lower premiums by subsidizing insurers, also referred to in Spiro’s document. But adding Hyde amendment restrictions to CSRs would likely prove an exercise in futility. As I noted above, the provisions would almost certainly not pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian. If they did not, Democrats would not vote to waive the “Byrd rule” to keep the restrictions in the bill—because most Democrats support taxpayer funding of abortion coverage, and wouldn’t want to help Republicans pass a “repeal-and-replace” bill on a party-line vote anyway. Creating a pot of money elsewhere in law—for instance, through the SCHIP statute, which does contain Hyde protections—and using that money to compensate insurers for reducing cost-sharing would prove just as unrealistic. The CSR payments reimburse insurers for discrete, specific discounts provided to discrete, specific low-income individuals. If the subsidy pool gave money to all insurers equally, regardless of the number of low-income enrollees they reduced cost-sharing for, then insurers would have a ready-built incentive to avoid attracting poor people, because enrolling low-income individuals would saddle them with an unfunded (or only partially funded) mandate. If the subsidy pool gave money to insurers based on their specific obligations under the Obamacare cost-sharing reduction requirements, then the parliamentarian would likely view this language as an attempt to circumvent the Byrd rule restrictions and strike it down. Not Ready for Prime Time Four participants in the Heritage meetings told me the group has discussed appropriating funds for CSR payments to insurers as part of the plan. Not a single individual said the Senate’s “Byrd rule” restrictions—which make enacting pro-life protections for such CSR payments all-but-impossible—came up when discussing an appropriation for cost-sharing payments to insurers. That silence signals one or more potential problems: A lack of regard for pro-life policy; an ignorance of Senate procedure, and its potential ramifications on the policies being considered; or a willingness to fudge details—allowing people to believe what they want to believe. Regardless, it speaks to the unformed nature of the proposal, despite meetings that have continued since the last time “repeal-and-replace” collapsed” nearly eight months ago. Earlier this month, Santorum claimed in an interview that while the original “Graham-Cassidy was a rush…this time we have the opportunity to get the policy better.” But any serious attempt to “get the policy better” wouldn’t have major lingering questions about tens of billions of dollars in “stability” funding, and whether such funds would subsidize abortion coverage, mere days before its public release. In this case, eight months of deliberations may not lead to a deliberative and coherent policy product.

"375",375,"Democrats, Media Freak Out Over Louisiana Bill Protecting Women From Abortion Pill Poisoning","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-05-23"," You wouldn’t know it from pro-abortion corporate media and Democrats’ commentary, but a bipartisan coalition of Louisiana legislators in the state House passed a bill this week that aims to punish anyone who knowingly tries to induce chemical abortion in a woman without her consent — the “crime of coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud.” 



The legislation also changes the drug classification of mifepristone and misoprostol to ensure possession of the most popular abortifacient combination on the market without a prescription is illegal.



The “Catherine and Josephine Herring Act” was created and named for sponsor Sen. Thomas Pressly’s sister and then-unborn niece whose lives were threatened when their ex-husband and father, respectively, drugged them using an abortion pill from Mexico.



Catherine and Josephine survived the attack thanks to the abortion pill reversal regime that Democrats and corporate media routinely smear.



“There was no ‘choice’ involved when my husband slipped abortion drugs into my drinks seven times,” Herring recalled. “I suffered serious side effects from the drugs that almost took my daughter’s life. As a survivor of domestic violence, I’m grateful for Louisiana’s willingness to protect women and children from those who intend to harm them with abortion drugs.”




Like usual, Kamala and the other Democrats squealing about this bill are not telling the truth.What this Louisiana bill did was criminalize possession of abortion drugs without a PRESCRIPTION.It was also an amendment added to a bill that made it a crime to slip abortion pills… https://t.co/HHAqhHKRm1 pic.twitter.com/Bm8cwH7JR8— Greg Price (@greg_price11) May 22, 2024
Poisoning an expectant mother, especially without her knowledge, the bill notes, “substantially increases the pregnant woman’s risk of death or serious bodily harm.” Mifepristone and misoprostol together are responsible for a 500 percent increase in abortion-related emergency room visits for side effects such as hemorrhage, “fast, weak pulse,” “shortness of breath,” diarrhea, dizziness, headache, nausea or vomiting, “pain” across the back, arms, neck, and abdomen, a myriad of other risks, and sometimes fatal complications.



Protecting women and their unborn babies is a proven bipartisan issue that should be uncontroversial. Vice President Kamala Harris, however, called Lousiana’s latest attempt to do so “absolutely unconscionable” and falsely claimed it “would criminalize the possession of medication abortion, with penalties of up to several years of jail time.”



“Let’s be clear: Donald Trump did this,” she wrote on X. 



U.S. House Minority Whip Katherine Clark shared a similar conspiracy theory on her X account. 



“In just the last 24 hours, Trump opened the door to banning birth control while his allies in Louisiana voted to criminalize the abortion pill. GOP extremists are coming after our most basic freedoms. Don’t look away,” she wrote. 



Pro-life laws in Louisiana, even with the introduction and passage of the new abortion pill bill, explicitly exempt pregnant women who have a prescription for abortifacients from the new fines and jail time. They also do “not apply to the sale, use, prescription, or administration of a contraceptive or an emergency contraceptive.”



Not even that truth, however, stopped the corporate media from joining the misinformation dogpile. 



The Associated Press claimed the bill, which still needs approval from the state Senate and a signature from the Republican governor, is “a move that doctors fear could prevent them from adequately treating their patients in a timely manner.”



NPR complained that the “proposed regulation could also target people who aren’t pregnant, but want to order abortion pills online and stock them in case of a future pregnancy.”



The fearmongering by abortion activists about the Louisiana bill is a direct attempt to dredge up public contempt for Republicans who act on voters’ wishes about life in the womb. Polling suggests a majority of registered voters do not agree that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration vetted the abortion pill “carefully enough to protect the health and safety of women” before approving it for widespread use.



The U.S. Supreme Court will decide this summer if the FDA, at the behest of the Biden administration, violated the law when it expanded the questionable abortion drug regimen via mail order and pharmacy sale.

"376",376,"66 Percent Of Irish Voters Legalized Abortion. Here’s What’s Next For Ireland","Scheer","Holly",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-05-28"," Ireland’s vote on the contentious Eighth Amendment has happened, and a majority decided to legalize abortion in the formerly prolife country. More than 66 percent of the voters voted to overturn the current laws. The vote leaves many across the country and the world wondering what comes next, and what this means on a practical level for the Irish people. Ireland’s society will be changing, and it’s important to know what this referendum actually addressed, and what the next likely legal and legislative steps for the country will be.  This Was a First-Trimester Referendum Once implemented, the referendum will allow abortions through the 12th week of pregnancy, or the end of the first trimester. Also planned to be allowed are special-case abortions, for health of the mother and other exceptions. This referendum does not address second- and third-trimester elective abortions. If Irish abortions follow the trends of the United States and other countries where abortion is legal, mothers’ first trimester is where the biggest percentage of abortions happen, often well over 90 percent. Making abortion legal in only the first trimester will still allow most Irish women who want an abortion to obtain one in their home country, instead of traveling to nearby England. In England, abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy—or past a child’s viability outside his mother—has been legal since 1967. Yearly, 1,000 Irish women have been traveling to England for an abortion. Late-Term Abortions Are Banned Under This Act Breaking News Ireland says “Simon Harris (Ireland’s Health Minister)  has said the requirement to certify that the foetus has not reached viability is an effective ban on later term abortions.  If viability is established and the pregnancy is ended on health grounds then it will be done through early delivery, with a full medical team on hand.”  It’s important to note this distinction from other countries’ abortion laws. Ireland plans to require all abortions past the point of viability, typically around 22 weeks of gestation, to be delivered instead of aborted, and for doctors to try to save these babies’ lives. The President Still Needs to Sign the Order In Ireland, the next step is for President Michael D. Higgins to sign the order written by Health Minister Simon Harris, and Higgins is expected to sign it. The order will be ready sometime before July, according to Irish sources, and it’s expected to pass through Ireland’s legislative houses, the Dáil and Seanad, despite lingering opposition. As these measures work through the legislative process, the current law, called the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, will be upheld, and abortion will still be illegal. Once passed, women in Ireland will be able to obtain first-trimester abortions in Irish hospitals. How Irish Women Will Eventually Obtain Abortions After the measure becomes law, there will be an enforced wait period for abortions. Women who want or need an abortion must wait 72 hours from their first doctor visit until the abortion. During this time, doctors can provide counseling, tests, and ultrasounds. The intention for this wait period is for women to make an informed and thoughtful decision.  Women will need to be examined and the pregnancy dated. Doctors will need to verify that women are 12 weeks pregnant or less, or 10 weeks into pregnancy from conception (most medical professionals date pregnancies from the mother’s last menstruation even though the child isn’t created until after ovulation, which happens around two weeks afterward). Abortions outside this window will only be allowed if they meet criteria that is still being decided, but will include exceptions for the health of the mother, including mental health and chronic medical conditions. In these cases, two doctors will need to agree that the abortion is medically necessary. One will need to be an obstetrician, and one a specialist in the medical condition from which the woman claims danger. The obstetrician will be the one to perform the abortion, which must happen before the baby is viable. Otherwise the baby will be delivered. Similarly, if the mother seeks an abortion because of abnormalities or disabilities with the baby, two doctors must agree on the baby’s condition. In the current plan, doctors will follow up with women, and offer post-abortion care. Women outside of Ireland’s medical card system will have to pay for the doctor visits and clinic and hospital bills for the procedures, unlike in Great Britain’s socialized National Health System. The situation in Ireland will continue to change, and it’s possible that the currently proposed procedures will shift as politicians finalize the details. It’s clear, however, that abortion will soon be legal in Ireland. ","https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/28/66-percent-irish-voters-legalized-abortion-heres-whats-next-ireland/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"377",377,"Biden’s FDA Can’t Get Its Story Straight On Who Can Sue Over Abortion Rules","Picciotti-Bayer","Andrea",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-06-10"," Americans should be alarmed by the Biden administration’s aggressive attempts to roll back pro-life protections for women and children while ignoring the plethora of dangers associated with chemical abortion — which accounted for 642,700 abortions in 2023, the first full year after the Dobbs decision.   



This trend is not only ethically disturbing but highly troubling from a medical perspective. Thankfully, a group of doctors and medical associations has sued the Biden FDA for its hasty decision to lift safety regulations related to chemical abortion drugs in one of the first cases since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The court is expected to release a decision in U.S. Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine this summer. 



And despite the argument by some that the plaintiffs lack standing — which is no surprise given the no-holds-barred approach to abortion-on-demand from the media and Biden administration — there are compelling reasons for the court to hear them out. 



Unable to get the FDA’s attention with citizen petitions sounding the alarm on the increasing dangers to women of chemical abortion drugs, four national medical associations and four individual doctors experienced in caring for pregnant and post-abortive patients sued the FDA. Federal district court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk agreed with the doctors, ruling that when the FDA eased requirements for prescribing the drugs its actions were unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. This ruling was subsequently affirmed by a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.



Predictably, the Biden administration petitioned the Supreme Court for review. Its main claim is that the court should not even consider the merits of the case and throw it out because the plaintiffs lack standing — the legal right to sue in federal court.   



How convenient.  



Declarations submitted by the doctors and medical associations attest that, as a result of the loosening of guidelines, many more women and girls accessing this drug are suffering complications, often ending up in the emergency room. These doctors “feel complicit in an elective chemical abortion” when treating women suffering from acute complications.



Removal of necessary safeguards for women and girls who use chemical abortion drugs, they explain, “place physicians in higher-risk situations with less critical information about patients, thus increasing their exposure to allegations of malpractice and potential liability.”



They add, and this is crucial, that “with the increase in women and girls suffering emergency complications from chemical abortion or seeking to reverse the effects of the chemical abortion regimen, there is a direct correlation in the decrease in time, attention, and resources that emergency department doctors have to treat their other patients.”  



During oral argument, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar tried to narrow the doctors’ declarations to a mere crisis of conscience that could easily be remedied by asking the hospital to allow them to opt out of caring for a woman who is suffering complications related to medical abortion. “It’s speculative that any of those women would seek care from the two specific doctors who asserted conscience injuries,” she said. “And even if that happened, federal conscience protections would guard against the injury the doctors face.”



But the last thing these doctors want is to see women suffer complications of a chemical abortion. The even stronger conscience-based objection they make, and Prelogar ignores, is that because of the FDA’s action, an ever-increasing number of women are now unduly placed in harm’s way. 



Justice Clarence Thomas, whose questioning during oral argument is notably brief and always to the point, wasn’t willing to play along. He asked Prelogar, “Could you give us an example of who would have standing … to challenge these FDA actions?” Instead of answering the question, Prelogar argued that the doctors challenging the FDA “stand at a far distance from the upstream regulatory action they’re challenging.” 



Justice Samuel Alito, author of the court’s opinion in Dobbs, was not satisfied with this response. He followed up by asking, “Is there anybody who could challenge in court the lawfulness of what the FDA did here?” Prelogar responded: “In this particular case, I think the answer is no.” Even Chief Justice John Roberts, citing the “remote nature of the injury” and “small number of adverse effects,” followed up with a chilling question: “What percentage of adverse consequences would be enough? What percentage of emergency room visits would be enough?”  



It is ironic that for years, Big Abortion challenged the constitutionality of abortion restrictions on behalf of prospective clients but now argues that doctors caring for patients with abortion-related complications can’t complain. In addition to speaking on behalf of their future patients, the doctors and medical groups challenging the FDA’s erasing of safety guidelines clearly satisfy standing requirements, not only because they are made involuntarily “complicit in abortion,” but also because their attention to other patients is taxed by the onslaught of medical emergencies afflicting women undergoing chemical abortions. 



Judicial review of the FDA’s grossly irresponsible erasure of standards for chemical abortion is urgently needed. Otherwise, we’re betraying the growing number of vulnerable pregnant women and the principled doctors who are treating them when these “safe and effective” treatments go horribly wrong.

"378",378,"Media Activists Won’t Grill Democrats On Unpopular Abortion Extremism Because They Agree With It","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-09-20"," As if it wasn’t already apparent from their overblown coverage advocating against abortion restrictions like the 15-week abortion ban Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced last week, the corrupt corporate media is not interested in making Democrats reckon with their deeply unpopular abortion extremism. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio confirmed that this week when he “emailed 55 different reporters from 40 major news outlets” asking if they ever bothered to press Democrats on whether they support any restrictions on abortion, when a baby in the womb is considered viable, and whether Planned Parenthood is qualified to declare a pregnant mother’s life is in danger.  Democrats have poured more than $124 million into TV advertisements with hopes of making abortion their topline midterm issue. Rubio’s own challenger Val Demings put millions towards ads promoting abortion, voted to codify unlimited abortion, urged Democrats in the Senate to ignore the restraints of the filibuster to vote the same, and admitted that she believes abortionists should be able to change the parameters of viability to accommodate women’s desires to get abortions. Despite this intense and expensive commitment to promoting unlimited, on-demand abortion, blue politicians have escaped any scrutiny about their unpopular abortion stances from their allies in the corporate media. That’s why it’s no surprise that of the dozens of outlets Rubio emailed, including ABC News, Axios, Bloomberg, CBS News, CNN, NBC News, New York Post, NPR, the Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and more, each one failed to “provide documentation it had asked Democrats a single tough question on abortion.” In fact, Rubio reported the only three corporate media mouthpieces that responded to his inquiry were defensive. Business Insider even published a piece classifying Rubio’s questions as “combative.”  “Democrats get away with murder, literally. They are never pushed to answer specific questions about where they stand on the taking of human life,” Rubio said in a statement. “The truth is that every single Democrat supports taxpayer funded abortion without any restrictions up until the moment a child is born. That is the truth, but Democrats never have to explain their radical position, because the press is all too willing to cover for them.” Rubio is right. The corporate press is not just failing to ask tough questions. Media outlets are deliberately refusing to ask key questions because they know doing so will expose Democrats’ abortion views for what they are: unpopular, unjust, and extreme. “There is no benefit to asking Democrats tough questions because their readers—the people that pay their salaries—don’t want to hear it. Besides, they agree with the Democrats anyway,” Rubio continued. Democrats’ radical track record when it comes to abortion is no secret. They want to push unlimited abortions in all 50 states and will stop at nothing, including the filibuster, to ensure it happens.  Yet, while voters are busy trying to cover their increasingly expensive grocery bills, wondering how they will pay for electricity this month, and thinking about which 2022 midterm candidates will help lower prices at the pump, the press is aiding Democrats in their mission to make their radical abortion campaign national by ignoring the vilest, most obvious premise of that campaign. That’s not just a dereliction of duty, that’s purposeful enabling of the left’s abortion propaganda without remorse.

"379",379,"Abortion Activists Name Republican-Controlled Nebraska As Next Radical Ballot Battleground","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-11-16"," Planned Parenthood, the ACLU of Nebraska, the Women’s Fund, and I Be Black Girl banded together to file a petition proposal that seeks to enshrine unlimited abortion through all nine months of pregnancy in the Nebraska state constitution. The proposed petition comes mere weeks after an ALCU-penned abortion amendment passed in Ohio and is part of a coordinated effort by national abortion activists to infiltrate red states, bypass Republican legislators, and taint constitutions with abortion and radical gender ideology provisions.  The national coalition’s attack on unborn babies, women, and parental rights began with a petition that must receive close to 125,000 verified signatures by summer 2024 to put the constitutional amendment on the November 2024 ballot. Republicans in Nebraska control the governorship, the secretary of state, the attorney general’s office, and the state legislature. Under their watch, Nebraska outlawed abortions beyond 12 weeks gestation in May and banned mail-order abortion pills. Currently, any woman in the state who seeks an abortion within the permitted 12-week span still has 24 hours after receiving counseling to change her mind about ending her unborn baby’s life. Parents of any minor who seeks an abortion must also be notified of that intent and grant consent. Under the amendment proposed by the organizations whose funding is threatened by the state’s current abortion limits, Nebraskans would not be able to limit abortion to 15 weeks, something that a majority of Americans say they support.  The petition proposal claims the state would be barred from “interference” in abortions “until fetal viability.” That language alone could eliminate Nebraska’s mandatory waiting period, parental consent laws, ban on mailed chemical abortifacients, and other safeguards designed to protect women and babies. The proposal also leaves the definition of “viability” in the hands of abortionists. According to this proposal, babies who require “extraordinary medical measures,” such as a trip to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to survive outside of the womb are not considered viable. Additionally, the “object” statement includes an exception for any abortions deemed necessary to “protect the life or health of the pregnant patient.” “Health” is not defined as physical and could be easily expanded to justify abortions for financial, emotional, familial, mental, or other reasons.  There are several strategies Nebraska Republicans and the organizations that make up its Pro-Life Coalition can use to fight back, but they must start now to get ahead of the lies and deception that plague ballot fights like this one.  Already, corporate media are amplifying the Nebraska ballot proposal as abortion activists’ next win in a Republican-controlled state. “Emboldened by success in other red states, effort launched to protect abortion rights in Nebraska,” the Associated Press and Washington Post chimed in. “Nebraska’s law currently allows abortion throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but that isn’t enough for the abortion industry and activists who are trying to write second- and third-trimester abortions into our constitution. This amendment would allow for abortion until the moment of birth,” Nebraska Right to Life Executive Director Sandy Danek said in a statement. “This ballot measure is not pro-choice, it’s pro-abortion, and it does not reflect the values of Nebraskans.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2023/11/16/abortion-activists-name-republican-controlled-nebraska-as-next-radical-ballot-battleground/",0.8361,0.1639,"male",2012,2012
"380",380,"California Bill Openly Admits Abortion Was Always About Killing Babies","Richardson","Katelynn",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-04-12"," Activists’ days of using sanitized euphemisms to mask the horrors of abortion are drawing to a close. The vague “right to choose” mantra is quickly morphing into the right to kill a full-term baby after birth, with no questions asked.



A California bill passed last week by the state Assembly Judiciary Committee and now on its way to the Assembly Health Committee could permit infanticide, opponents warn. The bill, AB 2223, is brought to citizens by the Future of Abortion Council, a group of more than 40 abortion advocacy groups organized at the urging of Gov. Gavin Newsom to help make California an “abortion sanctuary” state.



The bill’s sponsor, Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, claims it does not legalize infanticide but “protects reproductive freedom by clarifying that the Reproductive Privacy Act prohibits pregnancy criminalization.” 



However, the text prohibits investigations into deaths “related to or following known or suspected self-induced or criminal abortion” and would “delete the requirement that an unattended fetal death be handled as a death without medical attendance.” The bill also removes criminal liability for “actions or omissions” with respect to pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. 



‘Perinatal Death’ Is Frighteningly Broad 



The biggest problem is found in Section 7, where the bill provides broad protection in the case of “perinatal death due to a pregnancy-related cause.” The bill text states:



The Legislature finds and declares that every individual possesses a fundamental right of privacy with respect to personal reproductive decisions, which entails the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy, including prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management, and infertility care. …Notwithstanding any other law, a person shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or penalty, or otherwise deprived of their rights under this article, based on their actions or omissions with respect to their pregnancy or actual, potential, or alleged pregnancy outcome, including miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion, or perinatal death due to a pregnancy-related cause.



Legal experts explain the word “perinatal” is not clearly defined, meaning it could be used to justify killing a baby weeks after birth, depending on how it is interpreted by courts. According to multiple dictionaries, “perinatal” means “the period around childbirth, especially the five months before and one month after birth.” 



The California Family Council notes that definitions of the word all include the period from 22 weeks of gestation to at least seven days post-birth. The World Health Organization also holds to this definition. 



Existing California law expands the period. In California’s Welfare and Institutions Code, “perinatal” refers to the period “from the establishment of pregnancy to one month following delivery.” Elsewhere, the term “perinatal services” encompasses 60 days after delivery.



Cases of babies surviving abortion attempts have been extensively documented. But this bill permits abortionists to allow infants born alive to die by neglect.



“In California under AB 2223, former Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell, who murdered three infants born alive after botched abortions, could not be prosecuted,” explained Susan Arnall, an attorney and director of outreach for the Right to Life League. “And incredibly, someone like Gosnell who helped a California mother kill her newborn after birth will actually have a cause of action to sue police for investigating the matter if AB 2223 becomes law.”



Don’t Let the Vague Amendment Fool You



AB 2223 was amended on April 6 to add “due to a pregnancy-related cause” at the end of “perinatal death.” But Arnall told me the addition is meaningless and does “absolutely nothing to address the justifiable concerns relating to infanticide” or change what constitutes a perinatal death.



“To date, AB 2223 as amended will decriminalize infanticide — the death of a baby born alive, whether as a result of a failed abortion (which is already exempted from prosecution by CA Penal Code Section 187) or for some other reason like neglect or harm by the mother or a third party during the perinatal period,” Arnall said.



Arnall believes the amended bill also still discourages investigation into infant deaths.



“While the April 6 amendments attempt to address problems concerning immunity for government investigations, the bill will likely chill investigation of infant deaths since it empowers mothers and anyone connected with the death of a newborn to bring a private cause of action for damages ($25,000 penalty), including the threat of attorney fees upon motion to a judge, against people who inquire into a newborn’s death,” she said. “What impact will this bill have on private health care providers, doctors or nurses who report a perinatal death?”



Pro-lifers often highlight the absurdity of pro-choice arguments by pointing out there is no practical difference between a baby just before birth and just after birth. Once upon a time, this challenge gave some abortion advocates pause. Not anymore.



As California Family Council President Jonathan Keller told CBN, AB 2223 opens the door to “open season on unwanted newborns.”



“For years, pro-life advocates have argued there is no moral difference between ending a child’s life days before birth or days after birth,” Keller said. “California’s pro-abortion legislators now seemingly agree.”



It’s Not Just California



A similar bill in Maryland, SB 669, entirely strips pre-born babies of all rights, declaring that nothing “shall be construed to confer personhood or any rights on the fetus.” It also bans investigations or criminal charges for death by neglect during the perinatal period.



“One blue-state bill that would allow a born baby to be neglected to death might be an anomaly,” said author Wesley J. Smith in response to the Maryland bill. “A second that does that — and perhaps could be interpreted to allow infanticide, also — is a pattern,” he continued. “The cultural Left is blazing new grounds of depravity.”



In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis last week signed HB 1279, which will specifically strip unborn babies of any rights as human beings, as well as “permit abortion-on-demand for any reason in Colorado, permit abortion discrimination based on sex or race or ability level,” according to the Catholic Charities Archdiocese of Denver.



The progression should not come as a total surprise, as academics, most notably Princeton University ethics professor Peter Singer, have been discussing the case for infanticide for years. Three years ago, Virginia Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam made headlines for suggesting that a baby who survived an abortion could be killed by doctors at the mother’s direction. The law is just catching up.



AB 2223 is one of many pieces of legislation supported by California’s Future of Abortion Council. In January, Governor Newsom also allocated $20 million of the state budget proposal to loan repayments and scholarships for medical students and healthcare providers who “commit to providing reproductive health care services.”



As the final touch on an already radical bill, AB 2223 erases the fact that pregnancy is a uniquely female gift, replacing all references to “women” with “pregnant people.”

"381",381,"Left Trying To Revive Equal Rights Amendment To Get Abortion In The Constitution","Schlafly Cori","Anne",NA,"Hawkins, Kristan",NA,NA,"2019-03-28"," A trio of female leaders representing grassroots organizations with a national presence spearheaded a Capitol Hill briefing on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) earlier this month to illustrate, once more, that the abortion agenda has hijacked the women’s movement, to the detriment of what women truly want and need. Facing a renewed push for passage of the ERA, Eagle Forum and Students for Life of America (SFL) sponsored a briefing for legislators and their staff because, although the legal deadline has long passed and proponents of the ERA failed to win the hearts and minds of Americans, the abortion lobby is in full swing trying to create a constitutional foothold for abortion within the ERA.  The ‘Everything Related to Abortion’ Act Yet fundamental problems exist with the ERA proposal, which should be renamed the Everything Related to Abortion Act. As the Daily Beast recently reported: “The ERA would provide the framework for an equality argument: Women’s equality necessarily requires reproductive and bodily autonomy, and without control over our bodies, women cannot participate as full and equal citizens in this country.” Such phrasing is code for abortion, something feminists in the ’70s understood as well. Betty Friedan, one of the founders of the modern pro-ERA movement, stated in her March 1978 letter to the International Women’s Year Conference delegates: “The ERA has become both symbol and substance for the whole of the modern woman’s movement of equality. Further, I am convinced if we lose this struggle for the ERA, we will have little hope in our own lifetime of saving our right to abortion.” But the ERA was unnecessary for protecting women’s great need for access to the full benefits of society and protections from unique harms. In the context of the times, many laws other than ERA were advanced to protect women’s interests in a society that had too often ignored their needs. But those laws that would be in danger should the ERA pass. In a letter coordinated by Students for Life, leading pro-family and pro-life leaders reminded the legislators in Virginia (who recently ended the push for ERA) that women-friendly laws would suffer if the ERA were ratified. The letter noted:  ERA specifically states that a person’s sex could not be considered in making a legal preference. With that in mind, consider the many protections designed for women that would be impacted and harmed including the Equal Pay Act of 1963; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972; the Federal Minimum Wage Act of 1974, and the Pregnancy Nondiscrimination Act of 1964.”
In fact, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in Sex Bias in the U.S. Code that the ERA will change 800 federal laws … The financial impact on women is incalculable, and ERA will do nothing to focus attention on sexual crimes against women, as a focus on women would be discouraged. The ERA Is Wholly Unnecessary Equality for women has already been found in the Constitution. Ginsburg was an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union when she wrote the plaintiff’s brief in a case that made women’s constitutional rights clear in Reed v. Reed, finding that the 14th Amendment did apply to both men and women. Passage of the ERA would open a Pandora’s box of litigation, beginning with the fact that the legal deadline for passing the ERA has long been missed, and even since that deadline, some states have reconsidered and pulled their support. Serious problems exist with the legal status of the proposal, making Congress a logical next stop as ERA advocates try to fix the issue of the lapsed expiration date. Then there is the controversy surrounding taxpayer funding of abortion. Already, state supreme courts have found that ERA-like laws at the state levels do require taxpayer funding of abortion, something that most Americans oppose and would also be hotly contested by pro-life advocates in court. Consider that “Every justice on the New Mexico Supreme Court agreed that this classic ERA language mandates taxpayer-funding of abortions. The unanimous court held that a state ban on tax-funded abortions “undoubtedly singles out for less favorable treatment a gender-linked condition that is unique to women.”  If the ERA truly is not about abortion, but is only a measure for women’s access and rights in society, a compromise does exist. Pro-life leaders have advocated that a line be added, noting: “Nothing in this article [the ERA] shall be construed to grant, secure, or deny any right relating to abortion or the funding thereof.” Not surprisingly, abortion advocates have opposed this language. The ERA Is an Attempt to Prop Up the Abortion Lobby In our briefing, we addressed the question “Is Equality Equal?” noting that the stated goal of helping women won’t be met, but rather the interests of the abortion industry will win with this radical move. Abortion is not the key opening the door to women’s advancement. Educational opportunity, access to capital, fair treatment in the workplace, and aggressive law enforcement attention to crimes against women are just a few things that truly put women on a level playing field with their fellow citizens. But should ERA win passage, the result would be a dramatically empowered federal government on issues it decides impact women. Consider the words of Phyllis Schlafly, who championed women’s interest while opposing the ERA, when she debated Friedan on “Good Morning America” in 1976. Now I don’t think we are going improve things by letting (the federal government) decide these things, which is what ERA will do. It transfers these authorities to the federal government … It was back in 1875 that the Supreme Court said that the women have all the constitutional protections. In the case of Minor vs. Happersett, we have all the constitutional protections that men have and the ERA is not going to add any more Constitutional protections, but it will cause all kinds of nonsense.  Anne Schlafly Cori and Kristan Hawkins

"383",383,"Hillary Says She Wants More Questions About Abortion. Here Are 10 She Won’t Answer","Harsanyi","David",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-04-18"," During the last Democratic Party debate, Hillary Clinton demanded to know why the media wasn’t asking her about abortion. “We’ve not had one question about a woman’s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care. Not one question,” she plaintively pointed out. Hilary Weaver at New York translated Hillary’s plea to mean: “Why the hell aren’t we talking about the fact that a bunch of conservative dudes want to police my body?” Well, that’s not a question. That’s a political platitude with a question mark at the end. It’s also an inane way of framing a complex debate that, in its fairest reading, pits questions about life against privacy concerns. But Weaver is right. It’s exactly what Hillary would like to talk about. Because Democrats don’t want to answer questions about the science or the moral implications of abortion, they want to talk about a bunch of conservative dudes.  Hillary should be asked about abortion. It’s not widely known, for example, that most elected Democrats support legal abortion on demand to the moment of crowning — as long as the woman has huddled with her physician and family members and decided the fetus is a superfluous appendage and not a human being. This, quite notably, is one of the only important decisions in everyday American life that Democrats believe government should stay out of. So, since Clinton’s interested, why not start with the fundamental question: When does life begin? Is it whenever the mom decides life begins, or is it when science decides, or when courts decide, or when the kid is having her first birthday party? If this question is above your pay grade, why are you willing to bet the lives of around 10,000 viable babies every year on a guess? Should government not err on the side of protecting life?  This issue was broached by “Face the Nation” moderator John Dickerson when he asked Hillary: “Do you support a federal limit on abortion at any stage of pregnancy?” At the time, Clinton answered that she did not support any federal limitations on abortion. So, in other words, not at any stage. Period. Yet in a later interview with Chuck Todd, she claimed that there “can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother.” This was widely interpreted as Clinton walking back the initial position. But I’m convinced it was just a Clintonian prevarication. Question: Yes, there “can be” limitations, but do you, Hillary Clinton, candidate for the presidency of the United States in 2016, believe there should be any limitations on abortion? Almost No Abortions Are for a Mother’s Life Hillary also told CBS she thought “that the kind of late-term abortions that take place are because of medical necessity. And, therefore, I would hate to see the government interfering with that decision.” Do you support the legal right of women to have abortions in the late third trimester even if their life is not threatened? This contention is made all the time and rarely challenged. In reality, most abortions of viable babies in America have nothing to do with protecting the life of the mother. Not even the abortion industry’s propaganda outfit, Guttmacher Institute, believes this is true. In the only study it conducted on the reasons women have late-term abortion, Guttmacher found that in “many ways, women who had later abortions were similar to those who obtained first-trimester procedures.”  At the pro-life Charlotte-Lozier Institute, Dr. Elizabeth Johnson argues that both medical literature and late-term abortion providers show the majority of late-term procedures are not performed for “maternal health complications or lethal fetal anomalies discovered late in pregnancy.” So it’s, at least, a debatable contention. Perhaps Hillary could clarify her position by answering this question: “Do you support the legal right of women to have abortions in the late third trimester even if their life is not threatened in any way?” Don’t Stop There Some potential follow ups: Have you ever been to a NICU unit? What is the moral or scientific difference between disposing of (or whatever euphemism for “killing” you’re comfortable with) a viable baby in utero or in the hospital? Do you believe women who are pro-life or oppose late-term abortions should be equated to terrorist groups? Do you believe women should have the legal right to use abortion as a tool of eugenics? For example, should abortion be available to people who don’t want to be saddled with a Down Syndrome child? Do you believe women should have the legal right to have abortions as a means of selecting the sex of their babies? How about eye color? Will New Evidence Make a Difference? At the debate, Hillary pivoted off her support of overturning the First Amendment via Citizens United to bring up abortion again. “The only people I would appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe Roe v. Wade is settled,” Hillary said, who is malleable on free expression but not on late-term abortions. This position, judging by almost any poll, is considered extremist by a majority of Americans, including women. So, question: If new science comes to light—if, for instance, science proves a fetus can feel pain and is sentient at 20 weeks—would you change your mind? Or is abortion an inherent human right that can’t be amended no matter what evidence surfaces? When then-presidential candidate Rand Paul, whose rhetoric on life issues is far less cowardly than that of most Republicans, was attacked by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, he asked her if she thought it was okay to kill a “seven-pound baby in the uterus.” Her answer: “I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved. Period. End of story. ” So yes. No limits. This position, judging by almost any poll, is considered extremist by a majority of Americans, including women. Yet the media fails to dig in as they might with someone like Todd Akin, who has similarly odious positions. Why aren’t we asking every Democrat, including Hillary, if he or she believes there should be absolutely no limits on abortion, period? “Do you believe the act of killing a seven-pound, viable baby in the uterus for convenience is immoral?” Ask her.

BREAKING: @AP reports that Louisiana has passed Amendment 1, which establishes there is no constitutional right to an abortion. pic.twitter.com/JRaECGhLhe
— Catherine Hadro (@CatHadro) November 4, 2020

Pro-life Democrat State Sen. Katrina Jackson penned the amendment which was co-sponsored by people on both sides of the political aisle.
According to Jackson, the amendment grants more power to the legislators when it comes to evaluating abortion policy.
“It’s important to understand that Amendment 1 is not a ban on abortion. It simply keeps abortion policy in the hands of our legislators rather than state judges,” Jackson wrote.
“Our body of pro-life laws ensure that women are empowered with the truth about their pregnancy prior to an abortion, that minors seeking an abortion have parental consent, and that babies born alive following a botched abortion receive immediate medical care. Our law also makes sure that not a dollar of your state tax dollars fund abortion. Yet these laws and others are at risk unless we pass Amendment 1,” Jackson said.
Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Denise Burke says the passage of Amendment 1 is a big victory for the pro-life community.
“Louisiana voters have reaffirmed that every innocent human life — whether born or not — is worthy of legal protection and clarified that no ‘right to abortion’ can be found in their state’s constitution,” Burke said.
“Louisiana voters have taken an important step toward strengthening a culture of life and ending abortion on demand in their state,” she added.
While many states and people on the left peddle the narrative that abortion is a constitutionally ensured right, Burke notes that killing babies is not health care, nor is it something Americans should be entitled to.
“Unfortunately, state court judges in more than a dozen other states have already invented or manufactured a state-level constitutional right to abortion where none exists,” she said. ” But the government should protect life instead of pretending that abortion is somehow healthcare.”

"386",386,"Walgreens Says It Won’t Sell Abortion Pills In Kansas After State AG Threatens Legal Action","Dalke","Spencer",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-02-22"," Walgreens said on Friday it does not plan to dispense abortion pills in Kansas after state Attorney General Kris Kobach wrote a letter to the pharmacy warning of legal action if it goes along with President Joe Biden’s abortion-for-all scheme. In early January, Walgreens became the first pharmacy to announce it would sell the lethal chemical abortion drug mifepristone, in stores and by mail, under new rules by Biden’s Food and Drug Administration, which are intended to kick the door open for dangerous at-home abortions and work around pro-life laws in red states. Mifepristone is part of a two-drug process for killing and expelling a preborn baby from his or her mother’s womb.  Kobach blamed the “ends-justify-the-means” Biden administration for muddying the issue and objected to the drugs being sold in Kansas. “I have become aware of your company’s recently announced plan to provide abortifacients through its mail-order pharmacy business,” Kobach wrote in a letter to Walgreens executive Danielle Gray on Feb. 6. “As the chief law enforcement officer in Kansas, I am writing to advise you that this plan is illegal, and Kansas will not hesitate to enforce the law.” According to Kobach, Walgreens’ plan violates both federal law and state statute. Kansas statute requires that abortion-inducing drugs such as mifepristone “be given to the patient by or in the same room and in the physical presence of the physician who prescribed, dispensed or otherwise provided the drug or prescription to the patient.” Furthermore, though Biden’s FDA approves of sending mifepristone through the mail for DIY chemical abortions, Kobach notes that under Title 18, Section 1461 of the United States Code, “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion” is considered “nonmailable matter” and thus cannot be mailed. “Ordinarily, the national government’s steadfast determination not to enforce the law would be the end of things,” Kobach wrote. “But §1461 is not a normal criminal statute because it can be enforced by an ordinary private-party lawsuit,” meaning, according to the attorney general, that private parties are authorized under Title 18, Section 1964 to sue entities that violate Section 1461, among other statutes. In response to Kobach’s warning, Gray, the executive vice president of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which owns Walgreens pharmacies, said:  Walgreens does not intend to dispense Mifepristone within your state and does not intend to ship Mifepristone into your state from any of our pharmacies. If this approach changes, we will be sure to notify you. Kansas isn’t standing alone against federal pressure to provide virtually on-demand, mail-order abortion in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Twenty other state attorneys general have issued similar warnings to CVS and Walgreens over the legally dubious and dangerous plan. While touted by Democrats as health care, chemical abortions, which account for more than half of abortions in the United States, are not only lethal for the unborn child but extremely risky for the baby’s mother, especially given the lack of physician oversight when performed at home. A study published in Obstetrics and Gynecology concluded that women who get chemical abortions are four times more likely to experience complications than those who get surgical abortions. Other research shows abortion pills such as mifepristone are associated with a 500 percent increase in abortion-related ER visits. As The Federalist’s Jordan Boyd reported: One longitudinal study revealed that, in at least 17 states with taxpayer-funded abortion, many of which have relaxed chemical abortion laws, emergency room visits within 30 days following chemical abortions grew to nearly 34 percent of all ER visits as of 2015. The same study concluded that “chemical abortion is consistently and progressively associated with more postabortion ER visit morbidity than surgical abortion,” and the risks have been increasing year after year. “President Biden is beholden to the country’s most extreme pro-abortion voices, who constantly advocate for expanding the abortion regime without any consideration of legality or even women’s safety,” Kobach told Gray. “But nothing requires you to join him. The law says what it says. I encourage you to follow it.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/22/kansas-attorney-general-kobach-warns-walgreens-against-illegal-sale-of-abortion-drugs/",0.9067,0.0933,"male",2012,2012
"387",387,"Post-Dobbs, Corporate Media Rushes To Smear Free Maternal Care Centers That Don’t Provide Abortion","Hajicek","Olivia",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-06-29"," Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson, which overruled Roe v. Wade, crisis pregnancy centers have been cast in a negative light by corporate media framing the centers as “fake abortion clinics.”



The day Dobbs was released, two McClatchey news sites — Georgia’s Ledger-Enquirer and Mississippi’s SunHerald — ran similar articles by Mona Moore on “Anti-Abortion ‘Fake Clinics.'” 



“Jackson Women’s Health Organization is the state’s only abortion provider, but Mississippi has two “fake” abortion clinics — one in McComb and one in Bay St. Louis,” Moore wrote in the SunHerald. “According to Planned Parenthood, fake clinics (often called crisis pregnancy centers) look like health centers but have a hidden agenda. The anti-abortion centers advertise free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds and counseling, but do not include abortion as an option.” 



The same day, an article on “fake clinics” by Izaak Anderson ran in Idaho News 6. “According to the National Library of Medicine, “fake abortion clinics” or “fake clinics” are businesses that advertise similar services to abortion clinics, but instead talk those who are pregnant through options to discourage them from having an abortion,” Andersen wrote. “Also known as crisis pregnancy centers, these businesses advertise similar to an abortion clinic. Instead, they don’t provide abortions or offer a full range of health care for pregnant people or planning to get an abortion.”



The Lewiston Tribune in Idaho also published a similar article the day Dobbs came out. In it, Shaun Goodwin wrote, “A ‘fake clinic,’ also known as a crisis pregnancy center, is a clinic that advertises services similar to an abortion clinic, but with a different agenda. Instead of performing abortion services, the staff talks women through their options but ultimately attempts to discourage them from having an abortion.”



All four articles list signs from Planned Parenthood’s website that a clinic may be “fake.” 



On Monday, NBC ran a segment in which former Texas Republican state Rep. Sarah Davis called the state’s Alternatives to Abortion program “a program to make Republicans feel good like they’re doing something to help women” and said it didn’t help women. Davis and Texas Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard agreed that “in some instances they are actually committing fraud.” 



This is a ridiculous line of argument, considering that the vast majority of health-care establishments also do not perform abortions. Hospitals, doctor’s offices, and other completely legitimate and fully licensed health-care entities provide a great variety of care without also performing abortions. It’s not nefarious.



According to Scott Whitlock, research director for Newsbusters.org at The Media Research Center, negative coverage of crisis pregnancy centers following Dobbs is strategic. 



“The main way that the networks respond to crisis pregnancy center is to ignore them,” Whitlock said in an email to The Federalist. “The only reason we’re seeing coverage now is because of Dobbs. Journalists have to discredit crisis pregnancy centers so they can push this myth that conservatives want to abandon mothers in need now that Roe is overturned.”

"388",388,"The Repeal Of Ireland’s Abortion Ban Marks A New Paganism","Daniel Davidson","John",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-05-29"," Americans tend to have a sentimental interest in Ireland. We think of Guinness and “Danny Boy” and “Whiskey In The Jar,” Saint Patrick and the Book of Kells and the monks who saved civilization. But it’s time to get real. On Friday last week, the people of Ireland voted overwhelmingly to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish constitution, which had enshrined a right-to-life protection for unborn children. More than 66 percent voted to repeal the amendment, and only 33 percent voted against repeal. The referendum marks the first time in history a people have freely chosen to embrace mothers freely killing their unborn children.  The Irish journalist John Waters, writing about the referendum on Monday in First Things, captured the essence of the thing: “history seemed to have gone into reverse: the Resurrection behind, Calvary in front. On Friday, the Irish people climbed Calvary backwards, in the name of progress.” It’s difficult to understand the results of the referendum in any other terms. Progress in the name of liberalism has conquered whatever last vestiges of Christian morality still obtained in Irish public life, and Ireland now joins the rest of the western world in its inexorable march toward liberty for license, bereft of religious imperatives like Thou Shall Not Commit Murder. The referendum result is not surprising. If the same vote were held here in America, where polls for many years have indicated we’re split about 60-40, with the majority holding that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, we’d probably get the same result. What is surprising, at least on the surface, is the means: that legalized abortion was introduced to the country by referendum. Abortion came to be legal in the United States and the United Kingdom by an edict from the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and an act of parliament in 1967, respectively. In Ireland, the people themselves decided that mothers have the right to kill their unborn children.  Legalizing Abortion Transforms The Moral Life Of A Nation Once the shock wears off, however, even this should not be so surprising. The entire western world has concluded, against the claims of Christianity and in accord with the pagans of ancient Rome, that the unborn have no rights. Far more surprising is that Ireland’s Eighth Amendment was only passed in 1983, when the rest of the world was legalizing abortion, and that it only took one generation to throw it out. It’s a testament to the inexorable logic of the liberal order, which has played out along these lines in even the most Catholic countries. Consider France, where abortion went from a crime punishable by death to a medical benefit paid for by the state in less than 20 years. To boost the birthrate and replenish population losses from World War I, France criminalized abortion in 1920. During the German occupation, the Vichy regime made abortion a capital crime. The last person to be executed by the French state for performing abortions was a 39-year-old woman named Marie Louise-Giraud, who was beheaded by guillotine in the courtyard of a Paris prison on July 30, 1943. How monstrous that seems today, whatever one’s views on abortion. Yet Louise-Giraud performed 27 abortions. Should she have faced any consequences? Kevin Williamson was infamously fired from The Atlantic for pointing out, in an admittedly trollish way, the unwillingness of abortion advocates to talk about the reality of abortion. As he wrote in an essay for the Wall Street Journal after his firing, “If it isn’t homicide, then it’s no more morally significant than getting a tooth pulled. If it isn’t homicide, then there’s no real argument for prohibiting it. If it is homicide, then we need to discuss more seriously what should be done to put an end to it.”  France, like America and the rest of Europe, was unwilling to have that discussion. In 1975, French lawmakers legalized abortion. By 1982, the French social security system sponsored the cost of providing abortions. By 2001, a minor could get an abortion without parental consent. In 2015, a mandatory seven-day waiting period for abortion was abolished, and it became available on demand. Nothing Can Keep a Secular Liberalism From Brutalizing The Weak Why shouldn’t Ireland join these ranks? There is nothing inherent to a wholly secular liberal order that can prevent the transformation of individual liberty into a license to kill the unborn. If they are an inconvenience, they can be killed. Like the rest of the moral order, the Sixth Commandment is no impediment to the claims of unfettered individualism. The reality that so many of us do not wish to confront, and that the Irish referendum thrusts upon us, is that liberalism divorced from Christianity means nothing less than the reintroduction of the pagan brutality of Rome and Tenochtitlan, where life was cheap and the lives of the weakest were the cheapest. Indeed, the plain truth is that the Catholic Church civilized the Irish, drawing them out of their paganism and into the light of faith. Now, 15 centuries on, the Irish are abandoning the church in droves. In the space of a few decades, the Catholic Church in Ireland has imploded. Its teachings and rites are now as mysterious to the modern Irish as the lost pagan rituals were to Irish Catholics a generation ago. It is not all that remarkable that such a people would embrace the killing of the unborn under the banner of human rights. It is remarkable that they did not do it sooner.

"390",390,"Planned Parenthood’s Big Bad Business Model","Krumholz","Willis","L.",NA,NA,NA,"2015-10-27"," Mollie Hemingway recently reported on the horrifying reviews Planned Parenthood clinics have received on Yelp. The reviews detailed long wait times, dirty exam rooms, and rude or unhelpful Planned Parenthood staffers. One reviewer said the clinic she visited was “all sorts of nasty.” Another said Planned Parenthood had given her the wrong prescription. Another reviewer went in for an IUD, received five price quotes ranging from $200 to $785, and wasn’t told her appointment was only an “initial consultation” until she was hit with a hidden fee of $85.  It gets worse. The Federalist recently published a young woman’s account of her experiences with Planned Parenthood. During one particular visit, Planned Parenthood employees bullied the young woman for not indicating she would consider abortion while she was waiting for the results of a pregnancy test, to the point where she left in tears. There’s a reason Planned Parenthood isn’t very good at women’s health care, as these reviews attest: Planned Parenthood’s bad business model. Because Planned Parenthood is a rational economic actor, its clinics will push abortion over other women’s health care—explicitly in the event of a pregnancy, and implicitly by not providing adequate contraceptive care and instruction. Affiliates get the highest profits from abortion, so they have an incentive to oversell this service. Why? First, Planned Parenthood is a business franchise, just like McDonalds, and its franchisees—local clinics, usually referred to as “affiliates”—are cost-sensitive. Affiliates get the highest profits from abortion, so they have an incentive to oversell this service. Second, because many Planned Parenthood customers have nowhere else to turn, Planned Parenthood can get away with providing shoddy contraceptive care. Here, there are two incentives at play: Planned Parenthood faces a low profit margin when selling contraceptives; and providing subpar contraceptive care and instruction indirectly pushes abortion on some customers.  All this speaks to the need for lawmakers to redirect the almost $100 million in yearly Title X funding that Planned Parenthood receives to clinics that don’t have the same conflict of interest. Look at the Affiliates Planned Parenthood, the media, and the Democratic Party claim that Planned Parenthood isn’t all about abortion—abortion is just a necessary sideshow to Planned Parenthood’s many good deeds. If Republicans cut off Planned Parenthood’s Title X funding, poor women will suffer. This is a lie. Planned Parenthood affiliates are addicted to abortion. Planned Parenthood affiliates are addicted to abortion. First, Planned Parenthood’s structure requires local franchisee affiliates to be financially independent and self-sustaining apart from the national organization, despite the national organization being flush with cash. This causes local affiliates to be highly cost sensitive, even to the point where several have been caught fraudulently billing Medicaid and overcharging poor women for birth control. Next, when Planned Parenthood reports its revenues in picture form (see chart below), it throws revenues to both the national organization and its affiliates into one big bucket. So this chart compares apples with oranges.   Because of Planned Parenthood’s franchise model, if we want to determine the incentives for the actual clinics, we need to examine affiliate-specific revenues (see below).  If revenue per abortion is estimated to be around $500 (a conservative estimate), then $164 million, or 15 percent of clinic-level revenue, comes from abortion. This not only factors in “Non-Government Health Services Revenue,” but also includes “Government Reimbursements” that go toward abortion (more than half of the states cover abortion through their Medicaid programs). Pro-choice advocates love to point out that abortion is only 15 percent of Planned Parenthood affiliate revenues. The analysis does not end there. First of all, including “Private Contributions” in total clinic revenues to determine the incentives clinics face is arguable. Many donations come with strings attached, and cannot be counted on year-to-year. That reduces a donation’s impact on a clinic’s day-to-day operational incentives. Cut out “Private Contributions,” and revenue from abortion rises to around 20 percent of Planned Parenthood’s income. The revenue category that brings the highest margins consists of the fees Planned Parenthood charges its customers. More importantly, the revenue provided by “Government Reimbursements” unrelated to abortion, which makes up almost half of total clinic revenue, carries incredibly low margins. This is because Title X is a grant-based program that only covers the costs of providing birth control to low-income women, and also because Medicaid compensates providers at under-market rates. The revenue category that brings the highest margins consists of the fees Planned Parenthood charges its customers, or “Non-Government Health Services Revenue.” Customers usually pay these fees out of pocket. About half of all “Non-Government Health Services Revenue” comes from abortion. Abortion Makes the Most Money for Planned Parenthood Comparing the $164 million generated from abortion to revenues from the other services Planned Parenthood provides, it becomes clear that revenue from abortion provides the highest profit margins, and is the biggest contributor to affiliates’ total profit (what Planned Parenthood refers to as “revenues after expenses”). There are five reasons why. Abortion is a cash business, usually paid for out-of-pocket to the tune of at least $500. Out-of-pocket payments generally carry high margins for health providers.
Consumers of abortion are less cost-sensitive than are consumers of the other services Planned Parenthood provides. The decision to have an abortion is often an act of desperation, and others aside from the direct consumer, such as the father, may be willing to contribute to the cost of the procedure.
Planned Parenthood has a quasi-monopoly in the abortion market, and practices economies of scale:
Before state-regulation of abortion was widely allowed—before Planned Parenthood v. Casey—Planned Parenthood’s abortion market-share was under 10 percent. After the Casey decision, which increased competitors’ barriers to entry, Planned Parenthood’s abortion market-share climbed dramatically, as did the dollars flowing to its bottom line. Planned Parenthood’s hold over the abortion market now sits at 40 percent of all reported abortions in the United States.
The regulatory burden Casey brought also granted greater rewards for economies of scale, and Planned Parenthood seized on the opportunity: A single mega-clinic, capable of performing one abortion every five minutes, does most abortions for an affiliate.

Abortion services are most comparable to the services of ambulatory (outpatient) surgery centers. The margins available to these centers in a competitive environment run anywhere from 25 to 35 percent. Because patients are discharged quickly, any outpatient procedure or surgery performed is “incredibly profitable.” Further, surgical procedure margins are usually the greatest indicator of overall margins for a healthcare organization.
Even ignoring its lack of competition, Planned Parenthood’s “operating” abortion margin (which includes abortion’s share of an affiliate’s overall costs) is likely much higher than that of the average outpatient surgery center or other competing abortion providers, because Planned Parenthood has so many low-margin services funded by government, which helps eat up overhead and operational costs. Because of these factors, it is far-fetched to suggest that Planned Parenthood affiliates don’t generate a sizeable portion of their profits—totaling $91 million as of the last reported fiscal year ending in 2014—from providing abortion. Abortion Is Big Business for Planned Parenthood Clinics If abortion carries an operating profit margin of 40 percent (meaning a $500 abortion costs Planned Parenthood $300, including overhead and operating expenses, leaving $200 in “revenues after expenses”), abortion contributes to 72 percent, or $66 million, of affiliates’ $91 million in profit. Between $33 million and $66 million of Planned Parenthood affiliates’ $164 million in abortion sales directly contributes to affiliates’ $91 million in profit. If abortion carries a profit margin of 30 percent, abortion contributes to 54 percent of clinic profit. If the profit margin for abortion is 20 percent, the procedure contributes to 36 percent of clinic profits. Even if the abortion margin is only 10 percent, it contributes to almost 20 percent of clinics’ bottom line. Given the capacity of Planned Parenthood’s non-abortion low margin, high volume services to eat up much of the costs associated with clinic overhead, the barriers to entry in the abortion industry, profit margins for outpatient procedures, and Planned Parenthood’s use of economies of scale when providing abortions, I estimate affiliates’ abortion margin (including indirect costs of overhead and operating expenses) to be between 20 and 40 percent. (The exact margin will of course vary from affiliate to affiliate.) This means that between $33 million and $66 million of Planned Parenthood affiliates’ $164 million in abortion sales directly contributes to affiliates’ $91 million in profit. In other words, Planned Parenthood is like Hewlett Packard. HP sells a lot of printers, and we all think of “printers” when we think of HP, but HP makes almost nothing on its printer sales, and even sells printers at a loss. Although we don’t associate HP with “printer ink,” HP’s printer division makes most of its money selling ink. HP only sells you a printer so you will later buy the ink. Planned Parenthood makes little, or even loses money, from the services it bills to government, including when it sells birth control. Planned Parenthood clinics within an affiliate that don’t provide abortion are probably lucky to break even. But Planned Parenthood clinics that don’t provide abortion are brand ambassadors and referral centers to the affiliate’s mega-clinic that does provide abortion, which generates most of the affiliate’s profits.  Why Planned Parenthood’s Birth Control Services Can Be Awful Because Planned Parenthood makes minimal profits selling birth control to customers who depend on Title X or Medicaid, the organization doesn’t have a big incentive to provide the best contraceptive care possible to these customers. Of course, if women don’t receive proper contraceptive care, they come back to Planned Parenthood for its high-margin product: abortion. This leads Planned Parenthood to treat patients callously and carelessly—prescribing the wrong type of birth control for some women and wrongfully charging Medicaid-eligible women, which makes poor women less able to afford birth control. Planned Parenthood customers don’t have a lot of choice. In a more competitive market, if consumers preferred other options to abortion—such as effective birth control—the effects of these incentives would be muted. Planned Parenthood customers don’t have a lot of choice, however. Why not? First of all, because Planned Parenthood’s customers are largely poor. Seventy-nine percent of Planned Parenthood patients have incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. According to Planned Parenthood, the “vast majority” of the organization’s female patients lack private health insurance, meaning they are uninsured or rely on Medicaid. For such women, Planned Parenthood is usually the only place they can receive care oriented towards family planning or female health, unless a community-funded clinic is available. Furthermore, because Title X funnels so much federal money into Planned Parenthood rather than community health clinics, the community-funded clinic is understaffed, or Planned Parenthood is the only option altogether. Here’s a screenshot of the list of the top Title X recipients in my area:  The result of Planned Parenthood’s government-created monopoly is terrible outcomes, in the form of high unintended pregnancy and abortion rates for its customers. This happens for much of the same reason that inner-city public schools have bad results: Planned Parenthood doesn’t have to compete. Federal funding tilts the field in its favor. Send All Title X Funds to Community Health Clinics It’s no secret that Planned Parenthood enjoys a government-funded competitive advantage over clinics that could provide women with better-quality reproductive care. In fact, Planned Parenthood officials constantly brag about how many of their customers have nowhere else to turn. Planned Parenthood officials constantly brag about how many of their customers have nowhere else to turn. If anything, this speaks to the need for lawmakers to send Title X family planning funding to organizations that don’t have an incentive to push abortion. When Democrats say community-funded clinics don’t have the capacity to see an influx of patients who used to go to Planned Parenthood, they forget that community-funded clinics would have this capacity if they received more money. The solution then lies in Congress redirecting the nearly $100 million in yearly Title X funds that Planned Parenthood now receives to community-funded clinics that don’t sell abortion. Democrats will cry foul, and label this another example of the “war on women.” False. Planned Parenthood’s business model harms the very women it claims to serve. All this was seen on a wider scale in 1990s Romania, where the lack of choice coupled with medical providers receiving high payouts for abortion resulted in miserable outcomes for women: high unintended pregnancy rates, which led to high rates of abortion (Romania had 2.2 abortions for every live birth). In America, poor and minority women uniquely experience what happened in Romania. When Planned Parenthood pushed abortion, the young woman we heard about earlier was privileged enough to go somewhere else. Many poor American women have no other choice. Planned Parenthood’s business model harms the very women it claims to serve. Who knows? Maybe with different House leadership, the Republican-controlled Congress will see through the flim-flam and put Title X dollars where they will be the most useful to women. In the meantime, we can back up stories of Planned Parenthood’s malpractice with concrete evidence that may spur Congress to act. Survey the outcomes of women using community-funded clinics versus Planned Parenthood: (1) Measure the rate (percent) of abortions had by pregnant women entering a community funded clinic compared to a Planned Parenthood; (2) Measure the rate of unplanned pregnancies experienced by women who receive contraceptive care at a community funded clinic compared to Planned Parenthood. My prediction: the data will show that a government-funded monopoly is not in the interests of American women. American women deserve better than Planned Parenthood.","https://thefederalist.com/2015/10/27/planned-parenthoods-big-bad-business-model/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"391",391,"7 Lies Planned Parenthood’s New President Pushed On ‘The View’","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-09-17"," Planned Parenthood’s new president, Dr. Leana Wen, cut her teeth in major media appearances with a segment on “The View” Thursday. The abortion giant seems to be trying to remake its image and establish more credibility as a “medical provider” by choosing a medical doctor to head their organization. She is articulate, young, attractive, a new mother, and, at least on paper, she has some serious credentials as both an ER doctor and health commissioner of Baltimore. She’s also a minority who grew up in a working-class home; her parents immigrated to the United States from China.  On the surface, it seems Planned Parenthood couldn’t have picked a better face for their organization. Unfortunately, her appointment doesn’t seem to mark a change in how Planned Parenthood does business, as Wen is parroting the same discredited propaganda the organization has been disseminating for years. Although two hosts pressed moderately about federal funding for abortion, most of the interview was soft-balled and Wen had ample opportunity to spread further disinformation on behalf of Planned Parenthood, which is still in disaster-control mode after years of federal and state investigations into its fetal body parts business. Here is a fact-check of the major claims Wen made in her appearance on “The View.” 1. Planned Parenthood ‘has done more for women’s health than any other.’ Apparently the destruction of 3,401,891 preborn baby girls since 1978 is a stellar record for women’s health. Beyond the obvious fact that preborn genocide totally negates anything Planned Parenthood does, what is so special about Planned Parenthood that its services are critical to American women? If you want oral birth control, you can get it at any health clinic. If you need sexually transmitted disease testing, cancer screenings, or prenatal care, you can get it at the doctor’s office. If you simply need “education,” which Planned Parenthood loves to tout as a major accomplishment, you can go to any of the 2,752 pregnancy centers in the United States.  CareNet affiliate pregnancy centers alone, many of which provide ultrasounds and STI testing (1,100), outnumber Planned Parenthood affiliate health centers by almost 2 to 1 (650). Clearly Planned Parenthood is neither replaceable nor crucial for women’s health. 2. One in 5 American women go to Planned Parenthood for ‘basic medical services.’ “Just like 1 in 5 women in America, Planned Parenthood was where we went for basic medical services like cancer screening and family planning.” This statistic has been bandied about to refer to women who “rely” on Planned Parenthood or to refer to women who visit Planned Parenthood at some point in their lives. Wen seems to be doing the former. Planned Parenthood picked up this number from a 2013 online poll of 1,000 respondents conducted by YouGov in association with the Huffington Post, in which 20 percent of respondents said they had “ever personally visited a Planned Parenthood clinic for health services.”  It is still incredibly disingenuous to assert that 1 in 5 American women go to Planned Parenthood for “basic medical services.” For instance, 82.1 percent of women aged 18 and over visited “a doctor or other healthcare professional” at least once in the past 12 months. Out of the approximate total of this demographic in 2016, (67,765,930 is half the total population adjusted for the male-female ratio), an estimated 2,470,000 clients (we’ll assume they are all women) visited a Planned Parenthood clinic, or 3.6 percent just of total adult women who visited a health-care professional. That number is probably a bit lower if you exclude male and minor clients. If we want to be even more accurate, as of 2017, there were approximately 135,671,118 women above the age of 15 living in the United States, according to CIA data. Even if you consider all of Planned Parenthood’s estimated health clinic clients (still 2,470,000 in 2017), that’s less than 2 percent of all American adult women. Thus, it appears probable that Wen’s estimate of women who “go to Planned Parenthood for basic medical services” is off by a factor of ten. 3. If Confirmed to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh will overturn Roe V. Wade. “I’m a doctor and a scientist and I have to go by the data. And one data point is that President Trump has a litmus test, that he will only appoint Supreme Court justices that will overturn Roe vs. Wade… And I also have another data point on what Judge Kavanaugh has done before in his rulings and there’s nothing in his confirmation hearings that would reassure me otherwise…” One first has to consider the most recent Trump position on choosing Supreme Court justices, which is that he would not ask them about the landmark 1973 case. However, when Trump was asked about overturning Roe back in 2016, he said, “If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that will happen. And that will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.” Given the number of times Trump has flipped positions on a variety of subjects, it’s difficult to tell what his “authentic” position is. He’s essentially been winging it, as far as public statements, through his campaign and up to this point in his presidency. Nevertheless, Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings that Roe “is an important precedent to the Supreme Court. It’s been reaffirmed many times. It was reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 when the court specifically considered whether to reaffirm it or whether to overturn it. …That makes Casey precedent on precedent.” This was a walk-back of a statement he’d made in a 2003 letter saying that he was “not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since the Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.” Kavanaugh has only ruled directly on one abortion case: the illegal immigrant minor who sought an abortion in the United States last year. According to his own testimony during his confirmation hearings, he explained how his decision was made on precedent regarding parental consent, citing Casey as one of those precedents, and specifically said the government “cannot use [the administrative stay] as a ruse to prevent the pregnancy.” To say this one ruling, or even Kavanaugh’s Priests for Life ruling, in which he said that facilitating access to abortifacients and birth control was a substantial burden on Priests for Life’s religious exercise, means it is certain that Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe stretches the evidence pretty thin. 4. Women’s lives are ‘at stake’ in overturning Roe. “We have to take [Trump] at his word about overturning Roe vs. Wade and the stakes are just so high, I mean we’re talking about women’s lives that are at stake” (emphasis added). This is a bald-faced lie. Wen is clearly playing off her audience’s ignorance about the nature of the Roe v. Wade decision, making it seem as if pregnant women will all of a sudden start dying if the precedent is overturned. Roe V. Wade enshrined the right to an abortion in the United States as constitutionally protected. However, before 1973, abortion was already legal in some states. Overturning Roe V. Wade and Planned Parenthood vs. Casey would only return abortion to state control, where each state can each decide how to regulate abortion. It would not make abortion illegal across the country. In fact, only four states have “trigger laws” that would outlaw abortion should the precedent be overturned. Wen went for an emotional appeal. “I see every day what’s at stake,” she said, sharing how she had once treated a woman whose cousin had attempted an abortion on her and who ended up dying in the ER because “she didn’t have access to health care.” First of all, abortion isn’t care. Abortion is murder. Further, almost no abortions are done to save the life of the mother, and exceptions based on the mother’s health are standard in pro-life legislation. The second simplest fact people need to keep in mind is: abortion doesn’t pose any danger to you whatsoever if you don’t try one. Yes, some women are pressured, even coerced, into abortions. The people who would do that must be brought to justice, and women can seek help from law enforcement and pregnancy centers. Pressure from family or a partner is not an excuse to kill your child. And even if Roe were overturned, pressured women would still overwhelmingly have access to at least first-trimester abortions. The bottom line: No, women’s lives are not at stake with overturning Roe v. Wade. 5. Abortion is only a tiny part of what Planned Parenthood does. When co-host Sunny Hostin challenged the transparency of Planned Parenthood’s frequent claim that abortion only constitutes 3 percent of their services, saying the Washington Post found it to be “more like 12 percent,” Wen said, “I disagree. Just like any every major health-care organization that I’ve ever worked for, Planned Parenthood follows the law and makes clear what are the services we offer, what are the procedures that we perform…over 90 percent of the services that we perform are preventive care services.” In the 2016-2017 fiscal year, Planned Parenthood performed 321,384 abortion procedures. This is fewer than pregnancy tests (1,071,642), breast exams (336,614), reversible contraception (1,854,518), emergency contraception (730,329), and STI testing and treatment (4,434,039), and indeed, it is about 3.3 percent of total services rendered, according to their 2016 report. If you only tally up preventative services (e.g., excluding line items such as adoption referrals, emergency contraception, and treatments for urinary tract infections), the percentage of preventative care services out of the total services is about 76.5 percent, not 90 percent. In any case, dividing total services by abortion procedures is a misleading way to characterize the role abortion plays in Planned Parenthood’s business model. That was the issue Hostin wanted addressed, and Wen dodged it. By my rough estimate, abortions account for two-thirds (66.3 percent) of Planned Parenthood’s revenue from services rendered. A better, more transparent way to assess this is what percentage of Planned Parenthood’s revenue comes from abortion. Any business owner would tell you the same. If a company makes 2 cents off red widgets and 80 percent of their sales are red widgets, but makes 20 cents off blue widgets though they’re only 20 percent of sales, clearly the 40 percent of revenue coming from blue widgets is a very important part of their business. The cost of a chemical abortion (i.e., the abortion pill) ranges from $300 to $800, according to the American Pregnancy Association.  A second-trimester abortion could be over $2,000. According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control, 91.5 percent of abortions are performed in the first trimester, 7.2 percent are induced in the second trimester, and 1.3 percent are in the third trimester. So if we take a middle estimate, like $550, for the cost of first-trimester abortions, assuming Planned Parenthood abortions follow the overall distribution among first, second, and third trimesters, we get $161,736,498 of revenue. If we take $1,500 as a reasonable estimate for second-trimester abortions (we’ll lump in third trimester since the percentage is so small), we get another $40,976,460 of revenue. In total, that’s an estimated $202,972,958 Planned Parenthood made off abortions in 2016 alone. Planned Parenthood makes an estimated $203 million off abortion. Now, apply that to their revenue statement. Total Planned Parenthood revenue from services was $861.8 million in the 2016-2017 fiscal year (sum of line items 1 and 2 on page 34 of the report; i.e. excluding donor revenue but including any government grants they receive, since they don’t provide a separate figure for that). This means that, by my rough estimate, abortions account for one-quarter (23.5 percent) of Planned Parenthood’s revenue from services rendered. If you include “other operating revenue” ($65.1 million) in the total, abortions still bring in 22 percent of total non-donor revenue. Considering Planned Parenthood performs roughly a third of all abortions in America, this is a much more reasonable number to share with the public than “3 percent of total services,” or even less than 10 percent of services, as Wen suggested, to characterize the role abortion plays in the organization’s business model. 6. No federal dollars paying for abortions. “I want to clarify…There are no federal taxpayer dollars that go towards abortions…Planned Parenthood doesn’t get a check from the federal government. It’s not as if they get a check written every year about federal funding. Planned Parenthood, just like every hospital, gets reimbursed for medical services like breast cancer screenings, like cervical cancer screenings, like birth control.” This claim is technically true, but practically false. Currently, 17 states fund abortion through Medicaid, which is funded partially by states and partially by the federal government. At least one of those states, California, does not even require abortions to be “medically necessary” to qualify for tax-provided Medi-Cal funding. The fact that Planned Parenthood receives federal funding in one area means, of course, that they have more state funds available for other areas, including abortions. Oregon recently adopted a law that effectively pays for universal abortion for Oregon residents. This, too, is made possible by federal dollars. As I wrote last year, The Hyde Amendment currently prohibits the Federal government from funding abortions, but Oregon still receives federal dollars for its numerous programs. The Health Authority received $11.5 billion from the federal government for the 2015-2016 Biennium, drawing only $2.1 billion from the General Fund and $6 billion from “Other Funds,” as well as $11 million from the Lottery Fund.
The General Fund’s contribution to the Health Authority will effectively quintuple through this act, but funding is just a game of allocation. Because the state receives federal dollars for its other programs to the tune of $21.58 billion, it can allocate more of the state’s general tax money toward programs like this one. Indeed, it may even be able to receive federal money for the parts of this bill that don’t directly pertain to abortion.
The bottom line is that so long as Oregon receives federal funding, citizens across the country are forced into indirectly helping facilitate the ending of human lives—for whatever reason the mother may give. Moreover, federal reimbursement rate for “family planning services” is 90 percent. While those do not include abortions because of the Hyde amendment, it certainly provides a lot of money to Planned Parenthood. In 2016-2017, government funding (state and federal) constituted 37 percent of their total revenue. 7. Health care shouldn’t be political. “Health care shouldn’t be political. Needing medications for your children should be political.” The government has been deeply involved in health care for many decades (especially since the establishment of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965), and the Supreme Court has made numerous rulings about health care, particularly the intersection of religious freedom and “reproductive care.” Health care is political. Abortion especially is highly political, because of the government’s efforts to enshrine it and because it is a highly controversial ethical decision that virtually everyone agrees needs to be regulated in some way, from only allowing licensed practitioners to perform them, to parental consent, to outlawing it altogether. There’s no cramming those worms back into the can. ‘Abortion is health care’ is a lie that Planned Parenthood has been hawking for decades in the public square. While this line is emotionally appealing, “abortion is health care” is a lie that Planned Parenthood has been hawking for decades in the public square. When abortion is wrapped up in this category, you can simply assert your position that health care “shouldn’t be political,” and any opponent will have a hard time arguing with that question. Case in point: Abby Huntsman’s response to this statement was, “I agree with that,” perhaps not realizing that Wen had subverted the entire pro-life argument she’d presented—that federal money shouldn’t go to organizations that provide abortions—by defining abortion as health care. Wen is pushing the same propaganda that her Planned Parenthood predecessor Cecile Richards did, doubling down on the “abortion is health care” meme. As a doctor and a mother, who claims to reach conclusions off “the data,” she should be held to the highest standard. Indeed, as a smart, accomplished, articulate doctor, pesky questions like “When does human life begin?” and whether women should be informed of the developmental milestones of their fetuses before consenting to an abortion should be easy for her to answer. Hopefully future interviewers will have the courage to ask such questions. Until then, the least Wen can do is stop misleading the public. Correction: This article has been corrected for a decimal error regarding this figure — $40,976,460 — and thus also the related sums and percentages in the sentences following.

"392",392,"Here’s How To Take Down Planned Parenthood Now That Trump Landed A Punch","Krumholz","Willis","L.",NA,NA,NA,"2018-05-21"," President Trump’s administration is bringing back a Reagan-era rule that would pull federal birth control funds from clinics that sell abortion. Planned Parenthood, which is by far the nation’s largest and wealthiest abortion provider, has the most to lose. It is the largest single recipient of Title X funds, to the tune of about $80 million per year. The new regulation is a good start. It is a bigger blow to Planned Parenthood than anything the establishment Republicans have ever done. But more action is needed to take PP down.  How Trump’s New Rule Works In 1970, Congress created Title X as a grant program to provide birth control and sexually transmitted disease treatment to low-income women. The program has always been banned from funding abortion. But in the 1970s and ‘80s, the law was interpreted to allow the entity giving birth control to be the same entity selling abortion or referring patients for abortions. In 1988, President Reagan issued a regulation that said no Title X funds could go to a birth control provider that was “co-located” with an abortion clinic or that referred patients for abortion. The regulation was challenged and went all the way to the Supreme Court, where it was found to be legal in the case Rust v. Sullivan. When Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he reversed Reagan’s regulation, and George W. Bush’s administration never brought it back. President Trump’s regulation brings back the co-location prohibition, but it does not bring back Reagan’s ban on abortion referrals (although it does remove the radical and illegal requirement that a recipient of Title X funds must make abortion referrals, which precluded many pro-life clinics from receiving Title X funds). The New Rule Doesn’t Hurt Planned Parenthood Much The reinstated regulation won’t heavily affect Planned Parenthood because most Planned Parenthood locations don’t provide surgical abortions. Yes, many provide abortion pills, and all clinics refer for abortions, but because the new regulation doesn’t disallow abortion referrals, most Planned Parenthood clinics receiving Title X should be fine.  Because of this, more action is needed. First, the Trump administration should disallow Title X funds from any provider that makes any abortion referrals. This would totally cut Planned Parenthood off from Title X funding. If there are far too significant legal and political hurdles to such an action, the regulation needs to be enforced so that both surgical and chemical (pill-induced) abortions are included in the co-location prohibition. That would dent many more Planned Parenthood facilities, although the organization would probably find a work-around, albeit at a higher cost. To understand why the co-location rule doesn’t go far enough, let’s overview Planned Parenthood’s business model. How Planned Parenthood Makes Money Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit organization, but any business-savvy person would tell you nonprofits that sell things still care about “profit.” Instead of going to the shareholders, or an owner, greater profitability at Planned Parenthood goes to higher salaries for its employees, bigger benefits, or nicer amenities.  Planned Parenthood operates a franchise model. The national organization is flush with cash, but the franchisees—the “affiliates”—must be financially self-sustainable. That makes affiliates highly cost sensitive, and by far the affiliates’ most profitable service is abortion. Only a few affiliate locations offer abortions. These are usually the affiliate’s largest location and located in highly populated areas. They are designed to leverage economies of scale to make the procedure as quick and profitable as possible. Former Planned Parenthood facility director Abby Johnson says the “goal at Planned Parenthood was to get a woman on the table and off the table in 5 minutes.” Affiliates’ locations that don’t do surgical abortion make abortion referrals to the central hub. National Planned Parenthood often touts how low its abortion sales are as a percent of its total sales. But at the affiliate level, 15 percent of sales come from abortion services. The rest comes from Title X grants, Medicaid reimbursement for mostly birth control, and out-of-pocket payment for mostly birth control. Fifteen percent of sales coming from abortion seems small, but Planned Parenthood affiliates barely break even after providing birth control and other services that taxpayers send them through Title X and Medicaid. Medicaid is notorious for its low reimbursement rates. Title X, meanwhile, is a grant-based program, so it helps cover Planned Parenthood’s fixed costs of doing business (the building, maintenance, etc.) and the costs of handing out some birth control. Abortion, on the other hand, is incredibly profitable. Women usually pay about $500 for abortion with cash. Assuming the margin for abortion is between 20 and 40 percent, the percent of affiliates’ revenue after expenses that comes from abortion is between 35 and 75 percent of an affiliate’s overall “profit.” About Planned Parenthood’s Customer Base A hugely disproportionate number of Planned Parenthood facilities, especially those that provide surgical abortion, are located in poor and densely populated neighborhoods that are disproportionately black compared to the national population. After the landmark 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, states were allowed to regulate abortion for the first time after Roe v. Wade, which had said abortion was such a fundamental right that states couldn’t even enforce basic safety codes. Planned Parenthood brags about how the women it counts as customers have little choice aside from Planned Parenthood. Before Casey, the American abortion market was fragmented. Clinics were incredibly dirty, even unsafe. After Casey, states began implementing basic safety regulations. This pushed out the low-end providers, and provided Planned Parenthood an entry barrier against competition. Because of this, the organization saw its abortion market-share grow significantly after the 1992 decision. Because the business of providing birth control to low-income women is so unprofitable, and because Medicaid usually shortchanges normal medical providers to the point that many poor women in urban areas cannot access an OB-GYN or general practitioner because the provider won’t accept Medicaid, much of Planned Parenthood’s customer base is captive. Just ask Planned Parenthood, which brags about how the women it counts as customers have little choice aside from Planned Parenthood. The rest is down to incentives. If providing birth control to this captive customer base does very little for the bottom line, but providing abortion is a boon to the bottom line, the incentive is clear: Focus less on providing birth control, and more on abortion. Planned Parenthood facilities even have “abortion targets” for employees to meet, just like a car dealer has targets for cars sold but probably not cars serviced (selling cars makes the dealer more money; it is what the car dealer is there to do). The end result is a much higher abortion rate for America’s disproportionately black urban poor than for the country as a whole. The same was seen in 1990s Romania, where government medical providers receiving high payouts for abortion and no incentive to provide birth control resulted in miserable outcomes for women: abnormally high unintended pregnancy rates, which led to high rates of abortion (Romania at the time had 2.2 abortions for every live birth). In other words, the ultra-high rate of unintended births and abortions among poor black American women can be substantially explained by this population’s disproportionate reliance on Medicaid, which uniquely inhibits accessing a normal OB-GYN or non-emergency medical provider. How to Destroy Planned Parenthood Many states fund abortion in their Medicaid budgets. Medicaid is a federal program that subsidizes health care for people who earn less money than other Americans, but it is administered by the states, and states can cover services the federal government doesn’t. My home state of Minnesota, for example, pays for abortions in our Medicaid program. Look up whether your home state covers abortion and contact your legislature if it does. Many think government-provided birth control is the problem, but regardless the abortion rate among America’s poor—and Planned Parenthood’s sales—would go down if the money currently used for Title X went to a voucher program for OB-GYN care. In other words, just like vets would abandon the Veterans Administration if they had a choice card, low-income women would go to a normal OB-GYN if they didn’t have to go to Planned Parenthood. The abortion rate among America’s poor would go down if the money currently used for Title X went to a voucher program for OB-GYN care. Make the cost of abortion higher for Planned Parenthood. This approach, taken to its logical outcome, is counter-intuitive to many pro-lifers. The best example is Planned Parenthood’s lack of ultrasound use during abortions. Ultrasound allows the abortionist to “see” what he or she is doing, instead of just feeling around. Using an ultrasound is much safer. If the abortionist feels around too much, he or she risks puncturing the womb; too little and pieces of the baby are left inside the mother, which leads to a life-threating septic pregnancy (a medical provider I know encountered two post-abortive women suffering from sepsis in just one night in the emergency room). Planned Parenthood doesn’t like to use ultrasounds because this increases the time of doing abortions. Instead of one abortion every five minutes, maybe an ultrasound slows the procedure to 10 or 15 minutes. That increases cost, and lowers revenue unless Planned Parenthood increases prices commensurately (which a smart legislature could meet with price controls). So, at the state level, require that every abortion be done with an ultrasound. Arguing against such a measure would put the abortion lobby in an incredibly uncomfortable position, and such a law would almost certainly be upheld by the courts. This would also do more to dent Planned Parenthood than any 20-week abortion ban (such bans are wonderful, but most abortions occur at around six weeks of gestation). Finally, combat fatherlessness and family breakdown. There are huge penalties to marriage in our social-safety net. The program with the largest penalty is child-care assistance. It and others could be tweaked to stop penalizing two biological parents who live with their children. State policymakers should raise the income level for the program’s eligibility cutoff for poor married couples. In just the childcare assistance program, the penalty for marriage in Minnesota can be as high as $20,000 per year. Every state in the nation could follow suit and curb marriage penalties in welfare. This final point is by far the most important. Often, conservatives and pro-lifers think about the “supply-side” of the abortion equation. The demand side is just as important, and we need to try policy remedies. The government caused the problem of family breakdown, after all. The real end to abortion starts with sounder families, especially among America’s poor. Update: Contrary to pre-release reporting from which this article was written, the actual rule released includes a ban on Title X recipients making abortion referrals, but does not ban abortion counseling. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will significantly affect all Planned Parenthood locations, not just those that practice abortion.

"393",393,"7 Reasons It Is Deeply Misleading To Claim Americans Support Roe v. Wade","Camosy","Charles","C.",NA,NA,NA,"2018-07-06"," We’ve heard it a million times since Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. We’ll hear it a hundred million more between now and the end of confirmation hearings for whomever is designated to fill the vacant spot on the Supreme Court: “Americans support Roe v. Wade.” The poll numbers seem to bear this out, at least if one refuses to do any critical analysis of what the poll question and its answer actually reveals. The reason such a poll question is being cited, of course, is to put the new SCOTUS nominee—someone many believe may put Roe in serious danger of being overturned—in the context of a hostile public who wouldn’t approve of such a development.  But can answers to a poll question like “Do you support Roe v. Wade?” demonstrate that the public supports the abortion policy Roe requires? Not at all. Here are seven reasons it is deeply misleading to claim Americans support Roe v. Wade. 1. Many Americans Know Little About Roe A high percentage of Americans don’t know much about what Roe says or does. In a Pew Forum study done on the fortieth anniversary of Roe, we learned that 38 percent of Americans think Roe is a decision about something other than abortion. For those younger than 30 years old, this number rises to a shocking 56 percent. Furthermore, of those who know that Roe was about abortion, many don’t know even the most basic details of the case. Many wrongly believe, for instance, that overturning Roe would make abortion flatly illegal instead of merely returning the issue to a legislative process for states to decide. 2. Many Abortion Activists Don’t Like Roe Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, speaking at the University of Chicago, said Roe was a disappointment because it focused on privacy rather than on advancing women’s rights. Linda Greenhouse, an abortion-rights activist journalist who covered the Supreme Court for The New York Times, claims of Roe that “the seven middle-aged to elderly men in the majority certainly didn’t think they were making a statement about women’s rights.” Rather, she said, authentically female concerns were “nearly absent from the opinion.”  Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority in the Roe decision, was a former lawyer for the Mayo Clinic. Greenhouse says he wrote his decision with a focus on the concerns of male physicians. Peter Singer, perhaps the world’s most influential living philosopher, is well-known for being a pro-choice activist—not only for abortion, but also infanticide. But Singer has argued that abortion advancement would be better served in the United States if Roe were overturned and a legislative process unfolded along the lines of what has happened in most other developed countries. 3. Roe Is No Longer Roe. It Is Planned Parenthood v. Casey From a certain point of view, Roe has already been overturned. Even pro-choice legal scholars find it difficult to defend Roe as legal reasoning. Led by Kennedy and Sandra Day O’Connor (both Republican appointees), a pro-choice SCOTUS majority tried to save itself from Roe in 1992 by offering a substantially different defense of abortion rights. Caitlin W. Bormann argued in the William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law that Casey “established a new, less protective, constitutional standard for abortion restrictions.” It focused, not on defending privacy as Roe did, but on insisting abortion restrictions didn’t impose an “undue burden” on women.  This standard, Bormann says, “immediately enabled states to invade women’s privacy in new ways.” So a poll asking about Roe is actually asking the wrong question. A new SCOTUS justice might overturn the Kennedy-O’Connor compromise in Casey, but he or she wouldn’t be overturning Roe. 4. Americans Support Abortion Restrictions Roe Banned Most Americans support gestational abortion restrictions that Roe and Casey have made unconstitutional. In striking down an Indiana abortion law, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals articulated the legal standard after Roe/Casey. Indiana’s law, they said, violated “well-established Supreme Court precedent holding that a woman may terminate her pregnancy prior to viability [24 weeks], and that the State may not prohibit a woman from exercising that right for any reason.” But most Americans want abortion restricted well before viability. More than six in ten Americans, for instance, want abortion banned after 20 weeks. Last month Gallup asked Americans about their abortion views based on trimester, and found that only 28 percent wanted abortion to be legal during the second three months of pregnancy. Interestingly, this mirrors the policies of most European countries, which ban abortion after the early part of the second trimester. The views of the American people on when in pregnancy abortion should be illegal are dramatically out of step with what Roe and Casey require. 5. Coat-Hanger Abortion Stories Are Mostly Fables Horrific stories about blood in the streets from coat-hanger abortions are not borne out by the evidence. Sure as death and taxes, as soon as public discussion moves toward overturning Roe, a story about women dying from illegal abortions is not far behind. Many who claim to support Roe have this as a central and genuine concern, but, happily, the actual facts should make them feel more comfortable. By the late 1950s, social scientists and public health officials had determined that illegal abortions in the United States were not more dangerous than legal abortions. Improvements in medical technology, plus the fact that most illegal abortions were done by licensed physicians in a clinic (not in a back alley), were found to be the main reasons. Comparisons of a possible post-Roe/Casey United States to the results of banning abortion in a developing country with poor medical technology are either ignorant or disingenuous. Indeed, developed countries like Ireland and Chile, which have banned almost all abortions, have better health outcomes for women than do similar but abortion-permissive countries. Chile actually saw health outcomes for women improve when they dramatically restricted abortion. When women in the United States are denied abortions because of gestational age limits, the overwhelming majority don’t get illegal abortions or go elsewhere for abortions. Indeed, a recent study found that about 80 percent of them bring their pregnancies to term and only 5 percent end up regretting not having the abortion. In his book “Aborting America,” former NARAL founder Bernard Nathanson admitted that the early abortion rights movement simply fabricated the numbers of women dying from illegal abortion to further their political goals. Little has changed with the contemporary abortion rights movement. 6. Many Pro-Lifers Support Exceptions for Hard Cases Pro-lifers want abortion to be legal to save the mother’s life and in cases when the pregnancy is the result of sexual violence. We often hear of women being left to die from problematic pregnancies and victims of sexual violence being forced to carry their rapist’s child. Would this be the result of abortion policy going back to the states? It’s highly unlikely. Even if pro-lifers would be crafting public policy all by themselves (also highly unlikely), Gallup found than seven in ten want abortion legal to save the mother’s life and six in ten want abortion to be legal when the pregnancy is a result of rape. Even in states where abortion is likely to be “illegal” after an overturn of Roe/Casey, they will almost certainly have these important exceptions. People who know these exceptions are likely to be in place are far more likely to be more comfortable with much higher abortion restrictions. Interestingly, the same Gallup poll found that 52 percent of people who identify as pro-abortion want abortion to be illegal by the second trimester. 7. Americans Don’t Like Abortion of Disabled Children Americans are deeply uncomfortable with the kinds of abortions, currently protected by Roe and Casey, that target the disabled. About seven in ten prenatal children thought to have Down syndrome are killed via abortion, even though people with Down’s are happier than folks without it. Given these facts, it is no surprise that Americans hate abortion that targets people with Down syndrome. Indeed, while 84 percent of pro-lifers think aborting a child with Down’s is morally wrong, nearly half of people who identity as pro-choice feel the same way. Why wouldn’t they? In any other context, violently singling out disabled people would be a federal hate crime. Yet an Indiana law specifically designed to protect this vulnerable population from discrimination was struck down, as we saw above, precisely because Roe/Casey requires abortion to be unrestricted before viability. Once again, this puts Roe/Casey far afield from the views of the American people. If we want an honest accounting of what the American people think about U.S. abortion policy in the debate over the new SCOTUS nominee, the coming weeks and months should see media and others in public discourse doing much better than lazily citing a poll showing support for Roe v. Wade. They must instead dive into the facts about what Americans believe about abortion, and how they compare with what Roe/Casey has done to U.S. abortion policy. An honest accounting will find that the Supreme Court has given the United states one of the most extreme abortion policies in the world, and that the American people are ready to have policies that actually reflect what they believe about abortion.

"394",394,"It’s Time For Pro-Lifers To Scrap Their Losing Electoral Strategy And Adopt The Lincoln Method","Anderson","Jeffrey","H.",NA,NA,NA,"2023-11-13"," With Tuesday’s relatively easy passage of an Ohio constitutional amendment that effectively bars that state’s legislature from regulating abortion in the state, abortion advocates are now convinced that they not only have the public on their side but have found political gold. They now view abortion as such a winning issue that they think it can pave the way to enacting a wide range of other leftist goals. 



They are largely mistaken, as abortion mercifully remains a highly contentious issue in America. Still, abortion advocates will continue to prevail until pro-life leaders and politicians learn the political lessons that have arisen in the aftermath of their puzzling failure to prepare for a post-Roe world.



There are two main lessons to be learned from Ohio — and from other states where abortion advocates have scored recent victories. The first is that, as Abraham Lincoln understood, “public sentiment is everything” in a republic. One must win the argument before one can change the laws (or before one can keep them from changing in the wrong direction). And one cannot win the argument without being willing to make the argument.



The second is that a majority of Americans want limits on abortion, but they don’t want to eliminate it. They don’t want abortion on demand, but even less do they want an outright ban. After a half-century of legalized abortion imposed by activist judges, pro-lifers need to cultivate voters’ trust by emphasizing the need to limit rather than eliminate abortion, while emphasizing that pro-abortion advocates support abortion up until birth.



Lincoln’s own example is instructive. He regarded slavery as “a vast moral evil.” “Slavery is wrong,” he said, and “one cannot say that people have a right to do wrong” — yet he did not try to ban it in the South. He instead fought unflinchingly against its extension into the western territories and states. He fought the battle that could be won, not the one he was sure to lose.



Likewise, pro-lifers can’t win by trying to ban abortion outright or letting others suggest that this is their goal. Nor does it particularly serve pro-life interests to speak of banning abortion after a seemingly arbitrary number of weeks, severed from a rationale for that number. Not only does a 15-week abortion ban, the most popular new figure, concede too much — allowing abortions into the second trimester — but it also still requires a lot of political capital to try to enact. It is at once too much and too little. It may make sense in some places, but in general, it seems like a losing proposition. (Why the newfound fascination with weeks, anyway? Why not months, or days, or trimesters?)



Recognizing the importance of swaying public opinion, pro-lifers should instead seek to tie abortion bans to a developing child’s heartbeat or capacity for pain. They should push for requirements that mothers view ultrasounds before choosing whether to end their developing child’s life. They should defend crisis pregnancy centers against all sorts of attacks.



At the same time, as I’ve written before, pro-lifers should ask abortion supporters the uncomfortable question of where life begins. Is it at birth, as the Women’s Health Protection Act suggests? Is a developing child in the womb a human life? Is there any point before or perhaps even after birth when laws should prevent the killing of that life? These questions illuminate and mold public sentiment. 



Exit polling provides evidence that Americans are in the center on abortion, as they favor policies involving banning or allowing abortion in “most cases” over those involving doing so in “all cases.” Both on Tuesday in Ohio and during last year’s midterm elections nationally, exit polling found that a majority of Americans think abortion should either be “legal in most cases” or “illegal in most cases.” In Ohio exit polling, 58 percent said they held one of those two positions, while in midterm exit polling, 56 percent of voters said so. In comparison, only 40 percent of voters in Ohio and 39 percent in last year’s midterms held a more absolutist position, saying either that abortion should be “legal in all cases” or “illegal in all cases.”



In the 2022 midterms, exit polling found that voters who held more middle-ground positions on abortion were a bit more inclined to say abortion should be “legal in most cases” (30 percent) than “illegal in most cases” (26 percent) — yet they voted for Republicans over Democrats by 15 percentage points (35 percent to 20 percent). That’s because the “illegal in most cases” group seemed to hold its beliefs with more conviction — 90 percent of them went Republican, according to exit polling, while just 60 percent of those who thought abortion should be “legal in most cases” went Democrat. So Republicans won among those with more middle-ground positions on abortion.



In Ohio, exit polling showed that voters who held more middle-ground positions split evenly on the proposed constitutional amendment (29 percent to 29 percent), while it passed by 13 points overall. It passed because more than twice as many voters held the (de facto Democrat) position that abortion should always be legal (28 percent) than held the position that abortion should always be illegal (12 percent). So among the more absolutist voters, pro-lifers are strongly outnumbered. This was true not only in Ohio in 2023 but nationally in 2022, when exit polling showed that voters who thought abortion should be “legal in all cases” outnumbered those who thought it should be “illegal in all cases” by a margin of 29 to 10 percent.



Even though most Americans are somewhat in the middle on this profound moral question, pro-abortion politicians are fully embracing the issue and portraying themselves as defenders of a woman’s “right to choose.” In comparison, pro-life politicians have been far more reticent about portraying themselves as defenders of a developing child’s right to live. 



I reside in Virginia, where pro-abortion ads this election cycle were ubiquitous and pro-life ads were nonexistent. The impression surely left in many voters’ minds — because that’s what the ads said — is that pro-lifers want to ban all abortions. The fact that abortion advocates would generally allow all abortions — even partial-birth abortions — was left unsaid.



Americans’ general belief that there should be limits on abortion is at odds with the left’s view that abortion should be universally available. Pro-lifers are losing in spite of this, partly because they’re not making the case, and partly because Americans think pro-lifers want to ban all (or almost all) abortions. Americans are more concerned about abortion being eliminated, or nearly so, than they are about abortion advocates’ extreme embrace of abortion until birth (largely because voters don’t know about that).



As the refreshingly honest abortion advocate Camille Paglia puts it, “Abortion pits the stronger against the weaker, and only one survives.” Her words — highlighting the killing of the weak — starkly illustrate abortion’s cruel injustice. Perhaps because, on some level, she recognizes this injustice, Paglia says that while she favors “unrestricted access to abortion,” she nevertheless respects “the pro-life viewpoint” as the one that “has the moral high ground.”



In addition to holding that moral high ground, however, pro-lifers must learn to fight in the political trenches. Pro-lifers must work diligently to shift public opinion against abortion, but they neglect the current political reality at their — and abortion victims’ — peril. 



Pro-lifers should follow the example set by Lincoln on an earlier, similarly contentious, issue. While not being shy about characterizing abortion as a moral evil, they should make clear that they are not proposing to ban the all-too-common practice across the board — for it is too well-established — even as their opponents are working diligently to allow it in all circumstances and at all times.



While recent defeats have been dispiriting to the pro-life cause, those determined to protect innocent human life should take heed from Lincoln’s words in his 1860 Cooper Union Address: “Let us have faith that right makes might.” By making their case more forcefully on the merits, while also demonstrating more political prudence and savvy, pro-life leaders and politicians could succeed in fulfilling the promise of Lincoln’s words.

"395",395,"Human Life Review: Forty Years Of Fighting For Human Life And Dignity","Morabito","Stella",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-10-21"," “We won’t be like Nazi Germany. No one should be able to say, whatever happens, that they didn’t know what’s actually going on here.” When journalist James Patrick McFadden spoke those words, he was referring to the holocaust sparked by the Supreme Court’s Roe vs. Wade decision and its companion Doe vs. Bolton, which legalized abortion during all nine months of pregnancy. In the immediate wake of Roe, he founded The Human Life Foundation and The Human Life Review, a dynamic and multi-faceted quarterly. His mission was to confront and to document the assaults on human life and dignity wrought by Roe, including abortion, infanticide, cloning, euthanasia, and eugenics. After Jim McFadden died in 1998, his daughter, Maria McFadden Maffucci, stepped up as the Review’s editor. She continues to keep the torch burning at the HLR offices in midtown Manhattan. In a recent interview with Stella Morabito for The Federalist, Maffucci reflected on the evolution of the pro-life movement and the Human Life Review’s scope and critical role in that movement.  Stella: So much has happened over the past 40 years since Roe and the founding of the Human Life Review. If you could first give a quick tour of the life of the publication itself, what highlights would you point to? And what is it up to today? Maria: What comes to mind is that in 1983 President Ronald Reagan wrote an article for the Human Life Review called “Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation,” which about a year later was published in book form… Another interesting high point was when Walker Percy, the famous novelist, wrote a letter to the New York Times about abortion, and not only did the Times not publish it, but they didn’t even answer him. We published it. When my Dad founded the Review in 1975, the eminent British author Malcolm Muggeridge was really enthusiastic and he started contributing. Archbishop Fulton Sheen was one of our first subscribers. And William F. Buckley, with whom my father worked closely at National Review, was a very strong supporter of the Human Life Review at the outset. But I think the great thing about the Review is that from its earliest days we’ve been open to all sorts of articles from all sorts of different people. When Walker Percy, the famous novelist, wrote a letter to the New York Times about abortion, and not only did the Times not publish it, but they didn’t even answer him. We published it. We’ve managed to keep going for 40 years, which isn’t that easy since we are a print publication. We’ll have a new look starting in Winter 2015 and The Human Life Review is now online as well. Our website has a weekly blog and Twitter feed now also. And we’re looking forward to more people being a part of the conversation. We definitely want to reach the pro-life leaders of tomorrow. We want to reach more people in the medical profession and the legal profession, because we’re going to have to really fight back against what’s going on. Stella: In recent years you also started hosting a big October event in Manhattan, The Great Defender of Life Awards Dinner. What can you tell us about the event, and some of your past honorees?  Maria: Yes, the upcoming dinner on October 23 will be our twelfth. The first one, in 2003, was a testimonial to my father because we had chosen “Great Defender of Life” to put on his tombstone. And our first honoree was Congressman Henry Hyde. In the past we’ve also honored Nat Hentoff, who is a Jewish atheist pro-life columnist for the Village Voice, honored Mary Kenny, who is an Irish journalist and TV personality in England and Ireland ,Bill McGurn, formerly with the Wall Street Journal and now with the New York Post. Last year we honored Eric and Susanne Metaxas, the first time we honored a married couple. At this year’s ceremony we’re honoring Clark Forsythe, who is senior counsel for Americans United for Life and author of “Abuse of Discretion: The Inside Story of Roe v. Wade.” Our co-honoree is Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, who is a real dynamo and represents the youthful face of the pro-life movement. Sally Muggeridge, the niece of Malcom Muggeridge and president of the Malcolm Muggeridge Society, is our mistress of ceremonies. It’s a wonderful evening because there’s such a feeling of camaraderie and we honor people who deserve to be honored. The Changing Abortion Debate Stella: In general, how do you think the content of the abortion debate has evolved during the past 40 years? Maria: In the early days of Roe, people would ask: “who can say when life begins?” People talked about “products of conception” or “bunches of cells.” Nobody argues that way anymore, especially now with ultrasounds. There’s no question it’s a baby. We used to think if people just knew, they would change their minds. But now they do know, and it’s much more blatantly utilitarian and increasingly eugenic. The question from the other side isn’t whether or not the baby is alive in the womb, but: “Well, what kind of quality of life would that child have?” or “Why should my own life be put on hold?” So I think the debate has evolved in a frightening way in that sense.  There’s no question it’s a baby. We used to think if people just knew, they would change their minds. Stella: The pro-abortion side’s arguments seem to be appealing more and more to raw emotion these days, to justify things like late term abortion. That was something most pro-abortion folks used to really squirm about if you mentioned it. What aren’t people getting about this? And can you see any way for a real debate to evolve with things this extreme? Maria: They’re definitely relying on emotion. We’ve reached such a point of narcissism and selfishness in our society. For example, with Wendy Davis advocating for late-term abortions in Texas, the stories are always emotional. It’s always about a woman who really wanted a child, but the child would be disabled and the mother starts thinking about what that child’s life would be like and how much the parents would suffer. It’s the arrogance of deciding that someone else’s life won’t be good enough. And it’s hard debating because right now people have such different moral codes, such different compasses. The one logical thing that I think should work—if people were paying attention—is to note that if one group of humans can be killed, then any group of humans can be killed. It only depends on who’s in power, who’s deciding which group to kill. That ought to scare people. But it doesn’t, because they have a sense of security that they’re always going to be on the right side, the powerful side. And that’s just not true. People should be able to see this from past struggles, like slavery and the Holocaust. Logically the parallels are obvious. However, people just don’t see them. I watched Twelve Years a Slave, a terribly powerful movie. And I remember wondering if Hollywood would ever praise a movie that exposes abortion for what it is, because the themes are the same: man’s inhumanity to man, and considering one class of humans “less-than.” An Open Discussion of Infanticide and Eugenics Stella: Yet there are bioethicists today who shrug off human dignity. What do you make of the Princeton bioethicist Peter Singer and his outlandish support for infanticide and his animal-rights arguments? Maria: Peter Singer is part of this movement that seems almost like science fiction. He is a utilitarian, and believes pain is bad, actually thinks we can do away with suffering. And believes parents should have the right to kill even their born children up to a certain point—he doesn’t say what age that is. The scariest people are people like Singer in academia who advise medical boards. If you don’t believe in God, then there’s nothing wrong about making some life-and-death decisions for yourself and for others. Stella: Sometimes when I hear such outlandish views, I ask, “Do they really believe that stuff?” Maria: I can’t get into his head. I think we should argue all of the life issues from the standpoint of human rights, from common sense. But there is a point—and this comes to Singer’s goal of getting rid of suffering—that if you don’t believe in God, then there’s nothing wrong about making some life-and-death decisions for yourself and for others. If you don’t have a belief that some things are just beyond the pale for humans to do to each other—that murder and suicide are wrong because they’re deeply morally, and transcendentally wrong—then it’s hard not to feel sympathy for some of those hard cases. Stella: So what kind of impact do you think the abortion culture, and now open discussion of infanticide and euthanasia, have had broadly on American society today? On the American family and the coarsening of American culture, including the hook-up culture among youth? Maria: Regarding the hook-up culture, biologically women will suffer more from the consequences of sex. But even for men, I think it hurts the relationship between the sexes terribly, and of course that hurts the family. By trying to control it all and closing off opportunities, the whole family unit is hurt. And you can’t really fight this if you don’t talk about sex. You can’t trivialize sex. As a society if we don’t stop trivializing sex we aren’t going to have respect for human life. For people born after 1973, I don’t know what kind of collective mental effect it has to know that you could have been aborted, to know that your siblings might have been aborted. Another impact is that for people born after 1973, I don’t know what kind of collective mental effect it has to know that you could have been aborted, to know that your siblings might have been aborted. What does that do to you? It gets into your consciousness. And that’s the thing. If you know you had a sibling aborted, and that it was “okay” and your mother was exercising her rights, you can’t say there’s a not a part of you that doesn’t wonder who that sibling would have been. Stella: It’s going to create some pathologies across society, it seems. Maria: Yes, it must. Also, there are all the men and women who aborted and think it’s not affecting them. We all agree now that divorce has repercussions. That doesn’t mean we think it should never happen. But we all agree that divorce has negative effects on children. But with abortion we can’t say that. You can’t even go there. With all of the studies done on divorce, following kids for generations, you’d think we’d be doing that for families that had abortions. Beneath the Glossy Magazine Covers Stella: What’s your take on the “War on Women” rhetoric? You and I can see abortion itself as a central element of a full frontal war on women. The March for Life in Washington has a huge contingent of post-abortion women who will tell you how horribly destructive and violent the abortion culture has been to them. So how do you think the pro-abortion side co-opted the “War on Women” rhetoric so that being pro-abortion became synonymous with being pro-woman? Abortion and sex without consequences is turning women against their own uniqueness. Maria: I think it’s because they focused on contraception. They focused on Mitt Romney and made him seem like he wanted to send women back to the ’50s and ’60s being the stay-at-home mom with the perfect little casserole. And that does scare women. Of course, it seems at face value like a step into the past where women’s careers and education were not taken as seriously. So they focused the argument on that in order to distract people from abortion. And no matter how much we’d say it’s not about contraception, they know that, propaganda-wise, they’ll win with that kind of fear-mongering. At the same time, when you do start studying life issues and abortion, you realize that some contraceptives are abortifacients, and you ought to take a serious view of sex. The sad thing is that abortion and sex without consequences is turning women against their own uniqueness. So many women at the end of the day regret not having children. Abortion is definitely a war on women. There are a lot of base motives for pushing certain contraceptives, pushing abortion. There’s money-making (Planned Parenthood, after all, is a billion-dollar business!) and there’s eugenics. The big push for contraceptives, especially dangerous kinds like Norplant, which focuses on certain demographics, is eugenics. But if the mainstream media is against you right now, they’ll twist the reasonable things you say and they’ll let slide things other people say that are horrible. Stella: There was a movie this past summer, a box-office flop called “Obvious Child,” which was supposed to put a positive spin on abortion. What’s your take on how they’re putting together their propaganda? Does it seem like the pro-abortion elites are now just kind of trying on different things for size to see what works? Maria: Yeah. It’s interesting because they’re trying to do what we’ve been seeing with pro-life indie movies like “Bella” and “October Baby.” With those, you might kind of sit there and wonder if this is propaganda trying to make you see the pro-life point of view. But “Obvious Child” was just so obviously a propaganda movie for abortion. “Obvious Child” is an amazing title. It was trying to show that the woman was “obviously” a child and not ready to be a mother. But what about the fact that it’s obviously a child she aborted, and she’s a stand-up comic and she has a fling and she has an abortion and she makes a joke about it? Ha ha ha. You know. Not funny. Even when they try to be flippant, I’m surprised they would use that title, because you can so easily say “Obviously it’s a child.” It’s just so weird. Stella: And why do you think it’s so easy for people to wave off the Kermit Gosnell horrors in that Philadelphia abortion clinic? Do you think it’s desensitization? Or have we reached such a point of ignorance as a society that we don’t even know how to dig ourselves out? Kermit Gosnell was horrible, but people tell themselves that he was an ‘outlier’ or ‘the exception.’ Maria: I don’t think it’s new. I think it’s human nature. I think that throughout history, there are always awful things that happen. Someone will mention them, and you’ll say “No! They don’t really do that, do they?” And once you find out that they do, you can maybe do something about it, or go back to your state of ignorance before. Let’s just take the example of slavery. In the movie, Amazing Grace, he [abolitionist William Wilberforce] tried to show that the way slaves were brought over from Africa was completely inhuman. People knew that, but they chose to look the other way. We all do it to some extent. Because it’s overwhelming. And also people think when things are that bad, it just can’t be true across the board. Gosnell was horrible, but they tell themselves that he was an “outlier” or “the exception.” There’s this glossy-magazine idea of women’s health care and it doesn’t go with the Gosnell idea. They just don’t want to believe it. Stella: Over the past couple of years we’ve seen a campaign by the pro-abortion side to get women to “share their abortion stories” as a means of pushing back against lost public-opinion support. Cosmopolitan ran a story by a young woman who videotaped herself undergoing an abortion, then posted it on the Internet. New York Magazine recently touted “abortion doulas,” hand-holders for women while they have abortions. What do you think is driving all of this? Maria: It’s complicated. Definitely among people who’ve had abortions, there’s reluctance to face what they’ve done, so they take all that energy into justifying what they did. And there are younger people who buy the line that this is important for their freedom so they need to just champion it and be hardnosed about it and not give in to any other feelings. The problem is that reality is what it is, and the truth of it still comes out. The abortion doula story was awful. It was awful that a young woman would put herself through this. The emotions are complicated. Again, abortion is a huge industry. It’s not all sincere emotion. It’s a lot of strategic PR. But what really scares NARAL and Planned Parenthood is the absence of [an] enthusiastic following among the young. We have that ourselves now. I think young people are not going to make abortion their life’s cause. The stories of some of the women who first pushed for legalized abortion are very invested in justifying their own abortions. What scares them is not seeing the same kind of passion on their side among the young. The bad thing is that so many medical decisions are made in crisis without a lot of knowledge, so that young women who really want their babies are intimidated by professionals. They defer to them and end up aborting. Human Life, Inc. Stella: So what do you think allows Planned Parenthood to get a pass when it comes to a healthy American skepticism of big business? We don’t see someone saying: ‘I think you should have an abortion, but—full disclosure—I’m two abortions away from my quota.’ Maria: Again it’s a glossy, women’s-magazine way to cover up the fact that it’s a huge business. That they’re under pressure to talk you into an abortion. That they have quotas. Abby Johnson’s book ,“Unplanned,” is all about that, how much pressure she was under as a clinic director to come up with the requisite number of abortions and make more money. So where’s the healthy cynicism about this business, not to mention the laws insisting that clinics are clean? When a doctor talks about a drug, he needs to disclose whether or not he is paid. We don’t see someone saying: “I think you should have an abortion, but—full disclosure—I’m two abortions away from my quota.” Stella: When we’re talking about the life issues—abortion, cloning, embryonic stem cell research, assisted suicide, euthanasia—is there a certain point at which we just say we’re dealing with eugenics? Maria: I think from the very beginning we were dealing with eugenics, because Margaret Sanger [who founded Planned Parenthood] was a eugenicist. One of the driving forces behind liberalizing abortion laws was not really women’s rights. It was eugenics. Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in an interview with NYTimes Magazine: “Frankly I had thought that at the time it [Roe v. Wade] was decided, there was concern about population growth, and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” But she’s not different from many other people. They’re just smart enough not to say it. Richard Dawkins recently said if you have Down Syndrome, you should be killed. Why? I mean that’s how the Holocaust started—with disabled children. It’s really been about that forever. Eugenics is also coming more to the fore in screening for characteristics in sperm and egg donors. Stella: Is there any particular human life issue that you see as the biggest threat facing human dignity in the coming years? Maria: I would just say the biggest threat is what’s happening at end of life or with sudden disabling and not having life support offered. Obamacare and incentives for saving money are reaching a boiling point. How are you going to feel safe? My father was prescient about that, that a doctor would become either a “quality of life” doctor or a “sanctity-of-life” doctor. And there are going to be fewer and fewer sanctity-of-life doctors. If you are a sanctity-of-life doctor, who is going to back you up, hospital-wise, medicine-wise, insurance-wise? Reaching Out When People Don’t Want to Talk Stella: How can we help people of goodwill best understand what is really at stake? How can we make them more aware of their own human dignity as well as the dignity of others? There’s no one way to reach everyone. That’s why the pro-life movement has to be so diverse and have so many different approaches. Maria: With the number of abortions we’ve had in this country, it’s hard to reach people. If you point out the evil of it, you’re going to get a defensive response. So how do you try to start to say: “We’re all human. We all make mistakes. There are a lot of pressures. Let’s try to open our eyes, forgive ourselves, and move on.” That’s another reason being religious helps. Understanding that we’re all sinners and we’re capable of doing horrible things, but we can be forgiven. If you don’t have that and you take pride in your behavior, it’s just too crushing to see that your behavior is wrong. There are a lot of very good people who are pro-abortion. How do we reach them? What we do at the Human Life Review is try to appeal to people’s brains and hearts. But there’s no one way to reach everyone. That’s why the pro-life movement has to be so diverse and have so many different approaches. Stella: Going forward, where would you say the Human Life Review is headed, in terms of focus? Maria: We’re going to be part of this counter-cultural movement now against Obamacare. There’s a great opportunity to reawaken people’s sense of right and wrong when it comes to these things. Question the authority of Obamacare. We want to give people the tools to work intelligently against these really inhuman policies. And we need to reach out more to popular culture. We need to have pro-life themes well represented in the arts. As Seth Lipsky of the New York Sun said: what the pro-life movement needs is an “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” a great work of fiction or a movie that really shows people the humanity of the unborn. Stella: The Human Life Review is no ordinary academic journal. It’s astonishingly dynamic. What can you tell us about the diversity of the journal’s contributors and its scope? Maria: We’ve had famous people and we’ve had brilliant academics contribute, but we’ve also had an anonymous man write poignantly about how his father was euthanized—“let die” in a hospital. I think our youngest contributor so far is a homeschooled young man whose pro-life speech won a speech contest. We’ve had stay-at-home moms, and teachers, and one of our recent contributors is a wonderful man, retired, who volunteers at nursing homes and has a great perspective on end-of-life issues. We have academics who read the Review, but many of our most faithful cover-to-cover readers are not. They’re businessmen, doctors, moms, dads. The Review is meant to encompass a broad type of article and it’s also meant to be a record. So part of our editing philosophy is to let people speak as much in their own voice as possible. And when you pick up a copy, there may be one article that’s very journalistic, like Bill Murchison, who’s a columnist and is one of our senior editors. His articles are wonderful. They read quickly. They’re witty. And then you might have a real research paper by Mary Meehan, another senior editor. Or a truly thoughtful philosophical essay by our third senior editor, Ellen Wilson Fielding, Throughout you’ll see that kind of combination. So we see it more like an orchestra, not one instrument.

"397",397,"What People Who Love Life Should Be Doing Now To Prepare For Roe To Go","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-02-28"," It is time to prepare for life after Roe. Although the rest of us won’t know the results for a few more months, the Supreme Court has already voted in Dobbs, the case challenging Roe v. Wade’s invention of a constitutional right to an abortion. The opinions are being drafted, circulated, and revised. The general expectation is that Roe will go; even many abortion supporters seem resigned to that.



Abortion opponents have been burned before, and it could happen again. But we should not allow fear to keep us from planning for victory. 



Of course, overturning Roe will not end the struggle to protect human life in utero, but it is the breakout battle. Under Roe and the subsequent Casey decision, we have been besieged deep in our own territory, trying tactic after tactic to get around the constraints the Supreme Court placed on us. With Roe gone, abortion policy will be set by the states — there is an argument that abortion is unconstitutional, but no one expects the Supreme Court to embrace it in this case.



Without Roe, state laws protecting human life in the womb will not be constantly blocked by the federal courts. Thus, many states will promptly enforce laws restricting abortion. 



Some of these laws are from before Roe and some were designed to go into effect if Roe was overturned. However, states controlled by the abortion industry and its allies will continue to permit abortion on demand, and even increase their pro-abortion efforts. Also, although Democrats are unlikely to dominate Congress sufficiently to legislatively impose abortion on demand on the entire nation, the Biden administration’s control of the federal bureaucracy still gives them a lot of power.



Prepare to Counter New Tactics



Abortion opponents need to prepare ourselves to counter the new tactics the other side will use if Roe goes. Pro-abortion states will encourage abortion tourism, even to the point of providing state abortion funding for residents of other states. We should also expect abortion advocates to increase the harassment of crisis pregnancy centers that provide support for women looking for alternatives. The abortion lobby does not want any other options.



The pro-abortion endgame, however, is mail-order abortion. Telemedicine and the abortion pill regime will be used to circumvent state restrictions on abortion. Democrats are already shoveling money to Planned Parenthood for telehealth contraception, knowing that this will be used for abortion — if not now, then soon. Other gimmicks are possible, such as hosting abortion clinics on federal land, but the primary goal is for abortion pill mills in places such as New York City to flood the rest of the country.



Thus, though we should rejoice at the end of Roe, it is not the end of the fight to protect human life in the womb. We should take heart, though, for undoing Roe proves that the march of history is not one of pro-abortion inevitability. We can win.



Essential to our hope for victory is the truth is that abortion is an evil that makes everything worse. It is an impediment to human flourishing. This is why, despite apocalyptic predictions from the left, life will go on after Roe is overturned — indeed, more lives will go on. This is clear in states that have already imposed restrictions on abortion. Texas has been just fine since its heartbeat bill went into effect, and Missouri has not suffered from pushing nearly all elective abortions outside its borders.



Once Roe is gone, we must work state-by-state to limit abortion and to remove abortion clinics from an increasing area of America. Abortion on demand needs to be geographically confined — a regional peculiarity, rather than a national norm. Isolating and containing the evil of elective abortion will prepare the way for its national abolition.



Funding Support, Defunding Planned Parenthood



Furthermore, as we restrict abortion, we must continue to provide support for mothers and children. We should increase giving to local pregnancy centers and pro-life medical practices. Good family policy will also be essential, and conservative scholars are rising to the challenge. State governments should follow the example Texas set by pairing its heartbeat bill with generous funding to care for women and children.



We must simultaneously fight to defund Planned Parenthood — we should fund babies, not abortions. It is shameful that Republicans have allowed billions of taxpayer dollars to fill the coffers of the nation’s largest abortion chain. Republicans have had chances to end this, but have pursued other priorities. It is long past time to primary ostensibly pro-life GOP politicians who will not end the flow of government cash to abortionists.



GOP office-holders also need to prepare to use the federal bureaucracy effectively, and the pro-life movement needs to get ready to staff it. Democrats’ scheme for big-city mail-order abortion pill mills supplying the entire nation will be impossible if the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services do their jobs and follow the law. Republicans are bad at directing the administrative state even when nominally in charge of it, and they are even worse at oversight of the bureaucracy when the Democrats control it.



The fight to protect human life in the womb will not, alas, end with overturning Roe — and we must be wary, for the Democrats will revive Roe if they regain the Supreme Court. But if we prepare and persist for the next phase of the struggle, we will be able to restrain the evil of abortion far more effectively than we have been able to under Roe.



God willing, Dobbs will allow us to finally go on offense against the evil of abortion.

"398",398,"The Long-Awaited End To Roe v. Wade Will Be Just The Beginning","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-27"," What comes after Roe v. Wade? After almost a half-century, the Supreme Court is poised to admit that the right to elective abortion established by Roe v. Wade and affirmed in Casey v. Planned Parenthood was a fabrication with no basis in the text or history of the Constitution. Princeton’s Robert George predicts the justices will vote 6-3 to overturn Roe in the upcoming Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case. As he points out, it is not just that six justices presumably believe Roe to have been a mistake, but that their concern for the reputation and legitimacy of the Supreme Court also directs them to scrap Roe. Upholding Roe would be as destabilizing as overturning it. Nothing has politicized the Supreme Court as much as becoming the self-appointed arbiter of abortion, and nothing in their abortion jurisprudence would become the justices like leaving it.  The end of Roe will be a triumph of faithful advocacy for the powerless against the powerful, from judges and politicians to Hollywood and Wall Street. Pro-lifers must not grow weary or complacent after overturning Roe, for such a ruling will only return abortion policy to the ordinary American processes of representative democracy. When Roe falls, some states will restrict or ban elective abortions, others will continue to celebrate and subsidize them. The pro-life movement will still face many battles. But we will fight these without the handicap of the federal judiciary having veto power over every democratically enacted limit on abortion. We will also be better able to show that there is a better way of life than that encouraged by a culture of abortion. Glimpses of the Post-Roe Future There are already glimpses of the post-Roe future. Texas has deployed an innovative legal strategy to hamstring the abortion industry, and it has allocated $100 million to support pregnant women. Meanwhile, elective abortion has all but been driven out of Missouri, and other states are not far behind. These states not only provide examples of effective legal strategies against abortion, they also demonstrate that we don’t need abortion. Contrary to the predictions of abortion advocates, areas with abortion limitations are not dystopian nightmares. The parade of horribles that abortion supporters trot out to support their position turns out to be largely imaginary.  Indeed, Texas and many other conservative states are attractive destinations for those leaving deep-blue states such as California and Illinois. These moves are rarely made with abortion in mind, but this indifference itself shows that the supposed necessity of abortion is a myth. A Culture of Abortion Abortion does not promote human, and specifically female, flourishing. Only a sadist could look with satisfaction at the culture abortion has encouraged and enabled. The violent evil of abortion itself is obvious in the age of ultrasound, and decades of abortion on demand have shown that that it only encourages other evils, rather than remedying them. Nothing enables irresponsible and exploitative men as much as abortion. Abortion removes the perceived problems of an undesired pregnancy, but it encourages the dynamics that produce such situations. Abortion supports a materialistic and selfish culture, in which wealth and status are the measure of a life, and relationships are about looking out for number one, rather than mutual love and self-giving. Advocates for abortion justify it as the protector of individual autonomy and sexual authenticity. But though our culture treats these values as sacred, they leave people lonely and dissatisfied. Even before the pandemic, Americans were increasingly romantically unattached, childless, and socially isolated. This is not all due to the sexual culture built on abortion, but it is evidence of that culture’s failure to provide what is most important in life and to make us happy.  Abortion culture promotes unstable relationships and passing hookups, which have proven less fun than promised. It is particularly brutal to young women. It trains them to be sexual playthings for a string of men who don’t love them, and to be dedicated workers who prioritize career and consumption over relational fulfillment. But work and stuff will not love you back. Despite attempts to glamorize the culture abortion sustains, its rottenness is apparent, even in those who declare that abortion helped them become rich and famous. Celebrities’ endorsements of abortion as the enabler of fame and fortune are not compelling when we are all too aware of their broken relationships and shuffles in and out of rehab. Furthermore, for every woman proclaiming that abortion helped her reach the top, there are many who got there without abortion. And there are even more women for whom abortion is another desperate part of life at the bottom of a fetid culture, rather than a stepping stone for ambition. It does not have to be this way. Pro-lifers Must Continue to Show the Better Path Just as we must continue the political and legal fight to protect innocent human life after Roe is gone, pro-lifers must continue to show that there is a better option than abortion’s culture of death. We must demonstrate that relations between men and women need not be a battleground of selfishness, and that children may be seen as blessings, rather than as barriers to achievement or as luxury goods to be ordered up after acquiring everything else. The lure of abortion is the promise that good may come from doing evil. But the evil of abortion is not so easily instrumentalized and contained. Rather, it infects our culture and spoils even the goods that it supposedly supports.

"400",400,"Majority-Woman City Council In Texas Votes To Create Second ‘Sanctuary City For The Unborn’","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-09-17"," On Sept. 9, the City of Omaha, Texas, unanimously passed an ordinance outlawing abortion within city limits, making Omaha the second city in the nation to do so, behind Waskom, Texas. The City of Naples quickly followed suit that same day in a 5-1 vote. “To protect the health and welfare of all residents within the City of Omaha,” the ordinance reads, “including the unborn and pregnant women, the City Council has found it necessary to outlaw human abortion within the city limits.”  The text states that unborn babies “are the most innocent among us and deserve equal protection under the law as any other member of our American posterity as defined by the United States Constitution,” also asserting that “there is no language anywhere in the Constitution that even remotely suggests that abortion is a constitutional right.” Both Men and Women Voted to Preserve Human Life A majority-female Omaha City Council passed the ordinance on the heels of criticism that the all-white, all-male Waskom City Council was curtailing “the reproductive freedom” of a demographic that didn’t have a seat at the table. “I hate abortion, and I don’t want to see an abortion clinic in our city,” Naples Councilwoman Sally Buford told the director of Right to Life of East Texas Mark Lee Dickson, who led the initiatives in Waskom, Omaha, and Naples. Naples Mayor Pro-Tem Jacob Wilson wrote in a Facebook comment relating to the decision that he was “truly proud to be the one to make the motion to pass this [bill].” The Naples City Council is made up of four men and two women. The only opposition to the ordinance came from Councilman Danny Mills, an older, white male. “I just couldn’t see that we could tie up a mayor and cops tending to somebody else’s business,” Mills told Texarkana News.  Both Omaha and Naples are in Morris County in northeast Texas. Morris County voted overwhelmingly Republican in the 2016 presidential election, 69.3 percent to 28.7 percent Democrat. Although national voters, who overwhelmingly support access to at least first-trimester abortions, might consider the ordinances radical, the city councils seem to have the support of their constituencies. During the 2018 Republican Party primary, voters had the opportunity to vote on Proposition 7, which gave voters the chance to voice their opinion if they were “in favor” of or “against” the following statement: “I believe abortion should be abolished in Texas.” Out of 1,244 votes in Morris County, more than 75 percent were in favor of the statement. The Ordinances Properly Define Abortion The newly passed city ordinances define “surgical or chemical abortion” as the “purposeful and intentional ending of a human life,” classifying it as “murder ‘with malice aforethought.’”  “Rulings or opinions from the Supreme Court that purport to establish or enforce a ‘constitutional right’ to abort a unborn child, are declared to be unconstitutional usurpations of judicial power,” according to the ordinance, and are “declared to be null and void.” The near-identical Naples and Omaha ordinances later state, however, that the public enforcement part of the ordinances cannot go into effect “unless and until the Supreme Court overrules Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), and permits states and municipalities to once again enforce abortion prohibitions.” Although it would appear this clause renders the whole ordinance moot, Dickson says there’s no statute of limitations on this public act of enforcement: “This allows for those who break this law to be subject to these penalties at a later date — which is no laughing matter.” “Do not be mistaken,” Dickson continued via electronic correspondence, “abortion really is outlawed in every city that passes these ordinances. If someone performs an abortion in a city that has outlawed abortion they have broken the law and there are both future (public enforcement) and immediate (private enforcement) consequences.” Read the full Omaha ordinance here and the Naples ordinance here. City Councils Demonstrate Farsightedness on Abortion The Omaha vote was driven in part by Mayor Ernest Pewitt’s concern that an abortion business could move into the city and set up shop in an abandoned clinic, unless the city council passed a law to prevent it. The nearby city of Naples also has an abandoned clinic which could have been converted into an abortion facility. The ordinances outlaw abortion within the city limits and ban the sale and distribution of “emergency contraception.” They define “emergency contraception” as “any chemical or substance which is manufactured for the express purpose of use after unprotected sexual intercourse and which may function as an abortifacient to end the life of an unborn child by preventing implantation of the zygote in the uterine lining. This definition includes Ella, Plan B, Next Choice One Dose, and My Way.” Due to their inclusion of chemical abortion, these ordinances are more prescient than most other pro-life legislation, classifying “any remote personnel who instruct abortive women to perform self-abortions at home” as abortionists. Organizations dedicated to providing women access to and guidance for taking “DIY” abortion drugs are growing in popularity, particularly in areas and countries where abortions are banned or access is severely restricted. Without outlawing such efforts, many first-trimester abortions would continue undetected with the aid and guidance of “DIY” abortion activists acting with impunity. The documents also named specific abortion-facilitating organizations and declared them to be criminal, including Planned Parenthood, Jane’s Due Process, The Afiya Center, The Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and others. Ordinances Include a ‘Life of the Mother’ Exception The ordinance is also rare in its denouncement of “judicial usurpation” by the Supreme Court, although it simultaneously declines to enforce the laws until court precedent is overturned. In addition to these robust statements, the ordinances provide a “private enforcement mechanism” by which violators of the ordinance can be held liable in tort to any surviving relatives of the dead unborn child. Liability includes compensatory damages, including for emotional distress, punitive damages, and costs and attorneys’ fees. Unlike the provisions that require public enforcement, these tort provisions can be enforced immediately and do not depend on overturning Supreme Court abortion precedent, according to Dickson. The ordinances contain a “life of the mother” exception, which is standard in virtually all anti-abortion legislation and is here written to proscribe abortion as a remedy where early delivery is the superior option. The text states abortion is permitted “if the abortion was in response to a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that, as certified by a physician, places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.” Pro-life medical doctors acknowledge that “previable separations,” but never abortions, are necessary to save the mother’s life. In previable separations, mother and baby are separated to protect one or both lives, but the baby is not willfully killed. According to the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), in previable separations, health care providers try to “optimize the conditions of the separation so that the fetus has the best possibility to live.” Executive Director of AAPLOG Donna Harrison told me via email, “The separation of the mother and her unborn child to save the life of the mother never requires the intentional death of the fetus,” even in cases such as chorioamnionitis (a bacterial infection which can turn lethal within a few hours), severe preeclampsia, or pulmonary hypertension. She believes the wording of the provision is sound. Cities Are Sending a Big Message to Their States The ordinances passed in Omaha and Naples were based on the ordinance passed in Waskom, Texas. The purpose of all three is to ban abortion services and prevent abortion organizations from building abortion facilities or converting old facilities into them. Dickson calls the ordinance template an “abortionclinic-ifacient,” which makes the city “uninhabitable to an abortion clinic and abortion services.” According to Dickson, the Naples and Omaha city councils took proactive measures to protect what they view as the best interest of residents within the cities and in the surrounding areas, particularly those not yet born. Through these ordinances, these cities are “making a clear and definitive stand” for the preborn’s natural and constitutional rights. “These ordinances are not perfect,” Dickson admitted, “but they seek to do what can be done within the laws of the state in which we live.” They aren’t a replacement for state action, “but should send a message to the state that the cities in their state have had enough of the bloodshed,” he said. “It is time for the state to seriously consider bringing this holocaust to an end at the state level,” Dickson declared. He anticipates several more cities will pass similar legislation. America is witnessing enhanced indignation over abortion as communities organize in earnest opposition. Whether these ordinances lead to courts overturning abortion precedent or to states nullifying Roe remains to be seen, but legislators at the state and federal levels would do well not to ignore the grassroots momentum of those opposed to legal abortion.

"401",401,"Pro-Lifers Can Keep Winning But Only If We’re Smart And Steadfast","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-10-11"," We’re winning. In the months since Roe v. Wade was overturned, abortionists are fleeing from state after state as laws protecting life go into effect. As a report from Planned Parenthood’s research group, the Guttmacher Institute, despondently noted, in the first 100 days after Dobbs, “66 clinics across 15 states have been forced to stop offering abortions … there are no providers currently offering abortions in 14 of the 15 states.” 



There is more winning to come. Guttmacher estimates that just over half of the states will soon either ban or significantly restrict elective abortion. Tens of thousands of lives will be saved from the violence of abortion every year. Furthermore, the backlash abortion supporters predicted looks more like a ripple than a tsunami. Republicans are still poised to do well in the midterms, and it appears that their biggest problems could come from underperforming candidates instead of increased turnout from pro-abortion voters. 



Nonetheless, there have been setbacks amid the success. The defeat of an underfunded and poorly written Kansas ballot measure pushed by the pro-life movement is the most obvious misstep, but there will be more, especially in states where Republican politicians don’t stand up for life. Abortion opponents should learn from these losses and adjust quickly to this new phase in the struggle to protect human life in utero. 



Fortunately, pro-lifers have already learned many lessons that just need to be reapplied in new circumstances. Variations on tactics that were used while under the constraints of Roe will be essential to restricting abortion, especially in contested states.



Perhaps the most important lesson is that we should never expect a fair fight. The Kansas ballot measure would have ended the state Supreme Court’s usurpation of abortion policy-making, thereby returning the issue to the people of Kansas and their representatives. But the pro-abortion side spent millions on ads funded by out-of-state donors that were dishonest even by the standards of political advertising, leaving voters with the impression that the measure would ban all abortions, even if the mother’s life were in danger.



Similarly, after Dobbs, abortion advocates launched an extensive fearmongering effort suggesting that restricting abortion would keep doctors from treating ectopic pregnancies. This was a lie. As Alexandra DeSanctis has documented, no state law prevents physicians from treating ectopic pregnancies.



Abortion foes need to realize that this sort of deception will be a permanent part of the debate. Complaining about pro-abortion propaganda is helpful to the extent it educates voters and teaches them to distrust the pro-abortion side and its corporate media allies, but it will not shame pro-abortion activists and media into telling the truth. Pro-lifers need to account for this in our legislative and legal strategies. 



We also need to realize that the swing voters on abortion are confused, conflicted, and inconsistent — which is why they are swing voters on the matter. They don’t like abortion, and they are horrified by late-term abortions, but they are opposed to outright bans. In general, they’d rather not have to think much about abortion, and when forced to consider it, they tend to be morally incoherent. Such voters are unreliable and, as we saw in Kansas, easily manipulated by dishonest pro-abortion media campaigns. 



Consequently, abortion opponents need to pick their ballot battles carefully, meeting the public where it is at with precise language. Abortion supporters will still lie, of course, but we shouldn’t make it easy for them.



Furthermore, we should recall the tactics that succeeded under Roe when the pro-life movement had to find ways to reduce abortion without being able to ban it. There are still many states in which an abortion ban is not yet politically possible, and a national ban is likewise unlikely anytime soon. Nonetheless, the supply side of the abortion industry can still be restricted even in places where it is generally legal. After all, legal isn’t the same as available.



Even under Roe, elective abortions were not treated as a regular part of the medical industry or of a person’s medical care; abortion isn’t between a woman and her doctor, but between a woman and a stranger she has never seen before and hopes never to see again. This separation of abortionists from the rest of the medical profession means that the abortion supply can be reduced by going after abortion facilities and abortion pill mills. And under Roe, when they could not ban abortion directly, pro-lifers nonetheless became skilled at passing regulations that hindered the abortion industry.



Pro-lifers should thus keep using this approach to constrict the abortion supply in places where it is still allowed. It is not just that wavering voters and politicians will be more likely to support regulation and restriction over outright bans. It is also that the abortion industry and its political allies are notorious for cutting legal and medical corners, which gives the pro-life movement opportunities to hamstring them and even shut them down. 



For instance, pro-life governors, and of course, the next pro-life president, can aggressively enforce existing restrictions against an abortion industry that considers itself untouchable. Pro-life legal groups can find ways to sue over the legal and regulatory violations that Democratic administrations routinely commit in their zeal for abortion. 



The demise of Roe is allowing pro-lifers to rack up a lot of quick victories. But there are many tough battles ahead before the evil of elective abortion is ended across our nation. To keep winning, pro-lifers need to be humble enough to seek the partial wins that are possible, determined enough to show up and defend life at every opportunity, and smart enough to use the right tools for each job.

"402",402,"Blame The Supreme Court, Not Mike Pence, For Women Stuffing Babies Into Dumpsters","Forsythe","Clarke","D.",NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-20"," For decades, abortion advocates have intensely defended the Supreme Court’s 43-year-old abortion doctrine, which legalized abortion for any reason, at any time of pregnancy, in all 50 states, even after fetal viability. Their legalistic dodge has always been that states can prohibit abortion after fetal viability unless the woman’s “health” is at stake. That sounds significant until you learn that the unique definition of “health” the Supreme Court created in abortion law basically means few if any abortion limits can stand. It is a legal nuance that has ensnared GOP vice presidential hopeful Mike Pence, as a controversial legal case has become part of the abortion lobby’s complaints about him.  The Supreme Court defined “health” as “all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age—relevant to the well-being of the patient.” To make matters worse, the court also gave complete deference in decision-making to those who stand to profit from the abortion decision—the abortionists. The “health” exception is open-ended and subjective, allowing the abortion provider to decide if “health” is at risk, thus preventing the states from limiting abortion for any reason after fetal viability. This is the Supreme Court’s abortion doctrine that has given us cases like that of Purvi Patel in Indiana. As the Indiana Court of Appeals described the matter: “32-year-old Purvi Patel managed her father’s restaurant in Mishawaka [Indiana]. A relationship with a restaurant employee resulted in her pregnancy. In June 2013, she purchased mifepristone and misoprostol online from a Hong Kong pharmacy and used those drugs to terminate the pregnancy at home. On the evening of July 13, she delivered a live baby approximately 25 to 30 weeks gestation who died shortly after birth. She drove to the restaurant, put the baby in a nearby dumpster, and drove herself to the emergency room.” Pence Wasn’t Involved At All In the run-up to the October vice-presidential debate, abortion advocates made the unsubstantiated charge that Pence, Indiana’s governor, was responsible for Patel’s prosecution, but Pence had nothing to do with the Patel case or the statutes by which she was prosecuted. Pence didn’t create the under-regulated abortion market that allows someone to order abortion drugs over the Internet and take them late in pregnancy. The Supreme Court did. Prosecutors charged Patel with violating two Indiana laws: the neglect of a dependent statute, and the feticide statute. The neglect statute has existed for decades. The feticide statute was first enacted in 1979.  Pence was first elected governor in 2012 and was not involved with either of these laws. (A 2013 amendment to the feticide law, presumably signed by Pence as part of a broad reform of criminal laws, merely made a wording change.) Pence wasn’t involved in the prosecution by local prosecutors in Mishawaka, Indiana. Also, the governor is not the state’s attorney general and does not control the position of the state in an appeal. A jury found Patel guilty of violating both statutes. But three months ago, an Indiana appeals court threw out most of the case against Patel by throwing out the feticide charge, reducing the severity of the neglect of a dependent count, and reducing her sentence. At the trial, there was virtually no question that Patel’s baby was born alive. The question was whether Patel had caused the death, and the appeals court held that the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Patel caused the death by failing to secure medical care for the baby. Since there was sufficient evidence of neglect but not neglect leading to death, the appeals court reduced the neglect charge. The appeals court also said the feticide statute couldn’t be used against a woman for her own abortion because the Indiana legislature never intended the statute to apply to self-abortions. Allowing Abortion Until Birth Creates These Horrors Aside from Pence’s non-involvement and the abortion industry’s attempts to connect him to a controversial legal case, important questions of law and public policy remain. Why should the Supreme Court’s regime of under-regulated late-term abortion continue despite repeated instances of live birth after late abortion?  By legalizing abortion to (and beyond) fetal viability, the Supreme Court’s policy has encouraged numerous women to wait until abortion gets increasingly dangerous and live births are more likely, with tragic results like Patel’s. Advocates who insist that late-term abortion be unregulated do nothing to help women or children, and they ignore the extreme risks to women’s lives when they abort late in pregnancy. This case should raise troubling questions for legislators and state officials. Should infanticide laws be swept away with the abortion laws, leaving no legal responsibility if a self-abortion late in pregnancy results in the live birth of the baby? Should state officials be blocked from enforcing infanticide laws that result in a live birth after abortion? There have been numerous documented cases of live birth after late-term abortion. That’s the situation the Supreme Court has given us, and abortion advocates are fighting to expand abortion into infanticide and to treat the child born alive as a non-entity. Infanticide laws shouldn’t be so easily erased by abortion advocates or courts. Rather than a permission to limit abortion after fetal viability, the “health” exception is a sword to use against late-term limits, as Planned Parenthood attorneys have done to attack state limits on abortion after 20 weeks. Patel’s case has little to do with Pence, but a lot to say about the chaos left by the Supreme Court in appointing itself the country’s National Abortion Control Board. Tragic stories like this one will continue to occur unless the legal system addresses the reality that without reasonable limits on abortion, newborns will continue to be discarded as trash and abandoned in court.

"404",404,"10 Reasons Congress Should Defund Planned Parenthood, From Women Who Have Been There","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-05-01"," On April 29, protesters took to the streets across the country to call for Congress to finally fulfill Republican leaders’ promises to end taxpayers’ sponsorship of Planned Parenthood, our nation’s largest abortion provider. Sadly, in the debate between pro-lifers and pro-aborts, certain voices are often ignored. This includes the women who have experienced abortion and were deceived by organizations like Planned Parenthood, which have a vested interest in downplaying or denying the effects abortion can have on women’s lives.  While the abortion giant claims to have women’s best interests at heart, countless numbers of us who have suffered the adverse effects of abortion know that’s anything but true. While the organization’s brass promote themselves as health-care providers and advocates of poor women, a little research reveals the people running the show aren’t the champions they claim to be. In fact, they’re doing quite well for themselves as taxpayers watch their hard-earned dollars support their organization, which delivers more than 300,000 abortions each year. In 2014, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards earned $957,952, according to Internal Revenue Service records, while the organization received $528 million in government funding the same year. It’s no wonder the organization is keen to cling to its carefully constructed public image as a women’s health-care provider despite disturbing revelations over the past few years, including allegations that Planned Parenthood harvests the organs of aborted babies, or the fact that the organization does not provide mammograms. Deception has served Planned Parenthood well. Styling itself as a one-stop shop for women’s health care, the organization enjoys the support of countless donors who remain unaware of what goes on behind the nonprofit’s closed doors. It is hard to listen to all the rhetoric surrounding Planned Parenthood when you have been a statistic of abortion’s damage and the organization’s leaders downplay or deny the very real experiences of millions of women. Most women don’t feel comfortable speaking about their abortion experiences, but as more and more of us reach healing, that’s changing. On behalf of those women, here are 10 reasons why Planned Parenthood should be defunded.  10. Planned Parenthood Doesn’t Care for Post-Abortive Women Because it denies the reality of abortion’s effects on mental health, Planned Parenthood does not provide follow-up care for women who have had abortions. “Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide any after abortion counseling [and] they don’t provide real choices,” says Nancy, from New York. 9. Planned Parenthood Overlooks Statutory Rape As investigations over the years have revealed, Planned Parenthood’s de facto policy is to ignore statutory rape laws when admitting underage patients. “The fact is that they cover up the abuse of minors by abetting the sex trafficking of minor girls,” says Clarissa, from Ohio.  8. Planned Parenthood Uses Women “For me, Planned Parenthood was the clinic where my pregnancy was confirmed in July of 1972 as there were no home pregnancy tests at the time. It was there that I was told the first of many lies… [Such as identifying the developing baby as a] ‘Glob of cell and tissue.’ (I was 12 weeks pregnant.) Second, I was told it would be a simple surgical procedure. It was not…there would be no after effects and there was no discussion of any other alternative, [including] having the baby or adoption.” “They also told me to lie as I was only just 17 and the law was 18 in New York. It was later on that I came to find out that they were in an intentional partnership with the clinics in New York to deceive young women into having abortions as a safe and easy solution to the ‘problem of a pregnancy.’ This was part of the agenda to push for legalization on a national level…These abortions were not back alley. They were being done in hospitals and of course clinics like CRASH.” “There was not only deceit…but we were being used on so many levels for the purpose of an agenda…as we believed the lies and then had to deal with the aftermath of the death of our children. We were also left with no support or follow up…only birth control pills which became another way we could be used. I continued to go to the Planned Parenthood clinic to get my pills. No one ever even asked me about my abortion and how I was doing,” says Mary, in New Jersey. 7. Employees Speak of Pregnancy as a ‘Problem’ to ‘Fix’ “They are not very helpful in planning happy parenthood. Just the painful. I am the mother of deceased children.” “Further, as I volunteered recently at a pregnancy center I talked to women who came to us for an ultrasound after they visited Planned Parenthood. They were shocked when they saw their babies’ development. They reported that workers at Planned Parenthood said: ‘You should take care of this soon before it turns into something.’ In other words, they are still lying to women about fetal development, which is a truth of medical science! Why should my tax dollars pay for that? Real doctors don’t have to lie so they can profit from the services they provide,” says Eileen, in Michigan. 6. Planned Parenthood Ignores Women’s Testimony of Post-Abortive Suffering Because admitting abortion can cause emotional and mental trauma would damage the narrative that abortion is simply a minor procedure, Planned Parenthood ignores the stories of women who have suffered after their abortions. “After my two abortions by 1982, I was emotionally spent and quit my ‘dream TV career’ to go back home to the D.C. area to be near family. I desperately needed security. How many young women QUIT their own TV show? [It] proves I was broken and didn’t know just how much those abortions affected me. I just didn’t understand why I was so depressed, [why I engaged in] drug and alcohol abuse, major promiscuity, etc…I was a textbook case of self-sabotaging and destructive behaviors. Anything to dull the pain…but [I] didn’t connect the dots.” “They never once told me about the aftermath of what I’d feel or how the abortions would affect me mentally, spiritually, and physically,” says Leslie in Virginia. 5. Planned Parenthood Preys on Women’s Defensiveness About Abortion Planned Parenthood deceives women encouraging their support, knowing that they need to justify their abortion decisions. “For years in the 1990’s while raising my kids up to their high school years, I was a militant pro choicer and major advocate for PP (to validate MY poor choices), I was an angry voice for a woman’s right to choose… ‘my body, my choice.’ I lobbied lawmakers to get out of my bedroom. I was a misguided, angry woman, like so many I see today. “Planned Parenthood lies, and cheats women, families, and our tax dollars. They buy politicians to do their bidding. (Look at the DNC National platform!!!) I’ve studied their propaganda and deception, the history of Margaret Sanger, Nathanson, NARAL, NOW, etc.,” writes LB. 4. Planned Parenthood Ignores Abortion Coercion Planned Parenthood ignores the fact that many women and teenage girls are coerced into having abortions by their parents, husbands, boyfriends, and others who have power over women. “I was a seventeen year old kid when I had my abortion which was coerced by my father. I was in my 4th month of pregnancy because I had hidden it for so long. No one told me the development of my baby or anything about the procedure I was about to undergo. “ “For countless women abortion is not a free choice or between them and their doctor, it happens because of coercion by parents, boyfriends and husbands, but Planned Parenthood does nothing to stop that, all they care about is the money,” says Theresa in New York. 3. To Planned Parenthood, ‘Choice’ Means Abortion “The entire premise of the Planned Parenthood organization is that they stand behind ‘a woman’s right to choose.’ This is a complete lie. From the moment I walked into PP prior to my abortion, it was as if it was already understood that abortion was the ONLY choice and actually, the best way to handle my ‘situation.’ My ‘situation’ was a precious life growing inside of me and I was scared to death. At no point was I counseled in terms of future emotional, mental and psychological affects this abortion would have on my life. It was simply put to me that ‘more women than you could imagine have abortions’ – I never wanted to be in that category.” “I take full responsibility for my abortion; however being read off statistics of the prevalence of abortion in our culture was in no way comforting to me at this time. The term counseling usually comes with a positive, healing connotation. This was the complete opposite. Never once did the counselor or doctor broach the discussion of ‘would you like to keep your baby?’ It was as if it were just understood that this abortion was happening,” writes BT from New York. 2. Planned Parenthood Fights Oversight and Informed Consent Planned Parenthood fights every attempt at regulations, protection, and the informed consent of women, leaving them uninformed and in danger. It opposes Women’s Right to Know legislation, which would provide information on all the dangers of abortion and fetal development. Planned Parenthood is against parent consent to medical procedures done on minors. Your child cannot get an aspirin at school without parental consent, but in many states can go for a life-altering procedure like abortion without parental consent. Planned Parenthood fights regulations on abortion clinics, leaving their safety requirements far less than those on any other surgical clinics. 1. Women Have Died Because of Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood would like everyone to believe that ending federal funding to them would place women’s lives at risk. Yet we know women’s lives are already at risk in their clinics, physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Some deaths of women at Planned Parenthood include: Tanya Reaves, a 24-year old woman, who died from three major complications during a botched second-trimester abortion suffered at a Chicago Planned Parenthood; Cree Erwin, who died from complications of a botched abortion performed at an Planned Parenthood facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan; Holly Paterson, who died in an emergency room after having been given RU-486 at Planned Parenthood in San Francisco; and Diane Lopez, who went to the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood for an abortion when she was 18 weeks pregnant. Her cervix was punctured during the abortion and she later bled to death at a nearby hospital. Recent emergencies at Planned Parenthood include: The Virginia Beach Planned Parenthood hospitalized two women in the month of April 2017; On April 1, 2017, a patient was loaded into the ambulance at Tempe, Arizona, Planned Parenthood; and on April 1, 2017, a woman was medically transported out of the Planned Parenthood facility in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Then of course there are the countless numbers of women who suffer emotionally after abortion, and even those who have committed suicide. Planned Parenthood is quick to tell us they provide women “quality health care.” I think the families of the women mentioned would disagree. We’ve been there. We know. It’s time for Congress to defund Planned Parenthood and give our tax money to real medical providers who truly care for women’s health and safety.

"405",405,"Why We Need A Pro-Life Constitutional Amendment Even If The Supreme Court Modifies Roe v. Wade","Krumholz","Willis","L.","Delahunty, Robert",NA,NA,"2021-07-29"," The pro-life movement may soon find itself at a defining moment. Late last week, the state of Mississippi filed its brief in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The case concerns a Mississippi abortion law passed in 2018 that prohibits abortions (with limited exceptions) after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s measured and persuasive defense of the statute argued “abortion jurisprudence has placed this Court at the center of a controversy that it can never resolve.” It urged the justices to return “abortion policy to the states – where agreement is more common, compromise is more possible, and disagreement can be resolved at the ballot box.”  Under the Supreme Court’s current jurisprudence, which stems from its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, the challenged Mississippi law is plainly invalid. Under Roe, as modified in 1992 by the Supreme Court’s decision in Casey v. Planned Parenthood, a state may not prohibit abortion before the point of fetal viability, as Mississippi has done here. Fetal viability is usually reached about 23 or 24 weeks into a pregnancy, although it may be reached at 22 weeks in places where standards of maternal health care are higher. Obviously, 15 weeks into a pregnancy is far sooner than the normal point of viability. If the Supreme Court nonetheless upholds the Mississippi law (as some expert commentators forecast it will do), then the architecture of abortion law, erected over the nearly half-century since Roe, would be in danger. The reasons the Supreme Court should deconstruct that architecture are extremely powerful. There is, as Mississippi argues, no tenable basis for it in the Constitution’s language, structure, purposes, or history. Constitutional rules and norms derive from the consensus and practice of an overriding majority of the states and the people. Nearly half a century after Roe, it is unarguable that there never has been, and there is not now, anything like a settled national consensus on abortion. The Supreme Court has made up constitutional rules out of thin air.  But an outcome that dismantles Roe and Casey is by no means a certainty. There are at least two other possible outcomes – two “compromises,” in addition to a pro-life “victory.” ‘Compromises’ First, the Supreme Court might try to fashion a “compromise” that embeds the “principles” of Roe even more deeply into its constitutional law. Under the leadership of three “moderate” Republican appointees — Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter — that is just what the court attempted to do in Casey in 1992. The “compromise” predictably proved to be unstable, which is why, more than a quarter of a century later, the Supreme Court is facing the issue of abortion once again. Each of these justices has since retired. But the court might unwisely persist on their course. A second compromise is also possible, and more likely. The court might uphold the Mississippi law and allow states to regulate or prohibit abortions after a baby becomes capable of feeling pain from the procedure. That point in the pregnancy might be set at or around 15 weeks, perhaps leaving the states some latitude for judgment.  Such an outcome might seem like a clean sweep for pro-life forces. It would not be one, however, if the court also determined that abortions before that point remained entirely permissible. The overwhelming majority of abortions occur in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. A decision like that would therefore leave states powerless to restrict most abortions. The result: A pro-life victory, but a hollow one, if the new “constitutional” line proved to be politically acceptable to most voters, as might well be the case. Worse, a ban on late-term abortions that exempts abortions for fetal “abnormalities” including Down syndrome would preserve the system we have today, except by other rules. ‘Victory’ But let’s return to the possibility that the Supreme Court deals a death blow to the Roe/Casey policy, and gives states the power to protect unborn human life even from the moment of conception, if they chose to define that point as the beginning of human life. Would that not be a stunning victory for pro-life forces? Yes — or, rather, yes, but… What would happen if the court returned the question of whether to legalize abortion back to the states? This would be a welcome development, to be sure. Yet abortion on demand may still exist, by legislation, in many parts of the country. Extremist states would allow abortion up until — or even slightly after — birth. Most other states might allow abortion very early in a pregnancy, when (as we’ve noted) the vast majority of abortions occur. What if, say, most states enacted laws permitting abortion for any reason up to 13 weeks into a pregnancy, but restricted abortions thereafter? In practical terms, Dobbs would not have made much difference, except in some regions. But that is not the only, or even the most significant, challenge the pro-life movement would face after the Supreme Court victory we are imagining here. A Constitutional Ban on Abortion? The pro-life movement would still have to address whether to pursue a new litigation strategy of arguing for a constitutional ban on state (or federal) laws permitting abortion. That objective would go well beyond merely reversing Roe and handing off the abortion question to legislatures (and ultimately, voters). It would not be so much the reversal of Roe as Roe in reverse. Expect the debate over that strategy to dominate the internal conversations of the pro-life movement for some time — probably years. Indeed, as Steve Jacobs’s article “The Supreme Court Shouldn’t Return Abortion to the States, But Ban It” in The Federalist shows, the conversation is already well underway. Jacobs argues strenuously that the movement should seek the “constitutionalization” of a general nationwide ban on abortion. The argument is that the Constitution protects human life whenever it exists – and an unborn fetus is a human life, entitled to government protection from anyone who would kill it. Should the pro-life movement mobilize around this argument? Whether this is a sound strategy depends in part on how deeply you believe the country has become enmeshed in a post-constitutional regime. Roe and Casey are paradigms of post-constitutional law. They are unmoored from the text of the Constitution, its structure, or its purposes. They do not reflect the nation’s historic traditions nor its prevailing conception of which freedoms are fundamental. They are arbitrary impositions by a narrow and unrepresentative judicial elite attentive only to the wishes of a minority of citizens. They are junk law. If the Supreme Court affirms them, it will be to its indelible discredit. If one accepts the view that the true Constitution is irretrievably gone and we live in a post-constitutional order, then yes, the pro-life movement could well promote the constitutionalization of an across-the-board ban on abortion. If the left can wreak havoc in a post-constitutional world, the right can play the same game. Bring on Roe-in-reverse. But what course should pro-lifers pursue if they have not wholly given up hope in the restoration of a constitutional order? Returning Abortion Policy to the States? Under the framework of the Constitution, the basic answer is simple: abortion policy is generally left to the states and their people. That was commonly assumed before Roe. Mississippi’s brief affirms that history and urges a return to the bedrock rule. If the Supreme Court agrees, it would thereafter generally uphold state laws that allow, encourage or fund abortion, as well as laws that regulate or prohibit abortion. The Constitution is in fact agnostic about abortion. True, Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment protects “persons” against deprivation of life without due process of law. But are the unborn “persons” in a constitutional sense? Scholars like Michael Paulsen (and more recently John Finnis) have argued with considerable erudition that the answer might be yes. Two amicus briefs filed in Dobbs by state legislators and policy organizations defend the view that prenatal persons are constitutionally protected (and even that states have a constitutional obligation to protect them). Supreme Court case law has long determined that a business corporation, which is certainly not a natural person, is a person in the constitutional sense. So a “constitutional” person does not necessarily equal a human being who has been born and remains alive. But it is questionable whether an unborn child is a “person” in the constitutional sense. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides for congressional representation based on the number of “persons” in a state. In relevant part, it says: “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state.” Were the unborn ever counted as persons in a census of a state’s population? If not, could someone be a “person” in Section 1 but not in Section 2 – or is it more likely that the term means the same in both sections? Moreover, even if the unborn could be considered constitutional “persons,” there would remain a question whether a state, in allowing them to be aborted, was “depriving” them of life without due process of law. Abortion is an act of private violence, not state action. Is a state “depriving” the unborn of life by deciding not to intervene affirmatively to save them? It does not seem so. In general, under the Due Process Clause, the states have no duty to save an unborn child – or anyone else. The Due Process Clause generally follows the broad contours of the traditional common law, and under that law, there is no “duty to rescue,” except where some special relationship between victim and rescuer exists. Abortion and Slavery Abortion is often, rightly, compared to slavery. Both evils reflect a refusal to acknowledge and respect the full humanity of a class of people who are indeed human. Also, the debate over the constitutionality of abortion in some ways mirrors the debate over the constitutionality of slavery. Until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified as a consequence of the Civil War, the Constitution had never mentioned slavery in express terms (although it made implicit references to it). Before the war, there were bold and imaginative abolitionist legal theorists who had argued that the Constitution did not leave slavery to the states, but impliedly forbade it nationally, or at least empowered Congress to do so. For example, they made the argument that slavery was incompatible with the “Republican form of government” that the Constitution guaranteed. Sadly, the abolitionist view was probably not a sound interpretation of the (original) Constitution. As legal scholars have noted, the Constitution acknowledged state control over slavery. Even opponents of slavery like Abraham Lincoln admitted as much. In the then-prevailing view, slavery was the price that had to be paid for the Union. Where slavery existed under state law, the Union was powerless to undo it, unless perhaps the federal Treasury compensated slave owners for confiscating their “property” — an amount that would have been astronomical. Our federalism tolerates the choice of abortion by a state and its people — just as it tolerates their rejection of abortion, and once tolerated their choice for slavery. Where Should the Pro-Life Movement Go? Pro-life advocates should not want to replace one form of judicial tyranny with another. After all, what is to stop a future band of judicial tyrants supplanting Roe-in-reverse with reverse-Roe-in-reverse? Judicial tyranny begets protracted resistance, as the fevered political aftermath of Roe and Casey shows. We should not readily wish to recapitulate that process for decades longer. We are a pluralistic nation. We have few common substantive values. Indeed, we are finding it increasingly difficult to agree even on neutral procedural rules. And we most certainly do not have a consensus on abortion. The Constitution should be understood to recognize our inescapable value of pluralism and to give it room to breathe. Roe was not just wrong as a legal matter but was also untrue to the value pluralism that is in our nation’s DNA. It imposed the value perspective of what was and remains a minority. That is why it remains so unstable a decision half a century later. The wonderful and humane energy of the pro-life movement should be rededicated to creating a national consensus on abortion, not to agitating for another judicial coup like Roe. Truth, science, and humanity are on its side. And the moral case against abortion has become ever more compelling over time. When Roe was decided, we could not see imagery of infant life in the womb in nearly as much detail as we now can. That scientific advance has transformed our understanding of prenatal life. Further scientific advances will do the same. The pro-life movement should be sponsoring a pro-life constitutional amendment. It will take decades of hard work to build the coalition that will ratify it. But it is worth the effort.

"407",407,"Woman Who Aborts Her Baby At 32 Weeks Illustrates Why She Shouldn’t","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-06-28"," “We must philosophically strengthen feminist theory so that it can admit that abortion is an aggressive act, that it is a form of extermination. [I]n successful abortions, the fetus death rate is 100 percent.” — Camille Paglia, “Vamps and Tramps” One of the biggest arguments pro-choice advocates have against fetal-pain bills and late-term abortion laws is that when a mom decides on an abortion that late it might be dangerous or at least very inconvenient because the child is so large and well developed. They argue any restrictions on abortion whatsoever threaten abortion as a whole.  In that line of reasoning, in a 5-3 decision on Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt yesterday the Supreme Court threw out health and safety regulations on abortion clinics in Texas—one requiring clinics to meet the same health standards as hospitals and the other requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. While Texas has a fetal pain bill in place, not all states ban abortions after 20 weeks, and yesterday’s ruling will mean more abortions in clinics that may be unsafe. The majority justices even dismissed the horrors of convicted murderer Kermit Gosnell’s abortion clinic, which were an impetus for the Texas law. The cultural effects of this permissive legal structure are not surprising. In yet another horrifying abortion tale masquerading as a nuanced progressive opinion piece, Vox reports, via an article that originally ran at Jezebel, of a woman who had an abortion at 32 weeks because her unborn son was diagnosed with “anomalies [that] were so bad that he was ‘incompatible with life.’” The piece stated “If he survived birth, it would be a brief and painful life. So they decided to terminate the pregnancy.” Complicating their already difficult decision, according to Vox and Jezebel, were state laws restricting abortions so close to a child’s birth. Eleven states have enacted fetal pain bills, which limit abortions to before a child is 18-20 weeks old in utero. Because of this, Elizabeth (not her real name) flew to Colorado, where Warren Hern—one of the few late-term abortionists with a license—gave her baby a shot to stop his heart. Elizabeth then flew back to New York to deliver the baby. Hern advised Elizabeth to deliver in a hospital rather than in his clinic because doctors had told her labor and delivery could kill her also. As tragic as this couple’s story reads, Vox and Jezebel portray it as an unnecessary trial due to pro-lifers passing fetal pain bills. That’s classic liberal petitio principii, raising the question: What’s your support for this premise? Elizabeth says “political shit” complicated her abortion; Vox and Jezebel clearly agree. But how?  Maybe Pick Your Proof Stories More Carefully This story is not a great exemplar for the evils of late-term abortion limits. For one, Hern may not have been the best doctor to advise Elizabeth’s late-term (or any) abortion. He is currently facing a lawsuit from a couple claiming a story that sounds quite similar to Elizabeth’s (to be clear, it’s not the same couple). The plaintiff, Jennifer, “suffered a horrific late-term abortion complication that she says has caused her physical pain, mental suffering, and the loss of her ability to bear children.” Vox also states abortions like the ones described in the piece are “incredibly rare,” yet there are approximately 11,000 late-term abortions per year—and that’s just the states that report abortion statistics. Many states like California, where abortion is legal until viability, do not report abortion statistics at all. For comparison, Pew reports that from 2009 to 2014 (the most recent years data are available) the number of gun homicides has hovered around 11,000 and 12,000 per year, yet we don’t see Vox and Jezebel telling us these “incredibly rare.” Further, data shows this particular instance is not typical of most similar decisions. Studies show “most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.” The parents in this incident are no doubt bereaved over the loss of their baby and upset about this horrific abortion experience. While it’s undoubtedly sad, it’s still unclear why an abortion was necessary. Elizabeth had to give birth either way. Why kill the baby first? Why not deliver a live child and hold him in your arms for the brief time he’s granted on earth?  Essentially, these parents decided to euthanize their child because they feared his probable disabilities, and abortion laws allow for that, but only as long as the child is located inside the mother’s womb. Inside a mother, a child is a euthanize-able human. Once outside their mothers, the law protects children. This is only one of the major logical contradictions of abortion, and an illustration of the obvious connection between abortion and euthanasia. This case essentially admits it constitutes baby euthanasia because the abortionist used a shot to stop the baby’s heart and induce abortion. If the fetus isn’t a baby, why stop the baby’s heart to abort it? Abortion Doesn’t Offer Relief to Anyone Further, pro-choice advocates often use conception in rape and concerns for a mother’s life as justifications for legalizing late-term abortions, yet these two conditions were not at play in this instance. Vox still blamed Elizabeth’s harrowing experience on late-term abortion laws, otherwise known as “fetal pain” laws, saying, “They often take extremely individual, complicated medical decisions out of the hands of the doctors who are qualified to make them. Biology is fickle, bodies are unique, and anything can go wrong at any moment.” Yet Vox fails to show how more late-term abortion laws would have eased Elizabeth’s physical or emotional pain. In fact, it’s just as likely her access to late-term abortion has increased her suffering. She would still have faced this difficult situation and its aftermath, including the very obvious knowledge for a lifetime that she consented to the killing of what, at that date, is very obviously her unborn child. If she had delivered her child alive or after its natural death she could have taken comfort that she was not the one who caused it. Scientists and doctors have confirmed repeatedly that babies feel pain by at least 20 weeks, if not before. Compound this with the fact that the 22-week mark is the new viability point. Many of these babies, such as this little one born at 21 weeks and six days and who is now thriving, survive with proper medical treatment. In response, Utah’s governor signed a bill in March that requires abortionists to numb the baby if the mother is at least 20 weeks along. It Has a Heart, It Can Feel Pain: It’s a Baby This seems like the least abortionists can do. Yet its necessity again demonstrates that abortion proponents lie to women and the public about what’s inside a woman’s womb. If it needs painkiller and has a heart to stop, it’s a baby. At least modern medical science is forcing abortion supporters to admit the grisly reality of what they advocate. “We aren’t treating two patients if abortion is an option,” Anna Higgins, an attorney who is a public policy expert on life issues, told me. “We should be treating mom and baby like two patients with various medical needs. Just like any other medical situation. Murder is a ridiculous and false ‘option.’” Instead of facing the fact that abortion at 20 weeks is the willful euthanizing of an “inconvenient” child, late-term abortion proponents continue blaming “bad” laws rather than acknowledging the grim reality of what they support. And these advocates are prominent in our laws and public policy, not treated as distasteful fringe extremists. Clearly, our society’s ethics have stooped to a new low. Sometimes there is more to being pro-life than seeing a child live to his 18th birthday. Being pro-life means we value life from natural birth to natural death. So if a mom has a baby with complex abnormalities who lives outside the womb for five minutes, it still demonstrates life is valuable in all stages and all forms. I wonder if Elizabeth would have experienced far less emotional distress, perhaps even some bittersweet moments, had she allowed her baby to be born naturally and had held him in her arms, no matter how briefly.

"408",408,"Should You Get An Obamacare Conscience Tax Exemption?","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-01-20"," This spring, the Obama administration will again ask the Supreme Court to allow it to force Catholic nuns, Christian universities, and other nonprofits to help deliver abortion-inducing drugs to their employees in violation of their religious beliefs.
While the administration continues to defend that mandate, however, it has largely—but quietly—relented on another Obamacare requirement that forced citizens of some states pay a surcharge for others’ elective abortions.
Paying for Abortion in Any Other Name
Concerned that Obamacare taxpayer subsidies would illegally pay for elective abortions (which is unfortunately happening anyway), Congress required insurers to collect from anyone enrolling in a plan covering elective abortions a separate abortion fee. Insurers would use the proceeds solely to pay for elective abortions for the enrollee or anyone else with abortion coverage.
In some states every plan includes elective abortion coverage and requires the abortion surcharge.
In theory, this abortion payment is voluntary. Only those who voluntarily sign up for abortion coverage would have to pay into this abortion slush fund. But there are two problems: (1) Obamacare requires hiding this “separate payment” from enrollees, and (2) in some states every plan includes elective abortion coverage and requires the abortion surcharge.
My friends at the Charlotte Lozier Institute have previously documented just how difficult it is, by design, to determine whether a plan includes elective abortion coverage and this abortion surcharge. That problem remains. That’s why CLI and the Family Research Council joined forces on a website, obamacareabortion.com, identifying which plans require this abortion surcharge for others’ abortions.
Five States Offer No Abortion-Less Plan
But in some states even Sherlock couldn’t help you find a plan without the abortion surcharge, because every plan requires one. The Government Accountability Office confirmed in a report to Congress in September 2014 that at least five states, (Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Vermont, and Hawaii), offered only plans with elective abortion coverage. In at least Vermont and Hawaii, citizens still have no choice.
Citizens must either pay the surcharge or pay the substantial fines Obamacare imposes against individuals who fail to obtain insurance coverage.
The ACA requires that every state have a multi-state plan (which includes a mandatory option without elective abortion coverage) by next year, but there is no guarantee the administration will meet that deadline.
Alliance Defending Freedom has filed three lawsuits in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Vermont challenging this abortion surcharge where citizens must either pay the surcharge (because they have no other choice) or pay the substantial fines Obamacare imposes against individuals who fail to obtain insurance coverage.
In Bracy v. Burwell, Connecticut and federal officials arranged for new plans on the Connecticut exchange that did not include abortion coverage or this separate payment.
In Doe v. Burwell, Rhode Island required insurers participating on the exchange to include an option that does not include elective abortion coverage and the abortion surcharge at each level of coverage. They also added language to plan summaries on the exchange to help customers identify which plans do not include elective abortion coverage and the abortion surcharge. These changes have drawn the ire of abortion advocates upset that citizens will have expanded options that do not include abortion.
Vermont’s Lyle Howe Gets Off the Hook
In Howe v. Burwell, officials have provided no new plan options. Thus, Lyle Howe and every other Vermont resident continues to face the choice of paying a surcharge for others’ abortions or going without health insurance and paying a fine under Obamacare’s individual mandate.
Federal defendants have argued the government has a compelling interest not to force taxpayers to subsidize abortions in violation of the Hyde Amendment.
Federal defendants have argued the government has a compelling interest in requiring this separate abortion payment so as not to force taxpayers to subsidize abortions in violation of the Hyde Amendment. Nevertheless, the administration agreed to fully exempt Howe from this separate abortion payment. Unfortunately, Vermont insurers, fearing complaints about a voluntary accommodation, would not agree to cooperate and the administration would not require them to do so.
But just before Christmas the Department of Health and Human Services informed Howe he is exempt from the penalty for failing to obtain coverage because he “made a good faith attempt to obtain any qualified health plan in Vermont that does not cover abortion services for which public funding is prohibited, but were unable to do so, and the Affordable Care Act contemplates that issuers will offer such coverage.”
As a result, Howe will be free from the significant penalties (up to 2 percent of his income) on his tax returns this year and should also be exempt on next year’s taxes since Vermont continues to offer him no alternative to paying the abortion surcharge. Howe may also be entitled to a refund of any prior penalties paid. Howe will still not have an Obamacare plan, but at least he will not be punished for failing to pay for others’ abortions.
Although many Americans remain unaware of this separate abortion payment, Howe is certainly not alone in seeking to avoid paying for others’ elective abortions in order to comply with Obamacare. Other citizens of Vermont and Hawaii, and perhaps of Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island in prior years, may want to consider whether they should also be exempt from the individual mandate for tax years where they were forced to choose between paying for others’ elective abortions or being fined for noncompliance with Obamacare.

"409",409,"How A Pro-Life President Saves Tens Of Thousands Of Lives","Makridis","Christos","A.","Jakubowski,  Jonathan",NA,"Range, Peter","2020-09-25"," The battle for America’s most powerful office just inherited a whole new layer of intensity. On Sept. 18, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg passed away, creating a new vacancy on the Supreme Court. Ginsberg had been a stalwart advocate and defender of abortion throughout her 27 years on the court. The vacant seat represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the pro-life movement to achieve the highly sought-after reversal of Roe v Wade. While only time will tell whether this vacancy will be filled before 2021, the contrast between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden has never been clearer than it is today on issues of life and liberty.  Some of President Trump’s critics have sought to dilute the importance of the presidency to the pro-life cause, arguing that Trump does not deserve praise for his pro-life accomplishments. While such critics are right that abortion rates have declined over the past decade, these numbers reflect a wide array of confounding factors, ranging from a decline in fertility to an increased standard of living. A Biden-Harris Presidency Would Fuel Abortion But even if the abortion rate were genuinely trending in the right direction, that still would not justify supporting the most radical pro-abortion ticket in American history—that of Biden and running mate Kamala Harris. While former Vice President Biden once supported certain restrictions on abortion, he has adopted a radical position alongside Harris. Their stance goes against even the most basic legislation, like the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would mandate providing care to an infant who has survived a gruesome abortion procedure and is born alive. The Biden/Harris ticket also supports abortion through all nine months of pregnancy and repealing the decades-long, bipartisan Hyde Amendment, which keeps federal tax dollars from funding abortions. A Biden/Harris victory would lead to billions of dollars in abortion funding internationally, the nomination of pro-abortion justices throughout the federal court system including on the Supreme Court, the repeal of the Hyde amendment, leading to millions of dollars of federal funding directly for abortions, which combined would lead to millions of increased abortions over the foreseeable future. It would also squash the pro-life movement’s momentum and advance pro-abortion forces like Planned Parenthood, a major Harris supporter.  Yes, Presidents Matter to Pro-Life Victories Critics of President Trump, most notably David French, have made several arguments against the importance of the presidential election for pro-life policy. Let’s investigate these one-by-one. French claims presidents are irrelevant to the abortion rate. This is wrong at face value. For starters, President Trump signed an executive order in April 2017 that allows states to defund Planned Parenthood from federal Title X (family planning) funding, reversing an attempt by the Obama administration to exert federal authority over state policymakers. President Trump also signed the Protect Life Rule, which ensures compliance with the statutory prohibition on funding programs that use abortion as a method of family planning and no longer permits Title X-funded family planning services at the same location abortion is provided. Among many other examples, French and his ilk also overlook the fundamental role that the executive office, especially the president, plays in creating a platform on important issues. Consider, for instance, how President Trump completely shifted the dialogue about China over the past three years. The Obama administration focused on accommodation, hoping the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would choose a more democratic path.  But the Trump administration pointed out how China was taking advantage of the United States through unequal terms of trade, stealing intellectual property, and opening the country to systemic supply chain risk. President Trump has followed up with concrete policies, yet he also used the power of the presidency to create a platform for an argument that many pundits dismissed or overlooked. Why would pro-life issues be any different? If anything, the fact that life is in part a cultural issue makes the power of the presidency even more important for gaining a platform. For example, earlier this year, President Trump became the first American president to speak at the annual March for Life, bringing a surge in media attention to the chronically underreported event and expanding the pro-life issue to a broader base of Americans. Judges Absolutely Influence Changes in Law Second, while French concedes that President Trump has appointed many pro-life judges, he argues judges are a force for stability, not change, in abortion law. This is a patently false claim. While judges uphold the law of the land, unless they are activist judges that subtly try to change the law, court rulings constantly create precedent that leads to changes in policy. In other words, policy does not emerge out of thin air—it is based in part on court rulings. Biden-appointed judges would be far more likely to strike down the most basic pro-life legislation and uphold the most aggressive pro-abortion legislation. Moreover, as we can see with Ginsberg’s passing, Trump has the opportunity to appoint yet another Supreme Court justice, which could lead to a substantial realignment in constitutional respect on the court. Planned Parenthood Doesn’t Support Biden for Nothing Conversely, pro-life state legislation would be more often reversed under Biden-appointed judges. Even Planned Parenthood is worried about four more years of a Trump presidency, specifically due to his appointment of federal judges. During the 2019 state legislative sessions, more than 290 bills restricting abortion have been filed in 45 states. Why would Planned Parenthood be worried if judges played such an insignificant role? Third, some including French say state legislatures have more influence on abortion outcomes than Congress does. While state legislatures are clearly important, this again overlooks the interconnected nature of federal and state policymaking. Indeed, President Trump’s removal of the Obama administration policy that forced states to fund abortion is perhaps the most obvious illustrative example of federal policy affecting state policy. That doesn’t even include the fact that a president can campaign for state policymakers running for Congress or for governor, thereby giving an extra spotlight to politicians with similar values. And, if President Trump does not win, Biden is on record saying he would abolish the filibuster, which under a Democrat Congress would lead to additional federal actions that direct billions of dollars of federal funding through states to radical leftist policies, including on abortion. Repealing Roe Would Absolutely Reduce Abortions Fourth, it’s often argued that overturning Roe v. Wade would not substantially affect the number of abortions. This is a speculative claim that contradicts much empirical evidence that shows law has the potential to influence culture towards what is good, beautiful, and true—and vice versa. For example, prior to Roe v. Wade, only a couple of states had abortion laws. States stood on the pro-life side of the pendulum. Although we are in a different country today, it is much easier to make the argument scientifically about the personhood of the unborn child than ever before. Furthermore, if most of pro-lifers’ recent success is in the states, then repealing Roe would allow states to move bills they haven’t passed due to the Supreme Court’s defense of abortion. Just look at former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s vetoes of heartbeat bills. He justified them by stating that the Supreme Court would overrule him. State legislatures generally won’t act if there is federal protection for a given policy matter. That means overturning Roe v. Wade would lead to significant state action, which could come to at least a 32.8 percent reduction in abortions. While French argues this number is insignificant, over time it represents millions of lives. Law Influences Culture Fifth is the argument most people don’t want an abortion. While it would be great if no one actually wanted to have an abortion, the Pew Center reports that 61 percent of adults report that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Regardless, we still don’t want to set laws that are morally, socially, or economically harmful. Culture and law are intimately linked. Legalizing abortion normalized it. Law creates boundaries to hold culture accountable. Although culture is usually the catalyst for law, there are plenty of cases in which the opposite has been true. Consider, for instance, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The CRA ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination. While some racism remains, Sen. Tim Scott can now confidently say that his family has moved from “cotton to Congress in one lifetime.” President Trump deserves credit for being the most active pro-life president in our country’s history. We don’t want to just “limit” abortion or delight in the fact that it is declining according to some estimates. If we believe that abortion constitutes a brutal murder, then we need to fight for its abolition, period, just like we don’t only seek lower numbers of human trafficking, but to abolish human trafficking altogether. A Trump administration will continue to advance life. A Biden administration will push us into the dark ages of abortion on demand, no questions asked, even if the baby is just about to be born or has been born alive and survived, as Democrat politicians have openly stated.

"410",410,"5 Things Planned Parenthood Can Learn From Pregnancy Centers","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-03-21"," It seems that, in its 100th year of doing business, the worldwide leader in abortion is finally starting to understand the flaw in its model. Yes indeed, 2016 is going to be a big year for Planned Parenthood. It’s the year the abortion giant will start focusing on what, apparently, it should’ve been focusing on all along: human beings. Planned Parenthood must have realized something was amiss in the wake of last summer’s revelations that its top-level executives, medical directors, regional affiliate CEOs, and location directors—in other words, everyone Planned Parenthood employs—was involved in selling (excuse me: “reimbursement for reasonable expenses related to tissue donation”) body parts harvested from the babies it aborts.  Further evidence that Planned Parenthood’s previously inexplicable societal credibility was in peril has been rolling out in various forms since the moment the Center for Medical Progress released its first video on July 14, 2015.  Since nine states defunded Planned Parenthood in less than a year, rerouting taxpayer funding to federally qualified health centers, the abortion giant has been in constant damage control. Its oft-parroted, never-honest talking points have lost so much believability, in fact, that even Donald Trump is squawking them in public. Time to Image-Polish Like Crazy So, with its prized taxpayer-funded status jeopardized like never before, there’s no better time for Planned Parenthood to “elevate [its] patient experience with human-centered design,” as a FastCompany.com article declared in a headline last week. When women have options besides an abortion in a dimly lit, unsanitary environment, they go elsewhere for help in a crisis pregnancy. Detailing the findings of a 38-week research project undertaken by Planned Parenthood and global design consultancy Ideo—courtesy of the American taxpayer—the article follows the organization’s journey to discover how it can abort babies in offices less “dark” and “scary” than its present ones. It turns out, when women have options besides an abortion in a dimly lit, unsanitary environment (“dark” and “scary” are quotes from a Planned Parenthood clinic director in the story), they go elsewhere for help in a crisis pregnancy.  Almost a full century into its endeavors to rid the world of “human weeds,” as its founder so inelegantly referred to vast categories of people less privileged than she, Planned Parenthood has discovered its proverbial pig. As shameful as it is predicable, it seems Planned Parenthood is reaching for the lipstick. It’s never too late to change your ways, however. If change is truly in the air for Planned Parenthood, there’s plenty it can do to improve not only its image, but its substance. Even though pro-life pregnancy help centers, which out-number Planned Parenthood locations at almost a 4-1 margin in the United States, are the direct competition to the abortion industry’s flagship brand, it doesn’t hurt to offer some free advice from time to time.  Here are five things Planned Parenthood can learn from pro-life pregnancy centers in its journey to a “human-centered” approach. 1. Every Human Should Expect To Leave Your Office in One Piece While a commitment to “Care. No Matter What.” sure does sound catchy—and is no doubt an easy sound bite that even an intellectual elite like the aforementioned GOP front-runner can ape—“Safety First” might be a better motto to shoot for in Planned Parenthood’s case. Baby steps, you know.  Unlike abortion facilities like those Planned Parenthood administrates, no woman has ever died in a pregnancy help center. Time and space would fail to capture the imminent physical risks abortion clinics pose to every woman who enters their “dark” and “scary” doors. Here are six to serve as sample size since last January: here, here, here, here, here and here. Suffice it to say, abortion clinics, while never safe for a baby, are often just as dangerous for mothers. The abortion lobby’s tooth-and-nail opposition to a Texas law requiring common-sense regulations awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court decision belies Planned Parenthood’s true commitment to its own survival, even at the expense of its own patients. Planned Parenthood has plenty to learn from pregnancy centers in this, the first, most important lesson: every patient should expect to leave your office in one piece. Unlike abortion facilities like those Planned Parenthood administrates, no woman has ever died in a pregnancy help center. This is to say nothing of the preborn humans who have something of a 1 in 10 survival rate once their mother walks into a Planned Parenthood. At pregnancy centers, every human who enters comes back out alive. What’s more, the long-term survival rate for a preborn baby whose mother visits a pregnancy center is around 8 in 10. Safety first, Planned Parenthood. That should be a given for every human entering your clinics. 2. Celebrate Real Birthdays, Not PR ‘Birthdays’ In the article detailing Planned Parenthood’s projected transition into a more “human-centered” model of service, Dawn Laguens, the organization’s executive vice president and chief experience officer for Planned Parenthood, noted that 2016 is a big year for the enterprise. In stark contrast to an industry that profits by preventing birthdays through abortion, pregnancy centers provide women with real choices, so they are able to celebrate the actual birthdays of the children. “We’re about to have our 100th birthday,” Laguens said. You might recognize Laguens as the company’s chief spokesperson, who has been at the forefront of the current controversy and has also been seen blaming the pro-life community’s “rhetoric” for the homicidal attack on a Colorado Springs clinic in November. Even as Laguens points out what she clearly sees as a positive—Planned Parenthood’s 100th “birthday”—wouldn’t actual birthdays represent something a little more tangible to celebrate? In stark contrast to an industry that profits by preventing birthdays through abortion, pregnancy centers provide women with real choices, so they are able to celebrate the actual birthdays of the children whose mothers they’ve reached with practical, compassionate help in a time of need. Take Milo, for example. He spent his first birthday this January on an exclusive tour of the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Had it not been for his mother, Jessica, finding help at Fallbrook (California) pregnancy resource center, it’s likely Milo would’ve been an abortion statistic—that is, had we been talking about a state other than California, which does not even bother its Planned Parenthoods to count the number of children they abort. Yes, “birthdays” can be fun to celebrate, Planned Parenthood, but they don’t hold a candle to birthdays. 3. Be More Creative With ‘Solutions’ Than With Furniture Central to Planned Parenthood’s new strategic focus laid out in the FastCompany.com piece is an innovative, market-based furniture design for its patients. While Planned Parenthood claims the minimal safety regulations to preserve women’s health put forth in Texas’ House Bill 2, for example, afar too costly to comply with, that doesn’t mean the abortion giant won’t make any changes to its clinics. Aesthetics matter, and when you’re starting at ‘dark’ and ‘scary’ for your existing look and feel, there’s really no place to go but up. Aesthetics matter, and when you’re starting at “dark” and “scary” for your existing look and feel, there’s really no place to go but up. So Planned Parenthood is throwing out the old playbook, so to speak, and adding better lighting, organizing furniture in small groups, and even thinking through the proper chairs for waiting rooms that “offer a ‘nest’ for those seeking quiet space for themselves.” Overlooking the obvious disconnect between the word “nest” and the very mission of Planned Parenthood, it’s borderline commendable that the organization is committing itself anew to creatively organizing its waiting room furniture. What may be of better use to its clients, however, would be to apply that same creativity towards finding alternatives to its core product. An optimal “patient experience” takes true ingenuity in learning how to meet each woman where she is, hear her story, make her aware of her options, and help her navigate what she needs to do to make the healthiest choice she possibly can in an unexpected pregnancy. Pregnancy centers know this well. Each of the 2,500 U.S. pregnancy center and ultrasound-equipped medical clinic locations has something unique to offer that an abortion business never could. Add in 400 live-in maternity homes and 250 nonprofit adoption agencies, plus well over 25,000 active volunteers, and you start to get a picture of what creative problem-solving looks like. Perhaps big abortion’s movement toward resourcefulness will carry over to more than chairs and tables into the actual lives it finds itself accountable for. If that’s the case, the pregnancy help community is a good place to start for how-to examples. 4. Do What You Advertise Each year, Planned Parenthood conducts precisely zero mammograms. Don’t try and tell that to lawmakers in Washington DC, a statehouse near you, Miss Tennessee, or Whoopi Goldberg, however. As a Washington Post fact checker points out, these cultural authorities won’t be dissuaded by the data. Planned Parenthood’s claim that only 3 percent of its ‘pregnancy-related services’ are abortion? Also exceptionally dishonest. Planned Parenthood’s claim that only 3 percent of its “pregnancy-related services” are abortion? Also exceptionally dishonest. As Rich Lowry points out at the New York Post, when you apply the same imaginative accounting that comes up with the “3 percent” figure to baseball, you can make the argument that Major League Baseball is more about selling hot dogs (20 million per year) than it is playing the game (2,430 per season). The looming question is, if abortion brings fully $262 million a year into Planned Parenthood’s coffers—or 25 percent of its total revenue, which, together with taxpayer funding makes up 66 percent of its total income—then why do they trot out the 3 percent myth and the mammogram lie? It’s a pretty simple question to answer, really. Abortion is a hard sell when you call it what it is. Past the euphemisms of “choice,” “reproductive health,” “reproductive justice,” or whatever the word is this week, abortion is Planned Parenthood’s business, and abortion is becoming harder to sell by the hour. As it turns out, humans prefer straightforward advertising and messaging that depicts what they’ll actually find when they show up for an appointment. Meanwhile, pregnancy help centers both offer and advertise free services including pregnancy tests, limited ultrasounds to confirm viable pregnancies, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, and material aid including diapers, formula, and clothing. Pregnancy centers are also hubs of compassionate, ongoing support, with pregnancy options counseling, parenting classes, cooking classes, and post-abortion recovery groups. Unlike the highly profitable abortion industry that thrives on euphemisms and doublespeak to sell an ultimately unwanted product, pregnancy centers have nothing to hide and everything to offer, free of charge. As it turns out, humans prefer straightforward advertising and messaging that depicts what they’ll actually find when they show up for an appointment. That’s a lesson Planned Parenthood could stand to learn. 5. Tell Your Clients the Truth As much as it may help your bottom line to spruce up lighting fixtures and apply ergonomically friendly design concepts to your waiting rooms, what every patient will benefit from in the long run is the truth. Women deserve to know the whole truth about abortion, including its potential physical, psychological, spiritual, and emotional effects. Women deserve to know the whole truth about abortion, including its potential physical, psychological, spiritual, and emotional effects. Unfortunately, Planned Parenthood’s business model demands that its clinics, like all other abortion clinics, leave out the truth, putting abortion profits above what’s really best for women and their babies. For the uninitiated, here three quick links to get a taste for Planned Parenthood’s longstanding history of telling clients their preborn baby was a “blob of tissue”: here, here, and here. Again, it’s a tall order to tell the truth about something as undesirable as intentionally ending a life through abortion and still expect to sell it. It’s a little like asking a snake-oil salesman to come clean about his product and still turn a profit. Once again, pregnancy centers serve a shining example for Planned Parenthood in this respect. Here are nonprofit organizations, supported within their local communities, that offer the very thing many of its clients don’t think they need. Many clients go into pregnancy centers thinking abortion is their only choice. They come out with a new understanding that, not only do they have choices, they suddenly have the support of a new group of friends who will do everything in their power to help through those unplanned pregnancies, regardless of the mothers’ choice. While it isn’t likely Planned Parenthood’s recalibration as a “human-centered” outfit will have much effect on its long-term mission, it may well be ultimately replaced by a better alternative.

"411",411,"Democratic Party Accelerates Its Purge Of Pro-Lifers","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-11-21"," The leadership of the Democratic Party is determined that any rebirth of a pro-life presence in their party be stillborn. Less than a week after Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards won reelection against a Trump-backed Republican challenger, the Democrats’ Association of Attorneys General declared that they were imposing an abortion litmus test on candidates. Pro-life Democrats like Edwards can win in red states, but the national party would rather lose than elect pro-life Democrats to top state government positions that would provide them a platform. This is only one example of Democrats’ increased abortion extremism. Bill Clinton’s actions belied his rhetoric, but he at least paid lip service to the idea that abortion should be “safe, legal and rare.” Today, the Democratic Party proudly demands taxpayer-funded abortion on demand until birth, all of the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination reject any limits on abortion, and its national organs are excommunicating possible pro-life candidates.  The leaders of the Democratic Party are radically pro-abortion—the euphemistic label “pro-choice” is nonsensical when applied to a policy of unlimited taxpayer-funded abortion. They have left behind the American voters, including their own base. Abortion polling is notoriously difficult, but it is clear that comparatively few Americans, or even Democrats favor unrestricted abortion. Yet the Democratic Party champions this fringe position and sacrifices winnable races to uphold it. Money and voter intensity explains some of this: the voters who want unlimited abortion really want it and their interest groups and lobbyists are very well funded. Additionally, the national news media skews far left on abortion, which is why, for instance, there has been so little coverage of the extremism of the current crop of Democratic presidential contenders. Their views may be radical in the country at large, but they are standard in big-time newsrooms. The Ultrasound Factor However, there is another, albeit counterintuitive, factor: the humanity of developing persons in the womb has become undeniable. The age of ultrasound has punctured the comforting myth of abortion that it doesn’t really kill a person. The old claims of abortion advocates that a fetus is just a clump of cells have been exposed as ignorant superstition. The power of such illusions wanes as we watch our babies dance around in the womb and when we post in utero pictures on the fridge. As Caitlin Flanagan recently observed in The Atlantic, “The argument against [abortion] is a picture.” But as her writing also demonstrates, the increased visibility of life in utero has not ended the argument over abortion. Flanagan’s article provides a powerful, if confused, illustration of this. Against the humanity of the developing person, Flanagan posits the horrors of illegal abortions. Restricting abortion, she suggests, means sacrificing woman’s lives to an unacceptable degree.  At first, this makes little sense. Although Flanagan writes powerfully of desperate efforts at primitive contraception and of monstrosities such as Lysol-induced abortions, her anecdotes were out of date by the time Roe v Wade was decided, and they are hopelessly anachronistic today. Reliable birth control methods are readily available and illicit abortion methods (and medical care if they go wrong for the mother as well as the child) have advanced since the days when a woman might have her womb filled with household cleaners. Flanagan is too smart to really be worried about a future surfeit of Lysol abortions. However, the irreconcilable conflict Flanagan detects between the lives of women and the lives of humans in utero makes more sense if we realize that the stakes for women are seen as including not just life and death, but also self-determination about their lives. The most coherent argument for abortion is not the claim that the developing human being in utero is not a person until the second trimester, or until the third trimester, or until birth. Rather, it is the assertion that women have an absolute right to refuse to allow their bodies to be used by another person. No one can be forced to assume the responsibility of care for someone else, so a woman has the right to violently dispose of the dependent child growing inside her womb. This argument takes no account of fetal development or viability, and it is out of step with the American mainstream, which becomes more hostile to abortion as the child grows in the womb, However, it has a logical clarity that the fuzzy middle ground on abortion lacks, and is therefore uncompromising. The fuzzy middle wants abortion available to some extent, but without accepting the full moral weight of it.  Democrats Even Agree It’s a Baby In contrast, the extreme position that has become orthodoxy in the Democratic Party begins by accepting the moral weight of abortion and ends by denying it entirely. By making the deciding point a woman’s right to violently refuse to allow her body to be used or depended upon, it accepts the moral guilt of the decision to abort, for whatever reason and at whatever point in pregnancy. As an abortionist recently admitted in The New York Times, abortion is the killing of “a developing human being.” This would seem to acknowledge the moral gravity of abortion, but because this reasoning denies that the status of the child in the womb is of any significance against the woman’s claimed right to autonomy, it devolves into shameless pro-abortion stridency—for all her rhetorical hand-wringing, the abortionist quoted above opposes all limits on her practice of ending human lives. The result of this attitude is the modern Democratic Party, which demands unlimited government-funded abortion on demand, and will sacrifice its chances in conservative states to defend this position in all of its perverse purity. Some might respond that this is merely the reverse of the position of abortion opponents, who focus on the developing human in utero to the exclusion of the woman whose body the child is using as an incubator. Perhaps the mushy, muddled middle has a point in its attempts to balance the rights of the mother and the child to reach some sort of equilibrium that increases restrictions on abortion as the baby develops in the womb. But this presumes an adversarial pitting of the rights of the mother against those of the child, a framework that need not be accepted. If the abortion debate is, as Flanagan argued, unwinnable, it is because our culture is looking at it through the wrong lens. If liberal individualism sets mother against child like this, then to Hell with liberal individualism. And pro-life Democrats may be particularly well-positioned to make the case that there can never be true social justice, or even an approximation of it, in a nation that sets the interests of parents against those of their children and therefore sanctions abortion on demand. As citizens of such a nation, we are accused by those little bodies we watch dancing around on ultrasound monitors, and by the photographs in black and white that we post on the fridge and share with friends and family. We know what we do. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/21/democratic-party-accelerates-its-purge-of-pro-lifers/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"412",412,"12 Ways Artificial Wombs Will Change The World","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-10-26"," Researchers say we’re less than a decade out from being able to improve survival rates of extremely premature babies by letting them develop inside “extracorporeal devices,” or artificial wombs. It’s already been successfully tested on eight lambs from what equates to 22-24 weeks’ human gestation (100-115 days). They developed in these “Biobags” for 28 days, but authors of the study say the Biobags could have supported them for longer. According to the study published in Nature Communications, “Animals opened their eyes, became more active, had apparently normal breathing and swallowing movements, grew wool and clearly occupied a greater proportion of space within the bags.”  “The whole idea is to support normal development; to re-create everything that the mother does in every way that we can to support normal fetal development and maturation,” said Alan Flake, a fetal surgeon who led the study at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Flake told NPR he hopes to test the device on premature infants within three to five years, but that they don’t plan on pushing viability back any farther than about five months’ gestation. Yet someone is bound to do it eventually. While this technology holds much promise for premature babies, we should take the meantime to think through the potential ramifications. I’ve drawn on the expertise of several ethicists and writers to explore the ways in which artificial wombs could impact reproduction and our society. They are not all equally plausible, but nevertheless we must consider these potential outcomes with care. Technology is not to be feared, but the vast capacity of humans to use it for evil is important to guard against. Some of these potentialities will be dystopian; this is not to inspire fear of the future, but a wariness that as man’s power over nature increases, his ability to love and care for his fellow man is bound up with the ability to abuse and exploit him. 1. ‘Viability’ Unravels Current Abortion Doctrine “Up to now, we’ve been either born or not born. This would be halfway born, or something like that,” bioethicist Dena Davis of Lehigh University told NPR. Biobags would “blur the line” between a “fetus” and a “baby,” necessitating an overhaul of abortion law.  I posed the dilemma to Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel at Americans United for Life. He said that, “In the court’s formulation of abortion doctrine, it [being ‘born’] mean’s ‘term.’ But according to the laws regarding fetal homicide, unlawful death, and fetal injury, ‘Being born’ means ‘outside’ [the womb] without regard to gestational age.” In short, it seems artificial wombs would force the law the line up with itself. The legal definition of viability already varies slightly from state to state. But the availability of an artificial womb, and its potential capacity to push viability back far earlier than five months, would further complicate the matter. “I think one question will be, if you have an available artificial womb…can the law treat the child as viable?” asked Forsythe. Moreover, does the mere fact that artificial womb technology can save an extremely premature baby mean that all babies of AWT-viable age should be protected from abortion? Complicating matters is that not just the artificial womb must exist, but the technology to evacuate the baby in a manner that is relatively safe for the mother (from here I will include this in my definition of AWT). “[Supreme Court] justices have debated viability and have been more or less frank about how arbitrary the law of viability was,” Forsythe explained, referring to the fact that Roe v. Wade banned elective abortion at the point of viability. “If the court was to abandon the viability rule, it would substantially weaken the abortion doctrine. The pro-abortion justices think that viability is the only safe harbor for them.”  Stephen G. Gilles, a law professor at Quinnipiac University School of Law, says the concept of viability is in question, not just the gestational age at which it is set. “A careful reading of Roe and [companion Supreme Court case] Casey strongly suggests that the Court has in mind a definition of viability as ‘whenever the fetus has developed enough that it can survive outside any womb,’ not simply ‘outside its mother’s womb,’ he wrote via email. However, he allows the possibility that “the literal language about ‘artificial aid’ could be stretched to cover artificial wombs.” As it stands, the ban at viability is rendered virtually unenforceable by a generous definition of “the health of the mother” as defined in Doe v. Bolton, which is often interpreted to include “emotional” health. So in some states, a woman who is severely distressed by the idea of having a child is legally permitted an abortion. If this definition is not reformed, any changes to the legal understanding of viability will have minimal impact. Gilles, however, is “fairly confident” that when it comes down to it, the Supreme Court will rule that “significant health risks,” as phrased in Casey, must be “serious risks to physical or mental health.” The lamb study’s authors expect artificial wombs to initially help save human preemies around 22-24 weeks of gestation, but eventual advancements could push viability outside the mother’s womb earlier. Remember, however, that roughly 90 percent of all abortions are done in the first trimester, which is well beyond AWT’s supposed capability ten years out. Forsythe ultimately thinks “The political scenario is going to be more important than the technology…banning partial birth abortion had a big impact on public opinion, broader than the legal impact. Maybe the notion of artificial wombs will have a similar impact on public opinion than on the law per se.” 2. Changing Jurisprudence on Bodily Autonomy The abortion battle brought on by AWT inevitably opens the debate on bodily autonomy. Abortion advocates often argue “A woman shouldn’t be ‘forced’ to carry a child to term.” It’s her body, her choice. Gilles maintains in a University of Richmond Law Review article that, according to Roe and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, “The right to elective abortion will continue to apply to fetuses that are not yet developmentally viable-even though these fetuses can be rescued” with artificial womb technology. As long as these rulings stand, the use of AWT to rescue fetuses turns on whether a woman has the right to “terminative abortion” or “evacuative abortion.” Indeed, AWT has forced abortion extremists into the sinister admission that abortion is not about bodily autonomy, but the right to not beget a child. That womb tech could curtail the ability of a woman to destroy the human life within her is “terrifying,” according to I. Glenn Cohen, a bioethicist at Harvard Law School. In other words, as Margot Cleveland observed, pro-abortion extremists “want the right to a dead baby.” AWT poses another question: if the preborn human’s right to life and to not sustain bodily harm were to finally be codified, should courts order the removal of preborn babies from damaging circumstances? I posed a hypothetical scenario to Paige Cunningham, executive director for the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity: Should a court order the extraction of a preborn baby from a meth-addicted mother? Does the welfare of the child compel government to override “my body, my choice?” Does the welfare of the child compel government to override ‘my body, my choice?’ Cunningham says even assuming constitutional rights for the preborn “is a huge stretch,” especially considering the legal principle of battery. Even though courts have ordered C-sections on non-consenting patients, only two cases have been reviewed by an appellate court, and only one contained a “maternal-fetal conflict.” That was the 1990 case of Angela Carder, a pregnant woman facing imminent death from cancer. The trial court ruled that extracting her 26-week-old fetus was constitutional based on the compelling interest of the state in the welfare of the fetus. But the upper court vacated this decision due to lack of consent from the mother, stating that, “It would be an extraordinary case indeed in which a court might ever be justified in overriding the patient’s wishes and authorizing a major surgical procedure such as a caesarean section.” Of course, governments could establish incentive programs for drug-addicted women to have their children extracted. A county in Tennessee is facing a federal lawsuit over reducing jail time for women who consent to sterilization. Despite the risk of creating perverse incentives, such initiatives might save babies of drug-addicted mothers from great harm. 3. Preborn Orphanages Gilles sums up the problem this way in his aforementioned article: “Suppose that a state sought to protect these rescuable fetuses by enacting legislation prohibiting fetus-killing abortion methods, and providing AW [artificial wombs] at the state’s expense to any woman who chose to terminate her pregnancy…If the right to elective abortion includes a specific right to ensure the death of the pre-viable fetus, such a ‘fetal-rescue program’ would plainly be unconstitutional.” AWT will push society to decide just how valuable a human life really is. But if courts rule that women do not have the right to a dead fetus, then more babies will be saved from destruction, but at great potential monetary cost to taxpayers. Artificial womb “orphanages” or “preborn care centers” would either be government-run or -subsidized. Certainly in the technology’s nascence, costs will dwarf the typical cost of a Medicaid birth of $9,131. Gilles maintains that for any state laws preventing terminative abortion to be upheld under the current legal regime, the state would have to pay for “the presumably high costs” of AWT anyway. Requiring women to bear the cost of AWT would prevent many women from getting abortions, and thus fail the current Supreme Court “undue burden” standard. On the ethical front, AWT will push society to decide just how valuable a human life really is. From a societal vantage point, the rise of womb tech may degrade the bond between mother and child and the moral responsibility parents are supposed to feel toward their children. If life gets rough, even women who morally oppose terminative abortion may find “abandonment” an attractive option. Choosing adoption at birth could be less painful this way, and may be worth the risks of undergoing surgery. Someday, the number of abandoned babies might surpass current abortion numbers. 4. Reducing the Use of Surrogates Advanced AWT would likely impact the surrogacy industry. “No doubt that is a possibility, but the problems with surrogacy are not only with the use of women’s bodies” wrote Matthew Eppinette, executive director of the Center for Bioethics and Culture, in an email. “We would still be faced with pregnancy contracts [and] the commodification of human life, other issues that would arise in the exchange of money for children, and more. In short, the prospect of using artificial wombs from conception onward brings the specter of the manufacture of children to reality in a whole new way.” It may happen gradually as prices and regulation of the new tech could initially favor the more old-fashioned way of growing babies. But eventually, it’s not unreasonable to expect a rapid decline in surrogacy, especially if public and legal opinion shifts to seeing surrogacy as exploitive of women (using them as “breeders”), but AWT as essentially being victimless. As Cunningham noted, “parental choice” is highly valued in our society, propping the door open to convenience-based decisions such as using an artificial womb. ‘The prospect of using artificial wombs from conception onward brings the specter of the manufacture of children to reality in a whole new way.’ Ronald Bailey, who authored the book “Liberation Biology: The Moral and Scientific Case for the Biotech Revolution,” highly doubts artificial wombs will affect reproductive choices much. “I think AWT won’t be used that frequently, but in cases where women can’t carry a baby to term, or has some sort of a womb insufficiency. I think it will be a very rare technology, used in very specific, very rare cases,” he said. “My preference would be to regularize and make surrogacy more available… If they’re volunteering to do it, who am I to get in the way of it?” Bailey pointed to the hysteria over the first test-tube baby and predictions of widespread parental alienation that haven’t materialized as evidence that “bioconservatives” tend to exaggerate the consequences of new technology. Still, some would argue for widespread use of AWT by the state using the legal reasoning in Roe and Casey that the state has an interest in protecting life or “potential life.” If so, pro-life states such as Louisiana might ban terminative abortion and institute a program to make AWT widely available for women who choose “evacuative abortion.” 5. More Infant Adoptions If women who would have aborted choose to have their babies extricated and placed in artificial wombs, the number of adoptable babies would increase. As of 2010, more than 54,000 children, mostly babies (as this number excludes adoptions out of foster care) were adopted, putting the rate of abortion 23 times higher than the rate of adoption. That said, adoption fees for AWT babies will likely start out extremely high to cover the cost of preborn care to the point of “birth” or adoption, (probably much higher than the $38,000 to adopt a newborn in the U.S. currently) which could curtail the aspirations of adoptive parents. On a more somber note, this might cause a potential decline in adopting foster care children, since more babies will be available for adoption straight from the hospital. On the other hand, the “supply” of parents have “the heart” or fortitude it takes to adopt children from broken homes is likely limited regardless of technology. Accordingly, womb tech may hardly influence the rate of adoption out of foster care. 6. Rights for Fathers of the Preborn It’s also possible that the rate of single fathers could increase. Where a woman might once have gotten a surgical abortion, that baby could now be given to “the system.” Who has primary rights to the baby after an evacuative abortion? Would the father now have an opportunity to step up and care for his child? ‘The way to ensure the father doesn’t get involved is to ensure the fetus dies.’ Many fathers already want to father a baby the mother wants to abort. The founder of the Center for Urban Families, Jo Jones, said regarding the women he had previously directed to prenatal care and drug treatment programs, that in many cases, “The guys who got them pregnant were around, and they wanted to be involved.” But “the notion of the nurturing value of men, as contributors to their families or communities” is an idea society has yet to fully embrace. “I don’t think that father’s rights will be enhanced [with AWT] unless the mother truly wants to give up the baby,” Forsythe said. “The courts have said that she’s got the control vis a vis the father at any point of pregnancy.” Notably, laws in Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma that permit husbands to sue to stop an abortion are currently tied up in courts and opponents expect them to be overturned. The recent legal battle between Sofia Vergara and her ex-husband Nick Loeb over the fate of their two frozen embryos also demonstrates the difficulty in asserting a father’s rights pre-birth, even when the mother’s autonomy is not threatened. As Forsythe pointed out, if a mother is determined to prevent a father seeking custody of her biological child, “The way to ensure the father doesn’t get involved is to ensure the fetus dies.” 7. Changing Rules for Frozen Embryos Gilles argues AWT will affect laws regarding cryopreserved embryos, allowing states to set time limits for gestating the embryos (since it is unknown if there is a point at which frozen embryos are no longer viable), prevent their destruction, and grant custody of embryos to the state should the biological parents stop paying for their storage, allowing the state to search for willing parties to gestate the embryos. This is based on the premise, found in Casey, that, “The state has a ‘profound interest’ in protecting all postconception life.” Gilles argues that since AWT would grant the ability to effectively end a pregnancy without killing the baby, it allows the state interest in protecting life to prevail over the woman’s “protected liberty,” making bans on terminative abortion constitutional even under the current legal regime. If that is so, Gilles reasons that, “The state’s interest in the cryopreserved embryo is on par with its interest in the pre-viable fetus,” especially since the physical burden of pregnancy does not exist in the case of frozen embryos. “It is a foregone conclusion,” he writes, “that a state law forbidding the destruction of cryopreserved embryos is constitutional.” Indeed, “The very fact that cryopreserved embryos are deliberately created strengthens the case for forbidding the woman to destroy them or prevent the state from rescuing them.” 8. Baby Mills Dystopian as it sounds, it wouldn’t be that big a leap from state-sponsored ectogenesis—the growth of an organism in an artificial environment—of frozen embryos to “baby mills.” A permissive approach to ectogenesis could eventually lead to centers that create and mature humans to term for commissioning couples or general adoption. If we already create and destroy human embryos merely for the sake of science, then the argument against creating life, in addition to fostering abandoned life, is not very convincing to the secular public, especially if it uses one or both of the eggs or sperm from commissioning couples. The chance of either the legality of baby mills or even the government financing thereof increases if the natural population replacement rate continues below 2.1 and immigration cannot supply the deficit. The U.S. replacement rate was at 1.8 in 2013 and is still below replacement level. That baby mills might arise on the black market to meet the demand of infertile couples isn’t out of the question either. The infamous Nazi eugenics program indicates that man’s capacity to use science for evil, particularly through the power of the state, is a real threat. This is one of the “worst case scenarios” so-called bioconservatives often discuss, which the more libertarian-minded individuals, like Bailey, sweep aside as far-fetched dramatizations. Cunningham says considering these types of scenarios is useful for risk assessment. By considering possible outcomes, we can erect safeguards to ensure that the worst does not happen. The infamous Nazi eugenics program indicates that man’s capacity to use science for evil, particularly through the power of the state, is a real threat. Cunningham says technology follows a pattern, going from novel, to ordinary, to expected. She gives the example of the recent “three-parent embryo” breakthrough, meant to eliminate mitochondrial diseases. But not long after this development, scientists announced they would use the technique to rejuvenate the eggs of women of advanced maternal age. Euthanasia has followed this pattern in Belgium and the Netherlands: where once it was only for the terminally ill or incurable physical suffering of adults, now it extends to otherwise healthy people suffering “mental anguish,” even sexual assault victims, minors, and in Belgium’s case, even minors with disabilities. And a 2010 report stated that nearly a third of patients euthanized in the Flanders region of Belgium did not give explicit consent to be killed. Our waltz with womb technology could have us twirling at the top of a gentle, but slippery slope. 9. Disposable Babies for Study and Tissue Harvesting What’s at the bottom of that slope? How about “fetus farms”? The Center for Medical Progress made headlines in recent years exposing how Planned Parenthood and Stem Express trafficked the body parts of aborted fetuses, supposedly destined for scientific purposes. How much more valuable would an artificial womb be to that end? ‘The creation, use, and destruction of human life at its very earliest stages seems to now be simply a routine, unremarkable aspect of science.’ Eppinette sees human life grown in the lab as a point of concern right now, not just in the future. The specter of lab-grown fetuses thus looms even larger: “We already see the amount of time that embryos are developing in the lab being extended” from 9 to 13 days. Eppinette pointed out that at least 130 embryos were recently destroyed in testing gene editing here in the United States. “The creation, use, and destruction of human life at its very earliest stages seems to now be simply a routine, unremarkable aspect of science,” he wrote. I asked Eppinette if he saw organ harvesting as a potential motive for lab-grown fetuses. He pointed me to a 2009 article from The Daily Mail reporting on the call of some scientists to use aborted fetuses to make up for the organ donor shortage. A LifeNews article from 2015 discussed the ongoing research into organ transplants from aborted babies at Ganogen, Inc., which reportedly receives fetal remains from Stem Express. In 2015 they used “microsurgery” to implant a kidney from an aborted fetus into a rat, which survived four months. Ganogen’s CEO told Medical Daily, “Our long-term goal is indeed to have these organs ready for transplant into human patients.” “I don’t think that the tech will evolve that way [for disposable fetuses], because of the other wonderful technology for induced pluripotent stem cells…[with AWT] you would have a fetus, but its immune system would not be compatible with donor,” Bailey says. Cell reprogramming tech such as iPSC and Tissue Nanotransfection could greatly reduce the need for donor organs, but not eliminate it entirely. Overcoming the expected immune rejection of donor organs is proving a challenge, particularly in the case where a tiny, immature organ, such as that from an aborted fetus, would be matured inside another mammal. The long-term, ethically sound solution to organ shortages is to use therapeutic cloning to create individual organs in a lab, but scientists are still a ways off from achieving this goal. 10. Psychological Damage to AWT Children Commodification and the degradation of the intimate organic bond between mother and child may have significant negative consequences for children. Not being nurtured naturally in his or her mother’s womb could result in some level of trauma to child. At present we have no way of knowing for sure, but we do know that critical developments happen during the nine months in a mother’s womb that go beyond just physical maturation. Prenatal epigenetics studies how environmental factors in pregnancy affect gene expression, the physiological characteristics that compose a large part of an individual’s identity. A baby hears his mother’s heartbeat, learns to distinguish his mother’s voice and even her language from foreign ones, shows a partiality to face-like shapes, and may even poke back at mom and dad when poked. The authors of the lamb study state the clinical device would allow parents to be connected with their babies, including ultrasound, a darkfield camera allowing real-time visualization, and “the ability to play maternal heart and abdominal sounds.” Flake’s goal to recreate everything the mother would do is admirable, but bioethicists who value the mother-child bond, like Eppinette and Cunningham, doubt that the nurturing environment of the organic womb could be replicated in all its richness and complexity, especially in initial stages. And of course those beta versions would produce damaged children ostensibly on their way to reducing these problems. 11. Increased Social Tension and Prejudice CRISPR has made gene editing possible. Altough the ability to change traits like hair and eye color is still a ways off, the convergence of CRISPR and artificial womb tech could eventually bring “Gattaca”-like ramifications. These children might view themselves as unworthy of the sacrifice and nurture of organic pregnancy. If we assume that developing a gene-edited embryo is preferably done completely in the lab instead of implanting in a real woman’s uterus, an environment that isn’t 100 percent controlled, then many, perhaps most, of the babies matured in womb tech would be “designer babies.” As in the world of “Gattaca,” privilege for designer humans and prejudice against organic humans could result, producing a caste system. Conversely, depending on restrictions to gene editing, the opposite could result: children matured in womb tech might generally be viewed as the almost-disposables of society. Prejudice could be compounded by severe racial disparities among AWT children. Currently, abortions disproportionately kill black babies, and such ratios could transfer to “abandoned” AWT children. Indeed, these children might view themselves as unworthy of the sacrifice and nurture of organic pregnancy, as a burden shrugged off by a mother who, a generation or two previous, would’ve obtained a terminative abortion. The effects of this on a child’s psyche could be immense, even if the rest of society views him equitably, of which there is no guarantee. 12. Degradation of the Organic Family Unit Certainly government-sponsored baby mills would put society a step closer to a world where words like “family,” “mother,” and “father” are anachronisms. It could start with the first nine months, but why not keep these children through kindergarten before releasing them to a family unit, just to make sure they have a firm foundation and have begun to grasp the right ideas? Why not increase the requirements for parents and decrease compensation, so children stay under state care longer while awaiting adoption? With AWT, separating parents and offspring will be even easier and could happen even sooner in the life of the child. Totalitarian governments seek to drive a wedge between parents and children, allowing for greater control to mold the next generation. With AWT, separating parents and offspring will be even easier and could happen even sooner in the life of the child. But this is more a reason to fear the power of government rather than the technology itself. Nevertheless, the future of womb tech could easily fit the current trend of degrading the organic family. The commercial use of womb tech could compound the existing alienating effects of third-party reproduction. Even the increased opportunity for women to abandon their babies would weaken family bonds, even if AWT provided previously unrecognized opportunities for fathers to step up. We could see more premature babies survive and more babies adopted instead of destroyed, but also a greater commodification of children. Eppinette cut to the fundamental questions: “What are the limits to shaping and forming children? What is the line between shaping and forming children on the one hand, and designing and manufacturing them on the other? Where is the space to have this conversation, when the overriding factor is cost vs. benefits? The argument typically begins with, ‘this will relieve so much suffering.’ But it doesn’t end there. Soon it becomes, ‘We can control this rather than leaving it to chance. We can improve this. We should improve this. We must improve this.’ And so on.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/26/12-ways-artificial-wombs-will-change-world/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"413",413,"Killing Babies Isn’t ‘Stabilizing Treatment,’ But The Lying Biden Administration Already Knows That","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-08-04"," Treating pregnant women’s “emergency medical conditions” never requires ER doctors to perform illegal abortions. The Biden administration’s claims to the contrary represent a dishonest attempt to reinject federal courts into state abortion policy following the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. 



Less than a week after pro-life medical associations sued the Biden administration in a federal court in Texas over its attempt to use the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to force emergency room doctors to perform abortions in violation of state law, Biden’s Department of Justice filed suit against Idaho claiming that state’s abortion ban violates the EMTALA. 



The EMTALA, which Congress passed in 1986, bans “patient dumping,” wherein hospital emergency rooms turn patients away because of an inability to pay. Under the EMTALA, hospitals that receive Medicare funding and operate emergency rooms must “provide a medical screening examination” “regardless of an individual’s ability to pay.” The law then requires hospitals “to provide stabilizing treatment for patients” with an “emergency medical condition.”



In mid-July, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra issued a statement announcing that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had issued a new memorandum to Medicare service providers purporting to explain the mandates of EMTALA “in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.” 



In its supposed explanatory memorandum, the CMS claimed that an abortion may be the “stabilizing treatment” required under the EMTALA when a pregnant woman presents at an emergency department with a potential “emergency medical condition,” such as an “ectopic pregnancy, complications of pregnancy loss, or emergent hypertensive disorders, such as preeclampsia with severe features.” The Biden administration then advised that if “a state law prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life of the pregnant [woman] — or draws the exception more narrowly than EMTALA’s emergency medical condition definition — that state law is preempted,” meaning trumped by federal law.



Two days after the release of Becerra’s statement and the CMS memorandum, Texas sued the Biden administration in a federal court, challenging the memorandum on numerous grounds, including that it exceeded the CMS’s authority and violated the Spending Clause of the Constitution and the 10th Amendment. Last Thursday, Texas filed an amendment complaint that added as plaintiffs the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists (AAPLOG) and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations. The amendment complaint alleges similar legal theories but added several significant allegations.



For instance, the amendment complaint highlights portions of the CMS memorandum that suggest ER physicians will violate the EMTALA if they fail to provide a surgical abortion in response to women presenting with an incomplete medical abortion, even in cases “where the unborn child is still living and may still be preserved.” The CMS’s guidance under this scenario would, in effect, require ER doctors to provide illegal elective abortions, the amended complaint alleges. Further, as stressed in the amended complaint, the “AAPLOG has issued several position statements and medical practice bulletins on situations threatening the life of the mother and the need to not conflate legitimate treatments provided in such circumstances with abortion provided in broader circumstances.”



While the amended complaint filed in Texas does not detail those circumstances, shortly after the CMS issued its memorandum, The Federalist excerpted from those position statements, medical practice bulletins, and other pro-life obstetrician and gynecologist resources, explaining that “medical treatment of a pregnant mother and her child seeks to protect the life and health of both patients, where possible,” while “the purpose of abortion is to cause the death of one of the patients, namely the unborn child.” “An abortion procedure is not the same thing as treatment for an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage management,” the guidance makes clear, with the treatment for “an ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy outside of the uterus,” being vastly different than an elective abortion. 



Moreover, “while the treatments for miscarriage or pregnancy loss, may sometimes ‘be the same as those for abortion (e.g., dilation and suction or misoprostol or, uncommonly, a combination of mifepristone/misoprostol), the purpose is vastly different, i.e., removing an already dead fetus versus causing the death of a fetus.’” Likewise, treating “preeclampsia with severe features,” another example provided to justify an abortion, rarely occurs prior to viability, allowing the ER physician to treat the mother’s emergency medical condition while attempting to also save the unborn baby’s life.



Abortion is also not medically necessary to treat placenta previa, which “is a condition in which the placenta covers the cervix, making a vaginal delivery impossible due to the possibility of life-threatening hemorrhage if labor occurs.” As AAPLOG notes, placenta previa is “frequently diagnosed in pregnancy on ultrasound around 20 weeks,” but approximately 90% of these will resolve on their own before delivery.” Further, “if significant hemorrhage occurs due to a placenta previa (which again is so rare prior to viability that no incidence is even reported), the patient should be taken for an emergency C-section which is the most expedient way to get her bleeding under control.” In fact, “it would be medically dangerous and irresponsible to try to do an abortion since any instrumentation through the cervix would pierce the placenta and cause immediate massive bleeding.” Further, “an abortion would take significantly longer in this case and be much risker for the mother.”



Notwithstanding these medical facts, the Biden administration posits in its guidance that abortions are needed to stabilize patients — but with no evidence that any pregnant woman has been, or would be, denied stabilizing treatment and with no evidence that an abortion would be the only way to stabilize the patient. Further, in arguing an abortion may be required “stabilizing treatment,” the Biden administration ignores that the EMTALA requires the stabilization of the second “patient,” which is defined by the statute to include the “unborn child.” In fact, the EMTALA stressed “the need to protect the ‘unborn child’ four times” within the statutory text. 



The EMTALA’s mandate that ER physicians attempt to stabilize unborn babies means that the health care provider cannot disregard the unborn baby’s life in providing emergency medical treatment. And, as the amended complaint stressed, “it is obvious that abortion does not stabilize the unborn child from serious jeopardy faced by an emergency medical condition, nor does it preserve the life or health of an unborn child.”



While the DOJ has not yet answered Texas’s amended complaint, on Tuesday the Biden administration filed suit in an Idaho federal court arguing that Idaho’s abortion ban violates the EMTALA. 



Idaho bans “abortion,” which is defined by statute to mean intentionally terminating a “clinically diagnosable pregnancy of a woman with knowledge that the termination by those means will, with reasonable likelihood, cause the death of the unborn child.” A physician who performs an abortion may avoid liability, however, if “[t]he physician determined, in his good faith medical judgment and based on the facts known to the physician at the time, that the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.” Idaho also provides an exception for doctors who perform abortions on victims of rape or incest. 



In its lawsuit against Idaho, the Biden administration alleges that under the state’s law, it is illegal for doctors to perform an abortion to “stabilize” women facing a medical emergency. Thus, the DOJ’s complaint maintains that Idaho’s abortion ban violates the EMTALA.



It will be some time before the federal courts rule on the Texas and Idaho cases, although the DOJ will likely seek a preliminary injunction in Idaho, hoping to put an immediate halt on that state’s abortion ban to the extent it applies in emergency rooms. But in deciding whether to grant the Biden administration a preliminary injunction, and then later in ruling on whether the EMTALA overrides state abortion law, the courts will need to first sort through the rhetoric and reach the reality of when an abortion may or may not be required to “stabilize” a pregnant woman. 



And contrary to the Biden administration’s narrative, the answer to that question is “never,” because treating pregnancy loss and ectopic pregnancies are not abortions, and treating other “emergency medical conditions” can be done while also attempting to stabilize the unborn baby — something required under the EMTALA. 



For those few sad circumstances where both patients cannot be stabilized, there is also no conflict because it is also not an abortion to treat the mother, even if the unborn baby does not survive. Rather, an abortion is the intentional killing of an unborn child. But the Biden administration already knows that.

"414",414,"The United States Has A Femicide Problem","Lu","Rachel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-09-18"," The racist Right is at it again, or so we’re meant to believe. This time, Asian Americans are in the crosshairs, as pro-lifers lean on vicious stereotypes in an effort to bolster their assault on reproductive choice. That at any rate is the argument put forward by David Chiu, the San Francisco supervisor whose resolution to oppose bans on sex-selective abortion passed on Tuesday. Chiu contends there is absolutely no evidence that sex-selective abortion is a problem in the United States, and that arguments to the contrary are grounded in racial stereotypes. HuffPo’s Lydia O’Connor, Slate’s Emily Bazelon, Mother Jones’ Molly Redden, and Reason’s Emily Nolan Brown have joined in the effort to spread the word. Sex selective abortion isn’t a problem in the United States! It’s all just a racist ploy.  There’s just one problem with this argument. Sex-selective abortion does happen here, and the evidence has been bolstered by, ironically, the very study Chiu and others have cited as their primary source of data. Another day, another reminder that maybe somebody (at least an intern?) should actually read the study before we all get on our high horses about it. First, Some Background Let’s back up, for those who are unfamiliar with this controversy. Sex-selective abortion means killing your unborn child because he or (more commonly) she is not the sex you prefer. This has been widespread in China through the decades of the one-child policy and, as a result, the 2010 Chinese census revealed that men outnumber women in China by 34 million. That’s a huge social problem. It’s also a terrible tragedy, when you consider that it points to millions of babies who were killed or abandoned by their parents simply because they were girls. Among those study participants who were carrying girls, 89 percent chose to abort. China isn’t the only country where this happens. In India and Singapore, sex-selective abortion is also regularly used to express a preference for sons over daughters. Great Britain has only recently admitted it needs to address this problem, especially among its Asian population. Women say they are shamed for having too many daughters, and feel pressure from extended family to abort and save resources for a much-desired son. The Brits haven’t come up with a satisfactory solution, but at least they’re thinking about it. Here in the United States, we’re still struggling through the denial phase. The evidence is already before us that sex-selective abortion does happen here. Sunita Puri published a study in 2011 in which she interviewed 65 Indian immigrant women, all of whom had pursued fetal sex selection. Her study revealed that the women, like so many mothers abroad, had been shamed and sometimes abused for conceiving too many girls, and that nearly half of them had aborted daughters in the past. Among those study participants who were carrying girls, 89 percent chose to abort.  Those are some pretty sobering numbers, but then again, 65 women make for a small sample. Demographic data shows us the big picture, and it does bear out Puri’s claims, provided you know where to look. This is what Douglas Almond and Lena Edlund found in their 2008 study of birth ratios among American-born offspring of foreign-born Chinese, Korean, and Indian parents. First-born Asian children, Almond and Edlund found, showed normal sex ratios, with about 106 girls for every 100 boys. When the firstborn child was a daughter, sex ratios for second births were skewed a bit towards boys. But the really significant finding concerned third births in families who already had two daughters. Among these children, there were 151 boys for every 100 girls. Almond and Edlund drew the obvious conclusion: when expecting for the third time, a significant number of Asian parents preferred an abortion to a third daughter. Killed for the Crime of Being Female These numbers have been cited many times by pro-life activists in their push to ban sex-selective abortion, which is now illegal in eight states. Everyone recognizes that enforcement is difficult in a country that mostly embraces abortion on demand. Nevertheless, a majority of Americans are rightly offended by the notion that the unborn can legally be killed simply for the crime of being girls. This has been a fairly successful line of argument for pro-lifers, which predictably has NARAL supporters scrambling for an adequate response. Pro-abortion feminists find themselves in an uncomfortable position when backing up the right of patriarchal cultures to reject girls. Pro-abortion feminists find themselves in an uncomfortable position when backing up the right of patriarchal cultures to reject girls. Enter this study, published this year out of the University of Chicago’s International Human Rights Clinic. Widely hailed as the new, definitive word on sex-selective abortion, its data sets are larger and more recent than those used by Almond and Eklund. It also wears its political agenda on its sleeve, presenting a list of “myths” (used by the pro-life movement to justify laws against sex-selective abortion) and replacing them with “facts” (meant to show that such laws are unnecessary).  The presentation builds to “Myth #6” (“The primary motivation behind laws banning sex-selective abortion in the United States is to prevent gender-based discrimination”) which is replaced by “Fact #6” (“Restricting access to abortion is the primary motivation for sex-selective abortion bans.”) It’s refreshing they are so obvious about their allegiances. Why muddy the waters with pretensions to academic detachment when abortion rights are on the line? Let’s cut to the chase, though, and ask what is obviously the most important question: is sex-selective abortion happening in the United States? If not, that lends at least some support to the claims of Chiu and others that pro-lifers are scare-mongering and leaning on inapplicable racial stereotypes. Has this new study really shown that Almond and Eklund’s conclusions were wrong or out of date? You’d certainly think so to read the many write-ups from HuffPo, Slate, Mother Jones, or Reason. Study Confirms Pro-Life Argument For the skeptical, though, I advise pulling up the study yourself and flashing ahead to page 16, where the authors admit: “Our study of pooled ACS data confirms Almond and Edlund’s study with regard to the third births of foreign-born Chinese, Indian and Korean families that have already given birth to two girls.” Wait, what? This wonderful, up-to-date study confirms the very point that was most critical to the pro-life argument all along? So… then… what are all these pro-choice advocates so excited about? It’s got to be frustrating when you bring together a lot of important-sounding organizations to do a big, splashy study, and it ends up confirming the piece of data that most sticks in your craw. It’s possible they just didn’t read the study closely. And, in fairness, the authors pulled a bit of a fast one on their journalistic admirers by burying the single most important piece of information in a forest of far-less-relevant facts, graphs, and meanderings about methodology. Amazingly, they don’t even bother to tell us what sex ratio they found for the single most critical, two-daughter case. Did they figure people wouldn’t be interested in that niggling little number? Or do they just prefer to hide unwelcome data in plain sight by shining a bright spotlight on those statistics that are friendlier to their political agenda? It’s a neat little bit of misdirection. Move over, David Copperfield. Now, in a way, I can sympathize. It’s got to be frustrating when you bring together a lot of important-sounding organizations to do a big, splashy study, and it ends up confirming the piece of data that most sticks in your craw. But now that we’ve descended to throwing around accusations of racism, I think the truth should be spoken. Asian-born American parents with two daughters are significantly more likely to have a son for their third child. Combined with Puri’s qualitative study, and ample data confirming the use of sex-selective abortion in some Asian cultures, that constitutes strong evidence that it also happens here in the United States. My compliments to the University of Chicago for confirming this with their new, comprehensive study. Your Move, Abortion-Lovers It’s up to the pro-choice movement where they want to take the argument from here. They could, with Allison Benedikt, declare it doesn’t matter and it’s parents’ business if they want to kill their unborn daughters. They could admit that sex-selective abortion is happening and is tragic, but focus their attention on (admittedly difficult) challenges of enforcement. (China has long had laws against sex-selective abortion. We can see how that’s worked out.) Pro-choicers could bite the bullet and suggest that even if sex-selective abortion happens and is sort of distasteful, maybe a few hundred or thousand aborted daughters either way just aren’t that big of a deal. Or, they could take refuge in that small bit of cover offered by sperm sorting and other non-abortive methods of sex-selection. Bazelon gestures towards this latter strategy when she claims that sex ratios for Asian babies are skewed only at conception and not at birth. Following her links, I got to this study, which doesn’t at all back up her statement (that woman seriously needs more interns), but does at least consider the possibility that other factors besides abortion might play some role in explaining the suspicious sex ratios. The author, Jason Abreyava, still points to sex-selective abortion as “the most logical” primary explanation for the data. But, based on demographic data alone, we can’t absolutely prove that Asian-born parents are aborting their daughters out of a preference for sons. It just seems overwhelmingly likely. America is a big country and the relevant sub-cultures are fairly small. So pro-choicers could bite the bullet and suggest that even if sex-selective abortion happens and is sort of distasteful, maybe a few hundred or thousand aborted daughters either way just aren’t that big of a deal? Hey, I’m just laying out your options, if you happen to be a pro-choice feminist. In any case, what we shouldn’t permit is further deception about what the data is really saying. Even less should we permit disingenuous attempts to dismiss the struggle against femicide as racist or misogynistic. Insofar as non-Asian cultures practice sex-selective abortion (which, sometimes, they do) that is of course equally offensive, and bans on sex-selective abortion apply equally to all ethnic groups, and also to parents who kill unborn sons out of a preference for daughters. But when pro-lifers promote these laws with arguments about Asian cultures and femicide, they’re responding to real evidence that in some Asian cultures, femicide happens. Pro-lifers aren’t looking to control women. They’re trying to save them, and to make a clear and unambiguous statement that here in the United States, we cherish girls (just like boys!) as full human beings whose lives are worth protecting.

"415",415,"‘Unplanned’ The Book Reveals Women Who Abort Are Not All Duped","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-04-11"," Whether or not you plan on seeing the pro-life film “Unplanned,” and regardless of whether you consider yourself pro-life or pro-choice, you should consider reading the book on which it is based. Former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson’s biographical narrative about her conversion from pro-choice to pro-life is powerful, not just in illustrating how evidence can change the mind of even the most dedicated abortion devotee, but in its unique insight into the nature of front-line abortion clinic workers like herself and abortion seekers. The book is almost guaranteed to shift your perspective on one or both groups.  Some aspects of the abortion mindset she discusses are fairly easy to wrap your head around. For example, in many cases, women come in for an abortion with the mindset of “If I have this child,” as if a baby were still a potentiality. That is how Johnson described her own thought process regarding her two abortions. “What I saw,” she writes, “and by now was reinforcing in the minds of other young women as part of the Planned Parenthood organization, was that I was in a condition of pregnancy.” She confessed she suspected that keeping the pregnancy a secret from her parents was an attempt to “avoid it becoming ‘real’ for me” (p. 45). Like most women, she declined to see the ultrasound photos after the clinic workers determined how far along she was in her pregnancy. “My story. . . illustrates the complexity, the confusion, and frankly, the disconnect between behavior and values that permeates our culture,” she writes. “I spent many years counseling women whose thought patterns were not unlike my own.” Yes, the Abortion Industry Deceives Women Women who choose abortion are not monolithic, although people on both sides of the proverbial (and literal) fence often treat them as such. It is considered orthodoxy among both pro-lifers and pro-choicers that women who face unplanned pregnancies are victims, though their victimhood is framed in different ways. While pro-choicers insist they are victims of difficult circumstances, and more so of their own power of reproduction, pro-lifers say women are victims of a predatory abortion industry that has filled their heads with propaganda. I recently interviewed Johnson on my podcast, and she didn’t mince words on the length Planned Parenthood goes to narrow the scope of perceived choices for women in unplanned pregnancies. She told me no one was promoting adoption as an option before she brought in representatives from adoption agencies to train the staff on adoption counseling. “That was very looked down upon by my superiors,” she said.  Abby believes exploitation of both women and children is intrinsic to abortion: “Any time you are oppressing the rights of another person in order to uphold your own rights, that is one of the definitions of abortion. . .[abortion] can’t be separated from its exploitive nature.” It’s only logical to consider women who abort as victims of exploitation. But All Women Are Not Deceived Yet that does not mean all women are manipulated to the same extent, or that they have been deprived of their free will by cultural mores or pro-choice sloganeering. The experiences Johnson recounts in the book reveal the diversity of women who find themselves in an abortion facility, and a diversity of choices made from within it. Women who abort their children range from women who find out they are having twins and decide not to abort (not uncommon, according to Johnson), to a woman in her 36th week who offered her baby up for adoption, to much more heartbreaking accounts in which one would be hard-pressed not to consider the pregnant woman cold-hearted. Johnson recalls: The first time I ever encountered a woman seeking a late-term abortion left me shaken. She, too, was petite, but with a big, full, pregnant belly. She looked like she could give birth at any time. I happened to be filling in at the front desk when she walked in.
‘I’d like to schedule an abortion, please.’
I did a double-take. Her tone of voice was as nonchalant as if she’d just ordered a Big Mac. I ushered her to the back where we could talk privately and asked her to talk to me about why she’d come in.
‘I just found out I’m pregnant and I’ve just got to get this thing out of me. I feel like I have an alien inside me.’ I was so taken aback I was speechless. I spent some time listening and asking questions, doing an intake interview, and trying to get a handle on the real story. Though I found her perspective shocking, she seemed fully cognizant of the facts. Yet somehow she truly seemed not to have realized she was pregnant until quite recently, and no matter how far along she was, she wanted that baby aborted.
. . .An ultrasound revealed this woman’s baby was twenty-three weeks. I explained to her that abortion was not an option for her at Planned Parenthood.
She would not be thwarted in her goal. ‘Then where can I get this thing taken out of me?’ (p. 96-97) After describing the late-term abortion procedure to her in detail, Johnson remembers her reply. “Yeah, I know how it’s done. I don’t care. I’ve just got to have this abortion.”  She narrates another client case that left a distinct impression on her. Here, she details the scene as she seeks to escort a young woman into the office for her scheduled abortion: As I approached the girl’s car, she got out on one side and the friend who had accompanied her got out on the other. Her mom was standing just outside the fence calling to her, obviously in real emotional pain. The rest of the family stood in a semicircle behind the mom. I stepped up beside the girl and put my hand on her back. ‘I’ll bring you around to the back entrance. It’ll be quicker that way.’
The girl didn’t answer. The mother’s voice, through her weeping, was filled with desperation. ‘You don’t have to do this,’ she called, her voice anguished. ‘We want to help you. We can support you. You can live at home. We’ll give you money – whatever it takes! Don’t do this.’ Her mother’s pleas were so heartbreaking that my heart was pounding with the tension.
And as I stood waiting, the back door of the car opened and a little girl got out – maybe two years old. It was the daughter of the who’d come in to have the abortion! And as she stepped up beside her mother, she saw her grandmother on the other side of the fence. ‘Hey, mamá!’ she called innocently.
The grandmother wept even harder. Hanging on to the fence now as if to support herself, she cried out, ‘The baby you’re carrying will be just as beautiful as the daughter you already have! Just think if you had decided to abort her – think of all the joy she has brought into our lives. Imagine a world without her! Please – you don’t have to do this!’
. . .I escorted her inside. ‘Are you alright? Do you need to talk about this first? Are you sure this is what you want to do? Because it sounds like you’d have a lot of support from your family if you were to keep the baby.’
I am not sure what I expected, but it wasn’t what I saw next. She shrugged it off. ‘Oh, that’s just my mom,’ she said. ‘That’s how she is. I’m fine.’ (p. 118-120) The compassion Johnson feels for women in unplanned pregnancies or other difficult circumstances radiates through the whole book, even during her time at Planned Parenthood. In fact, it was her compassion that drove her, misguidedly, to continue working for Planned Parenthood for so long. It is a motivation she said other coworkers sincerely shared. Women Are Not Always Victims in Choosing Abortion The patient members of the Coalition for Life on the other side of the fence, just outside the clinic parking lot, shared that compassion and desired to extend grace and help toward even the most firmly “abortion-minded” women. Johnson credits and praises God’s grace over and over throughout the pages of “Unplanned,” particularly in revealing to her the truth about abortion. That is why Johnson’s stories of such clients should prompt readers to consider whether we’ve painted the abortion-minded with too broad a brush, whether we’ve adopted rhetoric that isn’t as accurate and precise as it should be, or limited their interpretation based on our assumptions. For instance, does “love them both” mean that women under no circumstances should ever be held accountable for illegal abortions? The common assumption that love and justice are mutually exclusive, and that women are only victims, leads many to that conclusion. While “Unplanned” doesn’t deal with those questions head-on, it does challenge us to think outside our pro-life or pro-choice boxes and to think holistically about abortion-minded women, as well as the clinic workers who facilitate their abortions. The women waiting in the clinic lobby are more complicated than any snappy line that can fit on a poster board, and Abby is living proof that the workers who interact with abortion clients aren’t necessarily hard-hearted or bent on evil. In the book, she recalled telling her husband that if every Planned Parenthood clinic employee saw what she saw in the ultrasound-guided abortion, half would quit. As with all big issues, it matters whether we establish our discourse on abortion with pie charts and slogans or with an empathetic grasp of the complexity of the set of actors in question. Each main camp on abortion pitches their policy positions as the most dignified and compassionate, as the most humanizing. Yet humanizing those actors doesn’t mean shoving them all in a victimhood box and calling it compassion and mercy. Nor does it mean making one particular person with a convenient story the standard-bearer for a whole demographic. Humanizing means learning about how real people conceive of their own choices, as shocking and repulsive or utterly heart-wrenching as they may be, or as small or big a percentage of a group they reflect. Those stories aren’t the basis for morality, as if our feelings could decide right from wrong, but they are part of the foundation of civil, truth-loving, and effective advocacy. Don’t just take a page out of “Unplanned” that’s convenient to your preconceived ideas. Take all the inconvenient ones, too.

"416",416,"VeggieTales Creator Applies His Postmodern Fairytales To False Mess Of A Video About Roe v. Wade","Krumholz","Willis","L.",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-26"," Earlier this month, Facebook prevented the pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List from running several ads. The Dispatch, one of Facebook’s fact-checkers and a Never Trump publication started by Stephen Hayes and Jonah Goldberg, had flagged the ads as false. Susan B. Anthony List’s ads said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris supported late-term abortion. The Dispatch’s convoluted fact check said this was incorrect. Yet the ads were correct, and The Dispatch was forced to offer a retraction. The damage to Susan B. Anthony List and their pro-life ad campaign, however, was already done.  Then, last week, Phil Vischer — creator of the children’s cartoon Veggie Tales — took to his videocast to talk about abortion, and introduced pastor Skye Jethani. In the video, Jethani makes several claims, some of which are highly misleading. First, Jethani says appointing pro-life justices won’t overturn Roe v. Wade because Republicans have appointed justices in the past who have turned out to be supporters of Roe on the bench. He then correctly says that reversing Roe would not make abortion illegal nationwide. He says that since about 600,000 abortions happened in the United States in the year before Roe, overturning the decision shouldn’t be the sole focus of American Christians. “Overturning Roe wouldn’t be a decisive win,” says Jethani, backing up his claim by quoting Dispatch senior editor David French. “Even if Roe is overturned, abortion will be mostly unchanged in the U.S.,” French says. Jethani then claims that Christians are “ignoring every other issue” by voting for pro-life politicians, arguing the politicians we elect don’t affect abortion and that Democrats — because they pass social programs — may do more to reduce abortions than Republicans. To back up this assertion, Jethani says during a period in the 2010s, while Texas passed abortion restrictions and Delaware “improved healthcare access for its poorest residents,” it was Delaware that saw a bigger decrease in abortions.  Jethani then says people shouldn’t only look at party platforms because abortions are falling in America after peaking in the 1980s, even falling the most under Barack Obama. Correctly, Jethani says that this has nothing to do with who was in the White House. Instead, abortions have been declining since the 1980s because fewer women are facing unplanned pregnancies. “None of the [reasons for the decline in abortion] had anything to do with Roe being overturned,” he says. Jethani finishes by pointing out that pro-lifers can do the most good in their local communities and should be active there. Jethani is correct about that. He’s also correct that broad trends have been pushing down the number of abortions in the United States since the 1980s. Ultimately, however, he’s either mostly incorrect or flat-out dishonest about everything else. The Truth About Delaware and Texas First, Jethani cherry-picks two states — Delaware and Texas — to imply that Democrats reduce abortions more than Republicans by expanding social programs. This ignores the fact that abortions are down nationally, and when all states are examined there is no pattern in which red states that passed abortion restrictions have seen a smaller decline in abortion than blue states. Texas and Delaware have different demographics, and Jethani’s comparison is uninformed at best.  Jethani’s analysis falls apart further when you dig into the details. He implies that Delaware’s “improving health-care access” targeted mothers. Jethani is talking about Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion to able-bodied childless adults. Since its inception decades ago, Medicaid has catered to expecting mothers. But Obamacare did nothing to enhance this. In fact, because Obamacare caused the federal government to foot a higher portion of the bill for expanding taxpayer-provided health care to able-bodied and childless adults, relative to Medicaid’s historic recipients such as the disabled and mothers, the disabled and mothers experienced a crowding-out effect. Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion thus harmed them. In addition, there is a direct relationship between Medicaid expansion and increased opioid deaths. On top of this, many of the “social programs” touted by Democrats increase demand for abortion because they fuel family breakdown, which fuels poverty and fatherlessness. The Medicaid expansion that Jethani so glowingly references has huge marriage penalties, which hurts family formation, as does the rest of the welfare state largely defended by the Democratic Party. Certainly, these penalties increase abortion, as plenty of abortions are caused by men who don’t want the mother to have the baby so they don’t have to provide child support. The young woman who is poor and desperate, pressured by the father of the child, and already receiving a host of government assistance, is sadly still a reality. The group of Americans originally targeted for these welfare programs — black Americans — experience both the highest rate of family breakdown and the highest abortion rates. The high abortion rate among black Americans is not explained by poverty. Rather, black American women who are receiving government health care touted by Jethani uniquely suffer from a lack of access to good health care. They disproportionately depend on Planned Parenthood, which has a profit motive to provide substandard care. Likewise, Texas’s restrictions weren’t all meant to necessarily reduce the number of abortions in Texas. Many were meant to put moral and monetary pressure on the providers of abortion. One stopped the ability to have an abortion after the baby is viable outside the womb (subject to some exceptions). Another required abortion facilities to be subjected to the same rules as other outpatient surgical centers. These weren’t draconian restrictions on abortion, they were carefully tailored laws to attempt to pass muster in the courts. That brings us to the next point. Why Roe and its Progeny Matter Jethani is utterly wrong to imply that Roe isn’t that big of a deal. Texas couldn’t pass bigger restrictions because of Roe. Indeed, Roe is so extreme that before a 1992 ruling called Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Roe meant that abortion facilities couldn’t be regulated at all. Before Casey, fetal remains were run down disposals, buildings weren’t up to code, and facilities were often dirty and dangerous. Heard of Kermit Gosnell? The sorry state of his facility was entirely a remnant of what the Supreme Court did with Roe, which took away the right of the people in each state and throughout the country to decide their own abortion laws. Jethani admits that there is “wide support for common-sense limits on abortion.” Roe completely preempts states passing these limits. As for Jethani’s critique of Republican presidents not appointing pro-life justices, he misses the point that President Trump is the most pro-life president in a lifetime, and not just according to his Supreme Court appointments. It’s true, reversing Roe wouldn’t make abortion illegal nationwide, but the point is that the states and the people would finally have agency. To imply such an outcome as inconsequential is flat-out wrong. Christians: Stop Running Cover for Democrats No, Christians shouldn’t tie themselves to the Republican Party. And no, Republicans aren’t God’s gift to America. But to equivocate the Republicans and Trump’s record to that of Democrats on the subject of abortion is farcical. Too often, self-described Christians use Christianity as a shield for leftist political arguments. Too often, Christians like French, Jethani, and Vischer minimize how awful the Democrat Party is on abortion. The most charitable explanation is that Jethani and Vischer are uninformed. Before Christians spout off on policy and politics regarding so-called “child separation” at the border, abortion, immigration, or welfare, they should try to be informed. Blasting Trump for child separation when the alternative is children being trafficked and used as tickets into America should be disqualifying. Claiming Medicaid expansion helped mothers and stopped abortion when Medicaid pre-expansion already reduced the care available for poor mothers is embarrassing.

"417",417,"Roe v. Wade‘s Millions Of Ghosts In The Cradle Haunt Us All","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-01-21"," America is broken because it is haunted. We all agree that something has gone very wrong with our nation, but we all blame different villains, which is itself a symptom of our brokenness. There have been insightful efforts at diagnosis, but too many explanations have remained superficial, presuming that we are just an election away from happy days being here again.  To understand what ails our nation, we must see the things that haunt us — the things that we don’t like to talk about or even think of. We must look at the ghosts we don’t want to see, but are tormenting us. Among the foremost of these spirits is the ghost in the cradle. It is the week of the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision requiring states to permit abortion on demand. At the time, it might have been said: forgive them, for they know not what they do. For most people in 1973, the womb was a black box; few knew much about fetal development. But we know. We excitedly share ultrasound photos via text and social media, and we stick the printouts on our fridges or display them in picture frames with “sneak peek” emblazoned on the border. We know. We have seen the moving limbs and the tiny fingers and the beating hearts. The advocates for our regime of elective abortion know, which is why they hide behind euphemisms — preferring to speak of reproductive freedom and choice, without mentioning the “A” word. Most people’s consciousnesses are not as seared as those of the zealots of “Shout Your Abortion” and similar campaigns, so, for the majority of abortion supporters, any rhetorical dodge will do if it avoids invoking the violent reality of abortion. They prefer to cover abortion in the moral haze of a necessary evil in an imperfect world, and then not think about it.  They justify abortion as the distasteful protector of the individual autonomy, personal achievement, material riches, and sexual satisfaction that our culture glorifies. But the effects of abortion are not so easily ignored. It is, of course, obvious how abortion has broken our politics. Because the Supreme Court invented a constitutional right to abortion on demand, the pro-life movement has been compelled to try to take control of the federal courts, lest these courts strike down all democratically enacted abortion restrictions. Faced with a Democratic Party that is now committed to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand until birth, many good men and women held their noses and voted Trump for the judges. The corruption of abortion goes far beyond unpalatable political choices, however; making abortion-on-demand part of the culture changes the culture. Its evil effects are systemic, as well as individual, and they do not end with the violent killing of the unborn. Our nation is haunted by what abortion does to the living. Trying to solve our problems by killing developing human beings makes us worse, individually and socially. If elective abortion seems necessary, it is because our sexual appetites exceed our willingness to care for the children who are the natural result of sex. Elective abortion is a violent form of birth control, which is used either instead of, or as a backup to, the proliferating array of modern contraceptives.  Abortion thus damages the fundamental relationships of our humanity, shattering the primeval union of mother, father, and child. Instead of the family solidarity that is foundational to human society, the begetting and bearing of new human life become a battleground of competing interests. Abortion, even as a possibility, separates mothers and fathers from their children, and each other. A regime of abortion on demand affirms a view of human sexuality as essentially selfish, and of relations between men, women, and children as fundamentally contentious. It replaces love and responsibility with selfishness and violence. America’s abortion culture sets men and women against each other. Even the justification of abortion as a private matter of female freedom implicitly relieves men of their responsibilities: why should a woman’s choice be a man’s problem? He signed up for a good time, not diapers and a minivan. Similarly, women’s workplace equality often advanced on the tacit assumption that female fertility would be suppressed to require little or no accommodation from employers. Children are considered to be a lifestyle choice, and those are not an employer’s responsibility. In each case, abortion provides a failsafe that allows men to get what they want from women with a minimum of commitment and responsibility. The effects of abortion pervade our culture, from dating and marriage to business and education. Instead of building a better culture, that encourages us to be more virtuous, abortion enables us to be more vicious and exploitative of each other. It should not surprise us, therefore, that after decades of abortion on demand, we live in a nation with cratering marriage and birth rates, and an epidemic of deadly loneliness. Abortion is not solely responsible for this, but the ghosts in the empty cradles undoubtedly haunt us. Many want to look away. But, if we are to understand the ills of our nation, then we must face them. There is a further, more dreadful, possibility, which is that the choice is between looking now or looking later. If the dead rise again for a judgment in which all secrets are revealed, then the aborted children of this nation will be waiting for us to face them. And when we look at them, and when they look at us, what excuse could we offer? Kyrie eleison. Christe eleison.

"418",418,"11 Quick Takeaways From House Hearing On Aborted Baby Parts Trafficking","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-04-21"," Abortion clinics and the businesses that purchase aborted baby parts likely conspired to violate federal laws against fetal human organ trafficking, expert witnesses at a House hearing testified yesterday. Evidence of a widespread market for unborn baby parts — down to the tongue, scalp, eyes — was introduced at a testy hearing of the House Select Panel on Infant Lives. Here are the 11 big takeaways from the hearing chaired by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, (R-TN).  1) Federal Law Prohibits Profiting Off of Aborted Baby Parts In 1993, the House passed the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 with an amendment stating, “It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce.” Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA), the abortion rights proponent who pushed the amendments, said at the time, “It would be abhorrent to allow the sale of fetal tissue and a market to be established for that sale.” Witnesses such as Catherine Glenn Foster of the Charlotte Lozier Institute testified that the law has not been enforced in the last 23 years, permitting just such a market to flourish. 2) The Basic Business Model for Aborted Baby Parts Abortion clinics supply the aborted baby parts to researchers through a “procurement business” middleman. Researchers pay some amount of money to the procurement business. The procurement business pays the abortion clinic for the human organs they supply via abortion. And the abortion clinic receives payment for the organs and tissue they obtain. Payment is permitted for “reasonable costs,” associated with securing the aborted baby parts. The procurement industry markets itself to abortion clinics as a way to improve their profitability. In a section of one procurement company brochure titled “Easy to implement program + financial profits,” the company stated that partnering with them would provide “a financial benefit to your clinic,” and was “financially profitable.” The brochure also featured an endorsement from Dr. Dorothy Furgerson of Planned Parenthood Mar Monte.  The market for aborted baby parts was good for at least one procurement company, which was poised to do business with 250 abortion clinics before undercover videos exposed fetal organ sales and drew unwanted attention to the practice. 3) Abortion Clinics Aren’t Incurring Costs Federal law permits payment for reasonable costs associated with the procurement of aborted baby parts. But under the business model being investigated, the procurement business sends its own technician into an abortion clinic to do the work of securing the human organs. The costs are incurred by the procurement business, but the abortion clinic still gets paid money. “Every conceivable task is performed by the procurement business employees” and not abortion clinic staff, according to committee staff presenting information from one procurement business. The customer places an order for tissue; the order is posted for a procurement technician to see; the technician reviews the medical files of women and girls who have abortions scheduled for the day; the technician informs the clinic about tissues needed for orders; the technician obtains consent from patients based on gestation and order data; the technician procures the body parts requested; the technician packages and ships the tissue to the customer; the technician records invoices for the clinic; and, finally, the middleman pays the clinic per tissue sample. To accept money, when there are no reasonable costs associated with providing the parts, would be a clear violation of the law. Investigators released evidence of guidance given to procurement technicians showing that they alone manage the entire organ procurement process — from targeting specific women for baby parts based on order demands to shipping the body parts to the customer. There was no evidence shown that abortion clinics incur costs as part of the process.  This business model might explain why Planned Parenthood announced in October that it would no longer accept money for aborted baby parts. To accept money, when there are no reasonable costs associated with providing the parts, would be a clear violation of the law. Or as Foster said, “Abortion clinics are being promised a profit and are paid even when they have no apparent costs to be reimbursed, which further multiplies a clinic’s windfall via savings on disposal services. Tissue procurement companies are likewise paid exorbitantly by their customers. This market in baby organs and tissues demonstrates a flagrant and repeated disregard for the rule of law. It was no surprise when America’s biggest abortion business, facing public and prosecutorial exposure, relented and agreed to end its longstanding practice of receiving direct payments for baby body parts.” 4) The Market for Aborted Baby Parts Is Very Specific Evidence was released at the hearing showing a drop-down menu order form where researchers can order any and all baby body parts, including brain, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, esophagus, tongue, and scalp. Yes, scalp. 5) Aborted Baby Parts Are Valuable One of the most interesting things about the revelation that abortion clinics sell fetal body parts is that the unborn child is not considered a valuable human when it comes to ending her life prematurely, but her body parts are considered incredibly valuable precisely because of her humanity. Invoices regarding the sale and transfer of fetal organs were presented at the hearing. One customer paid $22,610 for 38 fetal brains. Another paid $3,340 for a fetal brain, $595 for a “baby skull matched to upper and lower limbs,” and $890 for “upper and lower limbs with hands and feet.” 6) Everyone Agrees: Forensic Audits Are Needed Investigators have begun to find evidence of a significant market for fetal organs. They know that there are profitable procurement businesses that have exploded in growth in recent years. They know that hundreds of abortion clinics are partnered with these procurement businesses. And they have evidence that abortion clinics were paid for the organs from aborted children, even though the procurement business handled all of the costs. When income exceeds costs, that’s profit. Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics claimed they didn’t profit from their sale of human organs. Investigators have begun to find evidence of a significant market for fetal organs. Witnesses testifying at the hearing for both the Republicans and the Democrats said that the committee needs to subpoena financial records from procurement businesses and abortion clinics in order to determine whether these sales violate the law. Brian Patrick Lennon, a former Assistant United States Attorney in Michigan, reviewed the evidence presented for the hearing and said that there was enough for a “competent, ethical federal prosecutor” to “establish probable cause that both the abortion clinics and the procurement business violated the statute, aided and abetted one another in violating the statute, and likely conspired together to violate the statute.” However, he said that forensic accounting and analysis were absolutely needed to determine whether the payments to those involved in the business were in excess of what the law permits. No state investigation has involved forensic auditing, and no federal investigation has thus far. 7) Democratic Members Are Upset at Investigation From the moment the hearing started, Democratic members of the panel, such as Rep. Diana DeGette, (D-Planned Parenthood) attempted to keep the evidence of fetal organ markets from being discussed. Evidence revealed that they are working with procurement businesses attorneys to fight the investigation. That bolstered reporting from The New York Times that Democrats on the committee are helping others in the fetal organ market hide information sought by investigators. The strenuous Democratic efforts to fight the evidence, to help those in the industry thwart investigation, and to question the very investigation into fetal organ markets were difficult to ignore. Democratic members’ strategy appeared to be 1) fight discussion of evidence; 2) say the investigation is too expensive; 3) issue Planned Parenthood talking points against The Center for Medical Progress videos (which were not a topic of discussion at this hearing); and 4) claim that the evidence of fetal organ markets didn’t show fetal organ markets. When shown the drop-down order menu for fetal scalps, for instance, DeGette said it wasn’t evidence of fetal organ markets. This would be akin to looking at the Amazon.com website and saying it doesn’t suggest you can buy books online. Faced with overwhelming evidence of a fetal organ market, the Democrats’ response was to fight discussion of the evidence. This strategy wasn’t particularly effective at the hearing, but it does show the danger of believing one’s own talking points. An independent audit showed that The Center for Medical Progress videos were not deceptively edited, and Planned Parenthood itself conceded that the statements by its staff featured in the video were not manipulated. But Planned Parenthood supporters (and recipients of Planned Parenthood campaign donations, such as those on the panel) and their allies in the media protested that the videos were nevertheless fraudulent. Their talking point from the very beginning has been that the whole story is made up. Faced with overwhelming evidence of a fetal organ market, the response was to fight discussion of the evidence and then to claim that the evidence didn’t really show what it seemed to show. In that sense, their performance at the hearing is similar to the pro-choice movement’s response to the initial videos. Who are you going to believe, Jerry Nadler or your own lying eyes? They’re banking on the media believing Nadler. (And it’s not a bad bet!) 8) Democrats Struggling with Consistency on Discretion Throughout the investigation, Democrats have claimed to be worried that investigating those involved in fetal organ markets will put them at risk. At the hearing yesterday, Republican staff removed all identifying information of the people and companies being discussed. However, Democratic members revealed names while discussing the evidence. Even more, they complained that the Republican staff had redacted the names. 9) Consent Process Raises Questions about Minors, HIPAA The hearing showed that the procurement business technicians “consent” the women and girls who seek abortions. Some witnesses noted that the technicians have access to the names and private information of the individual seeking the abortion and will call her out by name to discuss “donating” the body parts of her unborn child. If she consents, she signs a form. One witness raised the issue of the third party business having access to this information. Another noted that many abortion clinics are performing abortions on minors, raising a question of whether the minor even can consent to the tissue “donation.” 10) Media Still Lagging on Major Story Bethlehem College professor Joe Rigney made an excellent point about the relative lack of media interest in this human rights story about fetal organ harvesting. He said, “Journalists like to think that, when faced with coverup of great evil, they’d do what the Globe team did in the movie Spotlight.” Their conduct with the revelation of fetal organ harvesting and selling shows the exact opposite, he said. “They’re not the brave exposer of institutional evil. They’re the bishop talking about how much good the Church does for the neighborhood, so let’s keep this abuse thing quiet.” Congressional investigators are doing a better job than journalists of finding out information. This hearing did have media interest, and many reporters are covering it well. But when a hearing reveals evidence of a significant market in fetal organ sales — in a year when that very claim has been fought over — much more coverage is needed. And when congressional investigators are doing a better job than journalists of finding out information, it’s flat out embarrassing. The expert witnesses who testified today about minors, HIPAA, and conspiracies involving abortion clinics and procurement businesses were witnesses that members of the media could have interviewed in previous months. 11) Daleiden Vindicated Perhaps the best way to sum up this hearing was that it revealed evidence that vindicates David Daleiden and The Center for Medical Progress. Daleiden showed that abortion clinics were selling human organs from the babies they abort, that there is a market for such body parts, and that this raises questions of violations of federal law. Daleiden said, after the hearing, “The undercover video admissions by senior-level Planned Parenthood officials only scratch the surface of this barbaric trade. The financial documents uncovered by the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives prove that Planned Parenthood profited from trafficking fetal organs and tissues. We now know the criminal trade in body parts is spread nationwide throughout the abortion industry, with nearly one in five abortion clinics selling baby parts to StemExpress. Even the pro-Planned Parenthood witnesses called by the panel minority agreed that a robust investigation should seek testimony and accounting documents from Planned Parenthood.” That’s why Planned Parenthood’s staunchest defenders tried to keep the evidence at the hearing from being discussed.

"419",419,"The Trump Administration Needs To Yank Federal Funding For Research Using The Bodies Of Aborted Babies","Krumholz","Willis","L.",NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-18"," New York State just passed a gruesome law that legalizes abortions up to and including the point of birth. A bill in Virginia, supported by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, would have apparently legalized the killing of just-born infants. The pro-life movement needs to strike back, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—part of President Donald Trump’s executive branch—is the vehicle through which to strike that blow. Late last year, it was reported that the Trump administration’s HHS was launching a review of the federal government’s funding of fetal tissue research using the remains of aborted babies. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of HHS, spent $103 million on fetal tissue research in 2018.  As part of the review, an audit is being conducted to determine the extent fetal tissue is used in government research by government scientists. NIH researchers were told to pause orders of fetal tissue, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was told to cancel a contract with a fetal tissue provider. In this case, the fetal tissue was being used by the FDA to develop “humanized mice”—by placing human cells obtained from aborted human tissue into mice—for testing. Non-government scientists’ use of taxpayer money for fetal tissue research is also being examined. A project by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), which sought to develop humanized mice in an attempt to find a cure for HIV, was put on hold as well—but only after pro-lifers raised awareness about that contract. After complaints from researchers who depend on these funds, HHS is now saying that the UCSF contract has not been officially cancelled, as the audit is still ongoing. Worse, the rules pausing fetal tissue research only apply to government scientists, not the tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded grants received by those who are not directly employed by the government. Right now, cutting taxpayer funding to non-government scientists is not even being considered. The NIH has promised to put $20 million toward finding alternatives to fetal tissue, but the implication is that the use of aborted human remains will continue for the foreseeable future.  That’s why the bureaucrats in HHS have been able to calm the researchers’ fears. Brett Giroir, the HHS assistant secretary for health, has reportedly assured non-government scientists dependent on these funds that the money would continue. NIH director Francis Collins has allegedly said that fetal tissue research would remain “a mainstay.” That is unacceptable. Fetal Tissue Research Is Not Necessary Scientists complain that there is no other viable option for research aside from aborted fetal tissue, but a wrong to (allegedly) do good is still a wrong. Despite what those making money off of fetal tissue say, the effectiveness of using fetal tissue for research is still open for much debate. It doesn’t help that proponents of fetal tissue research routinely make false claims about efficacy. In but one example, they say that fetal tissue was used to develop vaccines for diseases such as polio and measles. But these vaccines were developed using animal cells, not fetal tissue. Proponents also say fetal tissue is necessary for research on the Zika virus and other brain diseases, but fetal tissue is rarely used in such research, and has yet to be proven to be at all better than ethical options. That’s why instead of just an audit of contracts for fetal tissue research undertaken by government scientists, the taxpayer funding used by non-government scientists needs to be thoroughly examined as well. How many serious breakthroughs have occurred through the use of “humanized mice”? So far, adult stem cells have led to serious medical breakthroughs. The use of “humanized mice” has not.  Common sense best practices would require us to not just take the scientists’ and universities’ word for it. They are receiving money to do fetal tissue research; their jobs depend on the practice continuing. It shouldn’t be taboo to point out these researchers and universities’ clear conflict of interest. Scientists might also say that the abortion has already happened, so fetal remains might as well be put to some use. Aside from the ethical problems with this argument, the truth is that fetal tissue research operates as a backdoor subsidy to the abortion industry. Fetal Tissue Research Subsidizes the Abortion Industry Two factors make fetal tissue highly profitable for the abortion industry. In 1973, Roe v. Wade said that abortion was such a fundamental constitutional right that states were almost completely unable to regulate the abortion industry. Abortion clinics were often dirty and not up to code, and fetal remains were routinely discarded in the trash or sent down a sink’s disposal. But states’ ability to regulate abortion changed with Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. Even though Casey upheld the “right” that Roe v. Wade created to have an abortion, Casey parted with Roe by allowing states to regulate and provide oversight of the abortion industry for the first time. The vast majority of states have strict rules about medical waste that apply to abortion clinics. If not for a fetal tissue market, abortion clinics would have to use a medical waste company. Human remains can’t be run down the disposal, at least in most states. But many medical waste companies, for public relations reasons or otherwise, are reluctant to work with Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers. AEither way, paying a medical waste company to dispose of the fetal remains is an additional cost for Planned Parenthood. That’s the first factor. The second factor is that many clinics do not use an ultrasound during an abortion. For example, using no ultrasound is common practice at Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, in order to cut costs and speed up the abortion process. Because no ultrasound is used during the procedure, clinic workers must piece through fetal remains after the procedure to ensure that no pieces of the baby were inadvertently left in the mother. In other words, clinics are already cataloging and sorting aborted babies’ remains. Saving and storing the remains for the local tissue broker or university to come and pick up is an easy, almost cost-free last step. That means that when Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers can harvest fetal tissue, not only does this remove the problem of paying disposal costs, it brings in cash. That directly boosts the profit for each procedure. Nonprofit or not, Planned Parenthood—at the clinic or franchisee level—is very cost sensitive. And abortion provides the biggest boost to clinics’ bottom lines, which goes directly to employee bonuses and the like. A rough estimate is that Planned Parenthood affiliates’ profit margin from abortion is between 20 and 40 percent. That means that, historically, and even including donations as clinic revenue, up to half of clinics’ revenue after costs comes from abortion. In Planned Parenthood’s last reported year, once donations and bequests to affiliates are backed out, it is likely that almost the entirety of clinics’ revenues after costs come from abortion. A Lucrative Add-On Selling fetal tissue is a lucrative add-on for clinics. Contracts that pay clinics for fetal tissue vary depending on who is buying the tissue (a broker, or a research institution directly) and the local market. Planned Parenthood Los Angeles was paid by fetal tissue broker Novogenix $45 per “specimen.” But Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (located in Texas) was paid between $150 and $200 per fetal remain by the University of Texas Medical Branch. Assuming only half of Planned Parenthood’s almost 333,000 abortions in 2017 went to fetal tissue research, and assuming each of these only paid $50 per aborted baby, that’s an added $8.3 million that goes straight to franchisees’ bottom line. Instead of bringing in $500 in revenue, an abortion that is used for fetal tissue research brings in at least $550. That’s a 10 percent increase in revenue per abortion with no added cost, which goes directly to affiliates’ profits. Obviously, the amount of aborted remains that are sold is probably more than half, and clinics often receive more than $50. That’s why fetal tissue research is such a good gig for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. Instead of having to pay for the disposal of fetal tissue, which would dent the profit margin from providing abortions, the abortion industry is paid by the fetal tissue research industry to dispose of their waste. Federal law prohibits paying more than cost for fetal tissue, but a big part of the “benefit” to the abortion industry is not having to pay for fetal tissue disposal. Pro-lifers need to pressure the Trump administration. Congress specifies some NIH funds, but much of the funding NIH receives is discretionary. NIH gets a lot of funding, generally, for stem cells and tissue research, but NIH chooses to use that for baby body parts—to the tune of over $100 million per year. There is no reason that Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, appointed by President Trump and voted for by Republicans in the Senate, cannot cut that funding off. Too many scientists believe they should have unfettered research access without any imposition of boundaries, and their public universities too often take an “ends justify the means” approach and behave as if they are autonomous. And they happen to make money off it. That’s wrong. This practice is scientifically dubious, subpar compared to ethical methods of research, and operates as a backdoor subsidy to the abortion industry. It’s time to end it in America.

"420",420,"8 Nonpartisan Reasons To Defund Planned Parenthood","Siggins","Dustin",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-01-15"," House Democrats want to reinstate international abortion funding. Planned Parenthood’s new CEO, Leana Wen, is focusing on abortion as the forefront of Planned Parenthood’s offerings and goals. And the March for Life is this Friday, where tens of thousands––perhaps even hundreds of thousands––of people will protest abortion in Washington DC. The fact is that political parties are going to keep fighting on abortion. Republicans will claim that they prioritize pro-life policies, even though they didn’t defund Planned Parenthood or pass any federal bans when they controlled Congress and the White House. Meanwhile, Democrats will keep abortion sacrosanct.  Both parties are wrong: abortion should be ended. The first step to this should be a bipartisan ending of Planned Parenthood’s funding. To quote March For Life President Jeanne Mancini about America’s largest abortion company, “protecting vulnerable, unborn citizens should be a bipartisan goal.” Planned Parenthood dominates the Democratic Party, even though Planned Parenthood violates a number of the party’s core principles. As shown below, women are harmed by Planned Parenthood, and the vulnerable––such as sex abuse victims and the unborn––are sacrificed for profit and political advance. “Both parties ought to unite around redirecting” Planned Parenthood’s funding, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in an email to me. She noted that other facilities offer all of Planned Parenthood’s non-abortion services and “vastly outnumber” the abortion giant’s locations. Since SCOTUS showed last month that it is not willing to risk political controversy by hearing state-level defunding cases, it’s important that pro-life advocates create more of our kind to gain political advantage across all levels of government. To that end, here are eight nonpartisan reasons Planned Parenthood should be defunded.  1. The Unborn Are the Most Vulnerable People The main argument for abortion is that what occupies a pregnant womb is not a human being. But science proves that unborn life begins in the womb. From Just Facts* comes proof––not the organization’s own opinion, but 10 original sources provided in just the short section below. Readers can click to each source from the numbered hyperlink to verify the original citation: Fertilization normally takes place within one day of intercourse but can occur up to six days later. [34] [35]
At fertilization, humans’ genetic composition is formed. [36] This genetic information determines gender, eye color, hair color, and facial features. It also influences characteristics such as intelligence and personality. [37]
Per the medical textbook “The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology”: “fertilization” creates “a new combination of chromosomes that is different from that in the cells of either of the parents,” and this marks the “beginning of a new human being.” [38]
The four characteristics of life (growth, reproduction, metabolism, and response to stimuli) are present at fertilization. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] Unborn children feel pain, react to their surroundings, and have their own distinct blood. Their helplessness makes them the most vulnerable of all humans, a demographic Democrats stake their reputations on protecting. This is the best reason Planned Parenthood should be defunded. It kills more than 320,000 human beings each year, according to its annual reports. 2. Planned Parenthood Covers Up Sex Abuse Planned Parenthood has been accused by the pro-life group Live Action of hiding sex abuse. Live Action has undercover videos and personal testimonies to make its case. Planned Parenthood says Live Action is lying. It also has materials showing its support for survivors of sexual assault.  However, state officials in Alabama discovered that a Planned Parenthood center in Mobile covered up the suspected abuse of a 14-year-old girl. The girl already had two children and went to the center for two abortions in four months in 2014. I spoke to a senior Alabama health official who defended giving Planned Parenthood a light punishment. Like every other state in the nation, Alabama requires health workers to report suspected abuse of minors. Planned Parenthood’s Mobile location didn’t do that. The official told me his department believed it was an error. I asked the official if “essentially, your department was satisfied [Planned Parenthood] had acted in good faith, and not intentionally hid this information’ from child protective services.” The official said that what I described was accurate. He also asked me to frame the situation differently to avoid pressure by the state’s pro-life advocates, saying it “would be much better” if LifeSiteNews “could word [the situation]in a way that [Planned Parenthood] had considered the possibility [of abuse] but simply hadn’t reported it, and after review with senior management, they are revising their policies, and they did report it, and they will report similar instances in the future.” Got that? Alabama officials believed Planned Parenthood’s Mobile location accidentally broke a state law designed to protect minors, and that this should excuse their lack of protecting an abused minor. 3. Hurting Women In Other Ways Did you know that research shows contraceptives can cause blood clots, death, glaucoma, gestational diabetes, breast cancer, depression, and general pain for women? Planned Parenthood acknowledges but downplays many such risks of contraceptives. Despite these risks, it gave out almost 2.7 million various contraceptives to women in 2016. Planned Parenthood also ends the lives of about 6.6 percent of girls who would otherwise be born each year. The full calculations for that number may be seen here. About 157,000 unborn girls are denied the right to leave the womb and become women. This 6.6 percent does not include sex-selective abortions. There is evidence this happens domestically. Planned Parenthood’s California chapter opposed a sex-selective abortion ban, even though the national Planned Parenthood says it opposes sex-selective abortions. These numbers also do not include the many abortions that may be caused by several of the federally approved contraceptives that double as abortion-inducing drugs or devices. One person who has seen firsthand how women are hurt by Planned Parenthood is Lauren Handy. A dedicated advocate for women considering abortion, she told me that she “purposely live[s] below the poverty line” so as to not support Planned Parenthood with tax dollars. Handy said her activism started after “a woman just coming out of her abortion” was holding “her womb area in pain as her boyfriend dragged her along.” Handy “dropped out of college, sold all my belongings, and became a full-time pro-life missionary.” She holds signs in front of abortion centers which show graphic images of abortion victims, “medical diagrams of what the abortion procedure actually entails,” and provides non-abortive resources for desperate women. 4. Illegally Selling Baby Parts Planned Parenthood has denied illegally selling baby body parts. These denials came despite federal and state criminal referrals and investigations. The district attorney in Orange County, California filed charges against two companies that allegedly partnered with Planned Parenthood. Those companies settled for almost $8 million, admitted fault, and stopped their work in California. A court order has prevented any more of the Center for Medical Progress’s (CMP) videos, which allegedly show Planned Parenthood engaging in illegal activity, from being released. CMP lead investigator David Daleiden told me these videos “will be the final confirmation that Planned Parenthood and their business partners are guilty.” If you haven’t watched the CMP videos, which were released in 2015, please do so. In one of them, baby body parts are piled like slabs of meat. Stopping this shouldn’t be controversial. 5. Medicaid Fraud And Taxpayer Waste Congress should cut all inefficient and illegally spent money. This includes monies misspent by Planned Parenthood, an organization Dannenfelser described as “perpetually mired in scandals.” For example, the Texas attorney general’s office found evidence that Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (PPGC) engaged in fraud. PPGC denied the claims in 2013. It settled the case for $1.4 million. Wisconsin auditors found overpayments in 2014 at five Planned Parenthood centers and three other abortion centers. Finally, the Alliance Defending Freedom and Charlotte Lozier Institute examined dozens of state audits and three federal audits, which show that Planned Parenthood centers across the country waste millions of taxpayer dollars. Even the state of New York––an abortion-friendly state––targeted Planned Parenthood in 2009 for overbilling. Planned Parenthood For America did not respond to a request for comment about the audits and investigations. 6. Free Speech And Private Property Hypocrisy Elected officials promise to uphold the U.S. Constitution, and public programs are subject to its protections. Despite receiving more than $540 million in public money, however, Planned Parenthood does not support free speech for all citizens. For example, Planned Parenthood has sued to stop state and federal defunding efforts. It argues that eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood puts its rights and those of its clients at risk. Yet Planned Parenthood backed a California law that would have forced pro-life centers to refer for abortion. Planned Parenthood wanted to force private citizens to speak their message. It also backed another California law that restricted the ability of journalists to engage in undercover investigations. This hypocrisy also applies to property rights. Planned Parenthood backed the mobs which were arrested on Capitol Hill last year, saying “protest is patriotic.” Likewise, in 2014, people affiliated with the organization handed out condoms on Hobby Lobby property in protest of Hobby Lobby’s successful lawsuit against the Obama administration’s contraception mandate. But again, Planned Parenthood seems to think protests are patriotic only when they support their narrative. Pro-life advocates outside of Planned Parenthood centers had to fight all the way to the Supreme Court in 2013 to be allowed within 35 feet of abortion centers in Massachusetts. Planned Parenthood lost that case, but it has consistently urged lawmakers to ban pro-life advocates from using public property for free speech. 7. Planned Parenthood Isn’t Needed Public dollars should only be spent where necessary. While reasonable people can disagree on the existence of many federal and state programs, eliminating Planned Parenthood’s public sinecure is easy to justify on the basis that it is not necessary. Pro-life pregnancy resource centers take care of pregnant women better than Planned Parenthood can. First, these centers provide free ultrasounds, maternity housing, adoption assistance, clothes, diapers, and more for women in desperate circumstances. Planned Parenthood charges for many of its services. Second, pro-life centers outnumber abortion clinics. Best of all for those who are concerned about fiscal matters, most are privately funded, which protects taxpayers. In fact, taxpayers see a net benefit from pro-life centers. Citing a Charlotte Lozier Institute study published in 2018, Heartbeat International Director of Communications Andrea Trudden told me, “In 2017 alone, pregnancy help centers served more than 2 million women and men in the United States, saving taxpayers more than $161 million.” Life Advancement Group* co-founder Benjamin Kraft said in an email that “these centers support women in many different situations, from first-time expecting mothers to single moms with multiple kids who are struggling to make ends meet.” According to Kraft, one center “provided more than 1,600 medical and support services to women in need” with just a $250,000 budget. For Planned Parenthood’s other services, such as cervical cancer screenings and breast exams, federally-qualified health centers provide them. And it is these centers which pro-life groups have, for years, urged federal lawmakers to redirect Planned Parenthood’s funding because these centers provide other non-abortive services such as contraceptives. So, again, clearly Planned Parenthood-specific funding isn’t necessary because what Planned Parenthood offers is either immoral or provided elsewhere. But it is also the case that some of the dollars should be eliminated from the federal budget forthwith instead of being redirected. Such immoral ends should never be funded by the public. Additionally, rather than reduce abortion rates, research shows that widely available birth control increases the prevalence of abortion, above and beyond the abortion-inducing potential of several drugs and devices. The least expensive and most effective option for birth control is abstinence. It’s free, and it’s 100 percent effective in all consensual circumstances. It is also the solution that calls upon adults to engage in sexual intercourse as adults instead of like children who feel entitled to using someone else’s money in their bedroom. 8. Planned Parenthood Uses Public Money For Political Advocacy If the list above isn’t enough, Planned Parenthood uses taxpayer money to fund tens of millions of dollars of political advocacy. This is a favorite bipartisan activity. Politicians regularly give your money to their favored corporations, unions, and non-profit “charities” that are actually political advocacy groups. Eliminating Planned Parenthood’s federal funding should be part of a bipartisan effort to clean house. Making our government smaller would ensure that tax dollars are used far more efficiently––whether for folks concerned about abortion, corporate farm subsidies, or our oversized Department of Defense. It would also reduce the influence of outside groups on our elected officials. *Just Facts is one of my former clients.

"421",421,"Could The Same-Sex Marriage Ruling End up Protecting Unborn Children?","Camosy","Charles","C.",NA,NA,NA,"2015-07-07"," Abortion and same-sex marriage. They go together like bread and butter. Thelma and Louise. Rhythm and Blues. Indeed, headline writers and story editors almost can’t help but mention them together. The lines between the issues have been blurred to where many in our Western public discourse simply see them as virtually the same issue, with each shifting along a similar social trajectory.  After Ireland legalized gay marriage, for instance, many left-leaning voices simply assumed broad abortion legalization would be next. The headline from this opinion piece in The Guardian was representative: “If Ireland can Allow Gay Marriage, Surely it accepts a Woman’s Right to Choose.” Well, no. The Irish, despite legalizing gay marriage (and becoming significantly less religious), still strongly reject abortion. But pairing abortion with same-sex marriage also happens on the Right. Conservative Catholics, for instance, often invoke the (mistaken) idea that there are three “non-negotiables” when it comes to voting: (1) abortion, (2) same-sex marriage, and (3) religious freedom with regard to abortion and same-sex marriage. Conservative pundits are also increasingly writing pieces imploring the GOP to “get in step” with a fast-changing “modern America,” particularly on social issues. These, of course, turn out to be abortion and same-sex marriage. America Is Moving in Opposite Directions Want to get in step with a fast-changing modern American when it comes to abortion? Then you had better get okay with increased legal protections for prenatal children. Literally hundreds of bills limiting abortion have been passed in dozens of states in just the past few years, with hundreds more on the way this year. (One of the few state laws attempting to expand abortion rights was defeated—in a movement lead by a pro-life Democrat—in the liberal state of New York.) In addition, the future of abortion policy in the United States belongs to Millennials and Hispanics, who are increasingly skeptical of abortion. More than half are intensely skeptical. The future of abortion policy in the United States belongs to Millennials and Hispanics, who are increasingly skeptical of abortion. But public opinion is one thing. Constitutional jurisprudence is another. Despite the plethora of state laws limiting abortion, they appear to be nibbling around the edges of the central issue—an issue which has been enshrined as an unchangeable Constitutional right by our Supreme Court. Right?  Well, not so fast. In a piece she wrote for Slate in advance of the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, Katherine Franke explained why she was worried that the swing vote—Justice Kennedy—might justify his opinion legalizing such marriage by appealing to the human dignity of gays and lesbians. “It’s hard to come out as an opponent of dignity,” she said. “In this political and legal climate the cost of dignifying same-sex relationships risks shaming women exercising reproductive rights. I’m not willing to win marriage rights for same-sex couples in a way that might contract the noble promises of our Constitution.” Franke’s worry was anticipated a few weeks previous by Jeffery Rosen writing in The Atlantic: “if the Court strikes down same-sex marriage bans on the grounds that they violate a right to dignity, liberals may have second thoughts about empowering judges to decide whose dignity trumps when the interests of citizens with very different conceptions of dignity clash.” Celebrating Human Dignity Tanks Abortion In offering his opinion on same-sex marriage last week, not only did Justice Kennedy invoke human dignity as the central idea behind legalizing such marriages in all 50 states, it was celebrated all over the Internet as the most beautiful part of his argument.  Pro-lifers hope Kennedy will see U.S. abortion practices as yet another example of precisely this kind of hidden injustice. But some pro-life analysis of his opinion has been hopeful—not only because Kennedy (also the swing vote on abortion cases) refused to tie his opinion about legal same-sex marriage to abortion law—but also because of his insistence that the Fourteenth Amendment covers injustices that were previously unseen and must be corrected by the court. Pro-lifers hope Kennedy will see U.S. abortion practices (which involve, among other things, frequent killing of a fetus simply because she has Down syndrome) as yet another example of precisely this kind of hidden injustice. Do they have any legitimate hope for this? Although Kennedy was a key member of the court upholding abortion rights in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the pro-choice legal pundit Jeffery Toobin is worried that, 15 years later in Gonzales v. Carhart, this all-important swing voter demonstrated a significant shift toward restricting abortion. From Kennedy’s 2007 opinion: “The State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn.” In making this decision, Kennedy affirmed as constitutional the “Partial-Birth Abortion Ban’, a law which Kennedy described as expressing—you guessed it—“respect for the dignity of human life.” What makes abortion so complex and vexing an issue is precisely that the dignity of the mother and the dignity of her prenatal child seem to conflict. But if Justice Kennedy is willing to continue applying human dignity in a way which genuinely wrestles with this complexity, then his opinion is also likely to continue to shift in favor of laws which defend the dignity of prenatal human life. Indeed, as pro-choice pundits have feared, the concept of dignity he used in affirming same-sex marriage may be the very same concept of dignity he uses to further restrict abortion rights. While this may appear to be a contradiction to those still working with an outdated liberal/conservative binary left over from the culture wars of a previous generation, it makes good sense to the two constituencies who matter most for the future of abortion policy in the United States: young people and Justice Kennedy.

"423",423,"How A Pro-Life Ballot Amendment Threatens Democrats’ Senate Chances In West Virginia","Metzgar","Jayme",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-09-28"," It was a sunny, breezy August afternoon—perfect county-fair weather. At the fairgrounds in Jefferson County, West Virginia, families made their way through exhibits of livestock, produce, and crafts, finally meandering toward the dirt track for the evening’s demolition derby. As fairgoers trickled past the commercial booths, they were greeted by a slim, dark-haired woman handing out balloons to children and leaflets to their parents. “Have you heard about Amendment 1?” she’d begin. “It’s a constitutional amendment on the ballot this November.”  For those who stopped to listen, she’d explain: In 1993, West Virginia’s Democrat-controlled legislature passed a bill prohibiting state funding for elective abortions. The law was immediately challenged in court. In Women’s Health Center of West Virginia v. Panepinto, the state Supreme Court ruled that the West Virginia Constitution both secures the right to an abortion, and requires the state to fund it. Since then, deep-red West Virginia has been forced to fund elective abortions with tax dollars. The state has spent roughly $10 million on 35,000 abortions over the years. Amendment 1, passed by the legislature in March and now up for approval by voters in November, would amend the West Virginia Constitution, rendering it neutral on abortion and invalidating Panepinto. Legislators modeled their effort after a similar measure in Tennessee, which voters approved in 2014. The amendment’s text is simple: “Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects the right to an abortion or requires the funding of abortion.” State Sen. Patricia Rucker—the slender woman working the fair booth—was Amendment 1’s lead sponsor. “Right now, the only effect of this amendment would be to end state funding for elective abortion,” Rucker says. The 1993 law would once again be in force, requiring the state to fund abortions only in the case of severe maternal health issues, severe fetal deformity, rape, or incest. “In general,” Rucker says, “the amendment makes it clear that the right to abortion isn’t in our state constitution. It’s returning control over this issue to the people’s representatives: the legislature. Which is where it belongs.”  Hooded Cloaks and Dirty Tactics Of course, some want to see judges, not legislators, making abortion law. During floor debate, pro-abortion activists arrived at the state capitol to oppose Amendment 1, wearing “Handmaid’s Tale” cloaks and carrying crude signs. Rucker and her allies pressed forward, and the effort in the House of Delegates was led by another conservative woman, Delegate Kayla Kessinger. “Unfortunately, a lot of men hesitate to stand up for this,” Rucker admitted. “They don’t want to be labeled as telling women what to do. We have put men in this position where they’re afraid.” For her crimes as a pro-life woman, Rucker felt her opponents’ wrath. “I definitely got a lot of hate mail,” she says. “All of us who voted for the measure were harassed. We had coat hangers with red paint left in our offices. But I also had threatening messages left on my phone—threats of physical violence. As far as I know, that didn’t happen to any of the other legislators. It was just directed against me.”  The dirty tactics extended even to impersonation. “The night before the vote on [Amendment 1], we sent out an email to legislators, reminding them to vote ‘yes,’” says Mary Anne Buchanan of West Virginians for Life. “That same night, someone sent an email to legislators from a bogus address, pretending to be our president, Wanda Franz, and telling them to vote ‘no.’ Thankfully our legislators caught on, but it just shows to what great lengths the other side is willing to go.” As the battleground now shifts to the electorate, Amendment 1 opponents are busy telling women that their “right to make deeply personal health care decisions” is at risk, giving the clear impression that abortion will be banned rather than simply defunded. Another talking point is that “women will die”—despite the fact that state code clearly allows tax funding of an abortion to save a mother’s life.  “The radical abortionist lobby will stop at nothing to try to deceive people into thinking that Amendment 1 is something different than what it is,” says state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a pro-life Republican. “We have to let people know that this is an amendment that really, purely focuses on taxpayer funding of abortion in West Virginia. There are a lot of people saying, ‘There is no taxpayer funding [of abortion].’ That’s incorrect.” As West Virginia pro-lifers work to rally their voters, Karen Cross, political director at the National Right to Life Committee, worries that outside pro-choice activists will make a last-minute surge into the state. “I’ve seen other states actively sending people into West Virginia to campaign against Amendment 1,” Cross told me. “There’s going to be a lot of outside help against the amendment. I wouldn’t be surprised to see things pouring in at the very last minute.” Although opponents of Amendment 1 portray the measure as “radical” and “unprecedented,” taxpayer funding for elective abortion is more the exception than the rule in America. Federal law prohibits U.S. tax dollars from directly funding abortion, except in the cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. In administering their Medicaid programs, 33 states follow the same general guidelines. Only 17 states use state Medicaid dollars to cover elective abortions. Of those, just five do so voluntarily; the other 12, like West Virginia, have been mandated to do so by courts. Using State-Level Action to Chip Away at Abortion Two states are seeking to leave that list of 17 this year. Besides West Virginia, deep-blue Oregon will also vote on a constitutional amendment to end state-funded abortion. (In Oregon, the measure was initiated by citizens rather than the legislature.) A third ballot initiative, an amendment in Alabama, is more ambitious. Besides including text identical to West Virginia’s, Alabama’s amendment explicitly recognizes “the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life.” Ballot initiatives are a bold strategy for enacting policy—the closest our republic comes to direct democracy. They are a way of gauging the will of the people in no uncertain terms. Although the United States has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the world, most Americans tend to take a more moderate view. A Gallup poll this June found that a majority of Americans—both men and women—believe abortion should be legal only in certain circumstances, and they tend to favor fewer circumstances. In recent years, this public consensus has been reflected in the success or failure of pro-life ballot initiatives. While bolder “personhood” ballot initiatives have tended to fail, initiatives ending taxpayer funding of abortion—which nearly two-thirds of Americans oppose—tend to succeed. Another pro-life success story is the advent of state-level Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Acts, which limit legal abortion to an unborn child’s first 20 weeks of life. Since 2010, these laws have been passed in 16 states, including West Virginia. “In 2013, the year I became attorney general,” Morrisey remembers, “West Virginia was actually an outlier in terms of the states: abortions were allowed to be legally performed until birth. It was an absolutely outrageous position.” After Morrisey’s office did a survey of the abortion laws and presented its findings to the legislature, a Pain-Capable Act was passed with bipartisan support in 2014. It was promptly vetoed by the governor, a Democrat who had previously run as pro-life. The following year, the legislature passed the Pain-Capable Act again, this time overriding the governor’s veto. Six legislators (all Democrats) who had voted “yes” on prior versions of the bill voted “no” on the veto override. “When they knew the governor would veto, they voted in favor,” Rucker says. “But when it came time to actually put the law into effect, they voted ‘no.’” ‘He Went to Washington and Caved’ The intersection between abortion policy and party politics is unique in West Virginia, and it could play a role in this year’s congressional midterms. By almost any measure, West Virginia is a pro-life state. “West Virginians have always been for the downtrodden, the helpless, and the vulnerable,” explains Buchanan. “Who is more helpless and vulnerable than the unborn baby in the womb?” Responding to popular sentiment, politicians of both parties typically run on a pro-life platform. “When our West Virginians for Life PAC endorses candidates, those candidates have an 86 percent success rate,” Buchanan says. “We’ve even got Democrats who try to compete with each other over how pro-life they are.” In the legislature, Amendment 1 was approved by more than two-thirds in both houses, by members of both parties. However, the disconnect between campaign rhetoric and policy votes is becoming a bigger issue—particularly for the state’s representation in Washington DC. West Virginia’s best-known “pro-life” Democrat, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, was endorsed by West Virginians for Life during both his campaigns for governor, and in his initial run for the U.S. Senate. As soon as he arrived in Washington, however, things changed. “When Joe Manchin came to Washington, up until then he’d been a faithful pro-lifer,” says Cross. “The first year he was in the Senate, his pro-life voting record dropped to 20 percent. He caved to his colleagues. He caved faster than most.” Despite Manchin’s ongoing designation in the national media as a “pro-life Democrat,” he continues to be unreliable, consistently voting to fund Planned Parenthood and warning President Trump not to nominate Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. This year, Manchin’s race for reelection is one of the GOP’s best chances to flip a Senate seat. Both West Virginians for Life and National Right to Life have endorsed Manchin’s Republican opponent, Morrisey. “We know that we can count on Patrick Morrisey,” Cross says. “As attorney general he’s been wonderful on the issue of life. The fruit of the congressman or senator is his votes. We know that we cannot count on Manchin for his votes, but we can with Morrisey.” Another closely watched federal race in West Virginia is the open seat in U.S. House District 3, where pro-life Republican Carol Miller is running against Richard Ojeda, a Democrat. Ojeda, a state senator and Army veteran, became a darling of the national left during West Virginia’s recent teachers’ strike. Michael Moore, Politico, and The New York Times all lined up to interview this rare curiosity: a Trump-country progressive. The national spotlight was a boon for Ojeda’s fledgling congressional campaign, and somewhere along the way, he shifted his position on abortion. “When Ojeda first got to the West Virginia Senate, he was very pro-life – enthusiastically pro-life,” Cross says. “Then, something abruptly changed. I’ve been doing this long enough that I can always tell: Suddenly, these politicians start dodging me in the halls, avoiding eye contact. Ojeda turned into a pro-abortion vote almost overnight. He voted against Amendment 1. That’s not going to fly in southern West Virginia.” It’s all About Voter Turnout With Election Day just weeks away, West Virginia’s pro-lifers are working against the clock to inform voters about Amendment 1. “We still meet people every day who haven’t heard about the amendment,” Buchanan says. “But when they do, they tend to support it. Besides being a pro-life issue, it’s a taxpayer issue. West Virginians pay taxes for a lot of things, and this isn’t something they want their tax dollars going toward.” Although public opinion is on their side, pro-life leaders worry that the opposition has more energy, and more funds to spread misinformation. “People just assume West Virginia’s a pro-life state, and it is,” says Cross. “But it’s easy to become complacent. We really need our people to come out and vote.” The hope is that as voters come out for Amendment 1, they will also cast their ballots for pro-life candidates. “We are really putting to the test this perception everyone in the state has,” adds Rucker. “If we fail this test, it will definitely be a step backwards. It really is a make-or-break moment. Everyone is holding their breath.” For his part, Morrisey is optimistic. “I think that the combination of Amendment 1, the support I’m getting from the pro-life community, and Manchin’s flip-flopping on Planned Parenthood and abortion issues – I think that’s going to motivate a lot of pro-life voters to get to the polls,” Morrisey says. “And that’s going to allow Amendment 1 to pass, and it’s going to help ensure that I prevail over Senator Joe Manchin. West Virginia is a pro-life state. Manchin is out of touch with the majority of the people in the state.” Manchin’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Amendment 1. However, a statement the senator gave to Politico was non-committal. “We’ll see what happens,” he said. It’s an ironic non-position, given that Amendment 1 would simply restore a law the state legislature passed in 1993. One of the state senators who voted “yes” on that bill 25 years ago: Joe Manchin.

"424",424,"Why Do Pro-Life Leaders Demand Sanitizing Instead Of Ending Mass Murder?","Silberman","James",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-10-17"," Imagine a world where bold men and women react to former abortionist Ulrich Klopfer keeping thousands of corpses in his house by bringing that horror to bear on the Indiana legislature and the Supreme Court for sanctioning the murders.

Nor did he care that thousands of his patients did not give consent to allowing him to take the bodies of their deceased infants across state lines for an unknown reason. Was it for the purpose of personal, bizarre experimentation? Something else? He was effectively running an unlicensed cemetery.” Or note the concerns of pro-life Indiana State Rep. Ron Bacon, who said, “We would like for an investigation done with the three counties involved to ensure that no fetal remains are being stored there and if Indiana fetal remains were illegally transported across state lines.” Indiana Right to Life President Mike Fichter echoed the same, saying, “These sickening reports underscore why the abortion industry must be held to the highest scrutiny. We are calling on Indiana authorities to join in the investigation to determine if these fetal remains have any connection to abortion operations, or personnel, in Indiana.”  “This tragic case shows why abortion providers must be held to strict guidelines and face rigorous oversight,” said pro-life Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind. “I will be looking into federal legislation to ensure the remains of aborted babies are always treated with dignity, including the remains of chemical abortions.” White House spokesman Judd Deere’s comments were chilling: “Murdering thousands of innocent babies is one thing, but preserving and hoarding their bodies like trophies is a new level of sickness. … A full investigation is needed to determine whether crimes were committed and if anyone else was involved.” “Murdering thousands of innocent babies is one thing,” says the pro-life leader. I will not forget that line as long as I live. Hygienic Disposal of Mass Murder Victims, Please “Strict guidelines,” “rigorous oversight,” and “high scrutiny” for the Ulrich Klopfers of the world that they might dispose of their murder victims more hygienically and without crossing state lines is the pathetic cry of these pro-life leaders.  If they accomplish their objectives, these lobbyists and politicians will have accomplished nothing but sanitize and further legitimize abortion. Pro-choicers know this. It’s why rabidly pro-abortion Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is also investigating. He knows that pursuing this investigation and demonizing the deceased Klopfer distances the abortion industry from an enormous public relations liability. Rather than sanitizing abortion, we must put it on trial before the public, engendering abhorrence for abortion itself, not for regulatory violations. The regulatory regime that is the pro-life legal strategy does not enable the movement to bring about the abolition of abortion. Regulating rather than abolishing abortion is the doom of the United States’ nearly 1 million annual abortion victims. Many pro-life politicians and lobbyists have played directly into the abortion lobby’s hands. By regulating rather than abolishing, they’ve conceded that Roe v. Wade is a legitimate court opinion and, worse, that abortion is health care. If something is mass murder, you abolish it, and you don’t concern yourself with any opinions that you should allow it. But if it’s health care, regulate away. The pro-life lobbyist and politician will respond by holding up a piece of paper showing a slight decline in abortion rates, to which abolitionists (those who demand the total and immediate abolition of the evil of the age) will respond, “Praise God for every life saved because of a regulatory sanitation of murder. But you see those 900,000 there who were murdered? They could’ve been saved if the multimillion-dollar pro-life industry would’ve stood against the Supreme Court rather than obsequiously obeying their every opinion that child sacrifice should be legal.” Too Many Pro-Lifers Worship the Supreme Court as a God The pro-life politician or lobbyist will object to the labeling of their bills as the regulatory sanitation of murder, but that’s what they are. C.R. Cali’s recently published book, “The Doctrine of Balaam,” explained it well: Regulating abortions gives more than tacit permission; it definitionally governs, directs, and controls the killing of preborn children through rule and law. Rather than engendering an attitude of abhorrence for this slaughter, regulations legitimize the practice by dictating where, when, and how it is acceptable. The pro-life-pro-choice paradigm does nothing but cement legal abortion’s status as health care and the Supreme Court’s status as our functional god. Too harsh, you say? “We could no sooner ignore SCOTUS than the force of gravity,” Texas Alliance for Life President Joe Pojman said in April to the Houston Chronicle, explaining his pro-life organization’s opposition to the Abolition of Abortion in Texas Act. Unconditional submission to a legal-political institution akin to our acquiescence to a law of nature is nothing short of idolatry. Never mind that this submission entails obeying an order to allow serial killers to operate with impunity so long as they and those bringing their victims jump through a few pro-life hoops, and never mind that just about every state is disregarding a federal law, regulation, or court opinion on one or more other issues. Among pro-life leaders, Pojman is the rule, not the exception. Bills to immediately abolish abortion and disregard Roe as the evil, unconstitutional, nonbinding opinion that it is have been introduced in six states. The primary opposition in four of those states (Oklahoma, Texas, Indiana, and Idaho) has been pro-life Republicans, National Right to Life lobbyists, and Southern Baptist-affiliated conventions. Why does the pro-life establishment get away with treating abortion like health care and the Supreme Court like a god? Because they’ve handed the reins of the movement to worldly pragmatists. The biblical term for such individuals is “fools.” Professing themselves to be wise, they regulate murder and oppose its abolition, telling their donors and supporters regulation is the best they can do and that the Supreme Court is due unconditional submission up to and including obedience to their orders to allow mass murder. “This is the best way to fight abortion,” they say. “We have to be as wise as serpents.” As if Matthew 10:16 is commanding Supreme Court idolatry and the sanitation of murder. Stop Playing Regulatory Games Consider the statement of Abolish Abortion Indiana President Derin Stidd contrasted with the pro-life leaders at this article’s outset. These people make their living by murdering babies by the thousands. They see the arms and the legs that they are ripping off of these little children every single day. They see the little faces staring up at them from the heads that they just tore off of the bodies of little innocent babies every single day. So, it’s hard for me to imagine how we could possibly be surprised when we hear of the other sort of evil things they are doing.
This man murdered thousands of little babies, and hardly anyone cares, but he takes their remains home, and now all of a sudden it’s a big deal. Why? Of course, the fact that he had the remains of over 2,000 dead babies in his home is disturbing, but it’s disturbing because he’s the one that killed those babies, to begin with. What’s even more disturbing than that is that virtually no one is disturbed that Klopfer killed the babies, only that he took their remains home. I find that to be disturbing. Canadian activist Laura Klassen reacted along the same lines: “All this outrage over babies in jars … is amazing to me. We shouldn’t find it shocking that an abortionist kept over 2K dead babies as souvenirs. … [I]t should shock that this guy killed over 2K babies. Legally.” This is the appropriate reaction to the remains of Klopfer’s thousands of victims. Not a call for stricter enforcement of laws against taking corpses across state lines. Nothing coming from a foundation of compromise and defeatism. No call for regulation that could’ve come from an abortion supporter as easily as from a pro-lifer. Just a simple expression of abhorrence for abortion and a demand for its abolition. Stop playing regulatory games. And that is what’s going on. It’s a game. Pro-life lobbyists and politicians benefit immensely from regulating abortion and pretending it’s all they can do. Cease to be a part of it and demand abortion’s total and immediate abolition and Roe’s nullification. When more people demand abolition than the number of people who demand murder be more heavily regulated, abortion will be abolished — and not before. Praise God, that day is coming near.

"425",425,"In Its First Year, Biden’s HHS Relentlessly Attacked Christians And Unborn Babies","Morrison","Rachel","N.",NA,NA,NA,"2022-03-18"," March 18 marks one year since pro-abortion radical Xavier Becerra was confirmed as President Joe Biden’s appointee for secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Although both men claim to be faithful Catholics, they have launched unprecedented attacks on people of faith by eliminating vital conscience and religious freedom protections and funneling millions of taxpayer dollars to the abortion industry.



At the HHS Accountability Project at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C., we have been keeping tabs on HHS personnel and policy. The oft-heard maxim “personnel is policy” is no exception for HHS, the largest federal agency by budget. While Becerra was AWOL on the Covid fight, he was outright zealous on culture war issues, leading HHS’s singular focus on pushing pro-abortion and anti-religion policies on the American people.



Here are the top 10 lowlights for year one.



1. Dismantling HHS’s Conscience and Religious Freedom Division



 One of Becerra’s early acts as secretary was to strip the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division within the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of its independent ability to investigate violations of conscience and religious freedom laws. The division was created during the Trump administration to guarantee enforcement rather than neglect of laws that protect these fundamental and inalienable rights. 



Becerra’s first budget proposal would have effectively eliminated this division as a standalone entity, despite Becerra having promised Congress that “the work [of the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division] will not change.” He, along with OCR political staff (such as political ideologue Laura Durso), refused to even consult with the dedicated career professionals of the division while they methodically removed conscience and religious freedom protections from the American people. 



These developments were foreshadowed by transgender activist Dr. Rachel Levine who, prior to being elevated to the number-three position at HHS, proclaimed the division should be “either disbanded or certainly redirected.” 



2. Removing OCR’s First Amendment Enforcement Power



Becerra removed OCR’s authority to enforce conscience and religious projections under the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the First Amendment. A leaked memo revealed this move came at the request of Lisa Pino, the Biden-appointed director of OCR. She is tasked with enforcing civil rights protections in health and human services, not finding ways to remove them. 



Remember, it was HHS under Obama that went after the Little Sisters of the Poor and lost under RFRA. Now Becerra has removed the only internal entity that would hold HHS accountable to the law.



3. Pushing a Ridiculously ‘Woke’ Budget



The Biden-Becerra HHS budget for fiscal year 2022 removed references to “conscience,” “religion,” and “Conscience and Religious Freedom Division.” But don’t worry, the new budget replaces references to these constitutional and statutory rights HHS is responsible for enforcing with a bunch of woke terms like “equity” — the Biden administration’s preferred priority.



4. Backing Forcing Nuns to Pay for Abortion 



While Becerra was attorney general of California before becoming HHS secretary, OCR issued two notices of violation against Becerra and his state for violating federal conscience protections by forcing nuns (and others) to provide insurance coverage of abortion. Apart from the clear conflict of interest with Becerra leading the very office that previously found him in violation of the law, OCR under Becerra “reassessed” the conscience violations, magically finding there were none.



5. Abandoning Nurse Illegally Forced to Participate in Abortion



In 2019, OCR found a hospital had violated a nurse’s conscience rights by forcing her to participate in an abortion over her known conscience objection. When the hospital refused to change its policies to comply with the law, the federal government sued the hospital in federal court. 



But on Becerra’s watch and despite his many promises to continue enforcing federal conscience laws, the Biden administration quietly dismissed the case without any settlement, agreement, or compensation for the nurse. Because federal conscience protection laws do not provide a private right of action, she cannot sue on her own and the violating hospital has been let off with impunity.



6. Relentlessly Pushing Abortion With Federal Resources



In response to Texas’ law protecting unborn children with beating hearts from abortion, the Biden-Becerra HHS announced, despite prohibitions on federal funds going to abortion, ways the department could “bolster access to safe and legal abortions in Texas.” HHS is awarding $10 million in additional funding to increase access to abortifacients for those affected by the Texas law. 



OCR issued pro-abortion guidance explaining how a federal conscience protection law can protect abortion providers and patients seeking abortions. If HHS’s actions weren’t clear enough, Becerra stated, “We are telling doctors and others involved in the provision of abortion care, that we have your back.” Becerra and OCR clearly don’t want to enforce the law for those who do not want to participate in abortion.



7. Directly Funding Big Abortion



Becerra, who has oddly and repeatedly refused to acknowledge that partial-birth abortion is illegal, led HHS’s charge to fund Big Abortion. In 2021, Planned Parenthood received more than $5.4 million in taxpayer funds from HHS, an amount that is sure to increase over the next three years.



In an effort to further fund Planned Parenthood, the Biden-Becerra HHS ignored democratic norms to rush through new Title X regulations. Title X is a federal program that provides grants for a range of family planning services, but per the statute, such services cannot include abortion. 



The new regulations, however, remove the requirement of physical and financial separation between Title X projects and abortion services, require abortion counseling and referrals, and remove conscience protections for Title X providers. Planned Parenthood had dropped out of the Title X program under those regulations, forfeiting that funding stream, but under the new regulations the abortion giant is expected to receive significant Title X funding.



8. Comingling Insurance Payments for Abortion



Last summer, HHS rushed through new insurance regulations that, contrary to the text of the Affordable Care Act, no longer require separate insurance payments for abortion services, allowing those payments to be comingled with payments for other covered services. Besides violating the law, combined payments create a lack of transparency and accountability. Consumers with conscience objections to abortion will no longer be on notice that their insurance plan covers abortion or that they are subsidizing abortions, including for any adult children on their plan.



9. Rescinding Faith-Based Waivers



Prompting a congressional inquiry, the Biden-Becerra HHS gratuitously rescinded waivers previously issued to faith-based adoption and foster care agencies in Michigan, South Carolina, and Texas that allowed the agencies to qualify for HHS grants while operating in accordance with their deeply held religious beliefs. In the press release announcing the rescission, Becerra unironically stated: “At HHS, we treat any violation of civil rights or religious freedoms seriously.” 



Please. This action comes on the heels of a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court affirming the constitutional right of foster-care agencies to act according to their religious beliefs on human sexuality in certifying foster parents.  



10. Issuing Totalitarian Anti-Conscience Rules



HHS announced its new interpretation and enforcement of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act that would force health-care professionals to perform gender transition surgeries and provide minors with harmful and sterilizing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A new rule codifying this interpretation is anticipated in April and would likely not exempt providers with medical or conscience objections. HHS is also planning to rescind conscience regulations that protect health-care professionals from being forced to assist with abortions and protect others from having to pay for abortions.

"426",426,"Deception Drove Kansans To Vote Down Pro-Life ‘Value Them Both’ Amendment ","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-08-03"," Kansas voters yesterday rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have declared that the state constitution did not guarantee a right to abortion after out-of-state abortion activists flooded the Midwestern state with dark money and deceptive ads. With the vote now over, Kansans will soon discover the political dishonesty in play when the abortion industry descends on the state to expand operations while taking to the courts to strike the moderate pro-life laws still on the books.



The Value Them Both amendment included on Tuesday’s primary ballot sought to overturn the Kansas Supreme Court’s decision in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt that declared the state constitution guarantees a “fundamental right to abortion.” The amendment proved important because, with Dobbs’ holding that there is no federal constitutional right to abortion, overturning Hodes would have allowed the Kansas Legislature the opportunity to pass robust laws to protect the unborn for the first time in 50 years. 



While abortion activists and their apologists in the leftist media will claim that the 59 percent of voters saying “no” to the ballot measure, to a mere 39 percent of “yes” votes, proves the public disagrees with the reversal of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. But the millions spent by out-of-state leftist groups, coupled with the massive misrepresentation of the amendment, make such conclusions suspect. In the last half-year, more than 70 percent of the $6.54 million raised by the lead group campaigning against the amendment came from outsiders, compared to less than 1 percent of the $4.69 million donated by out-of-staters to the Value Them Both campaign. 



With a nearly $2 million cash advantage, outsiders succeeded in flooding Kansas with deceptive claims about the Value Them Both amendment, an amendment which, quite simply, would have returned the right to regulate abortions to the state legislature, providing:



“Because Kansans value both women and children, the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion. To the extent permitted by the constitution of the United States, the people, through their elected state representatives and state senators, may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, laws that account for circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or circumstances of necessity to save the life of the mother.”



In pushing Kansans to vote “no” to the amendment, the abortion activists inaccurately claimed: “The Legislature currently has the power to pose limits on abortion. To date, there are dozens of restrictions. What the Legislature can’t do is ban the procedure, as the Kansas Constitution currently guarantees access.”



In reality, the Hodes decision created a “fundamental right to abortion” under the Kansas constitution that surpassed the right previously guaranteed under Roe and Casey. And those dozens of restrictions on the books cannot withstand the strict scrutiny the Kansas Supreme Court established for judging regulations affecting abortions, including many passed with bipartisan support.



For instance, the “Woman’s Right to Know Act,” which includes a 24-hour waiting period plus the provision of information about abortion methods, risks, alternatives, pre-natal development, and county-by-county resources available to pregnant women, is subject to challenge and likely invalidation. While the abortion industry opposed that legislation, it passed the Kansas Senate 36-0 and 118-0 in 1997. The “Woman’s Right to Know & See” law, passed in 2009, will similarly be subject to a constitutional challenge. That statute requires that options be provided to view and receive copies of a sonogram and was opposed by the Aid for Women abortion facility and Planned Parenthood. It passed the Senate 32-6 and the House 85-37.



Parental-consent laws will likewise soon face court challenges, such as the 2011 law that requires two-parent consent for abortions on minors, with some exceptions. The Kansas National Organization of Women, Planned Parenthood, and Trust Women all opposed that legislation, which passed the Senate 24-15 and the House 100-22.



The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which bans abortions at 22 weeks with limited exceptions, will be another sure target of abortionists. Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs, such a second-trimester ban would be permissible but for the Kansas decision in Hodes. And under Hodes, the statute is doomed even though it passed the Senate 24-15 and the House 94-28. The ban on second-trimester dismemberment abortions — those where the fetus is killed by the abortionist ripping the living human being apart limb-by-limb — struck by the Kansas Supreme Court in Hodes, of course also remains banned with the defeat of the amendment.



Taxpayer-funded abortion will likely soon be required too, with a challenge to the Pro-Life Protections Act, which prohibits taxpayer funding of abortion. That statute also bans sex-selective abortions and requires anti-coercion warnings inside clinics, but those provisions will likely be declared unconstitutional in the near term. Conscience provisions and health and safety standards, including the requirement that physicians perform abortions, will also soon be on the chopping block. 



The experience in other states where courts have similarly found a constitutional right to abortion teaches that these laws have little chance of surviving. What is less clear is the strategy the abortion complex will adopt to attack the statutes. Will they wait until the public’s attention has moved on from the hard-fought battle over the Value Them Both amendment? Or will they move immediately to have the laws declared unconstitutional? And will they challenge all the laws at once or in sequential lawsuits?



If the abortion industry moves too quickly, Kansans may realize they were lied to about the amendment, teeing up a do-over. But with border and other nearby states such as Oklahoma, Missouri, Nebraska, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and South Dakota banning or placing tight limits on abortions, abortionists in Kansas will likely be antsy to have the laws struck from the books so they can expand their operations without legal jeopardy. And when that happens Kansans will realize both that they have been deceived and that abortion activists have turned their state into the abortion oasis of the Midwest.



What happens at that point will be telling: Will Kansans accept an abortion-on-demand regime installed by their state court, or will they seek to reclaim the authority to regulate abortion consistent with their conservative values? For now, however, the only clear takeaway from the defeat of the Value Them Both amendment is that more innocent human lives will be lost to abortion.

"427",427,"Here’s Where Republican Presidential Candidates Stand On Pro-Life Policies After The GOP Debate","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-08-24"," Every candidate who took to the GOP primary debate stage on Wednesday may have a political party in common but their views on policies to protect unborn life varied widely. 



Fox News host and debate moderator Martha MacCallum kicked off the abortion portion of the Republican debate by asking candidates how they plan to market their pro-life positions to voters. 



“Abortion has been a losing issue for Republicans since the Dobbs decision,” MacCallum falsely claimed. “In six state referendums, all have upheld abortion rights in this country. And even in red states, there are more swing state referendums that are coming up as we head into the elections.”



Despite her inaccurate framing of the abortion issue, most candidates spoke candidly about their support for pro-life policies. Many of their promises to shield the unborn, however, fell short of the national 15-week abortion ban that more than half of Americans want and pro-life organizations such as SBA Pro-Life America say they require from candidates who want their approval.   



Here’s where all nine qualifying candidates stand on abortion after Wednesday night. 



Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis



DeSantis kicked off the abortion portion of the debate by condemning Democrats’ radical abortion-until-birth agenda but failed to commit to a federal abortion ban. 



The Republican’s track record as a pro-life governor is indisputable. DeSantis’ most recent pro-life accomplishment was a heartbeat bill that effectively bars abortion beyond six weeks gestation and offers more resources for new parents.  



DeSantis has repeatedly pledged that he’ll also be “a pro-life president.” In a recent interview with Megyn Kelly, however, DeSantis only offered to “be a leader with the bully pulpit to help local communities and states advance the cause of life” instead of signing a federal ban.




Gov. @RonDeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida.

 SBA Pro-Life America, one of the nation’s leading pro-life organizations, called DeSantis’ position in July “unacceptable.”



Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy 



Ramaswamy did not weigh in on abortion during the debate. 



In previous comments, Ramaswamy said he is “unapologetically pro-life.” Yet, so far, he has refused to back a national abortion ban like the one most Americans support, with a campaign spokesman telling Time Magazine that “As a constitutional matter, he believes it’s an issue for the states and not the federal government.” 



The billionaire later claimed he is “open-minded” towards a federal pro-life policy like the 15-week ban proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham but has not openly backed it. 



Former Vice President Mike Pence



Pence advocated from his debate podium for a national restriction on abortions beyond 15 weeks gestation.



“Can’t we have a minimum standard in every state in the nation that says when a baby is capable of feeling pain, an abortion cannot be allowed? A 15-week ban is an idea whose time has come. It’s supported by 70 percent of the American people,” Pence said. 



He also criticized his fellow candidates for failing to support a national ban. 



In a recent address at Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual conference, Pence encouraged every GOP presidential candidate to join him to “support a ban on abortion before 15 weeks as a minimum nationwide standard.”



South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott



“We cannot let states like California, New York, and Illinois have abortions on demand up until the day of birth. That is immoral. It is unethical. It is wrong,” Scott declared from his spot on the debate stage. “We must have a president of the United States who will advocate and fight for, at the minimum, a 15-week limit.”




""We must solve that issue with a 15 week limit [on abortion] at a minimum."" – Sen. Tim Scott pic.twitter.com/vGUcA1Cb1o— Virginia Allen (@Virginia_Allen5) August 24, 2023
In April, Scott expressed hesitancy to sign a 15-week ban.

Shortly after the CBS interview, he clarified that he would sign a 20-week abortion ban. 



By July, Scott said he was fully onboard with the proposed 15-week limit.

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley



Haley claimed from the debate stage to be “unapologetically pro-life” but repeated her belief that a federal abortion ban is “not realistic.” 



“When it comes to a federal ban, let’s be honest with the American people and say it will take 60 Senate votes, It will take a majority of the House. So in order to do that, let’s find consensus,” Haley said. “Can’t we all agree that we should ban late-term abortions?”



She was chastised onstage by Pence who said “consensus is the opposite of leadership.”

Haley also recently condemned Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s decision to slow-walk congressional approval of military promotions in protest of the Department of Defense’s radical abortion agenda, which illegally uses taxpayer dollars to subsidize service members’ time off and travel to get abortions.



Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie



Christie remained relatively quiet about abortion law on Wednesday night. He previously stated that the federal government “should not be involved” in legislating on life “unless and until there’s a consensus around the country from the 50 states making their own decisions about what it should be.” 




Chris Christie says at a CNN town hall that he believes each state should decide its own abortion laws.Asked whether he would sign a bill for a federal abortion ban as president if there was consensus, he said, ""That's a lot of ifs in there."" https://t.co/q5tmMi3pCk pic.twitter.com/RptBECmc8l— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) June 13, 2023
Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson



Hutchinson signed an abortion ban into law in Arkansas while he was governor. Despite acknowledging that national pro-life legislation might face hurdles in Congress, he agreed to sign a federal abortion ban into law as president. 



On the debate stage, Hutchinson confirmed his support for national abortion restrictions. He also corrected other candidates’ assertions that only states should legislate on unborn life. 



“It’s most likely going to be addressed in the states, but it’s certainly fine for it to be addressed at the national level as well,” Hutchinson argued. 



North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum



Burgum said he’s a “pro-life governor of a very pro-life state” but, during the debate, stood by his previous assertion that “we should not have a federal abortion ban.” 



Despite signing an abortion ban into law in his own state, Burgum has repeatedly claimed he will not support a federal abortion ban if he is elected to the White House. 



“I think the decision that was made returning the power to the states was the right one. And I think we’re going to have — we have a lot of division on this issue in America. And what’s right for North Dakota may not be right for another state … the best decisions are made locally,” Burgum said in June. 



Former President Donald Trump



Trump qualified for the debate but opted to spend his time in a sit-down interview with Tucker Carlson, who did not ask the Republican about his stance on unborn life. 



The arguable peak of Trump’s first term was his effort to appoint pro-life justices and judges who went on to rule against abortion in several landmark cases. 



More recently, however, Trump was scolded by pro-life organizations and his fellow candidates for criticizing heartbeat bills, misrepresenting the Supreme Court’s landmark Dobbs v. Jackson decision, and wrongfully blaming Republicans’ 2022 midterm losses on their unapologetically pro-life positions.

Central to the plurality’s reasoning was that “[a]n entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe’s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions.” This reasoning came as much of a surprise to Chief Justice William Rehnquist as it did to the millions of American women who certainly had not ordered their lives around abortion. In his opinion, Rehnquist disputed not only the assumption that Americans had grown accustomed to Roe, but the condescending suggestion that many women had “reached their ‘places in society’ in reliance upon Roe, rather than as a result of their determination to obtain higher education and compete with men in the job market.”  Twenty-four years later, a number of women undeterred by these cogent criticisms filed amicus curiae briefs in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (the Supreme Court’s most recent abortion decision, decided in 2016) (here and here), telling personal stories of seeking abortions. They argued that women continue to rely upon abortion to plan for and succeed in their education and careers. Those briefs have largely come to define popular discourse involving abortion. That’s unfortunate, because they gave short shrift to the life stories of the many women who have been harmed, injured, and even killed by legalized abortion. They neglected data on abortion rates and their effects on women’s health, relationships, and careers. They also grossly underestimated all the women who have advanced and are thriving despite or irrespective of legalized abortion. Indeed, in 1973, the Supreme Court justices surmised that legalized abortion would reduce poverty among women. While Roe might not be the source of the feminization of poverty, the hard truth is that in the four decades since Roe, the proportion of those living in poverty who are women has increased. One factor may be Roe’s transfer of all responsibility for children to women. By teaching uncommitted men that the proximate cause of a baby is the woman’s decision to give birth and not to abort—rather than the proximate cause being intercourse—women are the decision makers and therefore the cause of any child born. Since men have no rights regarding their unborn children, too many believe they have no responsibilities either.  Scholars have further conjectured that abortion has negatively affected the marriage market by limiting women’s bargaining power in the marriage choice. The availability of abortion as a “contraceptive” option has helped to make premarital sex more universally casual, and cohabitation frequently preferable to marriage. In gaining the option of abortion, many women are finding it more difficult to achieve the option of marriage. An even broader social challenge, with or without abortion, is the desire, calling, and need of many women to balance work and family. Many women hope for children, including the majority of those who first have an abortion, and many want to balance work and family. Longitudinal studies have proven that up to 75 percent of women who have an induced abortion will become pregnant again. In fact, an article in the New York Times in February 2018 noted that some millennial women doubt that they will be able to have as many children as they would like to have. Legalized abortion has also forestalled balance and flexibility in the workplace because women are expected to use the right to abortion to prevent any conflict between work and family. These expectations, whether latent or expressed, are found in every sector of business and are deeply detrimental to women’s well-being, as well as to that of their families.  Women do not and should not have to choose between their future and their family. In 1992, the Supreme Court staked its abortion doctrine on the notion that women require abortion in order to vie for equal opportunity. But in the years since, that notion has been proven wrong time and time again. Women achieve success despite and irrespective of abortion. Contrary to popular belief, overruling or overturning Roe would not immediately result in abortion being illegal nationwide. Most likely, the Supreme Court would simply reverse the decision and negate the federal constitutional right to abortion. Thus, overruling or overturning Roe would effectively return the abortion issue to the states, although bills both legalizing and limiting abortion nationwide would likely be introduced in Congress as well. While Justice Harry Blackmun penned the Roe decision that ushered in America’s abortion regime, he also reminded Americans that we are but a “single vote” away from overturning it. In the Trump moment, with passionate proponents of religious liberty and federalism back in the White House, that single vote seems to at least a possibility.

"429",429,"Democrats Should Put Some Blame For Their Electoral Losses On Planned Parenthood","Hawkins","Kristan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-12-08"," Not too long ago, the abortion industry noticed their identity as “pro-choicers” wasn’t conveying their position accurately or resonating with younger people. So they sought to change the messaging on abortion, pushing out radical feminists like Katha Pollitt, who declared abortion was a social good. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, opened up about her abortion in a major women’s magazine. Abortion advocates attempted to remove the stigma of abortion. In essence, they all dug in their spiked heels even deeper. In the 2016 election cycle, they threw everything they had behind their pantsuit-loving, history-making Democratic nominee. And it didn’t end well for them.  Richards campaigned for Hillary Clinton, joked about coordinating outfits on Twitter, and fangirled the nominee for months on end. Illyse Hogue, the president of NARAL and who has been rumored to be seeking the Democratic National Committee chairmanship, got a prime speaking slot at the Democratic convention over the summer and shouted her own abortion—a first for any speaker at a national convention—which drew cheers and applause. Democrats Eject Pro-Life Americans from Their Party The Democratic Party then passed its most extreme platform in history on abortion, calling for the end of the Hyde Amendment, which prevents taxpayer funding from paying directly for abortions, more funding for Planned Parenthood, and for abortion to remain legal throughout all nine months for any reason whatsoever. There was no mention of trying to help women facing unplanned pregnancies or fixing our broken national and international adoption system. It was abortion all the time, for any reason, and paid for by taxpayers. The bond between the Democratic Party and the abortion industry has been tight. Planned Parenthood spent at least $30 million on the election and, according to Open Secrets, none of this money went to Republicans.  The message is now clear: There is no room for pro-lifers in the Democratic Party. And what a shame that is. Democrats believe in many worthy policies that are meant to care for humanity, but if someone is not pro-abortion, they are being told they have no place in that party. There were once a dozen or so pro-life Democrats in the House of Representatives, but when they sold out their votes on Obamacare in 2009, giving House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the votes she needed to pass the bill, all but one of these representatives were defeated the next election cycle. The Republican platform is an anti-abortion one, but it’s not unheard of to have pro-choice Republicans hold office. Just look at the U.S. Senate or at the Republican National Committee or in any statehouse. Being pro-life is a core position of the Republican Party, but it’s possible to still be accepted into the GOP while not holding those views. Good luck with that for pro-life Democrats, which are nearly extinct. Your Party Is Too Extreme for Most Voters As the Democratic Party reviews their historic losses this cycle, they need to take a hard look at Richards and her buddies in the abortion lobby. They pushed and pushed abortion to the masses, becoming more and more radical as the cycle went on, ending with Hillary Clinton’s refusal in the last presidential debate to decry late-term abortion, something that is vastly unpopular with the American public.  The Institute for Pro-Life Advancement poll on millennials and abortion over the summer found that the positions Clinton and the DNC take on abortion are so extreme and radical that only 17 percent of millennials agreed with them that abortion should be legal at any time for any reason. If the 2016 election cycle isn’t enough of a wake-up call, the Democratic Party will soon learn their lesson from young adults, many of whom are appalled by the extremism of the abortion industry. More than half of millennials, in the same IPA poll, said abortion should be illegal in all or most circumstances. The exceptions of rape, incest, and the life of the mother constitute the “most circumstances” language. Planned Parenthood boasts of having 200 groups on college campuses, while Students for Life of America has more than 1,040 groups on college, high school, medical, and law campuses. On Election Day, Google Trends reported that the term “abortion” was the most-searched for all day. And look what happened. The candidate that embodied the most extreme agenda on abortion in history is now busy looking at cupcake recipes instead of whom to appoint as the next Supreme Court justice. If the Democrats want to die a slow death, they will allow themselves to be contaminated by Richards and her own radical agenda. If they want to expand, bring in new people, and create a party that accepts those who hold anti-abortion views, they need to cut Planned Parenthood loose, severing ties to an industry that betrays women, sells their babies for profit, and corrupts the entire political process. It’s a simple choice. What is it going to be, Democrats? ","https://thefederalist.com/2016/12/08/democrats-put-blame-electoral-losses-planned-parenthood/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"430",430,"I’m A Card-Carrying Feminist Who Voted For Donald Trump","Ellen Browder","Sue",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-11-22"," Yes, you read that headline correctly. But before a raging mob of anti-Trump protesters shows up on my lawn to beat me up in the name of love, please let me tell you why. When disappointed voters wave placards reading “Love Trumps Hate,” I agree with their words, but not with their rage. Certainly, love is better than hate. But as a pro-life family feminist, I’d like to add a corollary to that statement: Life Is Better Than Death. And that’s why I voted for Trump. Some college students feel so traumatized over the election results, they’ve been given “safe places” supplied with coloring books and Play-Doh to calm them. To such sad, troubled children, I long to say, “Be not afraid.” Pro-life family feminists like me (the silently majority of mothers who chose to give you birth) won this election. If President Trump is as pro-life as he claimed during his campaign—if he works to defund Planned Parenthood, undo the HHS Mandate, and appoint pro-life judges to the U.S. Supreme Court—all women (black, Hispanic, white, Asian and more) will win a huge victory, not just in this nation, but around the globe.  We Need A Pro-Life Supreme Court Judge When Planned Parenthood CEO President Cecile Richards recently said she thought “Roe v. Wade was on the ballot in this election,” I hope she was right. As Hobby Lobby CEO David Green observed, “Make no mistake, the vacancy left by Justice Scalia and the subsequent appointment to fill his seat makes this presidential election one of the most significant in modern times.” Because the HHS Mandate requires employers to provide abortion coverage, Green has worried that faithful Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others who oppose abortion are just one judge away from losing their religious liberty. But pro-life family feminists are also concerned we’re just one judge away from making our anti-human, slice-and-dice abortion laws even more deadly. If Hillary had won this election, she would have appointed pro-abortion Supreme Court justices. They likely would have favored Planned Parenthood in any abortion case that came before the Court, and would no doubt have kept Roe on the books for many decades to come. Abortion On Demand Has Hurt Women Abortion on demand has not freed women. On the contrary, abortion enhances men’s sense of sexual entitlement. The abortion “right” encourages predatory men (and marketers) to turn women’s bodies into commodities, to be displayed in public to sell products, and to be “used” publicly and privately for men’s sexual pleasure. If a woman accidentally becomes pregnant—if overnight she turns from being a sexy, autonomous woman, into a pregnant mother interconnected with others—no problem. She can simply dispose of the baby. Then she can once again become a hot, sexy woman to “used” in the marketplace or bedroom.  In a Medical Science Monitor study (the entire study can be downloaded for free here), 64 percent of post-abortive American mothers said they “felt pressured by others” to have the abortion. Additionally, 77.9 percent struggled with post-abortion guilt, and 59.5 percent felt “a part of me died.” And this is what privileged pro-abortion feminists like Hillary proclaim to be an empowering choice? Early Feminists Weren’t Pro-Abortion This is the first time in history that so many expectant mothers of all races have been hard-sold on the misleading idea that killing their preborn babies will somehow set them “free.” Suffragist Susan B. Anthony called abortion a “crying evil” that could begin to be remedied only when women were completely enfranchised and elevated. Nineteenth-century feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote “the degradation of women” was caused by the “murder of children, either before or after birth.” Quaker Alice Paul, the author of the original Equal Rights Amendment, called abortion “the ultimate exploitation of women.” Even Betty Friedan, who launched the 1960s women’s movement in 1963 with her book “The Feminine Mystique,” strongly renounced sexual politics and seemed ambivalent about the pro-abortion crusade. Late one Saturday night in November of 1967, in the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., Friedan helped ram the abortion plank into the National Organization for Women’s political “Bill of Rights.” The vote was 57 to 14.  Yet in the year 2000, in her book “Life So Far,” Betty (who’d once been fired for being pregnant) wrote, “Ideologically, I was never for abortion. Motherhood is a value to me, and even today, abortion is not … For me the matter of choice has never been primarily the choice of abortion, but that you can choose to be a mother. That is as important as any right written into the Constitution.” Feminist Pro-Lifers Have Always Been Strong Just six years after Roe v. Wade made abortion legal in all 50 states, anti-abortion family feminists were already well organized at the grassroots level. The revolution had begun. In September 1979, socialist author Michael Harrington drew a gasp from a crowd of well-heeled Planned Parenthood supporters when he called the right-to-life women’s movement “one of the few genuine social movements of the 1970s.” By 1979, NOW boasted a national membership of 100,000, and the National Right to Life Committee had 11 million members. Although for most of my life I was on the pro-abortion side of the fence, I’m now a pro-life family feminist. I consistently vote for pro-life candidates who advocate authentic freedom for women and children. Pro-life family feminists like me support equal pay for equal work, and equal educational opportunities regardless of whether a woman has children. We want mothers who choose to stay home with their children to be as honored for their achievements as career women are. We know that women (in fact, all humans) flourish best not when we stand isolated and alone, but when we’re interconnected in a strong, respectful bond with others. We love and work well with good, kind, responsible men (the type we seek out to marry and with whom we hope to have children). We reject sexual predators. We reject the illusion that a woman’s value is measured solely by her worldly power and the size of her paycheck. We especially reject the diabolic claim that it’s essential for a mother to be able to kill her own preborn baby in order for her to be a full and valued participant in society. Life Is the Great Civil Rights Issue Of Our Age Some people (self-styled “talk radio philosopher” Andy Schmookler, for one) like to sneer at “single-issue voters” like me. Schmookler claims that single-issue voters’ “understanding of the workings of the larger systems in their world (e.g., the U.S. government and the American and world economies) is limited.” Single-issue voters, he opines, have “neither the time nor the interest nor the background to develop a complex picture of American politics,” and so “they welcome a simple way to exercise their duties as citizens.” And that’s why he presumes women like me vote for life. I don’t know Schmookler. Nor do I personally know his views on abortion. But I would suggest it’s time for privileged, Harvard-educated men like him (who’ve always been at the forefront of abortion advocacy) to look beyond their intellectual prisons and to try to think with their hearts. Life is the essential civil rights issue of our times. If you’re dead at the hands of another—whether you’re black, brown, white, young, or old—all your human rights have been stolen from you. Doing whatever one can do within reason to help a living person stay alive is a simple matter of compassion and justice. Fortunately, in a democracy (at least in one that’s still alive and kicking), power doesn’t come from the top down. It grows from the ground up. Pro-life family feminists had grassroots power in 1979, and we still have that power today.   Yes, we’re the underdogs. Yes, the elite media scorn us. Yet despite the high odds against us, we just won an election. And this Thanksgiving, that gives many feminists I know a lot to be thankful for.

"431",431,"How Roe’s 50-Year Undoing Informs The Next Half-Century Of The Cause For Life","Bateman","Ashley",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-10-20"," In the most comprehensive text of its time, Pushing Roe v. Wade Over the Brink chronicles the tumultuous history of abortion in America, contextualizing the conception of pro-life giant Americans United for Life, from state legalization of abortion preceding Roe to the post-Roe present day.



Authors Clarke D. Forsythe and Alexandra DeSanctis spent two years compiling an extensive and multi-faceted review of academic, legal, medical, and social texts and cultural contributors to the modern reality of permissive abortion and euthanasia in America. Heavily referenced, Pushing Roe is readable and compelling, connecting multiple decades of cultural shifts and highlighting the tenuous dance between the legal and societal frameworks that must align to recognize the dignity of all life and put a final end to abortion.



“Pushing Roe tells the story of Americans United for Life (AUL) as much as it documents the history of the larger pro-life movement over its first half-century,” said Tom Shakely, AUL’s chief engagement officer. “As we move forward in this post-Roe America, it is crucial that pro-life advocates of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs know our history in order to successfully adapt strategies and tactics to changing circumstances in the decades to come.”



A Legal Giant



Steeped in the twofold history of population control and eugenic sterilization, Forsythe and DeSanctis describe the origins of the modern fight for life. Eugenics, they write, still held some fashionable appeal to politicians, scientists, and academics in the 1960s. Even WWII Nazism couldn’t completely stamp out what some legal academics saw as a possible necessity to curb “genetic deterioration.”



What began as a debate to legalize abortion in the early 1960s became a nationwide “crisis” by the end of the decade in politics and the courts and among cultural “elites.”



The authors compare the elitist pressure that “normalized” abortion to the most recent phenomenon of mask-wearing during Covid-19 lockdowns. “[P]eople did so largely because those elites had told them to,” they wrote.



One of the leading, and arguably most detrimental, organizations at the time was and remains the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the authors write. Founded in 1951, the organization turned to “ignoring substantial evidence to the contrary and contradicting its prior statements noting the risks of abortion,” testifying that abortion was 23 times safer than childbirth. This extremely influential group filed significant briefs, “without sanction of the members of the College or even of their Board of Directors.”



Officially founded in 1971, AUL initially focused on educating the public but quickly realized law and policy must be grappled with; engaging in the intellectual debate on abortion, AUL swiftly found its footing as a legal giant defending landmark abortion cases after the passage of Roe made abortion a federal right.



Networking with pro-life legislators, academics, and lawyers, as well as infiltrating the media to support the cause for life, also became part of the resistance.



Technology Beyond Ethical Consensus



Another driving force in the abortion debate, technology has advanced “beyond ethical consensus,” continuing to plague ethical societies in the West, according to the authors.



“Advancements in technology have always shaped American law,” Forsythe and DeSanctis write. Even as technology advanced to save prematurely born babies, new methods to kill the unborn were under development.



From the “turmoil” of law and bioethics, which marked the end of the 1960s, to the defense of prenatal protections during the 1970s, the authors describe how defining death outstripped the common law during this tumultuous time.



The subsequent threat to freedom of speech and conscience instigated by Roe has caused increased aggression toward life advocates and protesters of abortion.



The Clinton administration — which the authors describe as “the first president to aggressively push abortion” — tested the legal system further, with the nomination of pro-abortion justices. Following Clinton, George H.W. Bush’s administration supported the overturning of Roe v. Wade and regulations to Title X funding, but ultimately failed to move the legal decision regarding abortion back to the states.



Strategically returning to Washington, D.C., following the 2008 election, AUL positioned the organization at the heart of the battlefield, while subsequently ramping up its media presence and encouraging legislative limits on abortion. The authors ably describe the “public-health vacuum” consequences of Roe, in addition to the numerous scandals involving abortion “rights” and criminal activity like that of infamous abortionist Kermit Gosnell.



Life After Roe



The difficult work of “translating moral principles into law,” and applying practical wisdom to win the fight, is strenuous work AUL continues to undertake.



“Roe dictated the legal, political, financial, and social structures that have shaped the abortion issue for more than four decades,” the authors write, but it also “contained the seeds of its own destruction.”



Adapting and proving resilient through legal attacks is a momentous undertaking that AUL has never abandoned. Often uphill, the organization’s continuous fight for the rights of society’s most vulnerable encompasses decades of victories and setbacks in a struggle that continues in the post-Roe era. Shakely sums up the struggle this way:




Since before Roe, Americans of goodwill have recognized that abortion warps the human heart. Ever since Roe was handed down, and even after Dobbs and to this day, the battle for America’s heart rages on. This is because America’s half-century legal abortion regime changed America by teaching Americans to embrace abortion as if it were a positive good. And in accepting abortion in this way, we’ve come to tell ourselves all sorts of related fictions about the human person. Too many have come to believe that human persons are disposable, at whatever age and stage in life. We see this playing out across the spectrum of human right to life issues, still with abortion federally and across the states, as much as with assisted suicide, patients’ rights, conscience protections, and denial of care situations.




The underserved, the vulnerable, and the ignorant all suffer because abortion disserves every single person connected to it, from the lawmakers and citizens who support it, to the provider whose hands deliver it, to the woman who endures it, to the child whose life is taken before leaving the womb. Americans once recognized this web of connected degradation as a threat to “inherited ethical and political ideals,” but history hides so many facets of the debate.



The Judeo-Christian ethic, belief systems that inherently “elevated the protection of human life” over millennia, were foundational to American ethics until recent decades. The good of the entire country and culture is dependent on the struggle to reveal these foundational truths.



“What we’ve learned at Americans United for Life, and as pro-life advocates across the spectrum of life issues, is that the pro-life movement has been and will remain essential for America’s health and prosperity,” Shakely said. “When we know our history in all its richness, we can confidently go about the continuing work of building towards a future full of hope.”

"432",432,"7 Ways Planned Parenthood Breaks Hearts Every Day","Russell","Nicole",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-02-14"," Just in time for Valentine’s Day, Planned Parenthood, that bastion of selflessness and love, called for folks to donate to the organization to “break Mike Pence’s heart.” This, of course, is supposed to be a humorous wink-wink, nod-nod to the time actress Mila Kunis revealed she had been pranking the vice president by donating to an organization he loathes in his name.  You can have a great sense of humor and still know there’s nothing funny about Planned Parenthood. Here are seven ways Planned Parenthood breaks hearts for fun and profit.  1. The FBI Is Investigating Planned Parenthood For Trafficking Human Body Parts Remember a few years ago a barrage of undercover videos came out showing Planned Parenthood systematically harvesting and selling human body parts they obtain during abortions? Planned Parenthood is still suffering from the effects of those videos. First the House Oversight Committee investigated them, then the Senate Judiciary Committee launched an investigation and found “The activities of those involved in the fetal tissue transfer industry potentially implicate a number of federal laws.” Finally, both committees found enough disturbing evidence of wrongdoing they told the FBI it needed to launch its own probe. In his recommendation, Sen. Chuck Grassley said, “The report documents the failure of the Department of Justice, across multiple administrations, to enforce the law that bans the buying and selling of human fetal tissue. It also documents substantial evidence suggesting that the specific entities involved in the recent controversy, and/or individuals employed by those entities, may have violated that law.” You have to hand it to PP: despite these ongoing investigations and documentation of evildoing, they keep forging ahead, asking people for donations and aborting babies like there’s just nothing to see here.  2. Planned Parenthood Will Apparently Receive Taxpayer Dollars Until the End Of Time Despite being under FBI investigation, somehow PP still receives more than $500 million in annual federal subsidies, funneled through Medicaid, which in and of itself should be a crime. One of the first things the House Oversight Committee found in its initial investigation was Planned Parenthood needs no federal funds to operate. Americans are somewhat divided on whether abortion should be legal, but clear majorities oppose taxpayer funding for it. Luckily for Planned Parenthood, congressional Republicans are unwilling to go to the mat on this issue. They continue to preserve funding for an entity their own investigations have found commits moral and legal atrocities. Think of where $500 million could go if not toward Planned Parenthood. It could bolster Medicaid or even go back to taxpayers so they can spend their own money on their own health care. Giving Planned Parenthood $500 million is a poor use of taxpayer dollars at best, and a crime at worst. 3. Planned Parenthood Provides Substandard Health ‘Care’ Planned Parenthood hangs its hat on providing women health care, but not only do they actually provide more abortions than they do actual health care, their facilities aren’t always up to medical standards either. That’s why many have closed over the last few years.  Abby Johnson is a former Planned Parenthood manager and the founder of an organization that helps women leave the abortion industry, And Then There Were None. She reported that “It was because of two former abortion workers that Planned Parenthood in Delaware was temporarily shut down. The women went to authorities with evidence of dirty equipment and ‘bloody drainage’ left on operating tables between women having abortions. It was disgusting.” At the March for Life in January, I met several women who had worked at Planned Parenthood facilities and found the atmosphere to be as unprofessional as it was emotionally draining. Annette Lancaster worked for nine months in 2015 at a Planned Parenthood in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and told me, “Physicians often talked badly about patients while performing procedures on them. Sometimes physicians would not use the proper amount of sedation. They would tell the patient they were providing them with certain medications, but they were out, so the patient didn’t get it.” So much for great health care. 4. Planned Parenthood Targets Minority and Special Needs Babies for Death Planned Parenthood likes to say they care about minorities, but little could be further from the truth. Far more African-American babies are aborted by population than are Caucasian babies, and in New York City, more African-American babies are aborted than born. In a rare, strange transparent moment, a Planned Parenthood group actually tweeted that African-American women are safer aborting their babies than birthing them. So instead of providing better maternity care to African-Americans, let’s just kill their kids? That’s Planned Parenthood’s grisly logic. Protecting Black Life, an outreach of Life Issues Institute, found in 2012 that “Planned Parenthood targets women of color for abortion by placing 79 percent of its surgical abortion facilities within walking distance of minority neighborhoods.” Planned Parenthood also targets babies with Down Syndrome. In March 2016, Planned Parenthood sued for the right to target babies with Down Syndrome for abortion, and won the case when federal judge Tanya Pratt struck down an Indiana law that would have prevented this. 5. Planned Parenthood Enables Sex Trafficking Last year, several organizations reported that Planned Parenthood helped cover up sex trafficking. Live Action published developments from a 2011 investigation of Planned Parenthood’s involvement in underage sex trafficking. “During the original investigation, eight Planned Parenthood staffers and directors at seven clinics around the country were caught on camera teaching undercover investigators posing as pimps and prostitutes how to traffic underage sex slaves through the health-care system without being caught. The follow-up investigation revealed that Planned Parenthood consistently failed to report incidents of possible sex abuse and trained directors how to spot undercover journalists rather than how to spot sex traffickers following the original investigation.” This kind of thing makes an organization that boasts how much they care about women look like what it is: a big, fat hypocrite. 6. Planned Parenthood’s Marquee Product, Abortion, Hurts Everyone Abortion doesn’t just hurt babies, it hurts their mothers, grandmothers, aunts, and other women, as well as the men involved in the process. As The Federalist recently reported, a recent study by Priscilla Coleman, Ph.D., et al., called “Women Who Suffered Emotionally from Abortion: A Qualitative Synthesis of Their Experiences,” “looked at multiple variables that affect how women adjusted to their post-abortive experiences.” It found women suffer following abortion, mentally and emotionally. “Prior to their first pregnancy resulting in an abortion, 13 percent of those surveyed reported having visited a psychiatrist, psychologist, or counselor, compared to 67.5 percent who received mental health services after their first abortion.” The study found women increased drug use following abortions, to numb the emotional pain. “Of the women surveyed, only 6.6 percent reported using psychotropic drugs prior to their first pregnancy resulting in an abortion, compared to 51 percent who stated they used prescription drugs for mental health issues after their abortion. The results of the study demonstrate abortion’s dynamic nature, and successfully capture the kaleidoscope of emotions that women internalize after having the procedure.” Abortion hurts men, too. Recently, while following discussion of the Pain-Capable Act, a gentleman told me he had helped his girlfriend have an abortion and, to this day, still thinks about their baby, the hurt he helped cause, and how he wishes he had made a different decision. While there’s not nearly enough research about the men involved in making decisions about abortion, often when men finally do speak out, it’s the opposite of what Planned Parenthood would have you believe. 7. Planned Parenthood Aborts Babies Last but certainly not least, it’s hard to think of something more heartbreaking than just the simple fact that PP’s primary goal as an organization is to snuff out the life of tiny humans about to be born. Not to mention the way they do this is cruel, ghoulish, painful, and yes, heartbreaking. Over the summer, Federalist correspondent John Daniel Davidson described the week-long event of an unusual court case wherein a group of abortion providers tried to claim they shouldn’t have to kill a fetus before dismembering it. While the case did not specifically involve Planned Parenthood, (it was Whole Woman’s Health), expert witnesses did describe second-trimester abortions, which Planned Parenthood also performs. Davidson wrote about the expert witness testimony of Dr. Anthony Levatino, a former abortion doctor, who described these kinds of abortions (trigger warning): He went on to describe a 20-week-old fetus as being about the size of the palm of an adult hand, from fingertip to wrist, ‘not counting the legs.’ A dismemberment abortion, he explained, involves reaching into a woman’s uterus with forceps and ‘grabbing whatever is there. Maybe you rip off a leg, which is about four-inches long,’ then you pull out ‘an arm, the spine. The skull is the most difficult part. Sometimes there’s a little face staring up at you.’ He understandably called it ‘an absolutely brutal procedure, in which a living human being is torn to pieces.’ There is little more ghoulish than a second-trimester abortion other than perhaps a third-trimester abortion, and PP supports both without pause or shame.

"433",433,"Yes, Planned Parenthood Targets And Hurts Poor Black Women","Krumholz","Willis","L.",NA,NA,NA,"2016-02-18"," Last year, my buddy (we’ll call him “Andy”) told me how his girlfriend (“Helen”) had a terrible weekend. Helen worked as an overnight nurse at a local hospital’s emergency room. In the early hours of Saturday morning, a young woman who had recently had an abortion came in, deathly sick, with septic shock. It was determined that pieces of the fetus, not completely removed during the procedure, led to the sepsis. Later that day, another young woman came in who had just had an abortion, also with sepsis caused by fetal remains.  “Helen’s pretty shaken up,” Andy said. “She says both girls almost died.” I asked Andy about the two young women. Both were black, and about Helen’s age; both had their abortions at the local Planned Parenthood affiliate in St. Paul, Minnesota. I then explained to Andy that Planned Parenthood generally doesn’t use ultrasound when performing abortions—it costs too much and takes too much time, cutting down on margins. Not using ultrasound is like operating with a blindfold. The abortionist can “feel around” for fetal tissue, but doesn’t want to feel around too much, as this would risk perforating the lining of the uterus. “That’s so sad, so messed up,” said Andy, who until then had been largely agnostic about abortion. Planned Parenthood and its fellow abortion providers are no friends to black women, yet they are heavily subsidized by Congress. Rep. Gwen Moore recently argued the opposite in the Washington Post, that “Abortion clinics don’t ‘target’ the black community.” That’s plain false. Look at the facts, partisanship aside. Watch for the Statistical Dodge Moore begins by citing a commonly used Guttmacher Institute statistic (Guttmacher is Planned Parenthood’s research arm): “fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majority-black neighborhoods.”  This statistic is spurious. Because black Americans comprise only 12 percent of the U.S. population, relatively few areas in America are majority black. By neighborhood, Guttmacher means ZIP code. Only 2 to 4 percent of U.S. ZIP codes have a majority black population. Only 3 percent of counties have a majority black population. It makes business sense for Planned Parenthood to reside in urban areas with high concentrations of people, of which a high portion are poor. Using Guttmacher’s own findings, however, almost 10 percent of America’s high-volume abortion clinics (performing more than 400 abortions per year) exist in those majority-black ZIP codes. Clinics in neighborhoods where non-whites are the majority, only around 15 percent of U.S. neighborhoods, make up 40 percent of all abortion clinics in the United States. This means that, even on Guttmacher’s own showing, abortion clinics are indeed disproportionately found where the local population is predominantly minorities. Guttmacher’s misleading statistic on “black neighborhoods” was contrived to counter a statistic put out by a pro-life group. This group pointed out that 79 percent of Planned Parenthood’s surgical abortion facilities are located within a two-mile radius, or walking distance of, a black or Hispanic neighborhood (what the Census Bureau calls a tract), defined as either having a “minority population at or above 50 percent,” “minority populations at least 1.5 times higher than the average percentage of the surrounding county,” or “a minority population equal to or greater than the average national minority population: 12.6 percent African American or 16.3 percent Hispanic/Latino.” The numbers don’t lie. Abortion clinics do disproportionately reside in minority neighborhoods. Planned Parenthood, especially, resides in urban, poor, and minority areas. This is no conspiracy. Rather, it makes business sense for Planned Parenthood to reside in urban areas with high concentrations of people, of which a high portion are poor.  Poverty Doesn’t Explain This Moore says “[conservatives’] goal is to intimidate and inflict trauma while limiting the health care choices for pregnant women in need.” She goes on to blame poverty and the lack of proper contraceptive access for the stunningly high black abortion rate—abortions of black children make up almost 40 percent of total U.S. abortions each year, despite black Americans comprising only 12 percent of the population. Abortions of black children make up almost 40 percent of total U.S. abortions each year, despite black Americans comprising only 12 percent of the population. Poverty alone does not explain the high black abortion rate. There are almost twice as many poor whites as there are poor blacks in America, yet black women who live below the federal poverty line contribute to 14 percent of the nation’s abortions, while poor white women contribute to only 11.7 percent of the nation’s abortions. Poverty also fails to explain the lack of birth-control access among poor black American women. In the 1990s, even though Title X funding steadily increased and the poverty rate fell, the number of unintended pregnancies poor minority women had began to skyrocket. That trend persists until the present. According to the American Prospect, while the average abortion patient used to be “[a] middle-class, white high-school or college student with no children whose bright future could be derailed by motherhood,” today she is more likely to be “a twenty something single mother of color,” because an unexplained “[l]oss of [birth control] access for poorer [minority] women” occurred in the first half of that decade. What then, can explain the high black abortion rate? Moore decries the lack of birth control access among poor black women even while Planned Parenthood gets millions every year from the public purse to provide contraception to low-income women. Are these women served well? Guttmacher reports that “minority women, women who are poor, and women with little education are more likely than women overall to report dissatisfaction with either their contraceptive method or provider.” Isn’t Planned Parenthood their main contraception provider? Blame Planned Parenthood for Its Clients’ Poor Access As I’ve extensively outlined in the past, Planned Parenthood is to blame for the high black abortion rate. Because black Americans are disproportionately poor, black women of childbearing age disproportionately rely on Medicaid, or are uninsured. Black Americans also disproportionately reside in urban areas. Planned Parenthood is like the Veterans Administration, only Planned Parenthood is actually efficient at abortion. Planned Parenthood is also largely urban-focused, mostly due to Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and Title X. Title X essentially pays Planned Parenthood to locate next to poor populations. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which allowed states to regulate abortion providers, brought higher fixed costs, increasing the appeal of urban areas to leverage economies of scale through higher abortion volumes. Planned Parenthood gained immense market share after Casey was decided in 1992, due to competitors’ retrenchment in the face of the regulatory onslaught, and this strengthened monopolistic power corresponds with the loss of birth-control access that occurred among poor women during this time. Next, women in urban areas who are uninsured or receive Medicaid (who are also disproportionately black) find few choices outside the local Planned Parenthood affiliate. Medicaid grossly under-compensates providers who don’t also receive Title X funds (of which Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient), and Title X providers offer the only avenue for uninsured women to receive women’s health care. Rather than empowering women, this system accomplishes the opposite, namely through lack of choice. Rather than empowering women, this system accomplishes the opposite, namely through lack of choice. According to a Guttmacher study, 6 in 10 women who visited a “specialty contraceptive clinic” (a Title X grantee) considered the clinic their “usual source of medical care,” while 4 in 10 women surveyed considered the clinic their “only source of health care.” Because this study only looked at clinics in areas with multiple Title X grantees, many women frequenting Planned Parenthood experience an even greater lack of choice. Due to this lack of competition, Planned Parenthood is free to undersupply its low-margin or loss-making product, contraception, to steer customers towards abortion, its high-margin product. A similar situation was seen in post-Soviet Romania, where doctors were heavily compensated for abortion relative to birth control. I estimated that between 30 and 50 percent of Planned Parenthood’s $91 million in profit during its last reported fiscal year comes from abortion. Planned Parenthood is like the Veterans Administration, only Planned Parenthood is actually efficient at abortions, a cash business with high profit margins. Poor Black Women Suffer to Protect Democrats To Moore and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, along with the rest of the Democrat Party: I understand you are for “choice,” but how long can you put your party’s interests above the interests of poor, black women? Many of these women directly support you, through volunteering, donating, and voting. Will they never find out what is being done? Will the light of day never shine through? Let them compete for the funds with other OB-GYNs, and let the consumer decide who gets the money. Congress could act now to end the high black abortion rate. Foster competition: Give every poor woman a “women’s health insurance” card they are free to use at any OB-GYN in the nation. Pay for this with the Title X funds currently allocated to Planned Parenthood. Lawmakers should agree that this insurance can’t be used for abortion—that’s already the status quo with Title X. Republicans would surely increase funding for women’s health care under such a program. Don’t worry: if Planned Parenthood is so great, it will still be around. Let it compete with other OB-GYNs for the funds, and let the women who use these services decide who gets the money. Black lives matter. And the lives of black babies matter, too. Let’s act to protect them now. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that black women comprise 12 percent of the U.S. population. Black men and women together comprise that 12 percent. We regret the error. ","https://thefederalist.com/2016/02/18/yes-planned-parenthood-targets-and-hurts-poor-black-women/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"434",434,"No, Pro-Lifers Aren’t Racists Who Only Want To Save White Babies","Stone","Lyman",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-06-29"," Thursday morning, progressive Christian writer Rachel Held Evans wrote a Twitter thread about the possibility that Roe v. Wade may be overturned once Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is replaced. Rather than make some kind of cogent-but-wrong progressive argument, she leapt straight to some completely unjustifiable insinuations about pro-life people. Basically, in her now-deleted thread, she claimed that pro-life people’s opposition to abortion is based on a belief that most saved babies would be white, and that if we knew that the saved babies would be black, we would probably be pro-choice. While the thread is gone, this screencap is illustrative:   Deleted tweet: pic.twitter.com/3xPwglcfrm
— Joseph Ashby (@JosephAshbyShow) June 28, 2018  Rhetorically, the tweets sounded even-keeled, but they represent a phantasmagorical world. Unfortunately, rather than rebut her position with facts, some on Twitter apparently responded to Evans with threats and insults, which is what led her to delete her thread. The antidote to this kind of mob responsive is to show, in plain and non-inflammatory terms, why Evans’ aspersions of pro-life people are wrong. We Know We’re Saving Minority Babies: That’s the Point First of all, pro-life conservatives are very well aware abortions target non-white people more heavily. Vox, hardly a right-wing propaganda site, recently ran an entire expose on “Abortion as black genocide.” The tagline is, “A new documentary examines how fears of ‘black genocide’ became part of mainstream anti-abortion activism.” Even a left-leaning site recognizes that explicit anti-racism is a key part of mainstream pro-life activism! However ferociously a site like Vox may favor abortion, even they are bound to a basic standard of journalistic honesty, and by that standard everyone must recognize that many, maybe even most, pro-life activists consider their activism to be explicitly anti-racist, and working to undo a horrible racial crime. Far from showcasing white babies, to see that pro-life advocates have a central concern for uniquely targeted or vulnerable families, including racial minorities, all you need to do is to go to the website of your local pregnancy center. The pregnancy center that my wife and I support, on their “impact” page, shows children of several races.  Pro-life advertising isn’t more or less focused on white babies than any other form of advertising is, and very well may be even more focused on minority kids, because we recognize that the perverse combination of racially concentrated poverty and legalized abortion combine to enable extermination of a huge number of African American, Native American, and Hispanic children. The Pro-Choice Movement Originated in Racist Eugenics Even more importantly, Evans is trying to flip the script on history. The origins of Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, are not mysterious. Margaret Sanger, who was instrumental in founding the “Birth Control League,” explicitly argued for using abortion and birth control to reduce or eliminate racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. There’s no serious historic debate that the rise of reproductive technologies in the early twentieth century was closely tied to efforts to exterminate or control “undesirable” populations. Most abortion activists today do not advocate for exterminating specific racial groups, thankfully. Modern activists believe themselves to be protecting women’s rights, not continuing the legacy of racial inequality begun with slavery and continued through the medical racism of Tuskegee in the mid-twentieth-century and Planned Parenthood today. Yet if either side were to be expected to be unpleasantly surprised by more black and Hispanic babies being born, it’s clear which side that would be: the pro-choice side. The movement began with eugenics. While it has shed that baggage as far as race is concerned, it nonetheless continues to militate against childbearing generally.  Furthermore, the eugenicist project continues unabated with regards to disabled people. Countries like Iceland and Denmark brag about eliminating Down Syndrome: what they mean is that they have murdered all of the disabled children before they were born. The job Adolf Hitler couldn’t complete with Aktion T4, the abortion doctors of the (overwhelmingly white) Nordic countries are well on their way to achieving. Even in the United States, aborting disabled children is extremely common. This is just good-old-fashioned eugenics, and it’s unapologetic. So, again, for Evans to imply that it’s pro-life people who are tacitly in favor of the eugenic reduction or extermination of a people group is absurd. We celebrate kids with disabilities. We center them in our rhetoric and vigorously assert their worthiness to live and their dignity. On the contrary, it’s pro-choicers who run op-eds in major newspapers celebrating the selective murder of disabled children. Racism Is Definitely Not a One-Party Deal More broadly, Evans’ point that conservatives are terrified of a non-white population boom is not correct. Sure, some “conservatives” wet their pants over having Hispanic neighbors. This kind of racism is very real and very awful. Also, you may notice that racial segregation is no better in very blue cities than in other places: practically speaking, there are racists of all political stripes. For example: Washington, DC is about 95 percent Democratic. I live in a two-bedroom apartment less than a block from a metro stop with three lines at it. There’s a bikeshare on my corner. We have ample parking all the time, and trendy restaurants within 10 blocks. Indeed, one of DC’s most bustling new areas, H Street, is about a 15-minute walk away, or a few minutes on a bike. Yet my rent is less than $1,500 a month. People just four or five blocks away pay twice that. The reason is simple: across the street is a majority-black high school. When they learn where I live, many otherwise progressive people have asked me, “Do you have problems with the…. Students? You know, the…. youths? Any problems? How about, um, crime? Is the… crime, you know, bad?” It’s this wonderful coded language where the person can make an extremely racist assumption that having a lot of black kids across the street is dangerous, but never actually say racist words. If this were just a few people, then we could write it off. But I live in a mid-sized building where every unit is this cheap, and the neighboring apartments are similar. These prices are low because, in 95 percent Democratic DC, demand is low for these units. Demand is not low due to bad parking or bad transit or a long commute or bad housing conditions: demand is low because a very large number of cocktail party DC progressives will pay $500 extra per month to not have black high schoolers walking through their alleyway on the way to school.  Real, hardcore racism, the kind that divides our neighborhoods and schools and segregates black people into neighborhoods with little opportunity, turns out to be alive and well in America’s most progressive cities. Demographic Angst Is Not Necessarily Racism More to the point, an appreciable share of conservatives have recently begun to identify as “pro-natal,” meaning we favor higher national birth rates. Some of us also have explicitly called for vastly higher immigration rates, especially from Sub-Saharan Africa. Pro-natal conservatives are very aware, in excruciating detail, that higher birth rates would hasten the non-whitening of America. Guess what? That’s fine! Is there demographic angst among some conservatives? Yes. I abhor the laments about “other people’s babies,” etc. We should celebrate life, and we should celebrate the growth of the nation. But it’s key to keep in mind that while a hard core of racist opposition to demographic change can be found among people registered in both parties, much of conservative opposition to demographic change is indirect. Demographic change is a proxy for concerns about other cultural changes driven by partisanship. Conservatives tend to believe (erroneously) that immigrants commit more crimes. We tend to believe (sometimes correctly, but usually wrongly) that immigrants present high risks of terrorism. We tend to believe (wrongly) that immigrants suppress wages. We tend to believe (rightly) that immigrants and minorities are overwhelmingly more likely to vote Democratic, even if they don’t support the radical cultural changes the Democratic Party supports. In other words, demographic change is a proxy for concerns about other cultural changes driven by partisanship. I think conservative anti-immigrant sentiments are mostly unfounded, so I favor more immigration, but the main driver of conservative concerns about immigration, I think, is not “concern that the neighbor’s dinner will be rice instead of burgers,” but rather, “concern that the Democratic Party is diluting native votes with an extremely culturally dissimilar group, which may enable the Democratic Party to impose cultural norms that Republicans abhor.” I get why some progressives would still find this view offensive (some people love to be offended), but it’s a far cry from the overt racism Evans imputes to conservatives. Crucially, it explains conservative behavior more accurately. It explains why Mexican immigration is opposed, but Cuban immigration isn’t. It explains why conservatives who on Monday loudly and crudely fear being replaced by “other people’s babies” on Tuesday argue passionately for those babies to be born. It explains the conservative fixation on “immigrant quality” and “merit.” The fear is not, for most of us, about race, it is about partisanship, and an awareness that however personally conservative many immigrants may be, the Democrats they elect will not be. Online Harassment Is Wrong and Not Representative Before I conclude, however, I should note why Evans deleted her thread: harassment. Attacking a person with threats and ill-speaking is never convincing. More to the point, it has become unfortunately common in some strands of the American right. Indeed, the alt-right in particular engages in an enormous amount of online harassment. The problem is, with such an inflated online presence, they make their own idiosyncratic positions seem normative for conservatives. One person tweeted to me, observing the same trend I have: https://twitter.com/MyronGaines1337/status/1012341450019753987 Indeed, whenever I write about fertility, abortion, and minorities, it only takes a little while for a half-dozen trolls and their gazillion sock-puppet accounts to show up and start tweeting about how, really, we should want fewer minority babies. While these people are big on Twitter and make it a hostile and inhospitable place, few conservatives want to abort a baby for being black. Nobody who calls themselves pro-life wants that. Further, the few real, offline people who are so concerned about “demographic change” that they will tolerate the murder of the unborn should and must be exorcised from conservatism, drawn out like the poison they are. When you hate someone so much that you would murder the innocent child in her womb rather than let the child possibly join the other political party, you have revealed yourself to be a pants-wetting political coward who, rather than play the game, smashes the board like a petty child. To any such alt-right weirdos reading this: grow up. The Pro-Life Movement Is About Justice Pro-life people believe the unborn are people too and thus deserve justice. Their right to life should be honored. All abortions are tragic; none individually more so than others. Go to a pro-life conference: you’ll find a lot of minority moms and disabled survivors. Beyond the individual tragedy of a murdered babe, there is an additional national tragedy and injustice when the scourge of abortion especially ravages racial or ethnic groups who also face centuries-old racial discrimination and segregation. Pro-life activists are well aware of this additional tragedy. Indeed, the black pro-life activists who call abortion a “black genocide” are particularly aware of this double tragedy. White activists in the pro-life movement have, imperfectly of course, tried to step aside and make space for groups especially targeted by abortion to tell their stories. Go to a pro-life conference: you’ll find a lot of minority moms and disabled survivors. The point Evans was struggling to make, of course, was not that pro-lifers are racist (I am unsure if she really believes that), but that pro-life people can’t just stop at birth: we should favor real financial support for parents and kids too. I agree. We cannot stop at birth. For starters, we must protect the lives of the elderly as well and oppose euthanasia. Pro-Lifers Hold All Sorts of Views about Redistribution But beyond that, we should indeed provide generous support to families. Conservative movements in Poland, Georgia (country, not state), and Hungary are taking huge strides to reduce child poverty and housing insecurity in their countries by providing generous per-child cash benefits to families. American conservatives should do the same, and, notably, the recent tax reform substantially increased the child tax credit. Evans is absolutely correct that pro-life people should enact their beliefs, not just by ending abortion, but by embedding support for childbearing, marriage, and the family in law and fiscal policy. Abortion rates have been steadily falling for over 20 years with virtually no correlation to changes in government spending. But while pro-life people should do these things, there’s very little actual evidence that more financial support would reduce abortions. When progressives claim that “abortions will fall more if we increase welfare,” they’re speaking from faith, not evidence. Abortion rates have been steadily falling for over 20 years with virtually no correlation to changes in government spending. Moreover, our abortion rates are much lower than in many countries where welfare is far more generous, or health care is socialized. Thus, while I think we should enact new policies, not as welfare but as universal benefits aimed to promote childbearing, marriage, and family, it should also be made clear that these policies won’t end abortion. What will end abortion is, first, reversing Roe v. Wade. Then, because abortion is not interstate commerce or the like, each state will face a decision about whether to ban abortion (a federal abortion ban is probably neither constitutional nor desirable, as it would energize pro-abortion groups into much higher turnout). Once Roe v. Wade is reversed, pro-life people will need to aggressively lobby their state governments and persuade their neighbors to protect life. Then, state by state, we will roll back the murderous campaign of abortion. Thanks to Kennedy’s retirement, this may all happen far sooner than most of us imagined a few years ago. Here’s hoping.

"435",435,"Yes, Pro-Lifers Should Cheer For Texas’s Winning New Unborn Protection Law","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-07"," Pro-lifers should not be afraid of winning. We should cheer Texas’s new law prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, and we should rejoice as it saves lives and changes the culture. It is understandable that some pro-life conservatives are worried. We have suffered many losses over the years, and it is easy to assume this victory must have a catch to it, perhaps lurking in a legal penumbra or leftist backlash.  But as Roger Severino explains, this law was a stroke of pro-life genius. It was crafted to be hard to litigate against, especially before it had gone into effect. Its opponents therefore struggled to mount a preemptive legal challenge, and the Supreme Court rightly permitted the law to go into effect. The key was that that instead of tasking state officials with enforcement, the law allows private citizens to sue those who help a woman obtain an abortion after the fetus has a detectable heartbeat, except in cases of medical emergency. This approach means abortionists will have to be hauled into court for breaking the law before they can challenge it, rather than preemptively suing state officials to stop the law from ever going into effect. Texas’s law will still be challenged in court, but abortion facilities in Texas may be closed or restricted during the legal battle. The New York Times reported that “what seemed to be happening on Thursday was near-complete compliance with the law without a single suit yet filed…Abortion clinics reported dramatic drops in patients on their schedules. And pregnancy crisis centers, where anti-abortion groups offer pregnancy services, reported surges in phone calls and walk-ins.” Furthermore, the culture is already shifting as people who relied on abortion as birth control change their behavior, and others learn how early a child’s heart begins to beat. In addition to restricting abortion, Texas also allocated $100 million to support women, babies, and families. Texas has thereby given other states a policy model to follow.  Despite this success, some pro-lifers are concerned, and although we should ignore the trolling of pro-abortion liberals such as Bill Kristol, who says this is a “pro-life setback,” good faith concerns deserve a response. One pro-life fear is that this Texas law will complicate the upcoming Dobbs case, in which the Supreme Court will hear a direct challenge to Roe and the Casey decision that upheld it. Legally, there is no problem, but the left has never been shy about trying to intimidate Republican appointees into bad rulings, and they have had particular success in pushing around Chief Justice John Roberts. But this Texas law might also stiffen judicial spines before the Supreme Court rules in Dobbs. Texas has provided a preview of a post-Roe world, in which states legislate on abortion as they do on other matters. The Roberts Court could have no greater legacy than getting themselves out of the abortion business. Texas is showing that, despite the hysteria of the pro-abortion left and its media allies, the sky will not fall without Roe. Rather, life will go on without a pretend right to abortion on demand—indeed, more lives will go on.  As Texas already shows, law shapes culture, as well as being shaped by it. In particular, abortion on demand has been a boon for irresponsible and abusive men, but we don’t have to live like this. Abortion supporters have been arguing that without abortion men will have to support the women they impregnate, and that the government will need to treat the unborn as persons, to which the pro-life reply is a simple: Yes. When Roe v. Wade was decided, abortion supporters made a multitude of optimistic predictions—abortion on demand was supposed to end child abuse, child poverty, fatherlessness and much more. These promises were false. We have learned what we should have known then, which is that abortion cannot solve social and familial problems because abortion poisons everything; it hardens the hearts it doesn’t stop. Just as the supposed benefits of abortion on demand never appeared, so too the prophesies of disaster without it will not come to pass in Texas, and the Supreme Court should take note. That the left and its media allies are already viciously smearing them should only encourage the originalist justices to end Roe for good. Some pro-lifers are also be concerned about political reprisals from the left, but this should not deter us. To be sure, uninformed Twitter commentators are fantasizing about revenge by flooding the system with frivolous complaints targeting GOP lawmakers. But not only would this strategy fail (the courts deal with false and frivolous claims all the time) the abortion facilities would remain closed in the meantime. Pro-life leaders can endure some legal harassment to save lives. Similar reasoning applies to fears that the left will use the Texas template to target us on other issues. They will not be dissuaded from this by the right disavowing Texas’s tactics. After all, they have long used harassing tactics against us, as seen in their persistent legal persecution of the Little Sisters of the Poor and Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop. Indeed, the left may hesitate to use Texas’s specific approach against the right, as it would require them to give up state enforcement power in order to avoid preemptive judicial strikes. Furthermore, we would still be able to have our day in court, and we would likely prevail in time, as the rights we care about are actually in the Constitution. But even if Texas has provided a new way for the left to harass us, that is a price pro-lifers should be willing to pay in order to close abortion facilities. Finally, some pro-life supporters might be concerned that this law makes us look like the aggressors in the abortion war, and they fear that public opinion will swing decidedly against the pro-life cause. They underestimate the support for limits on abortion—and likely underestimate the educational effect of having a heartbeat bill constantly in the news, reminding voters of the humanity of the unborn and the violence of abortion. After so many years of struggle and defeat, we should welcome this victory in Texas. We should not be so afraid of losing that we never try to win.

"436",436,"Why Nothing Has Changed Despite The Planned Parenthood Video Expose","Friedman","Daniel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-01-21"," If you followed the political fight over Planned Parenthood last year, you are probably dumber now. An anti-abortion group’s release last summer of a dozen undercover videos of Planned Parenthood executives talking about selling fetal tissue for research led to congressional hearings, state investigations, and failed efforts to deny the group federal funding. The anniversary of Roe v. Wade Thursday offers us a chance to take stock of how little difference all of that made. The controversy over Planned Parenthood resulted in just about zero productive political conversation between people who disagree about abortion law. It is just a small exaggeration to say no one learned a thing.  It didn’t have to be that way. The videos caused Democrats and Republicans to retreat to respective ideological corners. Lawmakers in both parties communicated only with their bases. That was no shock. Abortion, more than every other social issue, is an issue lawmakers love to fight over, not legislate on. With Roe v. Wade enshrined, Congress has limited power to change abortion law. Their incentive, on display this week, is to show supporters they agree with them. The point is to fight publicly, not to win. Videos Like This Don’t Win Hearts But a cynical approach to the videos was not inevitable. Whether you think the Center for Medical Progress, which created the videos, was heroic or shady in tricking Planned Parenthood officials into embarrassing statements, the fact remains: Their nonchalance about abortion and the sale of fetal tissue should disturb most people. Critics of abortion wanted the videos to move public opinion in their favor, and push legislatures to increase restrictions on abortion. For that reason, the videos offered a starting point—a chance in Congress and living rooms for political conversations that advance understanding of why the group receives support from some of the population and animosity from another. But that required granting the opposing view some legitimacy. It required acknowledging tradeoffs. We missed that chance. Many share fault.  Critics of abortion wanted the videos to move public opinion in their favor, and push legislatures to increase restrictions on abortion. They should have remembered that the videos motivate, almost exclusively, people who already oppose abortion rights. Those who support allowing abortion were not swayed, because the videos were presented in a way that makes them easily ignored. A boatload of studies on cognitive dissonance show most people ignore information that conflicts with their existing strongly held views, and look for information that discredits the conflicting view. Frame It as Immoral, Not Illegal Seen in that light, abortion critics erred by promoting the relatively weak argument that the videos show Planned Parenthood officials engaged in illegal organ harvesting, rather than unseemly conversation and immoral actions, legal or not. Once defenders of the group decided the claim of illegal activity wasn’t true, they tuned out, dismissing the controversy as a frame job. The sale of fetal tissue, while outrageous to people who oppose abortion, is easily rationalized by abortion rights advocates. The sale of fetal tissue, while outrageous to people who oppose abortion, is easily rationalized by abortion rights advocates. If the fetus died in what they consider a legally defensible procedure, using the tissue for research is morally comparable to organ donation. By relying on edited videos and conservative pundits that abortion rights voters don’t trust, Planned Parenthood critics offered easy excuses to those inclined to dismiss the information by quibbling with the messengers.  Critics of abortion rights might have influenced more people who didn’t agree with them by dialing back moral instruction (“You are flawed if you don’t react as I do to this”) in favor of a request to have their values acknowledged (“Please consider my profound moral objections to the practices depicted here”). For their part, Democrats and commentators backing Planned Parenthood reacted to the videos by seizing on excuses to avoid talking about the videos’ content. Pundits on the Left focused on presidential candidate Carly Fiorina misleadingly claiming a video depicts “a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.” Abortion Is a Tradeoff Between Mother and Child But arguing about what isn’t in the videos is in part a way to avoid talking about what is. Focusing on arguably dicey editing and the less controversial health services Planned Parenthood offers might have its place. But it is a way to avoid grappling with the undeniably difficult fact the videos present: Even if you support women’s right to choose it, abortion involves moral conflict. You cannot embrace one value without sacrificing the other. You pick. It’s not a pleasant choice for anyone. Planned Parenthood’s defenders dodged a responsibility to consider the clash of values that their views entail. Their position is that the right of mothers to choose to end pregnancies outweighs the cost, which is the killing of human fetuses, or babies. Abortion foes could acknowledge their alternative cost-benefit calculation. They place a higher value on protecting the unborn than on women’s autonomy over their pregnancies. You cannot embrace one value without sacrificing the other. You pick. It’s not a pleasant choice for anyone. Yet much political rhetoric reflects an assumption that there is no trade-off involved. “Defunding a trusted health care provider that serves one in five women in America doesn’t help anyone — in fact, it would hurt hundreds of thousands of people,” Hillary Clinton at a Democratic debate last year. Clinton’s claim naturally drew cheers from watching Democrats. She told them what they wanted to hear. Not only are they right, but there is no conflict to consider. No one loses if Planned Parenthood is funded. It’s easy. Our Divisions Aren’t Superficial Such pandering is not just an issue on abortion politics. America’s political discourse is low on tolerance for real, robust pluralism—where serious differences in values are accepted, not attributed to opponents’ stupidity or immorality. Many leaders, most prominently President Obama, regularly engage in phony celebrations of diversity that are actually assertions that Americans should not disagree on anything significant. Leaders regularly engage in phony celebrations of diversity that are actually assertions that Americans should not disagree on anything significant. “We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don’t like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states,” Obama said in his famous 2004 Democratic National Convention speech. “We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we’ve got some gay friends in the red states.” What about Americans who don’t worship any God, or lack gay friends? “The future we want,” Obama said in his State of the Union last week, “will only happen if we fix our politics.” What if we don’t agree on the future we want, and that’s what’s breaking our politics? In the president’s glib view, culture and race are superficial differences that obscure inherent similarity. Religious distinctions, far from being a disagreements over the fate of our souls, are just wrinkles in the way worshippers express their shared faith in God. This kind of thinking is ubiquitous. “I am attracted women, he’s attracted to men, but we all pine for marriage,” or “I like the Packers and she likes the Bears, but somehow it works” are common sentiments that celebrate trivial differences while actually promoting shared views. Touting phony diversity and essential sameness makes us less tolerant of real conflicts. If you pretend dating someone who likes another sports team is tolerant, you’ll struggle having a civil conversation about gun laws. Let’s Just Be Honest about Our Deep Disagreements This kind of thinking breeds political discourse that is subtly oppressive and completely boring. Americans discuss politics under an unstated rule that we should not disagree when it counts. You can argue about who makes the best barbeque, or maybe even tax policy, but make sure to agree on supporting our troops or gay rights. Abortion is controversial because it involves a disagreement that is close to unbridgeable. Abortion is controversial because it involves a disagreement that is as close to unbridgeable as they come. Because conflict can’t be denied, it could offer our best chance to acknowledge a difference in strongly held views without treating opponents as unworthy humans. It’s a chance to agree to disagree. The fight over Planned Parenthood represented a failure by many well-meaning people to communicate about a difference in values in a way that abetted mutual understanding and tolerance. The failure may be business as unusual. But was not necessary—and when you pull back from the screen long enough and consider it, it was very, very sad.

"437",437,"Dobbs Shows Roe And Casey Were Wrong On The Law And On The Science","Cleveland","Margot",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-06-30"," Since Dobbs’ release last Friday, coverage has focused overwhelmingly on the bottom-line holding—that there is no constitutional right to abortion—and what that means for the country. But Dobbs is much more than its holding: The Supreme Court’s opinion destroyed the legal sophistry of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and the anti-science underpinnings of their false claim that a constitutional right to abortion exists.



With the authority to regulate abortion returned to the people and their elected representatives, pro-life Americans seeking to persuade the public to prohibit or limit abortion would be well-served to study the Dobbs analysis.



No, Abortion Is Not in the Constitution



In its decision last week overturning Roe and Casey, the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization began its analysis “by considering the critical question whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion.” To answer this question, the Supreme Court methodically examined “whether the right to obtain an abortion is rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of ordered liberty.” That analysis led the court to conclude there was no basis to find a constitutional right to abortion in the U.S. Constitution.



The high court’s analysis did not end there. The Dobbs opinion addressed next whether the doctrine of stare decisis counseled toward the continued acceptance of the precedent of Roe and Casey, notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s conclusion that, properly understood, the Constitution did not provide a right to abortion. After stressing that it has “long recognized that stare decisis is “not an inexorable command,” the Supreme Court analyzed five factors that compelled the court to overrule Roe and Casey.



The first two factors discussed by the Dobbs court considered the soundness of the Roe and Casey decisions and specifically “the nature of their error” and “the quality of their reasoning.” That analysis eviscerated both Roe and Casey. After dissecting Roe, Justice Alito, writing for the court, capsulized the many errors of Roe as follows:



Roe was incorrectly decided, but that decision was more than just wrong. It stood on exceptionally weak grounds. Roe found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a right to obtain an abortion, but it failed to ground its decision in text, history, or precedent. It relied on an erroneous historical narrative; it devoted great attention to and presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedents on which it relied and the question before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set of rules, with different restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the history of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other cited source; and its most important rule (that States cannot protect fetal life prior to ‘viability’) was never raised by any party and has never been plausibly explained.



It wasn’t just the Dobbs majority and pro-life advocates, however, who found “Roe’s constitutional analysis was far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation of the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely pointed.” Almost immediately, Roe’s reasoning “drew scathing scholarly criticism, even from supporters of broad access to abortion,” putting Roe “on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided.”



Even Casey Contradicted Roe



Even in Casey, in which a plurality upheld what it called Roe’s central holding—that a state may not constitutionally protect fetal life before “viability”—the lead opinion “pointedly refrained from endorsing most of [Roe’s] reasoning.” Casey also “criticized and rejected Roe’s trimester scheme.” In fact, as Dobbs noted, the Casey opinion suggested that a majority of the justices might not have thought Roe was correct.



Not even the dissent in Dobbs sought to defend the Supreme Court’s analysis in Roe, but was instead “forced to rely solely on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions that accepted Roe’s interpretation.” “The dissent characterizes Casey as a ‘precedent about precedent,’” the Dobbs court noted in its Friday opinion, adding that to the dissenting justices Casey was “permanently shielded from further evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles.”



But Casey was fundamentally flawed as well, Justice Alito wrote, by treating “the national controversy provoked by Roe as a ground for refusing to reconsider that decision . . .” Justice Alito also stressed that the Casey court “provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe’s status as precedent, and imposed a new test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent.”



In short, Casey “either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe’s analysis, [and] failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe’s reasoning,” instead perpetuating the errors of Roe.



The Roe and Casey Courts Were Science Deniers



Having destroyed the constitutional analysis of Roe and Casey and rejected Casey’s “exceptional version of stare decisis that . . . [the Supreme] Court had never before applied and has never invoked since,” the court in Dobbs overturned those decisions and held there was no federal constitutional right to abortion. The majority in Dobbs, however, did not merely decimate the legal analysis underlying Roe and Casey: The high court also revealed, albeit much more subtly, that the decisions—much like the arguments of abortion apologists—rested on a denial of science.



“Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views,” Justice Alito opened the Dobbs opinion, continuing: “Some believe fervently that a human person comes into being at conception and that abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman’s right to control her own body and prevents women from achieving full equality.”



This initial phraseology, “that a human person comes into being at conception,” struck a strange chord, because it conflated two distinct beliefs underpinning the pro-life movement. First, that at conception, a new, distinct human being exists, and second, that all human beings are “persons.” But the Dobbs opinion soon made clear it understood the distinction, whereas Roe and Casey didn’t.



When Life Begins



Throughout its analysis, Dobbs spoke unequivocally of life and used quotation marks to stress the alternative reality presented in Roe and Casey that the fetal life at issue in abortion merely represents “potential life.” Roe and Casey’s anti-science view, however, extended much beyond the court in those cases framing the unborn as holding the status only of a “potential life.”



In Roe, the majority spoke of early “philosophical, theological, and civil and canon law concepts of when life begins,” and noted that those “disciplines variously approached the question in terms of the point at which the embryo or fetus became ‘formed’ or recognizably human, or in terms of when a ‘person’ came into being, that is, infused with a ‘soul’ or ‘animated.’” “A loose consensus evolved,” the Roe court continued, “in early English law that these events occurred at some point between conception and live birth.”



But philosophy and theology address questions concerning the value of life, not the facts of life, such as when life begins. When a fetus is “recognizably human,” holds the legal status of “person,” or is infused with a soul has nothing to do with the scientific question of “when life begins.”



Roe refused to decide that scientific question, claiming it was a “difficult question” to which “those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, . . .” and even maintaining “there has always been strong support for the view that life does not begin until live birth.”



The court in Roe then concluded that “a legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other point prior to live birth.” From there Roe and apologists for the court’s decision downgraded human life in utero to merely “potential life.” In reaffirming Roe, Casey followed Roe’s unscientific bent, speaking oxymoronically of “post-conception potential life.”



The Dobbs court exposed the scientific fallacy underlying Roe and Casey—that human life in utero is merely “potential life”—first by rejecting the “potential life” language from Roe and Casey and instead expressly stating that the issue of abortion concerned fetal life. The court brought home that point when it framed the dissent’s position as being that “the Constitution requires the States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic human right—to live—at least until an arbitrary point in a pregnancy has passed.”



Roe and Casey’s Viability Standards



But it was the court’s analysis of the viability standard of Roe and Casey that proved most devastating to the anti-science bent of those decisions. “What Roe did not provide was any cogent justification for the lines it drew,” Dobbs explained, with Roe and Casey’s “failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions,” a “glaring deficiency” in the opinion.



Dobbs then excerpted the Roe court’s purported justification for drawing the line at viability, stressing it represented not a rationale but a conclusion: “With respect to the State’s important and legitimate interest in potential life, the ‘compelling’ point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the womb.”



But how does the fact that the fetus is “viable,” meaning “capable of surviving outside the womb,” make a “State’s interest compelling?” Dobbs asked. If, as Roe held, a state’s interest in protecting prenatal life is compelling “after viability,” “why isn’t that interest ‘equally compelling before viability’? Roe did not say, and no explanation is apparent.”



The reason no explanation is apparent is because both before and after viability, human life is at stake. Even the dissenting justices in Dobbs accepted that truism, not even attempting to suggest that viability marks the point that a potential life becomes life. Instead, the dissent focused on stare decisis and a woman’s supposed right to abortion.



The Unborn Aren’t a Potential Life, But Living



Dobbs further refuted the anti-science concept that human life in utero represented but “potential life” in its discussion of the various views of philosophers and ethicists “who have attempted to justify a right to abortion.” The justifications posited concerned not the fact of life but of the value of life and when fetal life deserves legal protection.



The philosophical and ethical frameworks suggest, Dobbs explained, that human life must acquire characteristics of what “they regard as defining what it means to be a ‘person,’ to merit legal protection. Some characteristics offered as essential attributes of ‘personhood’ are sentience, self-awareness, the ability to reason, or some combination thereof.” These frameworks, however, all accept that human life exists in the womb.



The Supreme Court concluded that, even if one takes the view that “personhood” begins when a certain attribute or combination of attributes is acquired,” using viability to “mark the point where ‘personhood’ begins’ made no sense because “viability is heavily dependent on factors that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus.”



Dobbs also noted that the “personhood” theory, if adopted, would leave open the possibility that “even born individuals, including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions,” might lack the status of “persons,” which logically would allow for the lawful post-birth killing of children.



Personhood Is Not a Question for Science



While the dissent left unchallenged Dobbs’ correction of the scientific error underlying Roe and Casey—that the human being in utero represented only potential life—it chastised the majority for leaving unanswered the question of “personhood.” Here, the dissent claimed that Dobbs’ failure to determine the question of a fetus’ personhood “aligned” with Roe and Casey’s refusal to decide whether life or potential life was involved.



But rather than diminish the court’s reasoning, the dissent’s argument confirms Dobbs’ repudiation of the anti-science premises of both Roe and Casey—that when life begins is unclear. To the dissent, that question was no different than the question of “personhood.”



Pro-lifers would agree: Every human being is a person. But unlike the fact that life begins at fertilization, the concept of “personhood” is not a question of science. And because the question of whether the Constitution guarantees a right to abortion does not depend on a living fetus’ status as a person, there was no reason for the Dobbs court to address that question.



Nonetheless, the logic of the opinion tilts toward the conclusion that “personhood” rests on an individual’s status as a human being, and not whether the human life resides in a womb, a neo-natal unit, or a nursery. That will be a question for another day.



For now, pro-life Americans should celebrate the Dobbs decision while also educating themselves on the high court’s analysis, which exposes both the legal and scientific flaws of Roe and Casey.

"438",438,"Momentum From Dobbs Led Legislatures All Around The Country To Pass Popular Pro-Life Laws","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-05-24"," Shortly after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, momentum for saving preborn lives manifested in cultural and political victories. Now, less than a year after the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, half of U.S. states proudly have laws on the books to protect life in the womb between conception and 12 weeks.



In the last two months alone, Republican legislators and governors in more than half a dozen states enacted laws that save the lives of tens of thousands of unborn babies. 



Corporate media, Democrats, and even some on the right smear abortion limits like these as unpopular and ineffective but polling shows that most Americans — 72 percent — oppose ending the lives of preborn babies beyond 15 weeks. 



“These are incredibly popular among the American people in general and definitely in those states. And maybe not even as ambitious in those states as they could be,” President of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America Marjorie Dannenfelser confirmed in a press conference on Wednesday.



Legislatures aren’t just banning the murder of unborn babies, they are actively enriching the institutions and organizations that help mothers, babies, and families during and beyond pregnancy.



“I think that the Republicans and the pro-life legislators are making clear the contrast between the Democrats who want abortion on demand up until birth, who cannot even stomach a law being in place that would protect babies who were born alive, versus what they’re trying to do in protecting unborn children and then serving mothers,” SBA’s Vice President of State Affairs Stephen Billy said.



Here are seven states that passed popular pro-life laws in the last two months.



Florida



After months of workshopping behind the scenes with Florida’s Republican legislators, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation on April 13 that not only eradicates abortion in the state beyond six weeks gestation but also devotes $25 million dollars to supporting mothers, babies, and lifesaving pregnancy centers. 



Kansas



The Republican-controlled Kansas legislature overrode Democrat Gov. Laura Kelly in late April after she tried to veto their born-alive and abortion legislation. Abortion is currently restricted in Kansas after 22 weeks.



The born-alive law, which takes effect July 1, requires medical professionals to “exercise the same degree of professional skill, care and diligence” to save babies born during a botched abortion that they would a child during normal birth. The abortion pill law, also effective July 1, states that doctors must inform patients that “the effects of a medication abortion may be reversible.”



The legislature also passed a bill to amend the definition of “healthcare provider” to ensure pregnancy centers, not abortion facilities, are eligible for insurance. Upon Kelly’s veto, the bill passed with a supermajority in the House but failed to gain a supermajority in the state Senate.



North Dakota 



In late April, North Dakota Republicans and Gov. Doug Burgum teamed up to turn their clarified heartbeat bill, which was previously temporarily halted by the state Supreme Court, into law. 



The new law, which Burgum said “reaffirms North Dakota as a pro-life state,” enacts a near-total ban on abortions beyond six weeks. As of the signing of the bill, the state’s only abortion facility had already closed its doors. 



Montana 



On the heels of what was dubbed “the most pro-life legislative session in the history of the state of Montana,” Republicans in Big Sky Country passed nearly half a dozen pro-life laws in early May designed to protect preborn lives, taxpayers’ pockets, and pro-life doctors’ consciences. 



Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte eagerly signed into law bills that ban abortion beginning at 24 weeks, require doctors to care for infants born alive in botched abortions, state that abortion is not protected under the Montana Constitution’s right to privacy, require recorded data on complications that stem from the abortion pill, and shield medical providers who object to abortion from participating in one. 



On May 16, Gianforte signed several other pro-life bills into law including two that aim to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortion for all. The first law “brings Montana in line with the federal Hyde Amendment.” The second law mandates that abortions paid for by taxpayers through Medicaid must be medically necessary.



Other new laws ushered in by Gianforte include “restricting dismemberment abortion except for during a medical emergency in which the child would not survive outside of the womb” and giving the state’s Department of Health and Human Services the authority to license and hold abortion facilities accountable. 



North Carolina



North Carolina Republicans sided with the majority of their constituents in mid-May when they passed a law that will save thousands of unborn lives. 



The Care for Women, Children, and Families Act bans abortion in the Tar Heel state starting at 12 weeks gestation. Legislators designed the bill to be a “pro-life plan” that supplies mothers and their babies with the resources they need to thrive, including $160 million in funding for childcare, parental leave, and safe surrender adoption.  



Over Mother’s Day weekend, Democrat Gov. Roy Cooper tried to can the legislation with a veto that would have doomed the state to a 20-week ban. The Republican-led Assembly, however, voted on May 16 to override Cooper’s rejection. The law officially goes into effect on July 1. 



Nebraska



On May 19, Republicans in the Nebraska unicameral legislature successfully ended a filibuster to pass the Let Them Grow Act which outlaws not just gender experiments on children under 19 years of age but also the murder of preborn babies beyond 12 weeks gestation. 



The legislation, which was created to combat Democrats’ radical abortion-on-demand agenda, includes exceptions for abortions in the case of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. 



Mere days after the unicameral body’s vote, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed the bill, which is the “first piece of legislation to save babies in Nebraska in decades,” into law. Prior to the new law, Nebraskans could end the lives of babies in the womb until viability, which usually begins between 20-22 weeks gestation. 



“It’s an extraordinary privilege to be a part of answering prayers that have been going on for 50 years,” the Cornhusker Republican said at the signing on May 22. “We’re standing up to protect our kids so our state and our kids have a brighter future.”



South Carolina



After being called back to the legislature for a special session requested by the governor, South Carolina Republicans passed a bill on May 23 that protects thousands of unborn babies with a detectable heartbeat from abortion. Most of the time, cardiac activity in infants in the womb is recorded as early as six weeks gestation. 



Republican Gov. Henry McMaster confirmed on the same day the legislation passed that “I look forward to signing this bill into law as soon as possible.”



Prior to the new restrictions, abortion in the Palmetto State was legal through 22 weeks gestation.



The  Work Has Just Begun



Even though some states’ pro-life laws are already in effect or will soon be, several other states face litigation. 



Courts may side with Republican legislatures, which have the right to legislate against abortion, but many of them still face imminent challenges from out-of-state abortion groups which use deceitfully-worded ballot measures to enshrine their abortion-until-birth absolutism in state constitutions. 



“They see that they’re losing in the court of public opinion and that is the big story,” Dannenfelser said. “When you have 25 states that have actually passed pro-life protections and then their best strategy is to go after our territory by going to the state constitutions, that’s a message that they’re losing clearly in those places.”

"439",439,"44 Pro-Life Reasons 44 Percent Of Americans Want A Real Third Option","Smiley","Lisa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-06-20"," On June 21, prominent pro-life and Christian leaders are scheduled to meet with presidential candidate Donald Trump “to address longstanding concern about his candidacy” Time magazine states. This continued vetting process underlines how, for pro-life voters, this presidential election may be the most difficult in decades. Try as many do to put a good spin on it, there are currently no good options for those of us who cannot compromise on the sanctity of life.  We are not alone in our feeling of dissatisfaction. According to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, 64 percent of registered voters answered “no” when asked if the presumptive nominees of both parties are “honest and trustworthy” In addition, a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll shows a whopping 44 percent of Americans want a viable third option. On the one hand, we have Hillary Clinton, an unabashed proponent of abortion on demand—perhaps the most pro-choice candidate in history. She is uncompromisingly opposed to any legislative move towards protecting lives in the womb or regulating the abortion industry, even to protect and save women’s lives. On the other hand, we have Donald Trump, who has shown that his pro-life convictions are on shaky ground—and negotiable, like many of his other policy positions. While the Republican Party has traditionally upheld pro-life values as part of its platform, its presumptive leader seems confused when asked basic questions on this issue, showing he lacks critical knowledge on what the pro-life movement really stands for. A new Gallup poll indicates Trump specifically needs to improve his pro-life outreach. Yet for astute, committed pro-lifers, any outreach he does now would only seem like a ploy to gain our votes. It is plausible he will be the most liberal, pro-choice candidate the Republican Party has ever offered the American public.  The question remains: Will Trump actually help or hurt the pro-life movement’s decades of education and advocacy? We are committed not only to change the laws of our land, but also to change the hearts and minds of Americans, that every innocent life would be valued and defended. Standing against the prevalent culture of death takes conviction, not money or brashness. As one whose own life was saved from forced abortion in communist China, I am exploring my options for whom to support this presidential cycle. Here are 44 reasons pro-life advocates are looking for another option for president: Hillary Clinton’s Record on Life Issues Planned Parenthood endorsed Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries—a first for the nation’s leading abortion provider.
Clinton has said abortion should be legal during any stage of a woman’s pregnancy for any reason whatsoever. She would not put any restrictions on a “women’s right to choose.”
In speaking of Supreme Court nominees, Clinton said, “We’ve got to make sure to preserve Roe v. Wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed.” Her Supreme Court justice picks will be, without question, extreme pro-abortion supporters.
Clinton’s views are in fact in line with the Democratic Party platform, which supports aborting lives in the womb up to the time the child is born.
In April 2016, Clinton said, “The unborn person doesn’t have constitutional rights,” and that “the woman’s right to make decisions” trumps any rights the child has—including the right to life.
Clinton has called abortion a “fundamental human right.”
In March 2016, an investigative report found the Clinton campaign paid Planned Parenthood thousands of dollars for volunteering on behalf of the Democratic candidate.
Clinton defends the violent (and currently illegal) practice of partial-birth abortion.
She is happy her husband vetoed a bill to ban partial-birth abortions.
In 2009, Clinton received Planned Parenthood’s highest honor, the Margaret Sanger Award.
Clinton has said, ”I will always defend Planned Parenthood and I will say consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported and protected, not undermined, misrepresented and demonized”—even after the scandal involving Planned Parenthood illegally profiting from the sale of baby body parts.
Clinton would repeal the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits public funding for abortion services. Not only will she ensure abortion is legal in all nine months of pregnancy, Clinton wants taxpayers to foot the bill.
Big Abortion is one of Clinton’s largest donors.
Clinton compares pro-lifers to terrorists for wanting to defund Planned Parenthood.
Clinton believes abortion must be a “core priority” in developing countries.
NARAL Pro-Choice America endorsed Clinton for president.
Clinton has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record with NARAL and Planned Parenthood.
In 2015, Clinton slammed the U.S. House for passing a bill protecting pain-capable lives in the womb from late-term abortions.
One of Clinton’s heroes is Margaret Sanger, racist eugenicist and founder of Planned Parenthood. She is “really in awe of” Sanger, whom she considers “one of the most transformational in the entire history of the human race.”
Clinton has said if she becomes president she would ensure Planned Parenthood receives even more taxpayer funding.
Clinton has said “religious beliefs” against abortion “have to be changed.”
Clinton’s abortion views appear to have become more extreme. In 2008, she said abortions should be “safe, legal and rare, and by rare, I mean rare.” She has since dropped the “rare” rhetoric, saying in 2016 that abortion should be “safe and legal.” Donald Trump’s Record on Life Issues Trump has said he does not support changing the laws on abortion, because right now “the laws are set.” The Susan B. Anthony List responded by saying if that was his position, he had “disqualified himself as the GOP nominee.”
Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Planned Parenthood, saying it “does a lot of good,” “does do wonderful things,” and “does a really good job.”
Cecile Richards, CEO of Planned Parenthood, thanked Trump for praising her organization—which named Trump their favorite Republican candidate this cycle.
Trump has said his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, who supports partial-birth abortion, would make a “phenomenal” Supreme Court justice. He reportedly changed his mind a few months later.
When Trump released a list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees on May 18, many praised the judges listed for their strong records. Within hours of releasing the list, Trump walked back his commitment to nominate one of these judges.
Trump has profited from female exploitation, as the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey, became the city’s first casino to have an in-house strip club in 2013. Many pro-life leaders connect the issues of sex trafficking and abortion.
In his 2000 book “The America We Deserve,” Trump wrote, “I support a woman’s right to choose, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures.” Since then, he says his views have “evolved.”
Known for generating news from his tweets, Trump was oddly silent on one trending topic. During this year’s March for Life, all other conservative candidates celebrated the thousands gathered to defend innocent lives, while Trump said nothing.
Trump has said he’d “absolutely” liberalize the pro-life platform of the Republican Party to include the exceptions of rape, incest, and the life of the mother.
Trump has said he supports the status quo of funding Planned Parenthood as it is currently being funded. Yet when he was forced to clarify his stance, he finally said he would sign a bill to defund it if he became president.
Trump said he became pro-life because one of his friends planned on aborting a child, but decided against it, as the daughter turned out to be a “superstar.” Yet what does he think should happen to vulnerable babies with disabilities who aren’t considered “winners”?
Trump spreads the lie that abortion is a “fairly small part” of what Planned Parenthood does.
Trump has said there should be “some sort of punishment” for women who have abortions—a view the pro-life movement largely does not support.
When Trump was asked whether he believes abortion is murder in the early stages of pregnancy, he said “No.” He has said a baby becomes a person “as the process goes along.”
Trump’s position on abortion evolves depending on the day. For example, he took five different positions on the issue in a span of three days in March and April of this year.
Trump has donated at least $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, which supports abortion overseas.
Trump has donated thousands of dollars multiple times to his pro-choice opponent, Hillary Clinton.
Trump has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to pro-choice Democratic politicians over the years.
In his only congressional primary endorsement to date, Trump backed Rep. Renee Ellmers—who actively worked against the pro-life movement’s top legislative priority in 2015. When votes were tallied in the North Carolina Second District primary election, Ellmers lost to the candidate endorsed by Susan B. Anthony List.
In his book “The Art of the Deal,” Trump wrote, “If I told the real stories of my experiences with women, often seemingly very happily married and important women, this book would be a guaranteed best-seller.” Such cavalier dishonor of women and sacred marriage bonds is antithetical to a culture of life.
Trump claims “millions and millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood” because it provides women’s health care like cervical cancer and breast cancer treatments. Yet its CEO has admitted Planned Parenthood has never even provided mammograms.
Despite what Trump has said about what he believes about the sanctity of life and abortion, he has not done anything substantial or noteworthy to further the pro-life cause to date. This will indeed be a confounding presidential election for pro-life voters, considering the current candidates. Can I in clear conscience vote for either Clinton or Trump with what is plainly documented about their pro-choice views? As citizens of a democratic republic, we have a great privilege and responsibility to stay engaged in the electoral process. Unless something drastic changes, at this point I am prayerfully exploring my options.

"440",440,"Media Quotes Wrong Bill To Scaremonger About Ohio’s Heartbeat Legislation","St. Onge","Sarah",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-11-28"," The recent headlines are startling: “Ohio Republicans Proposing Death Penalty For Abortion,” says Refinery 29. “Ohio Politician Proposes Death Penalty for Women Who Have Abortions,” reads the The Sun, a British tabloid. Fortunately, these headlines refer to a defunct Ohio bill that never made it out of committee and had few sponsors. The bill sent to debate when these headlines were created was HB 258, in which the following section details exactly what will happen to women who procure abortions outside of the limited scope of the new law:  Sec. 2919.193 2919.198. A pregnant woman on whom an abortion is performed or induced in violation of section Revised Code is not guilty of violating any of those sections; is not guilty of attempting to commit, conspiring to commit, or complicity in committing a violation of any of those sections; and is not subject to a civil penalty based on the abortion Sec. 2919.199. (A) A woman who meets either or both of the 2919.191 or 2919.192 2919.193, 2919.194, or 2919.195 sections. following criteria may file a civil action for the wrongful of the being performed or induced in violation of any of those death of her unborn child… Not only does the statute not penalize women who choose the type of abortions that would be illegal under the new law, but it gives them recourse to sue the physician involved, should it be proven he performed an illegal abortion on the woman and her child. Pro-Choicers Routinely Mischaracterize Pro-Life Positions The mischaracterization of current legislation as potentially dangerous for women is another piece of pro-abortion propaganda from a progressive media. As science continues to prove the humanity of the unborn child, the case for absolute, unhindered bodily autonomy, as in the justification for abortion, weakens. We can no longer deny that a fetus is human, so abortion advocates must now promote the fetus as an “invader” to the detriment of women everywhere. This turns abortion into an action of self-defense, justifiable under any and all circumstances. Anyone who chooses to wade into the quagmire of internet abortion debate has undoubtedly seen the unborn referred to as a “parasite.” But with the hundreds of articles falsely positioning Republicans as advocates of criminal penalties for post-abortive women, in conjunction with a similar profuseness of articles describing pregnancy as inherently dangerous—more dangerous than abortion—the fetus-as-parasite campaign seems to have been elevated to the central talking point within the context of the so-called Republican “war on women.” Like an animal fighting for its last breath, the pro-abortion movement is struggling to fight against the life-affirming science it can’t deny. They’re trying to recapture the “pro-life generation” they lost with the advent of the internet, full of free information about fetal development. They will continue to spew more vitriol and spread more lies in an effort to turn moderates against the pro-life movement.  It’s our job to meet their dishonesty with accuracy and kindness, no matter how scandalous the headline. Today they’ve brazenly lied about the new Ohio law, and tomorrow there will be another sordid tale of evil anti-abortion legislators and activists who hate women and just want them to suffer. The “war on women” will be dredged back into the spotlight to inflame the passions of a few more women who aren’t really pro-abortion, but who are ignorant of the facts and afraid of being jailed over a missed period. Why Pro-Lifers Don’t Support Penalizing Abortive Mothers The reality is that, except for a few sidesteps from ignorant lawmakers and fringe anti-abortion groups, criminal penalties for post-abortive women are not promoted by pro-life groups in the U.S. (or abroad in most cases) for very practical reasons. Primarily, if prosecution for abortion is a potential, there would be a high probability for false imprisonment when women miscarry or deliver a stillborn baby. This is currently the situation in El Salvador, where women have been in jail for a decade or more for miscarrying or delivering dead infants. Less dangerously but certainly as relevant, many post-abortive women state they have been coerced by partners or parents into terminating a pregnancy. Women don’t generally make the decision to procure an abortion a vacuum. If we were to plan on holding women criminally liable, how do we assure other parties aren’t involved in a coercive manner? Are we going to DNA test each fetus to locate the father, who would most likely deny involvement in the abortion to avoid criminal penalty?  While researching this article, I was unable to find one instance of a man being jailed for his partner’s voluntary abortion, which would logically lead me to believe men are rarely found complicit in the destruction of their children. This type of legislation and penalty would also potentially collapse the pro-life movement. Some of the strongest anti-abortion voices come from those of us who have had abortions, and who speak publicly, counsel women, and work quietly every day to change hearts as well as laws. Not only would the movement lose a large proportion of the post-abortive activists, but great numbers of pro-life individuals who understand that unjust incarceration is the likely result of criminal penalties for women who procure an abortion. No real pro-lifers are going to support a law that could unintentionally end up with a grieving mother in jail for decades. Media Deceptively Scaremongers to Harden Sentiments Mainstream anti-abortion advocates, lobbying groups, and politicians are aware of the potential repercussions of pressing prosecution for abortion. Historically speaking, Western nations have not typically penalized women for abortions. The U.S. government (at a state or federal level) will not be prosecuting women for abortions, and certainly will not be putting them to death. The headlines are just that: headlines, meant to catch your eye and instill a sense of fear into moderate pro-lifers and those who are caught in the middle. While the offering of liberal news out there today has been consistently pro-choice for quite some time, this particular piece of news (and overall theme) is a most stunning example of the lengths pro-abortion activists and media will go. The outright falsehood on the parts of most major media outlets, not to mention hundreds, if not thousands, of small blogs and magazines, regarding the death penalty and the Ohio bill, is a shocking reminder of how insidious a lie can be when told over and over again. It’s also a reminder that the most egregious lies are the ones shouted the loudest, to mask the truth they’re trying to cover up: the unborn child is a human being, worthy of legal protection.

"441",441,"You Can’t Really Be Pro-Life And Feminist","Payne","Daniel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-02-12"," By now it’s axiomatic that the pro-life movement is largely incompatible with modern feminism, and that today’s feminists, by and large, passionately oppose most of what the pro-life movement stands for. Some have attempted to reconcile this tension, but it seems on balance to be an exercise in futility. Some years ago, for instance, the activist Jennifer Baumgardner was asked if you can “be a feminist and pro-life.” Her rather astonishing response was effectively: “Yes, so long as you don’t want to outlaw abortion.” Perhaps one might suggest Baumgardner doesn’t represent the feminist movement at large, except that she has written two books on the topic, one about “young women, feminism, and the future” and “a field guide for feminist activism.” She is also the executive director and publisher of the Feminist Press at the City University of New York. If she is not a good example of the mores of modern feminism, I am not sure what is.  In spite of this, some still occasionally attempt to bridge the gap between the rabidly pro-abortion feminist movement with the anti-abortion pro-life movement, and last month—on the same day as the March for Life, appropriately enough—Vox played host to one of these attempts, running an essay by Claire Swinarski entitled “I’m a pro-life feminist.” Abortion Is Murder, But Don’t Outlaw It It would be nice to see a genuine defense of the unborn coming from someone who styles herself a “feminist.” But Swinarski does not really effect such a defense. Her “pro-life” position, in fact, seems more or less pro-choice, so she fails to make the case for defending unborn children from murder. Feminism has once again trumped the lives of the unborn. She fails most particularly because she does not actually want abortion outlawed in any meaningful sense. She makes the claim that the pro-life movement “[has] no interest in legal punishment for women who’ve had abortions.” I asked her to clarify this, and she claimed she is “not for arresting women who were in desperate situations.” Rather, she believes we should “provide counseling instead.” (Over email, I also asked Swinarski whether she believed killers of born humans should receive “counseling,” as well. “Feel free to use [my] article,” she replied, “but I’d rather not be quoted in any other context.”)  Other “pro-life feminists” such as Feminists for Life actually share the desire to fight abortion without actually outlawing it. This is, to say the least, a breathtakingly mystifying position: we do not, in any other situations that I am aware of, sentence first-degree murderers solely to “counseling” after they have killed another human being, even if the murderer was in a “desperate situation.” Either Unborn Babies Are People Or They Are Not Swinarski’s apparent philosophical incoherency actually underscores one of the key questions that the wider pro-life movement must answer: once abortion is made illegal, what should happen to the women who procure them and the doctors who perform them? To be pro-life is to also be pro-justice for the murdered unborn. If anti-abortion activists really believe abortion is the unjust killing of another human being, then the logical penalty for such premeditated murder would be either the death penalty or—for those of us who oppose the death penalty—years in prison, possibly life. Any plan of action less punitive than these measures necessarily accepts, at least in part, the core premise of the pro-choice movement, which holds that unborn humans are less-deserving of rights and legal protection than are born ones. To be pro-life is to also be pro-justice for the murdered unborn, something that you can’t accomplish by simply “counseling” the people who murder, and aid in the murder of, the unborn. One can, of course, sincerely desire that fewer abortions take place while not simultaneously demanding that abortion be made illegal. Plenty of well-meaning people do. But this position seems woefully incomplete, chiefly because of its deliberately selective application of justice: nobody would consider applying the same standards of justice to the murder of born humans.  Swinarski’s Potential Solution Isn’t One It is thus hard to take Swinarski seriously when she calls herself “pro-life,” at least given that her preferred “pro-life” policies would have no practical effect in either protecting the unborn or securing them justice. Clearly, more generous maternity leave does not necessarily correlate to a lower abortion rate. To her credit, she apparently tries to reconcile this problem by advocating policies that make abortion “unnecessary in the first place.” In this she fails, as well. “Bad policies,” she writes, “have led many women to believe they are unable to be mothers.” She claims that the United States’ failure to require paid maternity leave drives women toward abortions. “Better policies are good for women,” she says, “and could help reduce the perceived need for abortion.” Maybe so. But then you’d expect that, the more generous a country’s paid maternity leave policies, the lower the abortion rate—and that isn’t always the case. Sweden, for example, has some of the most generous parental leave policies on the planet, but their abortion rate in 2012 was nearly 21 per 1,000 women of childbearing age. The United States’s rate for that same year and same demographic was 13.2. England’s maternity leave is similarly generous, as is that of Wales, yet the abortion rate for England and Wales in 2012 was 16.5 percent. To be sure, plenty of countries with generous maternity leave policies have lower abortion rates than the United States. But clearly more generous maternity leave does not necessarily correlate to a lower abortion rate—and anyone who is serious about pro-life efforts should not pin her hopes on leave policies altering the abortion rate. Human lives are far too precious for such a whimsical approach to saving them. If abortion is murder then neither ‘cultural change’ nor ‘tackling’ ‘social structures’ is sufficient. Swinarski also advocates limiting the number of sex-selective abortions through “cultural change,” and reducing the number of black babies that are aborted by “tackl[ing] these structures at the base,” i.e. fixing the “complicated social structures and other disadvantages” minority women face. Both of these are worthwhile goals, but they are also in a sense immaterial to the core effort of the pro-life movement, which seeks to afford unborn humans the same legal protection as born ones. If abortion is murder—and it is—then neither “cultural change” nor “tackling” “social structures” is sufficient to bring about the necessary justice that all unborn persons deserve, any more than mere “cultural change” would have brought about justice for enslaved black Americans. You Can’t Serve Two Political Masters Swinarski finishes her argument with a bang, writing about the inappropriate behavior of some anti-abortion activists: “Pro-lifers bug me, too.” Thanks for that. The politics and the philosophy of one side will often crowd out the other. The modern feminist movement largely diametrically opposes the pro-life movement: the former believes abortion is sacrosanct, and the latter believes it to be a crime against humanity. It is, indeed, possible to call yourself a “feminist” and also style yourself “pro-life,” but as Swinarski’s efforts show, such a marriage is ultimately untenable—the politics and the philosophy of one side will often crowd out the other. In Swinarski’s case, the pro-choice side has clearly won. In spite of her good intentions, she merely gestures at the pro-life movement while proposing to keep pro-choice policies firmly in place. I’m sure it made the editors at Vox very proud of themselves to publish what they termed a “pro-life” essay, but they were lying to themselves. Meanwhile, thousands of unborn children are killed every day in the United States. Their lives ultimately cry out for justice—not “cultural change.”  They deserve the protection of the law, and they suffer a grave injustice by “pro-life feminists” who are more concerned with feminism than they are with life.

"443",443,"Do Lives Have Value Only If We Say So?","Silberman","James",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-09-29"," Now that scientists have developed 3-D ultrasounds, it is no longer tenable to claim that the preborn are not human or that a child inside the womb is somehow less human than a child outside of it. Ever since then, and now with the Center for Medical Progress unveiling to the world exactly what goes on inside Planned Parenthood, the abortion lobby’s defense of abortion has shifted dramatically. There is no more denying the humanity of the preborn. The only thing abortion supporters can do now is claim that a human life only has value if they say so.  “The unborn person has no constitutional rights,” declared Hillary Clinton on CNN a few months back. Notice she readily admits the preborn is indeed a unique, individual human person. “So what if abortion ends a life?” writes Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon. Williams goes on to say the preborn child is “a life worth sacrificing.” In April, pro-abortion students at the University of North Georgia made cookies shaped like children and bit the heads off while laughing hysterically. In June, a San Diego abortionist was filmed saying that he “loved” dismembering babies. We Know It’s a Person; We’re Still Killing Him Many in the pro-life movement have long thought that if we could get people to see that the preborn child is indeed a human life, and not merely a clump of cells, we could win the argument. However something strange, almost surreal, has happened. Abortion supporters have moved the goalposts in a shocking way. They continue to kill even as they acknowledge the humanity of their victims.  “Our arguments were predicated on the hope that by just getting people to realize that a life was being killed, they would become pro-life. What we forgot was that history is filled with examples of the powerful preying on the weak, fully knowing that their victims were alive,” writes Ardee Coolidge of CareNet. “Whether it was the slave owner in the Antebellum South or the Nazi prison guard in World War II, few believed that the slave on the auction block or the prisoner on their way to the gas chamber was not a person. They were persons worth selling and sacrificing. They were alive, but only partly human.” Just as there is no logical distinction between a child inside the womb or out, there is also no logical distinction between sub-humanizing Jews and black people and sub-humanizing unborn persons. Abortion simply perpetuates the human tradition of putting personal ambitions and desires before others’ lives. In the 1860 presidential election, Democratic nominee Stephen Douglas argued that, regardless of the morality of slavery or the humanity of black people, it would be wrong to force citizens to accept black people as fully human. He said that despite personal opposition to the practice, state territories should decide for themselves whether slavery would be legal. He was making the “pro-choice” argument for slavery just as today’s abortion supporters make the “pro-choice” argument for abortion. To Douglas, the slave trader, and the abortion lobby, the value of a human life is subservient to personal freedom. The inherent worth of a human being can be negotiated based on preference and circumstance. Just as the slave’s rights to life and liberty were worth sacrificing in order to provide slave-traders a wealthy, slothful lifestyle, today’s abortion supporters believe the preborn are worth sacrificing so they can maintain their promiscuous, self-centered lifestyle.  Either We All Have Value Or We’re All Up for Interpretation Abraham Lincoln, Douglas’ opponent, argued that freedom of choice cannot justly be used to take away another person’s freedom or rights. This is the non-aggression principle of governance. One is free to do as he or she wishes, so long as he or she does not infringe on the freedom or natural rights of fellow human beings. It is crucially important that every unborn human being can claim his or her inalienable, natural rights to life and liberty. If instead the value of an unborn human life is up for interpretation, as the Left claims, then the value of all our lives is up for interpretation. The callousness of this shift in leftist rhetoric reveals nothing, save for the grace of God, could convince these people to give up killing babies. Even if they become wholly convinced of the humanity of the preborn, which they now are, they will not loosen their grasp on abortion. As Dinesh D’Souza puts it, leftists know that abortion is the glue holding their failing sexual revolution together: “Liberals understand that abortion-on-demand is the debris of the sexual revolution. If you are going to have sexual promiscuity, then there are going to be mistakes, and many women are going to get pregnant without wanting to do so.” Babies are the “uninvited guests” of the sexual revolution who must be erased so adults can have their fun. Abortion Supporters Need to Become Human Again The pro-life movement, with help from scientific advances, has effectively humanized the unborn. Now we just have to humanize abortion supporters. They deny they have consciences. They deny that they feel guilt, and tell women to celebrate and #ShoutYourAbortion, but study after study on post-abortion trauma reveals that women are suffering. Compared with women who give birth, women post-abortion have significantly higher rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and a host of other mental ills. These consequences are so prevalent they have a name: Post-Abortion Syndrome, which is considered a strain of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. For healing, we have to help abortion supporters recognize their own consciences, which scream at them to acknowledge the human blood they have shed and the lives they have sent into depression. That conversation is going to be a very difficult, but necessary one. The increase in hateful, shameless pro-abortion rhetoric suggests it has already begun. We must foster a culture that recognizes the inherent value of every single person. We must throw all forms of devaluing human life into the ash heap of history. We must all understand that the value of a human life is not up for interpretation or subject to personal feelings. Salon, Clinton, and the abortion lobby are finally conceding that the preborn is a human person, but they still believe that other rights come first. Call me an extremist, but I still hope we can all agree that every human person has the right to not be violently killed, and no right that any other person may claim supersedes it.

"444",444,"Ideas For Reporters Struggling To Cover Planned Parenthood (Updated)","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-07-20"," Many years ago I interviewed for a reporting job covering government waste, fraud and mismanagement. The interview went well and my future employers mentioned that they’d had trouble keeping the position filled as many reporters had trouble coming up with story ideas. They wondered if that would be a problem. I thought they were joking, so I chuckled. But they were entirely serious. I thought of that when looking at media coverage of the Planned Parenthood scandal. The media seem to be really struggling to come up with any story ideas for how to cover this story.  A few reporters wrote an initial story on the undercover video that caught the senior director for medical services at Planned Parenthood discussing the harvesting of organs from the unborn children killed by abortion. Another few reporters noted early political repercussions that followed, including the launching of state and federal investigations. A few reporters wrote up the apology (for the “tone” used by the wine-drinking, salad-munching Dr. Deborah Nucatola as she discussed harvesting lungs, livers, hearts and brains) offered by Planned Parenthood’s president Cecile Richards. But given the many angles that could be covered, the lack of ferocity with which they’re tackling this story is noticeable. Compare, for instance, what happened in the last month with coverage of Confederate flags. The controversy over the flag arose after the man charged in the Charleston church shooting was pictured with a Confederate flag. Coverage was media-led and media-stoked. The media couldn’t stop finding new angles to cover, including calling up retailers and pressuring them to stop selling merchandise with any Confederate flag depiction, such as a toy depicting the General Lee from the Dukes of Hazzard television show. The shooting happened on June 17, about a month ago. The media quickly moved on from the victims and the shooting itself, even though there were many worthwhile angles to cover. Instead they went for frenzied coverage of the presence of Confederate flags. The Planned Parenthood video was released on July 14, about a week ago. If the story of harvesting organs for sale from aborted babies were deemed merely as important as the flag story, we’d expect to see many multiples of the levels of coverage we’re seeing now. Using Nexis, I looked at a few media outlets to see how their coverage of the Confederate flag compared to the Planned Parenthood video. For my quick searches, I put in “Confederate” and “flag,” and “Planned Parenthood” and “video,” with the appropriate dates. My search of the media companies’ web sites showed higher counts for one or the other entry than what showed up in Nexis, for what it’s worth. And for CNN, I modified “video” with “undercover.” What I found was most interesting, and goes a long way to show how the media can drum up interest in a story or work to suppress a story:  CNN has had 493 mentions of the Confederate flag since June 17 (only 188 of these even mention alleged church shooter Dylann Roof), and managed 167 in the first six days. In the first six days of the Planned Parenthood scandal, they managed 7 mentions, less than 5 percent what you’d expect if you considered those stories only of equal importance.
The Washington Post mentioned the Confederate flag 624 times in the last month (only 135 of these mention Roof), and 126 times in the first six days. The Washington Post has 28 stories mentioning the Planned Parenthood video in the first six days, just over 22 percent of what you’d expect if you considered the harvesting of organs from aborted babies to be merely as important as the Confederate flag topic.
The New York Times has run stories and essays on the Confederate flag 149 times since June 17 (and only 39 of those mention Roof), 41 of those in the first six days. That compares to three stories on Planned Parenthood during the same window, just 7 percent of what you’d expect if the New York Times considered those stories merely of equal importance.
Finally, Nexis shows 70 mentions of the Confederate flag on Politico.com in the last month (only 18 mention Roof), 29 of those in the first six days of the story. For the Planned Parenthood video, it shows 4 stories. Don’t forget that many broadcasters were even more zealous in their coverage of the Confederate flag, while running only the briefest mentions, at best, of the Planned Parenthood story. I’d also be curious how the pro/con arguments break down for the two issues in terms of editorials and op-eds. Clearly, our media are struggling to come up with any angles to cover on this story. Perhaps they don’t want to be so disparate in their coverage but, like my predecessors on the government waste, fraud and mismanagement beat, they just don’t have any ideas. I don’t have any of the resources of the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, or Politico. If I did, here are just a few stories that I might have reporters look into. Feel free to add your ideas in the comments. Have at ’em, well-funded news teams: We’ve heard about serial murderer/abortionist Kermit Gosnell keeping trophies of his victims, abortion clinics dumping babies in the trash, and now Deborah Nucatola working to do “a little better than break even” in the sales of intact baby organs. What’s the standard procedure for disposal of the unborn children killed in abortion? Are there abortion clinic standards for this? Does it vary state by state? Do states even have regulations? Does Planned Parenthood have uniform regulations? If not, why not? If so, how are they enforced?
How much money does Planned Parenthood receive via sales of baby organs? Do they keep records? Are those records trustworthy? How do we know? How significant are these funds to the abortion portion of Planned Parenthood’s operation? How does compensation for the children’s lungs, livers, hearts and brains vary by state, if they do vary?
How far along in a pregnancy must a woman be for her child’s organs to be considered worthwhile for procurement, sale and transfer? How much does the value of a child’s liver, heart, lungs, etc., increase with time? Do the sales of baby organs form a significant enough part of Planned Parenthood’s business model to result in, say, filibustering of protections for late-term unborn children?
How did the Center for Medical Progress obtain the video? Who are they? Why haven’t the media ask tough questions of abortion clinics, historically? When Indiana passed a religious freedom bill, various media outlets roamed the countryside searching for vendors with religious objections to same-sex marriage, such as the owners of Memories Pizza. What questions might be posed to abortion clinic owners and managers around the country? Does the failure of the media to cover abortion well encourage undercover journalism operations, such as the one by Center for Medical Progress?
What are the laws on trafficking in human body parts? Who wrote those laws? Was the abortion industry involved in writing those laws?
How much money is made throughout the organ sale process? How do corporations make their way around laws prohibiting the express sale of human organs? What do ethicists say about these loopholes and workarounds?
Could expert observers take us through Planned Parenthood’s various responses to the charges levied in the video? They don’t deny the charges. How is that significant?
Clearly this was a story that generated tremendous interest among critics of Planned Parenthood. Yet reports flooded in of Facebook denying people the ability to share posts about the story or even “like” ones they saw. What is the real story there? What was going on? What does Facebook say about why that was happening? Similarly, Twitter waited many hours before allowing Planned Parenthood to be a trending topic on Twitter. Why? How is that focused? What role do social media corporations play in controlling news? Who makes these calls, and what are their criteria for doing so? How do they rate something as offensive or unsuitable?
Who is Deborah Nucatola? What is her role at Planned Parenthood? Does she have other significant roles? What are her political contributions? Who are her political allies? If a young woman making lightly disparaging comments about the Obama family on her Facebook page merited a deep dive by the Washington Post into her high school records, what can we learn from Nucatola’s childhood friends, boyfriends, colleagues. Where did things go wrong for her? What did it mean, if anything, when Planned Parenthood said Nucatola had been lightly reprimanded for her comments recorded on the video? What, in particular, did she do to deserve a reprimand? Will Cecile Richards tell us what specific statements Nucatola said that were offensive?
Why has the media covered this salacious and scandalous story with so much less rigor and enthusiasm than might be expected? What do managing editors have to say about the treatment of this story? Many promised to fix the problems after the Gosnell media blackout. What do they think went wrong with those efforts, if they were ever implemented?
Why have abortion rights groups and prominent activists been so silent about this story?
If asking every pro-life politician in the country to weigh in on Todd Akin’s impolitic remarks on “legitimate rape” made sense, let’s certainly find out what every pro-choice politician in the country thinks about the harvesting of baby organs by abortionists for sale to corporations. Hillary Clinton’s close ties to Planned Parenthood and abortion rights extremists mean her response is the lead story.
How did sales of aborted children begin? Did Planned Parenthood seek buyers or did the baby part buyers seek out Planned Parenthood? Does it depend by affiliate? Planned Parenthood has a corner on the market of freshly dead young humans. Does this market share make them significant in the human organ trade? Who are the buyers? Who arranges the sales? How much money changes hands? Do the buyers receive any federal funds? What research is conducted?
Along those lines, what are the laws governing sale of tissue in other circumstances? If it was a tumor that had been removed, would the doctor have the right to sell it? Would they have the right to try and do “a little better than break even”? What governs that? How does the process specifically work and who oversees the regulation of this industry? Specifically how are sales monitored? How confident are observers and interested parties that the monitoring of this process is stringent or effective?
What do corporations do with aborted baby parts? Is there any risk that people have unknowingly been using products or research based on parts harvested from the children killed in abortion? Do consumers have the right to know when humans are killed and then have their parts used for research?
The undercover journalists produced one example of a form Planned Parenthood uses to obtain consent from mothers procuring abortions. Is that form standard across all Planned Parenthood affiliates? If not, how and why do they vary? Do other abortion corporations have similar consent forms? How do they vary? The one example of Planned Parenthood’s consent form specifically said that mothers understand they won’t be compensated for “donating” their children’s tissue. However, in early public relations materials from Planned Parenthood, they claimed that Nucatola’s money discussion wasn’t about selling body parts to corporations but, rather, about compensating women for their “donation.” Explain the disparity.
Do medical ethicists think that Planned Parenthood’s consent forms are sufficient? Should women be told that abortionists may alter their abortion procedures to procure valuable livers, lungs, hearts and brains? If not, why not? If so, are any Planned Parenthood affiliates so informing the women whose abortions they perform?
Is Planned Parenthood able to disclose which of its affiliates are engaged in the harvesting of baby organs for sale to corporations? If not, why not? If so, how reliable are their records? Since organ sales are prohibited, organ harvesters typically charge for “shipping” or “rental space” in a clinic. How does Planned Parenthood designate its organ sales to be or appear to be reasonable? What is the range of amounts charged for these things? How and why do they vary? What is considered a reasonable amount? How is “reasonable” determined?
Explain the various federal and state laws governing organ procurement and sales. What legal regime is in place that permits the harvesting and sale of organs? How is it monitored?
What do medical experts say about the changes to the abortion procedure mentioned by Nucatola for the sake of procuring organs. Do these changes to the abortion procedure increase the chance of complications for the mother? Is there an incentive on the part of Planned Parenthood to target larger babies for “part conservation” by inducing breach deliveries, as mentioned by Dr. Nucatola? What rights do the mothers have to be informed about how their abortion process has been altered to procure these parts? Dr. Nucatola claims that mothers don’t have the right to be notified of her alterations to the procedure. Is that true?
How has the Planned Parenthood video been received by those who have seen it? What parts struck them the most? How do people who deny the humanity of the unborn child explain the video discussions about harvesting their organs?
How does the harvesting of organs fit into Planned Parenthood’s work culture? Do people who work at Planned Parenthood clinics know that this is going on? Do they all chat about it over salad or is it more a covert wing of the operation? Do new workers or volunteers learn about it and react poorly? Various prominent pro-life activists are former Planned Parenthood employees and managers. What do they know about this practice? Are secretaries at Planned Parenthood cheerfully arranging for the delivery of fetal livers immediately after booking an abortion appointment? Does Planned Parenthood have an employment hiring or retention problem?
Tell us more about the “reimbursement” rates for various organs. Which organs are most valuable? How do those organs change in value over time? How does this relate to the late-term abortion debate?
Is there a price differential between white baby parts and black baby parts? Is there a price differential between male organs and female organs? If so, how much? It’s just a few of the many angles that could be covered and should be covered. The media may have gotten a tremendously late start, but better late than never. Go get ’em, journalists! Do your jobs!  UPDATE: Readers suggest a few more questions reporters who want to do journalism might be interested in finding answers to: Did the buyers of organs, either as companies or as individuals, from Planned Parenthood donate back to Planned Parenthood or their affiliates? Would be great to see donor records. Start with executives at StemExpress. Are there lobbying ties to explore?
Why the difference in price for different parts (Nucatola discussed a “menu” of options) if it doesn’t correlate to their value, there are no changes to the abortion procedure and Planned Parenthood is merely being “reimbursed” for their costs?
What laws govern organ harvesting, state and federal? How do they vary?
How widespread is the practice of organ harvesting in this country and elsewhere
The video mentions discussions regarding organ harvesting occurring “behind closed doors” at Planned Parenthood. Tell us more about what those conversations might entail.
Why doesn’t Planned Parenthood advertise that they harvest organs?
What are the uses of the organs and tissues obtained and where is the end market? Medical research in what fields? In what countries? For what end goals? What non research /non scientific uses are there if any, and in what countries and by whom?  Do these same markets exist in post birth and/or adult tissue and how do the markets compare? How big is the industry in terms of manpower and economic power? Are the procurement procedures and markets in existence in other countries and how do they compare? What are the international laws that govern this industry and are there treaties for trade that include these markets? Is there a black market In the US or elsewhere, and to what extent?
If a women is ‘gifting’ her baby’s body parts to Planned Parenthood, and then Planned parenthood is then, supposedly, ‘gifting’ these parts to research, what value is placed on the gift? I can’t gift something of significant value to another person or organization without the IRS being involved. Can a women claim the ‘gift’ as a donation to a tax exempt organization and if so how much can be claimed on IRS forms? My question is, with all this ‘gifting’ going on, what is the possible requirement for IRS involvement? Are body parts considered a tax exempt donation when passed from Planned Parenthood to a public for-profit corporation doing research? If it can and should be claimed, how much is Planned Parenthood claiming on their IRS forms for each of their ‘donations’ to corporations and/or research organizations for each body part? Do these companies then declare the receipt of the organs as donations which are assigned a monetary value and then taxed?
What is the history of Planned Parenthood and in particular how have Margaret Sanger’s principles and ideas about social classes and races influenced PP? Does Sanger have any thoughts about medical ethics with regards to aborted babies? Or aborted babies of “inferior classes”?
Are abortions ever delayed and pregnancies allowed to continue until fetal development reaches a particular stage that makes harvesting of organs more viable?
Since this is all scientific research, can we expect video of the research? Can we get access to video documentation of the transport of fetal remains and harvesting of the organs? Is there a timeline available in how this material is handled? Are harvested fetal organs treated in the same way as other donated organs? Does the mother have any involvement in the release of such organs to researchers? How is authorization given for such usage
What sort of benefits does PP receive that are not directly financial? Are there other forms of compensation that we do not know about?
What about the use of ultrasound technology? If it’s considered torture to the recipient of the procedure to make her watch it, how does she feel about doctors using it to reposition the fetus for maximum extraction rewards? Should the recipient be giving consent for the sonogram for this portion of the procedure? Why is there no backlash against PP doctors using ultrasounds to better obtain intact body parts, while there was a huge backlash against the Texas law requiring ultrasounds to provide the mothers with a more thorough understanding of their bodies and the procedure they were signing up for? How is one invasive and whatnot, but not the other?
The original video had the doctor quoting the worth of the ’tissue’ as $30-$100 per SPECIMEN. What is the breakdown on that? If the doctor ‘crushes’ the correct parts and the harvest includes a healthy, undamaged liver, two lungs, a brain, at least one kidney, a heart and ‘lower extremities’, would the end results be perhaps hundreds of dollars for one abortion?
how much time do Planned Parenthood staff spend on encouraging adoption over abortion? After all, a major source of their income comes from abortion.
Are these “business lunches” a typical part of the operation for both Planned Parenthood and the organ brokers? Who picks up the tab? Are they part of Planned Parenthood’s budget, and how much is budgeted for them?

How many brokers are there for tissue and organs? Where do the organs ultimately end up– hospitals, universities, big pharma companies? How much taxpayer money ultimately ends up in the process? Who are the real companies buying the parts from PP? What type of volume are we talking about? Are they private independent labs or University labs? Any public research involved? What is so important about having more than just the tissue? What are the experiments?

Do arguments in support of harvesting organs from the unborn apply to prisoners who die or are executed? If so, how so? If not, how do they not apply? What are the rules governing organ harvesting of the incarcerated who die in prison?
How were the actors portraying biologics buyers so knowledgeable and able to be so convincing? Was a disillusioned staffer at one of the purchasing companies helping them? Did someone from the Komen Foundation have anything to do with these videos as revenge for what Planned Parenthood did to them a few years ago when they tried to stop funding Planned Parenthood? Did they have someone inside Planned Parenthood helping them out?
Cargo and passenger airlines have specific policies regarding the packaging and transport of human remains. What is the method of conveyance and tracking for harvested human tissues? How are they protected against damage or loss? Do they constitute a biological hazard if broken open?

"445",445,"How To Help Planned Parenthood Employees Escape","Scheer","Holly",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-09-23"," “Anybody… ANYBODY… could have ended up inside an abortion clinic, because we all have a propensity to sin and it’s not like people wake up and say, ‘I want to work in the abortion industry.’ That could have been any of us.” These words, spoken by former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson, help explain her subsequent pro-life outreach to clinic workers. We pro-life people are familiar with the damage abortion does to babies and families. The recent spate of undercover videos has outraged us by bringing to light not just Planned Parenthood’s sale and disposal of bodies of dead babies, infection risks to mothers, and the companies poised to claim remains for experimentation. They’ve also shocked us with the reactions and sentiments of Planned Parenthood workers and connected researchers. The truth is that abortion hurts these people, too, even if they don’t realize it. And there’s help for them.  Without workers willing to perform abortions, the industry would grind to a halt. We’re fighting legal battles to end abortion. We’re urging mothers to choose life. We’re contacting our elected officials to let them know we disapprove of legalized murder. But are we reaching out to Planned Parenthood workers and letting them know that there’s hope and forgiveness? If you’re not familiar with Johnson’s story, you should be. She worked for eight years at Planned Parenthood, culminating in directing a Texas clinic. Then she left the industry and changed from being part of the abortion process to helping other workers who want to leave. You can read more details about her story here. Financial, legal, and emotional support for clinic workers looking to leave the abortion industry can be found at And Then There Were None. Johnson talked with me about the realities of life as a clinic worker and how we can help people like her. ‘Many Times, These Workers Want to Leave’ At least 70 percent of people who work in the abortion industry have themselves undergone abortions. Johnson said most people don’t know something very important about clinic workers: “We don’t need rage, we don’t need anger. There’s enough in those clinic walls. We only need to bring grace and kindness to the people in the clinics. To the people who have the procedures, and the workers. We need to have the same level of compassion for post-abortive workers and clinic workers.” At least 70 percent of people who work in the abortion industry have themselves undergone abortions, Johnson notes.  “So these are hurting people that got into this industry because they were trying to justify a past of sin in their lives,” she says. “So we need to be compassionate, kind, and always pointing them to hope. Many times these workers want to leave.” A Frightening Career Johnson and her organization stress a relationship and love for clinic workers as the way to win their hearts and help them leave. ‘They have a belief that if a child is unwanted it’s wrong to bring that child into the world.’ Something else Johnson says about these workers may surprise you: “Pro-lifers make the incorrect assumption that people who work in the abortion industry hate children, but most of them are parents. They’re moms. They’re dads. They love kids—they love their kids. It’s not about not liking kids, it’s about they have a belief that if a child is unwanted it’s wrong to bring that child into the world.” Legalized abortion has created a whole category of people hurt by their careers. When your livelihood and family support is tied into any industry, it can be frightening to imagine a career change. The possible legal ramifications of breaking the silence around what has been happening behind Planned Parenthood’s closed doors adds a whole new layer of fear to the equation.  How Others Can Help So how do we help? How do we reach out to those who see in one day things the rest of us can barely stand to watch? First, we don’t need to accept what is happening as morally licit. Pretending that abortion is okay doesn’t help anyone, including the employee in question. Masking the reality of the practice allows us to excuse and rationalize it. Abortion results in death. Pray for these people. Actions have consequences, in this life as well the next. Pray for these people and their families. Pray for our society that allows this, and for the women and children abortion hurts daily. Visit an abortion clinic to pray for the women and babies—and for the workers. Let them know that there are options, hope, and forgiveness. Masking the reality of the practice allows us to excuse and rationalize it. Abortion results in death. Volunteer at a pregnancy center. Offer to help in whatever ways they need, from donating time to fix leaky faucets to baby clothes to money. Get involved. How can you help? Can you write letters to abortion workers? Can you donate money to people as they look for new jobs? Does your church body include any sort of ministry to abortion clinicians as part of their human care? If you own a business, would you hire someone looking to leave the field? Speak out. Being silent about the abortion industry allows people you know to start a job and not be blindsided at what is expected of them. If you know people entering the medical profession, talk to them about life, options, and the value of all humans. Let them know you’ll help them look for a job that won’t compromise their morality. There is hope and help for people, even those caught working in the abortion industry. Part of saving lives is saving the lives of all, and that doesn’t stop at the preborn. It includes those whom it’s so easy to vilify—abortion clinicians. Let’s be pro-all-life. “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,” says Matthew 5:33-34 .Johnson echoes this as her advice for those of us working for change: “Our enemy is not flesh and blood—it’s powers and principalities… Satan and sin. See [abortion workers] like we see ourselves: sinners.” ","https://thefederalist.com/2015/09/23/how-to-help-planned-parenthood-employees-escape/",0,1,"female",2012,2012
"447",447,"Washington Post’s Kermit Gosnell Denialism Is Out Of Control","Hemingway","Mollie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-06-27"," Today the Supreme Court issued a ruling forbidding Texas from enacting health and safety regulations for facilities that end the lives of unborn children. That same court admits that the regulations were enacted by Texans in part in response to the horrific story of Kermit Gosnell, an abortion doctor out of Pennsylvania.
Gosnell is in prison for the murder of one woman and three children, the most recent of the untold number of victims he killed as part of his abortion practice. He worked for decades in filthy and unsafe conditions, keeping trophies of his victims’ feet and other body parts in formaldehyde around his cat-urine-soaked offices. The conditions of his abortion clinic and the illegal killings that took place there were only discovered when federal drug agents investigated him on tangential and unrelated drug trafficking claims.
One of the scandalous parts of the Gosnell situation and eventual trial was the near-blackout provided by the media in response to the story. The picture above is of the empty seats reserved for media at the trial. One of the few reporters who covered the trial said of it, “Sat through a full day of testimony at the Kermitt Gosnell trial today. It is beyond the most morbid Hollywood horror. It will change you.”
Usually the media are captivated by serial killers, much more those who face trial. The more lurid the details, the better. The more angles to cover, the better. But in this case, the media just couldn’t be bothered, for some reason. After years of shaming by pro-lifers led to public outrage in demand of news and information on Gosnell, the media briefly offered up a story or two before moving on.
Perhaps the best example of how this media game was played is given by Sarah Kliff, one former health policy reporter at the Washington Post. She wrote more than 80 stories about the Komen Foundation’s failed attempt to stop funding Planned Parenthood, Sandra Fluke’s campaign to force religious groups to pay for abortifacients and birth control, and Todd Akin’s comments about rape and pregnancy. But she hadn’t written a single one on Gosnell. I asked her about it at the time. Here was her response:
@MZHemingway Hi Molly – I cover policy for the Washington Post, not local crime, hence why I wrote about all the policy issues you mention.
Sarah Kliff (@sarahkliff) April 11, 2013

Of course, Gosnell’s horrific abortion clinic conditions and the legislation they spawned became the biggest abortion policy story of the next few years. But the one consistent thing about the media approach was the extreme downplaying of Gosnell and other abortion clinics with unsafe and unsanitary conditions.
Kliff has since moved on to Vox, where she’s now curious about how to extend this ruling to other states and is praising Ruth Bader Ginsburg for a “must-read quote” in her personal concurrence. Other abortion-supportive journalists are also praising the quote. Here’s the Washington Post‘s take on the most revered Ginsburg:
Notorious RBG smacks down a major abortion myth after historic SCOTUS ruling https://t.co/rBcWocEP9k
Washington Post (@washingtonpost) June 27, 2016

With tweets and headlines like this, isn’t it surprising that some find the media to be compromised on the abortion issue? Somehow it gets even worse. “The Notorious RBG” is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the strident advocate of abortion and its accompanying eugenicist philosophy. Her fans, which include the abortion-enraptured media, call her “The Notorious RBG.” Here’s the argument from the Washington Post‘s Danielle Paquette:
Texas attorneys had pointed to Gosnell in their oral arguments before the court. But in her concurring opinion, Ginsburg wrote that it’s when regulations reduce access to abortions that women are more likely to turn to underground clinics that might resemble Gosnell’s practice.
“When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures,” she wrote in a concurring opinion, “women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, faute de mieux, at great risk to their health and safety.”
So the “major myth” that the “Notorious RBG smacks down” is, apparently, that Kermit Gosnell existed and was a serial murderer who operated under an abortion regime so permissive that he hadn’t been inspected in 17 years and was only found out thanks to unrelated regulatory oversight of the drug trade.
Except that she didn’t smack that “myth” down at all, partly because it’s anything but a myth, partly because she didn’t address how clinics like his are allowed to flourish without any oversight, and partly because she didn’t substantiate her own mythical claims. Gosnell existed under a legal abortion regime. As does my local clinic in Virginia that keeps running despite flagrant health and safety violations, year after year. As do countless other filthy and unsafe clinics operating throughout the country. 
U.S. Senator Ben Sasse noticed the Washington Post claim as well:
.@washingtonpostPlease fix this bizarre headline.(Or are you suggesting that Gosnell's mass murdering was a myth?) https://t.co/llIHmFmAxz
Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) June 27, 2016

Completely apart from legitimate arguments about whether abortion clinics can or should be regulated, the Supreme Court ruling striking down health and safety regulations of Texas abortion clinics is a disingenuous and incoherent mess that does real damage to the rule of law and that only the most strident advocates of abortion could defend. 
But just on the issue of regulatory oversight of clinics, the media are perpetuating a closed loop. The abortion corporations’ claim is that abortion clinics are safe and wonderful, but will somehow be forced to close if required to hold the same health and safety standards as other surgery centers. They carry water for the abortion corporations, fighting any oversight of abortion-related practices. They smother-to-the-death any and all stories about unsafe and unsanitary conditions at health clinics. They mock voters who don’t get their marching orders from Planned Parenthood and other abortion corporations. They praise Supreme Court justices who run roughshod over the law to keep at bay any regulation of abortion clinics. Rinse, repeat.

"448",448,"Cosmopolitan Blames A Violent Rape On The Pro-Life Movement","Hobbs","Jay",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-07-03"," Reaching what can only be described as a new, heartbreaking low, Cosmopolitan ran an article this week arguing that opposition to abortion leads not just to “extreme violence,” but—at least in one case—to rape. In doing so, the so-called “women’s” magazine could be allowing a North Carolina rapist to stay free and unaccountable for his crime.  The goal of the piece, written by Rebecca Grant, was made plain by its headline: “She Told a Guy She Worked at an Abortion Clinic. On Their Next Date, He Raped Her: Clinic director Calla Hales was a victim of the extreme violence abortion providers face simply for doing their jobs and helping women.” Using a rape Hales says she suffered in late 2015 as a fulcrum, Cosmopolitan leverages her story to try and demonstrate that the attack itself—rather than an isolated, yet horrific, instance of violence—is indicative of swelling anti-abortion extremism at-large. As the headline indicates, Hales says her attacker turned violent after she told him she worked at A Preferred Women’s Health Center (APWHC), a chain of four abortion businesses in North Carolina and Georgia. On Hales’ telling of the attack, the man sexually assaulted her at the end of their second date, making his motivations clear even while he was raping her:  “He had me in between the seats, wrapped the seat belt around my neck, and at some point, bit me on my chest,” Hales said. “He said things like I should have expected this and that I deserved it. He asked how I could live with myself and said I should repent. That I was a jezebel. That I was a murderer. That he was doing no worse to me than I had done to women. He said he would make me remember him.” Though she’s willing to tell her story through Cosmopolitan, Hales declined to report her attacker’s name—even after she says the man showed up at one of her clinics on multiple occasions to harass her as part of a larger group of pro-lifers who gather regularly to protest APWHC’s abortion practice. Hales goes further during the article, in fact, telling Grant that her rapist followed up the initial attack with intimidating text messages and phone calls, and told the other pro-life demonstrators intimate details about Hale so that they could harass her as well. Hales’ reluctance to report her attacker to police is surely understandable. What’s more difficult to reconcile is how Hales could be too afraid of the rapist’s “retribution”—as she puts it— to report him to the police, yet comfortable enough to tell the whole world about the incident through Cosmopolitan.  The Real Culprit: Pro-Lifers? While casting those on the other side of a debate in the worst possible light is a time-honored—albeit, sleazy—way to look like you’ve won an argument, Cosmopolitan’s capitalizing on Hales’ story to sling mud at the pro-life movement is beyond the pale by any measure. There’s no reason to doubt Hales’ story in and of itself. It could very well be that her rapist is a walking contradiction, pronouncing a high value for human life on one hand, yet dehumanizing others—even to the point of raping those with whom he disagrees. To take Hales at her word, the man who raped her is driven by a deep, vile disregard for the sanctity and dignity of human life. That he justifies rape by condemning abortion only makes him what he already is—an evil man justifying an evil act. Yet, rather than showing a proper zeal to bring this man to justice and—at the very least—protect his future victims from the crimes he’s sure to commit, Cosmopolitan shows it’s far more committed to “winning” the abortion debate than actually helping women and advancing their role in the world. If the rapist gets a free pass this time around because Cosmopolitan is too busy grinding its axes, well that’s just the price of doing business. After all, we all know who’s responsible for this rape: pro-lifers who have the gall to stand outside of abortion clinics and offer a woman in an unexpected pregnancy a better way forward. Violence at Abortion Clinics is Actually Trending Downward Opening the article with the story of Hales’ sexual assault, Grant backtracks to tell readers that Hales’ parents purchased APWHC when she was 8 years old, so she grew up learning to live in a contentious environment as a result. Curiously, Grant then goes on to cite a 2016 National Abortion Federation report that actually shows incidences of violence against abortion businesses on a steep downturn over the past seven years. By NAF’s count, even non-violent crimes such as trespassing fell by more than 53 percent from 2010 to 2016 as compared to 2000-09. Nevertheless, Grant attempts to prove that a rise in reported picketing in front of abortion clinics is tied to Hales’ rape: In its 2016 report, the National Abortion Federation (NAF), which monitors clinic harassment and violence, found that picketing, vandalism, obstruction, invasion, trespassing, burglary, stalking, assault and battery, and bomb threats are all on the rise. Clinics reported 60,000 incidents of picketing that year, an all-time high since the NAF began tracking these statistics in 1977. The report also documented a five-fold increase in hate speech and internet harassment, which escalated after the election. The 2016 National Clinic Violence Survey, published by the Feminist Majority Foundation, found that the percentage of clinics reporting the most severe types of anti-abortion violence and threats of violence has dramatically increased from the first six months of 2014 to the first six months of 2016 — from 19.7 percent to 34.2 percent. Hales was raped in November 2015.
Now abortion rights advocates fear the violence and harassment may get even worse. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, passed in 1994, made it a federal crime to use force, threat of force, or physical obstruction to interfere with a person’s right to obtain or provide reproductive health services, but it’s only effective if enforced. Cosmopolitan’s argument is clear, and becomes even more pronounced as the article moves along: picketing abortion clinics leads to violent assaults and rape. It’s hard to dream up a more ironclad fusion of Slippery Slope and Guilt by Association fallacies than that. Blame the Actual Perpetrator, Cosmo In its failed, slanderous attempt to tie Hales’ rape to an uptick in abortion-clinic violence that isn’t actually happening, Cosmopolitan is actually doing something far more dangerous in the long run. While Grant and Cosmopolitan spill plenty of ink and pixels blaming abortion opponents for violent attacks like the one Hales suffered, their own reporting—if true—concedes that a violent sexual predator is still on the loose because Hales refuses to report him to the police. Rather than inspiring rape victims like Hales to defend themselves—at the very least—through the legal system, Cosmopolitan pins the blame on pro-lifers who oppose an industry that not only takes a million human lives every year in the U.S. alone, but routinely covers for rapists and other sexual predators in order to keep up its profit margin. Calla Hales and other rape victims deserve far better than this. Rather than exploitation as a pro-abortion mascot, they deserve help and healing from assaults that are in no way their own fault. Hales’ attacker deserves to be brought to justice for his crime, and his future victims deserve protection from a violent madman. And those on both sides of the abortion divide deserve the basic decency it takes to cast blame on actual perpetrators, refusing the ever-growing urge to slander those with whom we disagree.

"450",450,"UnitedHealthcare’s Obamacare Drop Erodes The Conscience Safety Net","Mattox","Casey",NA,"Donovan, Chuck",NA,NA,"2016-05-10"," Americans are accustomed to thinking about the “social safety net,” the network of financial support and services, both public and private, that helps individuals and families deal with periods of poverty or job loss. We are less accustomed to thinking about a “conscience safety net,” the network of policies and institutions that allows people to deal with deep differences in values and moral outlook. Nowhere is that conscience safety net more important, and more frayed, than in health-care decision-making and financing. Today people disagree on a profound range of ethically grounded decisions about practices, from abortion to in vitro fertilization to assisted suicide, that go to the heart of what citizens believe properly constitutes health care. Combine these deepening differences with a tendency to bureaucratize and centralize health-care financing and administration, and profound clashes are sure to follow.  While we closely follow disputes that result in lawsuits, like the Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor litigation over mandatory contraceptive coverage or California’s mandate that even churches include elective abortion in their insurance plans, we tend to pay far less attention to the structural and economic changes in health care that actively, but quietly, erode the conscience safety net. But these disputes may actually be where the rubber meets the road. Consider the recently announcement from UnitedHealthcare (UH), the nation’s largest health insurer, that it will leave the Obamacare exchange system for 2017 in at least 26 of the 34 states in which it has participated. This means UH would be off the exchanges for sign-ups as early as this fall. UH officials attribute the departure to the company’s sustained financial losses in these marketplaces, which rely on premium tax subsidies to enroll millions of customers whose health histories had reduced their insurability under prior law. Obamacare Has Allowed for the Conscience Safety Net The Obamacare exchanges offer a patchwork of components in the conscience safety net. Each recognizes in its own way the legitimacy of citizen objections to using their tax dollars, or their own funds, to pay into an insurance plan that treats elective abortion as ethically acceptable. The underlying law, the Affordable Care Act, permitted states, in their reduced role of regulating health insurance plans, to exclude from their exchanges all plans that cover elective abortion. Twenty-five states have taken advantage of this ACA provision and operate exchanges with no plans that cover elective abortion. The rest allow plans that cover elective abortion. Each recognizes the legitimacy of citizen objections to using their tax dollars, or their own funds, to pay into an insurance plan that treats elective abortion as ethically acceptable. Then there are the insurance options managed directly by the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These multi-state plans (MSPs) are private-sector plans that must meet a timetable ACA established (a timetable many insurance companies doubted could be met), offered by private insurers like UnitedHealthcare and Aetna in multiple states and eventually reaching all 50 states if they are to remain qualified as MSPs.  The conscience factor for MSPs followed from the fact that the ACA required each private company offering an MSP to provide at least one plan option that excluded elective abortion coverage. This was particularly important because the ACA requires a monthly abortion payment for any plan that covers elective abortions, with the proceeds segregated into an account specifically to pay for those abortions. On paper, having MSPs sounds like a reasonable way to ensure that at least one subsidized insurance option in each state exchange offers individuals and families coverage without abortion. But, as we have explained before, it is nearly impossible for average citizens to discern whether their plans cover elective abortion before enrolling, much less the import of that fact—that they are paying a hidden abortion surcharge. Atop the secrecy, the MSPs have not developed smoothly. The ACA describes what an MSP must do to exist on the exchanges and derive the benefit of OPM promotion, but no company is obliged to offer an MSP in the first place. Nor can any company afford to conduct a segment of its operations in a market where it is taking heavy losses. Thus, while Obamacare required the administration to ensure an MSP without abortion coverage was on every exchange by 2017, some insurers have expressed doubt it would meet this deadline. A Lack of Insurance Plans That Don’t Sponsor Abortions The failure to implement MSPs or recruit other non-abortion plans has meant that in several states pro-life citizens had no choice. They would be fined if they didn’t purchase a plan, but the only available plans required them to pay a surcharge used to cover others’ elective abortions. Through 2014, all exchange plans in five states covered elective abortion. Three Alliance Defending Freedom lawsuits in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Vermont challenged this compulsion of pro-life citizens to pay for others’ abortions or be fined by the government.  The failure to implement MSPs or recruit other non-abortion plans has meant that in several states pro-life citizens had no choice. In response to a lawsuit by the Bracy family in Connecticut, the exchange and federal government added new plans that did not cover elective abortions or require this mandatory abortion fee. Rhode Island’s exchange likewise added new plans the year after the ADF lawsuit. Vermont added no pro-life plan but exempted the objecting individual from the mandate because of his pro-life conscience. UH’s exit is not just a sign of the economic problems facing Obamacare; it may also expose more Americans to the “choice” to pay for elective abortions or be fined. The first conscience impact of UH’s departure may be felt in Massachusetts, where UH has been the only option among the 10 available in the Bay State that does not cover elective abortion. Massachusetts would join Vermont and Hawaii (at least) as states where citizens must either pay into the abortion pool or go without exchange coverage and pay a federal fine. The conscience safety net will be frayed elsewhere, also. Although UH plans do not uniformly exclude abortion coverage (a factor that might make some plan purchasers object to the company), in many states they have been one more option for customers to avoid paying for something they regard as antithetical to the canons of medical ethics. In Connecticut, for example, UH has been offering seven plans that exclude elective abortion, meaning its departure could wipe out 58 percent of the state’s pro-life options next year. In Colorado, UH has been offering more than 10 percent of the exchange’s abortion-free plans. UH’s business decision is part of a trend. In the Obamacare era, the health-care industry continues to centralize and concentrate. These largely government-imposed economic obstacles will also leave fewer options for those who want health-care choices that align with their values. With fewer options and less responsive markets, the conscience safety net is likely to continue to deteriorate, and the drive for a massive single-payer system will accelerate. The ability of customers to “vote with their feet” will decline, and so will their ability to vote with their convictions.

"451",451,"The Left’s ‘Forced Birth’ Motif Is Just A Projection Of Its Own Lethal Force","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-11"," A Twitter follower recently sent me a photo of a poster in Seattle alluding to abortion restrictions and bans as “forced motherhood,” which is, to the leftists who drew up this tripe, “female enslavement.”



There’s no mention here about the rights of preborn females to life and freedom, mind you, but we are told with the passionate conviction of a Baptist preacher describing the end times that women everywhere are being forced into motherhood, since their “choice has been taken away from them,” and that this is a violation of their “fundamental human rights.” Women are being coerced, you see, and that just doesn’t jibe with the concept of human rights, does it?



Like so many of the left’s talking points about everything from sexuality to school choice, the “forced birth” meme examined critically is not just untrue, it’s a projection onto their opposition of their own brutality and reliance on force and limiting choice.



First, the part that should be obvious: Babies are the natural consequence of sex, and if you have sexual intercourse, you invite the possibility of pregnancy. Getting pregnant and carrying that baby to term and having that baby is not some new dystopian reality for women that Ron “DeathSantis” (or insert the latest rage-inducing Republican politician here) “forced” on “birthing people.” Procreation is as old as humanity and is indeed the only way humans have survived as a species. 



Since the advent of hormonal birth control and “safe and legal” abortion, many humans have been deceived into thinking that the primary reason sex exists is not to make new humans, but rather for enjoyment. This is as false now as it has always been; the fact that new ways to avoid being pregnant have arisen in the last 60 years does not change this basic biological reality that sex makes babies. Participants in consensual sex aren’t being forced into birth, they are inviting the possibility of new humans coming into existence. When that possibility manifests, women engage in a completely natural and healthy process of nurturing developing babies in their wombs.



When a woman is impregnated by rape, this is obviously a violation of her autonomy. Still, the child is innocent, and as an innocent human being, he or she has the most fundamental right: the right to life. That right cannot be violated to avoid a loss of autonomy for nine months. The baby’s right to life doesn’t supersede a mother’s right to life, either, which may be a reason to deliver a baby early, even too early to survive, but never a reason to deliberately destroy him. The leftists currently throwing tantrums over Dobbs and sketching cliché shackled wrists aren’t asking for abortion to be legal only in cases of rape or threats to mothers’ lives anyway; they’re objecting to most restrictions on the so-called “fundamental right to choose.”



Abortion Isn’t a Right



Yet the idea of abortion as a legally protected right is extremely new in the context of thousands of years of human existence, though it wasn’t uncommon among the Romans, the Aztecs, and other ancient civilizations to treat infants and the unborn as disposable. Human rights don’t spring up or die when “safe and effective” technology arises; human rights are as old as humans, since they come from their Creator, and are not dependent on technology. 



It’s the same with abortion as it is with “sex change” surgeries. Your ability to alter your appearance to resemble that of the other sex or brutally remove another human life from existence with minimal physical damage to yourself does not create new “fundamental rights.” These are entitlements dreamed up by people desperate to free themselves from core realities of being physical humans, eager to drag other naïve humans along with them in a quest to “liberate” themselves of these pesky biological “constraints.”  



We must suppose abortion advocates haven’t stopped to think that maybe deliberately destroying their own flesh and blood offspring is what’s messed up and unnatural and “forced,” even as they’re buying their organic food and their organic fertilizer and their organic cotton sheets. Going to a medical facility or taking medication at home to dismember or chemically dissolve their own babies is what is truly disturbing and disordered — not laws against doing so.



Abortion advocates, a group almost exclusively belonging to the left, will not allow the possibility that the desire for abortion might be an indication that either the circumstances or the woman’s mindset about motherhood or both are warped and unhealthy. Instead of helping women create external circumstances like mate choice, career choice, and social support that are more favorable to raising children, they double down on the disordered, the unnatural, the lethal “force” of abortion as a “human right.”



Consequence not Coercion



If “forced birth” is how a pro-abortion woman thinks of carrying a baby she accidentally made while having sex, then any other unintended consequence in life must also be “forced” upon her. She ate too much cake and sat on her couch too much: obesity was “forced” on her. She drank too much chardonnay: a hangover was “forced” on her. She took a turn too fast in the rain and slid off the road into a ditch: the ditch was “forced” on her.



When you put it in these terms “forced birth” seems like nonsense — because it is. Consequence and coercion are too completely different concepts. Not having an “easy out” of an accident doesn’t mean the consequences of your actions are “forced” on you, it just means you have to live with your consequences. Legal abortion was an “easy out” the Supreme Court had guaranteed, and so many women who grew up under this regime over the past five decades came to understand abortion as their “right” to escape a life-changing consequence. But this right was never a real right in the God-given sense, only an entitlement granted by the government that in fact relies on force itself. Lethal force. Abortion ends a human life, every time. How’s that for a “forced” consequence? 



Abortion advocates now pivot to very exceptional circumstances like 10-year-olds getting pregnant by incestuous rape to turn the public against those cruel Republican-crafted abortion bans. But these abortion advocates were, and still are, pushing abortion as a right in any circumstance whatsoever and declaring any unplanned pregnancy in a world without legal abortion to be a “forced birth.”



Abortion ends a human life and stops a heartbeat. Whether leftist abortion advocates freely admit it or not, this is lethal force applied to another innocent human in order to exercise this so-called “right.” The “forced birth” meme is thus another projection of the left’s own brutality and reliance on force onto their opposition, just like they project Ron Desantis as “authoritarian” for not allowing Covid vaccine mandates while they push government vaccine mandates as “freedom,” or claim that “free speech” is “oppressive” while censorship is “freedom from hate.”



The left can post all the sloppy sketches of breaking chains and sobbing women they want, but we should take the power out of the “forced birth” meme by calling it what it is: a projection.

"452",452,"Illinois Considers Another Terrifying Law Allowing Infanticide","Bauer","Elizabeth",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-03-01"," On January 22, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law a measure permitting abortion up to the gestational age of 24 weeks for any reason, and after that point, if “necessary to protect the patient’s life or health,” that is, broadening its prior “life of the mother” law to one based on the broad Doe v. Bolton definition as overall well-being. On February 21, the Vermont House passed a measure that “would legalize abortion at any stage of pregnancy and for any reason,” as described by Alexandra DeSanctis at National Review. The House sent it to the state’s Senate.  Then Illinois climbed on the bandwagon with a bill that removes any limits on abortion, HB 2495, the Reproductive Health Act. As of February 28, it had 42 sponsors, out of a total of 118 members of the Illinois House of Representatives, 73 of whom are Democrats. On Tuesday, it was assigned to a committee. This bill is terrifying in its scope. To begin with, it wholly repeals IL 720, the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975. This law has been amended multiple times, including in 2017 (HB 40), but some minimal protections remained, so that current Illinois law permits post-viability abortions but requires that an attending or referring physician determine that it was “necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother,” in which case the doctor was required to document the particular medical indications for the abortion. It also requires that, if the baby would be capable of survival, the doctor use the abortion method “most likely to preserve the life and health of the fetus” and a second physician be available to provide medical care for any child born alive. These provisions would be entirely removed. The bill also would repeal the Partial-birth Abortion Ban Act and the Abortion Performance Refusal Act, which, as its name suggest, protects the conscience rights of those who refuse to perform abortions. Instead, it categorically states that “Every individual who becomes pregnant has a fundamental right to continue the pregnancy and give birth or to have an abortion, and to make autonomous decisions about how to exercise that right.” It also states “A fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights under the laws of this State.” The bill’s definition of abortion makes it clear that abortions are intended to result in the death of the child: “‘Abortion’ means the use of any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other substance or device to terminate the pregnancy of an individual known to be pregnant with an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth, to preserve the life or health of the child after live birth, or to remove a dead fetus.”  If that isn’t enough, the bill goes further: Any qualified “health care professional” — “including, but not limited to, a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant”—may provide abortions (emphasis mine). There’s more: Abortion clinics become exempted from rules for ambulatory surgical treatment centers, unless they use “general, epidural, or spinal anesthesia.”
Any health insurance policy issued in the state must include abortion coverage without any cost-sharing requirement.
All instances of the phrase “pregnant woman” are changed to read “pregnant individual” and instances of the phrase “her unborn child” (in a section which, as small consolation, remains, on the intentional homicide of wanted unborn children) have the possessive pronoun removed, in order, it appears, to make allowance for pregnant transgender people. Separately, a companion bill, HB 2467, would repeal the parental notification law. This bill, however, has a mere three sponsors. Why this law? Why now? Although CBS News, for example, describes it as motivated by “uncertainty surrounding the fate of Roe v. Wade,” the 2017 law was already billed by its supporters as “codifying Roe v. Wade,” so whatever desire abortion rights activists in other states might have to eliminate any laws that would criminalize abortion in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned, it is not an issue in Illinois. Instead, this bill is part of a larger strategy to normalize abortion, under any circumstances, at any point in pregnancy. As Rewire.News reported, “It’s pushing back against a deliberate strategy of the anti-abortion movement of stigmatizing and siloing women’s reproductive health care, and these bills are saying we need to treat reproductive health care like any other health care,” said Colleen Connell, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois.  Indeed, even in the bill itself, “abortion care” is used instead of “abortion” and it is listed as one component of “reproductive health care” alongside “maternity care.” This is Illinois, where Democrat J.B. Pritzker has replaced Republican Bruce Rauner (who signed abortion-expanding legislation) as governor, fast-tracked a $15 minimum wage (signed by Pritzker on February 19), and has been casting himself as the one who will save the state from his predecessor’s misdeeds. Will the Democratic supermajority push this bill through as a means of demonstrating and cementing their power over Republicans, without any legislators even reflecting on or acknowledging its extreme nature? Will any consideration for the humanity of the unborn (and the lives even of abortion survivors) be discarded in order to score political points? It’s a very real, and very worrying, possibility.

"453",453,"Roe Destroyed Many Social Institutions That Are Unlikely To Return","Lott","John","R."," Jr.",NA,NA,"2022-05-09"," With the news that the U.S. Supreme Court will likely overturn Roe v. Wade, commentary has largely concentrated on the moral issues, women’s desires to not bear a child to term, and the soundness of the original court decision. However, the current discussion also provides a chance to evaluate how liberalizing abortion rules from 1969 to 1973 ignited profound long-term social changes in America and whether the court’s decision will reverse those changes. One often misunderstood fact: Legal abortions didn’t start with Roe or even with the five states that liberalized abortion laws in 1969 and 1970. Before Roe, women could have abortions when their lives or health were endangered. Even in some conservative states, such as Kansas, doctors had very liberal interpretations of what constituted a danger to health.  Nevertheless, Roe substantially increased abortions, more than doubling the rate per live birth in the five years from 1972 to 1977. But many other changes occurred at the same time, among them: a sharp increase in premarital sex; a sharp rise in out-of-wedlock births; a drop in the number of children placed for adoption; and a decline in marriages that occur after the woman is pregnant. Many of these changes might seem contradictory. For example, why would both the number of abortions and out-of-wedlock births go up? If there were more illegitimate births, why were fewer children available for adoption? When examined closer, however, one can make sense of these changes. Encouraging Premarital Sex Part of the answer to the first puzzle lies in attitudes toward premarital sex. With abortion seen as a backup, women and men became less careful in using contraceptives and more likely to have premarital sex. There were more unplanned pregnancies. But legal abortion did not mean every unplanned pregnancy led to an abortion. After all, just because abortion is legal does not mean that the decision is easy.  Academic studies have found that legalized abortion, by encouraging premarital sex, increased the number of unplanned births, even outweighing the reduction in unplanned births due to abortion. Starting in the early 1970s, following Roe, out-of-wedlock births increased dramatically through the late 1980s. It rose from an average of 5 percent of all births from 1965 to 1969 to more than 16 percent two decades later (1985 to 1989). For black Americans, the numbers soared from 35 percent to 62 percent. While not all of this increase was caused by liberalized abortion rules, it was a key contributing factor. Shotgun Marriages With legalization and a woman able to escape an unplanned pregnancy, a man might well expect his partner to have an abortion if a sexual encounter resulted in an unplanned pregnancy. But what happens if the woman refuses — say, she is morally opposed or, perhaps, she thought she could have an abortion but, upon becoming pregnant, decides she can’t go through with it? Feeling tricked into unwanted fatherhood, many men likely will wash their hands of the affair altogether, thinking, “I never wanted a baby. It’s her choice, so let her raise the baby herself.”  Society’s expectations of men in this position changed dramatically in the last five decades. Evidence shows that the greater availability of abortion largely ended “shotgun” marriages, where men felt obligated to marry the women. Single-Parent Families What has happened to these babies of reluctant fathers? The mothers often raise the children on their own. Even as abortion has led to more out-of-wedlock births, it has dramatically reduced adoptions of children born in America by two-parent families. Before Roe, when abortion was much more difficult, women who would have chosen an abortion but could not get one turned to adoption as their backup. After Roe, women who turned down an abortion also were the type who wanted to keep the child. But all these changes — rising out-of-wedlock births, plummeting adoption rates, and the end of shotgun marriages — meant more single-parent families. With work and other demands on their time, single parents, no matter how wanted their child may be, tend to devote less attention to their children than do married couples. After all, it’s difficult for one person to spend as much time with a child as two people can. From the beginning of the abortion debate, including in Roe, those favoring abortion have pointed to the social costs of “unwanted” children who won’t get the same attention and care as “wanted” ones. But a trade-off is often ignored. Abortion may eliminate “unwanted” children, but it contributes to increasing out-of-wedlock births and single parenthood. Unfortunately, the social consequences of illegitimacy dominated. Children born after liberalized abortion rules suffered a series of problems, from increased difficulties at school to committing more crime. The most vulnerable in society, poor blacks, have suffered the most from these changes. No matter who wins the election or controls the Supreme Court, abortions are unlikely to be outlawed, just as they were not outlawed before the court decided Roe in 1973. Unfortunately, Roe destroyed many social institutions, such as the social pressures for shotgun marriages, and they are unlikely to return. Nor will premarital sex likely be as rare as it was before Roe. Liberalized abortion undoubtedly has made life easier for many, but like sex itself sometimes, it has had many unintended consequences.

"454",454,"Louisiana Democrat Explains Why She’s Defending A Pro-Life Law Before The Supreme Court","Shepherd","Josh",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-12-18"," While many Americans focus on upcoming holiday celebrations, some pro-life advocates have been watching developments on a Supreme Court case — and the counternarrative female legislator behind the law being challenged at the high court. In June Medical Services v. Gee, the abortion industry contested a patient protection law that specifies health and safety regulations for medical providers. In June 2014, the Louisiana state legislature passed the law, Act 620, putting abortion doctors under the same regulations as all other outpatient doctors by requiring that any “physician performing or inducing an abortion shall have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than thirty miles from the location at which the abortion is performed or induced.”  Abortion providers challenged the law, and while their case remained unsettled in the district court, the Supreme Court ruled on Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, striking down a “nearly identical” Texas law for causing an “undue burden” on women’s abortion rights while serving no “health-related benefit” nor “relevant credentialing function.” This led to the district court concluding the same about Act 620. A panel of judges from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, determined that the district court failed to see “remarkabl[e] differen[ces]” between the two cases, saying Act 620 would not inflict an undue burden on women. Act 620 was authored by state Rep. Katrina Jackson, who is now state senator-elect, after she ran unchallenged for a seat representing District 34 in northeast Louisiana. In early 2020, Jackson will be speaking out not only in the state house but perhaps also at the highest court in the nation. “Oral arguments have been set for March 4,” said Jackson in a phone interview. “I am now in the process of getting barred to go before the Supreme Court and argue this case with the Louisiana Attorney General’s Office.”  A longtime Democratic elected official who nevertheless shuns her party’s pro-abortion stance, Jackson will be a featured speaker at the 47th annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., in January, as well as a charity event to benefit pro-life nonprofit Save the Storks alongside Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former press secretary to President Donald Trump. In a wide-ranging interview from her office in Louisiana, Jackson shares why she believes the court case matters, addresses her critics, and reveals how faith undergirds her pro-life advocacy. It has been lightly edited for length. The Coming Court Battle In January, you will address the March for Life on the main stage — which is a rarity two years in a row. What do you plan to share with the hundreds of thousands of pro-life advocates expected to gather on the National Mall? Jackson: You know, it’s a short address, and having it two years in a row is just God shining his favor on me. What I expect to say is that we continue to fight. Regardless of who we are, where we come from, or our background, we will stand for life together.  One reason for the attention is that the law you authored in Louisiana, regarding admitting privileges for abortion providers, is now at the U.S. Supreme Court. Could you share about that case and why it matters to pro-life advocates? Jackson: That law is a women’s health piece of legislation. In Louisiana, for a number of years, we have ensured by law that anyone who goes to an outpatient facility for any kind of surgery, that the doctor must have admitting privileges. That applies to all physicians, even if you go to such a facility only to have a mole removed. It came to our attention that, because the abortion laws are in a different section of our statutes, that those procedures were not covered. Why it may be important to pro-life advocates is because of what our 2014 bill said, that this is a women’s health issue. Louisiana requires a certain standard of care for outpatient surgery, and we will not lower it for those electing to have abortion. I don’t consider an abortion a minor procedure, to be clear. In the context of this case, people have revisited the Supreme Court case on the Texas law that was struck down. Louisiana is uniquely situated in that, for a number of years, we’ve had this law on the books. When originally enacted, legislators believed it applied to everyone. It’s just now being applied to abortion providers because of our legislative fix in 2014. Faith, Life, and the Christmas Message Where did this value for vulnerable lives originate in your life? Jackson: I have been in church all my life, since I was born. Then I went to law school after moving away from my family, and was in a church away from home that was teaching wonderful Bible studies. We came to the scripture in Proverbs chapter six that says, God hates the shedding of innocent blood. It began to relate to abortion — what blood is more innocent than that of a child? When you’re in the womb, you have not yet been born into a sinful world. That was when it became clear to me: I’m going to hate what God hates. Children in the womb have never had a chance to know sin. Not that I’m perfect in any way; I am striving, just like everyone else, to do the will of God. But if I’m going to truly profess to know the Lord Jesus Christ, then I’m going to hate what he hates and love what he loves. I had to have been 24 years old or so. Before then, I had never really heard that scripture relate to abortion or even decided where I stood. Coming into my legal career, this formed my opinion and basis of belief much stronger on what abortion meant: the shedding of innocent blood. Today, the media seems to use issues of life and abortion as a political football. As we approach Christmas, what message do you see in the gospel story about the value of every life? Jackson: Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph. Her miraculous conception could’ve been looked at negatively, number one, by him. It was looked at negatively by other observers. If we stress this idea of life not being valuable in the womb, then Jesus’s life wouldn’t have been valuable — because he wasn’t born under the ideal circumstances. Look at the circumstances of Jesus’ birth and all the reasons why advocates for abortion talk about abortion being a right: the economic situation of a family not having much money, being unwed with a child, and not having anywhere to stay. Those are all arguments that are used by those who advocate for abortion. The Christian message would say: We would have lost the redeemer of this whole world had we gone with the proponents of abortion and why they think it is necessary. They could have very well argued for the death and aborting of Jesus Christ. On Enduring Criticism from Every Side Some people will be puzzled or offended about the “D” behind your name, due to the power that Planned Parenthood and other pro-abortion interests have in the Democratic Party. How do you respond to such critics? Jackson: I’m a Christian first — and I love my party. When they’re right, I stand with them, and when I believe they’re not, I cannot stand with them. No party is perfect. There are things the Republican Party believes in that I adamantly do not stand for. From day one of running in my district, I was very clear that — although I’m not perfect — my goal in this office was to do the will of God. This is one of those issues where I’m standing with God. We are not elected to be cookie-cutter politicians; we are elected to represent the people who send us to our state houses and Congress. My concern is not who I offend based on their overall national view of a party or a candidate. My concern is always, number one, that I not offend God, and number two, that I not offend those who elected me to be their voice. This fall, you campaigned for your friend, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D). Why do you believe he won? Jackson: John Bel Edwards is 100 percent a “whole life” pro-life advocate such as myself. I believe he won because he has, in the past four years, advocated for people even outside of the pro-life arena. He has stood on his beliefs regardless of fierce criticism from the left and right. He won because he really tries to understand every group of citizenry and respond to the concerns of the people of Louisiana. African Americans turned out in large numbers for Edwards. He has a wonderful ability to hear the voice of all constituencies and address issues like criminal justice reform. Reuniting people with their families after they have been incarcerated and giving teeth to laws that prevent wrongful convictions, he sees that as part of his pro-life stance. He won because he was right for Louisiana, and that includes being pro-life. The fact that he stood for what is right is a major factor in him winning. Republicans and people from other parties crossed over to vote for Edwards — possibly for his views on economic issues, but certainly because they shared his views on life and faith in Louisiana.

"455",455,"Left Amps Up Pressure On John Roberts To Weaken His Jurisprudence","Blake","Nathanael",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-10-14"," As a new term begins for the Supreme Court, the pressure campaign against Chief Justice John Roberts is picking up. For example, The New York Times ran an op-ed that labeled Roberts the “extreme, right-wing leader of an extreme, right-wing majority.” If only. This overwrought assessment comes from Take Back the Court, a leftist group created to promote packing the Supreme Court. Its perspective is exemplified by its advisory board chairman, Mark Tushnet, the Harvard Law professor who called for treating conservative Christians like defeated Nazis. Roberts is not the extremist here.  Fortunately, the court is unlikely to be packed, even if the Democrats win the next election. However, the threats and insults the left is aiming at the court are meant to intimidate the chief justice, and they may succeed even if their more grandiose schemes for court-packing come to nothing. To the Left, ‘Legitimacy’ Means Doing What They Want Roberts cares about judicial restraint and the perceived legitimacy of the court, and the left views these concerns as weapons they can use against him. Thus, they will declare any Supreme Court opinion they dislike to be illegitimate, regardless of whether it is right as a matter of law. And if they believe this smear campaign pressures Roberts to change his votes (and they have reason to hope, given Roberts’ apparent switch to save Obamacare and reported recent switch to prevent the census citizenship question), they will double down on the attacks. This unprincipled approach to the law is illustrated by their hypocrisy over the judicial treatment of precedent. The New York Times article makes much of Roberts’ votes to overturn precedents, but the left respects precedent the way the Brezhnev Doctrine respected territory: What we have, we hold; what we want, we take. Thus, even as leftists condemn Roberts for overturning precedents they like, they are drawing up lists of other precedents to overturn as soon as they seize control of the court. After all, the left’s legal standard is the will to power. Rather than accepting the rule of law, they believe the courts are another political battleground. Thus, abandoning sound constitutional and legal reasoning because of their threats will only encourage more threats requiring more appeasement. The lesson Roberts should learn is that the legitimacy of the Supreme Court will best be vindicated by its ruling in accord with the law and the Constitution, as understood when enacted. Adhering to the law as written is the guarantee of the court’s legitimacy.  This originalist approach does not ensure easy analysis, and sometimes the law requires policy outcomes judges dislike. But the alternative is to elevate private judgment above the laws enacted by the people and their elected representatives. That is what the left is trying to protect; all their talk about legitimacy, stability, and precedent is an attempt to preserve their previous judicial power grabs. Left Used the Supreme Court to Unlawfully Allow Abortion Although many of these power grabs have occurred, the left’s supposed concern for precedent and judicial extremism is most of all about abortion. The latest broadsides are a reaction to the court’s considering the constitutionality of Louisiana’s abortion regulations. This case should be an easy call, as nothing in the text or history of the Constitution suggests that it protects a right to abortion, let alone prohibits states from regulating abortion facilities to ensure they meet health and safety standards. The left believes, however, that unborn humans have no rights that adults are bound to respect, and it has imposed this view on the nation by judicial fiat. By capturing the court, the left was able to enact a radical pro-abortion regime in the Unites States, one that it could never have achieved through democratic means. This is why the left insists that respect for precedent requires conservative justices to sanction the left’s judicial coup. For instance, another New York Times article declares Louisiana’s law “flagrantly unconstitutional” without any discussion of the text or history of the Constitution — it only mentions precedents. Yet Supreme Court justices do not take an oath to precedent but to the Constitution. They are therefore bound to overturn bad precedents.  The invention of a constitutional right to abortion made the Supreme Court the arbiter of every democratically enacted restriction or regulation on abortion. In seeking to overturn Roe v. Wade, abortion opponents are asking only that abortion be subject to the ordinary democratic deliberations of the people and their representatives. In the current case, the state of Louisiana is not even asking that much; it is merely seeking to regulate abortion facilities, not prohibit abortion. The Constitution Trumps Precedent Every Time The court’s usurpation of abortion policy has distorted law and politics for decades. Abortion opponents have spent years patiently working through the political process to confirm Supreme Court justices who will follow the Constitution and return abortion policy to the democratic process. Betraying the Constitution and pro-lifers again will do far more damage to the legitimacy of the court and our political system than a minority of radical, pro-abortion leftists could do. That radical minority is dominant among law school faculty, national media, and the Democratic Party. But most Americans are not as pro-abortion as the regime that has been imposed on them, which is why abortion advocates are desperate to keep abortion policymaking undemocratic. Many voters are unclear regarding the details of Roe, Doe, Casey and other Supreme Court rulings on abortion, but they favor more restrictions than these precedents allow. For the Supreme Court to continue to violate the Constitution by striking down these democratically enacted laws would destroy its credibility. The political fallout would be unpredictable but assuredly destabilizing. The Republican Party would collapse if abortion opponents gave up on it, and an emboldened Democratic majority might go ahead and pack the court despite Roberts’ capitulation. This would lead to further radicalization and escalation, ending with no one respecting the court. Hopefully this will not come to pass. But the surest way to protect the legitimacy of the court is for the justices to faithfully uphold the Constitution, rather than caving to pressure campaigns.

"456",456,"Stop Telling Post-Abortive Women We Need To Shut Up About Our Pain","Bonopartis","Theresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-01-05"," A recent so-called study making the rounds says abortion has little effect on women’s mental health. “Women’s Mental Health and Well-being 5 Years After Receiving or Being Denied an Abortion A Prospective, Longitudinal Cohort Study” was published last month by JAMA Psychiatry. It’s referred to as the Turnaway Study, and was run by the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program at the University of California, San Francisco. The people who did the study have affiliations such as Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, and with the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. Need I say more? Unbiased and without an agenda this study is not.  The pro-abortion crowd denies any negative effects of abortions and works diligently to remove abortion stigma in an attempt to make abortion an acceptable “normal” act of life. This is their dream study to prove that abortion really is no big deal. The pro-life side likes to have testimony about how deeply damaged those who have abortions are. Too often pro-lifers don’t follow up by discussing the hope for healing after an abortion. It is important to many of them to make healing seem impossible after abortions, because they want to make abortion unthinkable for any woman to even consider. This Is for All the Post-Abortive Women Out There My purpose is not to debate the legality of abortion, or even its impact on all women.  If you are a woman fine with participating in the death of your child and wearing it proudly and loudly on your sleeve, so be it, but that is not the case for millions of us. Even the abortion industry-affiliated Guttmacher Institute has stated that at least 10 percent of women who have had an abortion have adverse effects. That is millions of women, many who are suffering in silence. We deserve to be heard, and we have a voice, a voice that often is ignored and marginalized. At one time we may not have been able to speak for ourselves because of our wounds, and because society denied our pain. Even today our voices are often drowned out, but we will continue to speak the truth from our experience so we can reach out to those still suffering in silence. These are people I am speaking to in this article.  I can only imagine the emotions that overcame you if you saw this article on the web or the news. I am sure it triggered a host of emotions, not least a feeling of craziness at the denial once again, of your experience with abortion. The message is clear: you are not allowed to feel negative consequences, because according to them there are none. Your feeling must be wrong or come from a different place. This article was particularly crazy, actually telling us that being denied an abortion was more damaging than having one. For sure, these people have never experienced the post-abortion grief, shame, and guilt so many of us have lived with for days, months, years, and even decades. You are not crazy, nor are you alone. There are tons of us out here who have felt the same way you do. We have suffered from depression, anxiety, and paralyzing fear, especially the fear of being found out. Like many of you, we have chosen poor behaviors that damaged us further because of our lack of self-esteem, guilt, and shame, which came not from religion or society, but from participating in the death of our very own children. We get it, and we are speaking out and reaching out to you to let you know that your feelings are real and normal, and that healing is possible. We know, we have been there!  Face the Truth, and You Can Find Forgiveness Many of us have sought counseling only to be told, as this study does, that our feelings are not from our abortions. Sadly, we trusted their professionalism and as a result of this lie continued on a road of self-destruction because no one addressed our pain and legitimized our experience. But this is ending, as more and more of us are reaching out to the millions of women who are hurting. It is time for us to be there for each other and to speak for ourselves. No one knows better than we do the suffering of abortion, and we refuse to listen to studies such as these because we know the truth of what we experienced. We also know that you can heal, not from denying abortion’s impact, or removing its stigma, but from looking at and facing the truth and working through the dynamics of healing. So don’t listen to the thunderous praise of this “study,” the purpose of which is to not only keep abortion legal but to expand its reach. Don’t listen to those who say there is no healing from abortion, and make you feel as though you will be damaged for life. Will you forget? No. But do you really want to forget your child? Instead, you will be able to look at it in a different way, a way of newfound peace. Seek help from those who have been there and have walked the journey of healing. They may try to drown us out, but we keep coming up for air.  And we are more than happy to light the way out of the darkness for you!

"458",458,"Mike Lee’s Speech On The March For Life","Lee","Mike",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-01-19"," Republican Sen. Mike Lee gave the following speech on the Senate floor Friday regarding the 45th annual March for Life. Mr. President, today hundreds of thousands of Americans from all walks of life will participate in the 45th annual March for Life.  Why do these citizens march, year after year? It certainly isn’t for their health … Or for the media coverage. No, these Americans march on behalf of those who cannot. They march for uniquely vulnerable members of the human family. For the unborn. For those threatened by abortion. And for the countless innocent lives already lost.  These Americans march to protest the legal regime that sustains abortion. The cornerstone of that crumbling edifice is Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that invented a so-called “right” to abortion in the Constitution, and in so doing stripped the unborn of their right to life. The principal effect of Roe on our culture has been to cheapen the value of humanity itself. Roe has insinuated into the law a poisonous notion, the notion that some human beings may be treated as things. As objects to be discarded when they are inconvenient. We’ve seen this before in human history.  But an unintended effect of Roe has been to kick-start a movement that has lasted for four-and-a-half decades. Roe did not resolve the abortion debate — although it tried to. Rather it intensified the debate. The nation’s conscience was not deadened by Roe’s euphemisms and evasions; rather it was brought to life. Like a firebell in the night, Roe awakened a generation of Americans to the injustice of abortion. Countless thousands of them are marching in Washington, Salt Lake City, and cities across the country today. But the institution of abortion still has its defenders. Vociferous defenders, even. Why does this issue arouse such anger and passion? I argue it is because the pro-life and pro-abortion rights movements offer competing moral visions for our society. Indeed, competing arguments about human dignity and what it means to be human in the first place. Both moral visions are as old as the nation. They have appeared in various guises all throughout our history. But there is a consistent trend in how the clash of visions has played out in every era. The vision advanced by the pro-life movement has inspired righteous protests. The other vision has been used to rationalize hideous injustices. The pro-life vision embraces our country’s noblest truth. The pro-abortion vision twists it. Let me explain what I mean. Our Declaration of Independence contains one of the most succinct and revolutionary statements in human history. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that ALL men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are LIFE, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” We know that the United States has not always acted on this high principle. We have denied life, liberty, and opportunity to our fellow man in countless cruel and unfortunate ways. But even in the darkest times, patriots and reformers have looked to this passage as a guiding light, because it is the conscience of our nation. Abraham Lincoln referred to the Declaration constantly in his speeches, calling it the “sheet anchor of American republicanism” and the “Father of all moral principle.” He called the Declaration’s statement on human equality the “electric cord” that links patriotic Americans through the ages. Now that electric cord has reached us. It is a direct line that runs from the Founding Generation to the very heart of the pro-life movement. The core conviction of the pro-life movement is that “all men are created equal.” That all have a right to life. We believe that every human being has dignity and merits protection simply by virtue of being human. You will often hear pro-lifers emphasize the human features of unborn children, as well we should. We point out that the human heart begins to beat as early as 16 days after conception. We point out that the unborn child can yawn, react to pain, and suck her thumb. And we point out that that thumb even has a one-of-a-kind fingerprint. But we do not mention these characteristics because they are what give unborn children worth. It is not our fingerprints or even our beating hearts that make us people. Rather, we point to these characteristics because they point in turn to something more fundamental. They point to the inescapable fact that the unborn child is a human being, just like us. A member of our messy family. It is that endowment, that shared humanity, that gives us all moral worth. And so, to summarize the pro-life position, we have only to repeat those five words in the Declaration: “All men are created equal.” All are entitled to life. But to be sure, not everyone shares the belief that all men are created equal. At various times this belief has been called an “error of the past generation.” It has even been called a “self-evident lie!” Few today would denounce the Declaration of Independence in such terms. But defenders of abortion still repudiate the Declaration by their actions, and by the arguments they advance to protect legal abortion. Defenders of abortion no longer dispute that unborn children are living human beings. How could they? Science testifies unequivocally to our shared humanity. Most sophisticated defenders of abortion do not even dispute that abortion is a violent act. If you do not believe me on this point, perhaps you will believe Ronald Dworkin, a prominent apologist for the pro-choice position: “Abortion,” Dworkin writes, “[is] deliberately killing a developing human embryo.” He goes on to describe abortion as a “choice for death.” So if abortion defenders do not deny the humanity of the fetus, and if they do not deny that abortion kills the fetus, how then do they defend abortion? In short, they do it by segregating the human family into two classes: Human beings who are worthy of life — sometimes referred to as “human persons”– and human beings who are unworthy of life — “human non-persons.” According to this view, human beings do not deserve protection on the basis of their humanity alone. Rather they gain the right to life when they attain certain characteristics — usually some level of cognitive ability or bodily development. Since the unborn lack these magic personhood qualities, they lack the right to life and may be dismembered in the womb. They are “human non-persons.” Or so the argument goes. There are many problems with this chilling view. It has been rebutted at length by smarter men and women than me. But for the purposes of today, it is enough to point out the track record of this argument. Because it just so happens that every time mankind has been artificially divided into classes — into “persons” and “non-persons” based on their race, sex, genetic fitness, or any other attribute — the result has been calamity. Which leads to a very simple question that has never been satisfactorily answered by abortion’s defenders: Why should we believe that this time is any different? Abortion is a difficult subject matter for so many reasons, but on another level it is quite simple. Our society has to choose between the two visions of human dignity described above. Put simply, do we believe that all men are created equal? Or that some are more equal than others? This simple question deserves a simple response: We must choose the first of those options, and affirm that all human beings are created with dignity. And we must reject all attempts to separate the human family into higher and lower classes. Let us see these attempts for what they are: Cruel fictions that cheapen life itself. Just as there is no such thing as “life unworthy of life,” there is no such thing as a “human non-person.” There are just people. And we are each fearfully and wonderfully made. Yes, dignity was ours before we stirred in the womb. It is stamped onto the very fabric of our genome. It is printed onto our soul. This is the truth so brilliantly proclaimed in our nation’s Founding Documents — even as it is denied by our legal system, starting with Roe v. Wade. But even though the laws of man are against us (for now!), the truth is with us. And the truth can erode even the most formidable edifice of lies. And so, on this forty-fifth anniversary of Roe v. Wade, let us respond to Roe as Frederick Douglass responded to a similar indignity, Dred Scott v. Sandford. “Happily for the whole human family,” Douglass thundered, “their rights have been defined, declared, and decided in a court higher than the Supreme Court.” Those words are as true today as they were when they were spoken. They call us to continue the winding march for justice — and for life –until the unalienable rights of every human being are respected in our land. Thank you.

"459",459,"Since Dobbs, Pro-Life Laws Have Already Saved 10,000 Unborn Lives And Counting","Donovan","Charles","A.","Longbons, Tessa",NA,NA,"2022-11-22"," Do pro-life laws, whether state or federal, actually save lives?



According to a new study from the pro-abortion WeCount coalition, the answer is “yes,” with the number of abortions nationwide falling by 10,000 in the first two months after the Dobbs decision.



Ten thousand lives saved is cause for celebration, although you might not guess that from the media’s reaction. But the effect of Dobbs won’t stop there. As is often the case, the answer goes beyond the headlines.



While the WeCount data can’t be independently verified, it’s surprising to see the abortion industry finally acknowledge, however grudgingly, that pro-life state laws save lives. The abortion industry often seeks to obscure, deny, or ignore research that challenges its position.



As reported in The New York Times, WeCount estimates that 22,000 fewer induced abortions were performed in states with pro-life laws in July and August, compared with the baseline beginning in April, before the Dobbs decision. In states where abortion-on-demand remained legal, abortions increased by roughly 12,000, leading to a net decline of 10,000.



Taking a deeper dive into the report, the number of lives saved has the potential to grow significantly in the months and years ahead. There were just under 7,400 fewer abortions in August than in June. If you extrapolate that figure over 12 months, you get a drop of nearly 90,000 abortions per year.



That’s not all. Economist Phillip Levine has argued that, by changing people’s sexual behavior, pro-life laws lead to fewer unexpected pregnancies. We agree. Many of the babies that were aborted in July and August would have been conceived pre-Dobbs. The total number of induced abortions is likely to decrease further as people make changes to their behavior based on post-Dobbs state pro-life laws and changing mores.



By some estimates, state and federal pro-life laws have already helped save millions of lives over the years, including limitations on federal and state taxpayer funding of abortion, state prohibitions on discriminatory abortions, and the more recent effect of heartbeat laws in states like Texas. This new data shows Dobbs will only accelerate this encouraging trend as mothers and fathers consider other options that affirm the dignity and worth of every human life.



While obviously not intended by WeCount’s pro-abortion authors, their new study also shows how pro-life state laws are offering a new level of protection for women who have been preyed upon by the profit-driven abortion industry for 50 years.



The reality that abortion advocates choose to ignore or conceal is that abortion harms women. We know from analyzing 17 years of Medicaid claims data that women whose first pregnancy ends in abortion average 35 percent more pregnancies, 50 percent more miscarriages, and four times as many abortions as women whose first pregnancy results in a live birth. Peer-reviewed research from countries with much better public health data, such as Finland and Denmark, clearly shows that multiple abortions increase the risk of extremely premature birth in subsequent pregnancies and that a woman’s risk of premature death increases with each successive abortion.



This sort of data is readily available to public health researchers in other countries but is virtually unknown in the United States. Why? Incredibly, several states, including California and Maryland, report no official abortion data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and many others report abortion data only inconsistently. The WeCount study was based on data that abortion advocates collected directly from abortion facilities, bypassing the CDC, peer-reviewed journals, and other forms of data verification.



Given the stakes, you have to wonder what the abortion industry is hiding. Perhaps abortion advocates fear that their tired rhetoric about “women’s reproductive health” will be exposed for the canard that it is. Worse, this kind of concealment makes it difficult for public health officials and policymakers to develop a complete picture of the risks that women face from abortion. That’s bad for America — and especially bad for women.



Even so, the results from the WeCount project, while lacking in accountability and objectivity, are promising. Even pro-abortion researchers are confirming that pro-life laws save lives — lots of lives – forecasting a more hopeful and healthy future for both women and their babies.

"460",460,"Missouri Democrats Quickly Reverse Decision To Tolerate Pro-Lifers In The Party","Wolfe","Liz",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-08-17"," The Democratic Party of Missouri amended their official platform in June to soften its stance on abortion, in order to become more inclusive to pro-life Democrats. Unfortunately, the party walked this commitment back on August 11, voting unanimously to remove the pro-life-inclusive language that had only been present in the platform for a few weeks. The June amendment’s language was fairly routine: “We respect the conscience of each Missourian and recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing positions on issues of personal conscience, such as abortion.” The Democrats then went on to laud differing views on abortion as a source of strength for the party.  So why the sudden about-face? Was welcoming people of conscience merely a value-add for eight weeks, but no longer? Perhaps the June decision, although good on principle, was bad for voter appeal. As one might expect, the announcement of the amendment’s revocation was shrouded in sanitized “reproductive rights” buzzwords. Per the Kansas City Star, alderwoman Annie Rice claimed, “Abortion is a legal healthcare procedure, and as a party we must support access.” The executive director of pro-choice group NARAL Missouri, Alison Dreith, told the Kansas City Star the “right to access abortion care is in more danger now than ever” and that the party’s platform change “has put the party back on track just in time to pick up wins in November. This vote goes to show that when women organize, women win.” But does excluding people of faith and conscience really help women win? More than that, does bolstering abortion access really help women win? Perhaps it just erodes our culture’s value of human life and belittles women by implying the only way they can get ahead is if they reflexively reject motherhood.  Dreith’s comments hit the nail squarely on the head. It was only briefly about principle, and now the party has shifted toward appealing to voters instead of recognizing the complexity of the ethical dilemma surrounding abortion. After all, attempting to resolve crucial life-or-death ethical dilemmas with Democrats of faith pales in importance to getting votes, right? A 2014 Gallup poll found around 28 percent of Democrats call themselves pro-life. A 2011 Gallup poll found nearly 48 percent of Democrats who attend church on a weekly basis self-identify as pro-life (out of a sample size of 385). Pew found in 2017 that approximately 75 percent of Democrats believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. But numbers on legality don’t tell the full story. There are plenty of people out there who believe that repealing Roe v. Wade or Planned Parenthood v. Casey could create negative consequences for women, especially those who might seek illegal abortions. But lack of viable alternative to the current legal framework does not mean that they believe abortion is ethically or morally correct. More polling must be done on those people — the ones who feel a visceral disgust with the way we talk about aborting the innocent, but fear a world in which criminalization wreaks havoc on maternal health. Too often, people on the pro-choice side act like there’s some sort of broad consensus in support of so-called abortion rights. They trot out a Quinnipac poll which claims 63 percent of respondents agree with Roe v. Wade. But, as colleagues here at The Federalist have pointed out, this oft-cited figure doesn’t truly indicate that there’s currently a strong pro-choice majority.  For starters, many respondents don’t really know much about the Roe decision, except that it deals with the legality of abortion. If they did know anything about it, they would realize that Roe isn’t really the relevant case nowadays. Instead, most legal quibbles are really over Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which created a new undue burden standard for judging abortion access and the constitutionality of various restrictions that seek to put an obstacle in the way of a woman seeking an abortion. Many people, when asked about the legality of abortion, broadly support maintaining the status quo. That doesn’t mean they’re ethically in support of abortion, so much as that they haven’t seen good alternatives to the current legal framework offered. They’ve been understandably scared by coat hanger and back alley abortion imagery and offer their support for Roe because they can’t visualize what a pre- or post-Roe world really looks like. Not to mention, when it comes to abortion, we too often argue about the fringes without realizing that a significant chunk of the populace are willing to compromise to some degree on abortion. About 70 percent of pro-lifers are okay with allowing abortion in situations where it might save the mother’s life, and nearly 80 percent of pro-choicers are okay with outlawing third trimester abortions. This doesn’t mean we’re all the same or that we should water down our ideologies to appease the other side. It does mean we should recognize that the other side is not the monolithic, fully ideologically consistent group that we make them out to be. If this were the case, what would explain the fact that so many pro-choicers still feel a discomfort with ableist abortions, or people specifically choosing to abort children who have Down syndrome? It fundamentally doesn’t square with their broad support of anti-ableist rhetoric to then turn around and claim that children with disabilities are quite literally unworthy of living. They have yet to resolve that inconsistency within their ranks. One thing that might help is introducing more Democrats of conscience into their parties, so they can sort out these complex dilemmas with their ideological kin, instead of just spouting disingenuous talking points spoon-fed to them by Planned Parenthood. But that would be too welcoming and intellectually honest for the Missouri Democratic Party and might, in fact, draw them closer to the middle. Instead, they’ve chosen to double down on their reproductive rights jargon, filled with hollow catchphrases such as, “When women organize, women win.” They miss the fact that pseudo-female empowerment doesn’t confront the actual issue. That is, whether it’s morally justifiable to take a human life, no questions asked, for a woman seeking to rid sex of consequences (if that sounds like an oxymoron, it’s because it is). This is the real question we’re grappling with, and people of faith have important insight on when human life begins and how much it’s worth protecting. Democrats would be wise to make their party more big tent on an issue as important as abortion.

"461",461,"‘Sanctuary Cities For The Unborn’ Gear Up To Fight ACLU Lawsuit","Boorman","Georgi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-03-18"," The American Civil Liberties Union recently filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Lilith Fund and Texas Equal Access Fund, claiming that new abortion bans instituted in seven small East Texas cities violated their citizens’ constitutional rights. Citizens of the seven tiny communities — Waskom, Naples, Joaquin, Tenaha, Rusk, Gary, and Wells — say they are ready to fight the ACLU in court and are confident their ordinances will be upheld. Asserting the right to abortion is “protected by the U.S. Constitution,” the ACLU says, “The ordinances’ existence misleads residents of these cities as to whether individuals can in fact exercise their right to access abortion.”  The ACLU also claims that calling the plaintiffs “criminal organizations” deprives them of their due process and “unconstitutionally punishes them through the legislative process, without a trial.” The Fight Over Whether Abortion Is a Constitutional Right The director of Right to Life East Texas, Mark Lee Dickson, said the people involved in passing and defending the ordinances are standing their ground. He shared with me some of the statements he’s gathered in his work on the abortion bans. Rusk City Councilman Martin Holsome had a positive outlook on the litigation. “If you’re not being sued by the ACLU, it’s because you’re already doing exactly what they want you to do — nothing.” Likewise, Joaquin Mayor Bill Baker said his city is “not going to be intimidated by the ACLU. … Our town, our people, are willing to stand and fight for the unborn.”  While pro-lifers across the country flatly reject the ACLU’s claim that abortion is a constitutional right, the scattershot lawsuit does make a claim that’s at least plausible on its face. The lawsuit alleges the language of the ordinance, which is virtually identical in each of the seven cities as well as five more not named in the suit, is “unconstitutionally vague.” “‘Operat[ing] within’ the cities is defined broadly,” it reads, and “includes, but is not limited to: ‘offering services of any type,’ ‘renting office space or purchasing real property,’ or ‘establishing a physical presence of any sort.’” The ACLU alleges the definition is broad enough to “suppress lawful speech about abortions and other reproductive healthcare” and restrict the right to freely associate within the cities on those issues. But Dickson says the case is “without merit.” He points to two billboards in Waskom put up by NARAL Pro-Choice Texas and the Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity in July of last year, after the ordinance was passed. “If NARAL Pro-Choice Texas and the Lilith Fund want to spend more money on billboards in those cities we welcome them to do so,” Right to Life East Texas said in a statement. “The more money they spend on billboards the less money they can spend on funding the murder of innocent unborn children.” I reached out to Lilith Fund, the Texas Equal Access Fund, and NARAL Pro-Choice Texas for comment on the lawsuit and the billboards, but they did not respond by publishing time.  The city of Waskom did not take any action against NARAL or the Lilith Fund for the billboards. It is Lilith Fund’s core mission that makes it a target of the ordinances. The fund, which shares its namesake with an ancient baby-killing demon goddess of Jewish folklore, provides “direct financial assistance to individuals who want to end a pregnancy but cannot afford the full cost of an abortion procedure,” as stated in the lawsuit. This service, if performed in a city where abortion is outlawed, would make the fund a “criminal organization.” Will the Ordinances Hold Up in Court? The ACLU alleges the defendants are spreading falsehood and confusion about abortion and their plaintiffs. But Pastor Jody Hooper of First Baptist Church of Haslam in Joaquin disagrees, saying their town is speaking “truth into a culture that has fallen for lies,” and that “no matter the consequences,” they must stand for “those who cannot stand for themselves.” The city of Rusk signed a letter obtaining the services of former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan F. Mitchell, free of charge. Dickson told me Mitchell is also representing the other cities mentioned in the suit. Texas Right to Life says it is “confident” the pro-life ordinances will “hold up in court.” “[These] cities acted within their constitutional rights to self-governance and within the scope of current U.S. Supreme Court abortion jurisprudence,” it stated in a press release. Dickson says these ordinances do not violate the “undue burden” standard established in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, which says government regulations cannot put a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.” Defenders of the laws argue that since Texas permits city ordinances to prohibit things within their jurisdictions (such as alcohol), and the laws do not prevent residents from obtaining an abortion outside the city, they do not impose an undue burden on women. The ordinances “maintain the status quo,” since no abortion providers existed within the cities before the ordinances were passed. That argument is not a slam dunk, however. It can be argued that if enough municipalities pass these ordinances, taken together they would constitute an undue burden on a pregnant resident of East Texas. Travel times, wait times, and time taken off work (i.e., lost income) all factor into the “substantial obstacle” calculation. It Takes Faith to Fight Abortion The Supreme Court acknowledged all this in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, noting that increases in driving distance to abortion providers, while not always constituting an undue burden, can be “an additional burden, which, when taken together with others caused by the closings, and when viewed in light of the virtual absence of any health benefit, help support the District Court’s ‘undue burden’ conclusion.” The “undue burden” standard of Casey did not erase the abortion entitlement created two decades before in Roe v. Wade, but reinforced it. Forty-seven years’ worth of cards are stacked against the sanctuary cities for the unborn. Legal abortion is a giant, and the dozen-and-counting small Texas towns are, by mortal men’s standards, no match for it. Yet the audacity and determination of those standing firm for these sanctuary cities for the unborn reflects a strong faith and a distinctly Christian understanding of good and evil. In an interview Right to Life East Texas conducted with Dr. Ivy Shelton, pastor of First Baptist Church in Waskom, he encouraged citizens to remember 1 John 4:4: “Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.” Those who simply hope for an end to abortion would not have passed the ordinance in the first place. The men and women supporting the sanctuary laws have faith, and “faith grows stronger” through trials and tribulations, Shelton said. As Moses told the Israelites before God parted the Red Sea, “Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you today. … The Lord will fight for you, you need only be still.” In a sense, it seems the small, unflappable band of men and women behind these ordinances are expecting the sea to part before them as a much stronger army rushes up from behind. But they have put their faith not in courts or public opinion, but in a God who makes a way and has brought down mightier institutions than abortion in America. Perhaps the Lilith Fund, Texas Equal Access Fund, and the ACLU should not be so sure of their victory.

Its Missouri abortion facility is only one of many locations Planned Parenthood says are threatened by following exactly the same rules for similar surgical and health centers. If Planned Parenthood is really about providing women the health care they need, why can’t it manage to do so at the same level that other health providers meet? Rather than bring their standards up to match those of health facilities, Planned Parenthood facilities often close instead — that is, if they can’t get themselves out of having to follow the same rules everyone else does. This seems to indicate Planned Parenthood is not really the health champion women need, despite their advertising to the contrary. What Happened in Missouri When Missouri required abortion facilities to meet standard health requirements, Planned Parenthood affiliates filed a lawsuit. PP affiliates attempted to block state requirements that doctors who perform abortions must have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that clinics meet hospital-like standards for outpatient surgery. This is because abortion is an internal surgical procedure. So far, a federal appeals court is letting the regulations stand, much to Planned Parenthood’s frustration. If the requirements are enforced, the attorney for PP said one of their facilities in Columbia won’t be able to provide abortions because the doctor does not have admitting privileges with a local hospital. (Apparently he can’t get them, either, for some reason, which also makes one question his medical — no pun intended — chops.) This would leave one Planned Parenthood site as the only abortion provider in the state.  PP argues, of course, as they always have, that fewer abortion clinics are bad for women. “These requirements do nothing to help Missouri women — and, in fact, actually hurt them,” the local affiliate’s President Brandon Hill said in a statement. “If these laws are allowed to take effect, women will now have to travel farther, wait longer, and use more of their own resources to access the health care they need most — if they can get care at all.” If you follow this logic, it suggests that the health and safety standards now applied to non-Planned Parenthood medical providers also make women travel farther, wait longer, and pay more for the procedures offered. Then the logical solution would be to end these standards across the board, not merely exempt Planned Parenthood from them. Yet the major opposition to these standards is not all medical providers affected, but just the one that does abortions. That suggests the truth is that abortion is inherently dangerous and unsanitary. Or that people who go into the field are not top-shelf medical staff. And that despite its rhetoric, Planned Parenthood doesn’t care enough about women’s health to aspire to meet even basic standards for women’s safety. Abortion Facilities Regularly Violate Health Standards The abortion industry’s rather gruesome history of failing to offer women sanitary facilities reinforces this suspicion. For example, two years ago I reported on the health violations of an abortion facility called Virginia Health Group. The Virginia Health Department temporarily suspended their license after a two-day inspection revealed 26 deficiencies, listed in this detailed 52-page report.  “Inspectors observed, among other things: dirty equipment, unlocked and expired medication, inaccurate and absent medical records, unsterilized or improperly sterilized medical equipment, bloody gowns, and one of the physicians wearing dirty scrubs and working out of a dirty office.” If a mother wouldn’t be allowed to bring a child there to suture a split chin, or if an adult wouldn’t go there to get an antibiotic for a strep infection, why do abortion advocates feel okay sending women there for an abortion? Of course, many folks are now aware of the gruesome story of Kermit Gosnell, the abortionist convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three infants born alive during abortions and involuntary manslaughter in the death of a woman who wanted an abortion. When the staff from the Pennsylvania Department of State and Pennsylvania Department of Health attended the raid of Gosnell’s Women’s Medical Society, in 2010, they found the office in abhorrent conditions. Here are some descriptions from the Grand Jury report. ‘Filthy,’ ‘deplorable,’ ‘disgusting,’ ‘very unsanitary, very outdated, horrendous,’ and ‘by far, the worst’ that these experienced investigators had ever encountered. There was blood on the floor. A stench of urine filled the air. A flea-infested cat was wandering through the facility, and there were cat feces on the stairs. Semi-conscious women scheduled for abortions were moaning in the waiting room or the recovery room, where they sat on dirty recliners covered with blood-stained blankets. All the women had been sedated by unlicensed staff – long before Gosnell arrived at the clinic – and staff members could not accurately state what medications or dosages they had administered to the waiting patients. Many of the medications in inventory were past their expiration dates… surgical procedure rooms were filthy and unsanitary… resembling ‘a bad gas station restroom.’ Instruments were not sterile. Equipment was rusty and outdated. Oxygen equipment was covered with dust, and had not been inspected. The same corroded suction tubing used for abortions was the only tubing available for oral airways if assistance for breathing was needed. Clearly sanitation is not a priority for many in the abortion industry. But, again, if Planned Parenthood really cared about women’s health, they would support regulations aimed to ensure a basic level of safety for women at health centers. Both of those stories came out before the Supreme Court released their landmark decision on abortion facility regulations. The decision essentially let abortion facilities off the hook in terms of medical standards. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 struck down similar rules Missouri has that were in place for abortion clinics in Texas, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. In this case, the court ruled 5–3 that Texas cannot place restrictions abortion services if it creates an “undue burden” for women wanting an abortion. The vote was closer, however, and shows why issues like the one in Missouri are still ongoing. The fact that PP is fighting Missouri’s regulations so hard suggests they really don’t care about women’s health, they care about abortions. For an organization boasting a medical doctor as their new president and women’s health as one of their priorities, this certainly seems hypocritical at best. Let’s hope, for the sake of women in Missouri, that the only care PP and other abortion affiliates may offer is health care comparable to what women would get everywhere else.

"463",463,"How Trump’s Conservative UN Social Policies Strengthen Foreign Relations","Garrison","Shea",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-02-15"," According to recent news reports, the Trump administration has instructed U.S. delegates to the United Nations to replace the term “sexual reproductive health” with those like “reproduction and the related health services” and the word “gender” with “woman” in documents and negotiations. These reports (and a resulting letter from members of Congress) stem from “leaked” State Department memos and warn that striking these terms will damage U.S.-foreign relations, hinder access to health care, oppress women’s rights, and “define transgender people out of existence.” These reports are at best misinformed about U.S. development aid and foreign relations and at worst sounding yet another false alarm to continue Obama’s legacy of “progressive” social ideology in U.S. foreign policy. President Obama’s administration took a hardline approach in promoting legalized abortion, LGBT ideology, and fluid and multiple “gender identities” around the world through the UN, State Department, and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Yet promoting western social values has very little to do with improving U.S.-foreign relations or reaching development goals.  Instead, this is the newest form of colonialism imposed upon vulnerable countries under the guise of foreign aid. It disrespects national sovereignty and individual freedoms of religion and belief. The result: to erode public goodwill toward the United States and endanger U.S. relations with the majority of socially conservative and religious countries of Africa, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East—as well as populations in Latin America and Eastern and Southern Europe. Several U.S. nongovernmental organizations working closely with member states at the UN report that foreign delegates often feel coerced to accept western social values during negotiations in order to receive funds. Pope Francis’s 2015 address to the UN General Assembly reminds states that even well-intentioned foreign aid risks becoming “cover for all kinds of abuse and corruption, or for carrying out an ideological colonization by the imposition of anomalous models and lifestyles which are alien to people’s identity and, in the end, irresponsible.” Abortion Is Not Women’s Top Health Need The term “sexual and reproductive health” has been used at the UN to refer to the inclusion of abortion services since negotiations in the Cairo 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). In the conference’s resulting Programme of Action, these and similar terms are clearly defined to include abortion (13.14 and 7.6). However, contrary to assertions of abortion advocates, legalized abortion is not an international right but under the sovereignty of UN member states. The Programme of Action says any changes related to abortion are determined “at the national or local level according to the national legislative process” (8.25) and even adds that “governments should take the appropriate steps to help women avoid abortion, which in no case should be promoted as a method of family planning.” (8.25 and 7.24)  If U.S. delegates push “sexual reproductive health,” it ultimately undermines the national sovereignty of member states and the U.S. position on funding abortion overseas—i.e. the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and President Trump’s executive action reinstating and extending the Mexico City Policy through Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance. Meanwhile, western-based organizations spend billions to push “comprehensive” reproductive services (emphasis “abortion”) on the premise that these promote women’s rights, health, education, and economic prosperity. In developing countries, these organizations widely promote legalized abortion as an integral part of maternal health and decreasing maternal mortality. But according to the UN and World Health Organization, of the 289,000 women who died in pregnancy or child birth in 2013, only 8 percent died from unsafe abortion. The other 92 percent died from direct and indirect causes like hemorrhaging (leading cause), sepsis, hypertensive disorder, HIV, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. Why, then, is abortion promoted in a much greater capacity than services that could actually combat the majority of deaths—like skilled birth attendants, antibiotics, blood banking, and uterotonics? The bottom line is that “vast resources” of global organizations fail to focus on the real causes of maternal mortality—causes the West has effectively treated for almost 100 years. The tragedy, according to two Africa-based maternal health doctors, is that “In the middle of the night, a woman bleeding to death from a post-partum hemorrhage cannot be saved by…a reproductive health mandate.”  Foreign Countries Resent U.S. Abortion-Pushing In addition, the concept of abortion isn’t accepted within the cultures of most countries. Pew Research Center shows that in 26 out of 40 countries surveyed, the majority of populations believe abortion is “morally unacceptable.” Most of these countries lie in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Muslim-majority countries of Asia and the Middle East. In Africa, all countries surveyed believe abortion is morally wrong by the vast majority of their populations. A voice for African women, Nigerian-born Obianuju Ekeocha, echoes Pope Francis’s statements, calling the push of abortion by western organizations “Ideological Neocolonialism.” At a UN panel she remarked: “At the core of my people’s value system is the profound recognition that human life is precious, paramount and supreme.” She explained that in traditional African languages, phrasing abortion in a good light is impossible and colonialization occurs when westerners introduce language and concepts that redefine African culture. She drove the point home: “to convince … any woman in Africa that abortion is … a good thing, you first of all have to tell her that what her parents and her grandparents and her ancestors taught her is actually wrong … and that…is colonialization.” Gender Identity and U.S. Foreign Policy In addition, clarifying the word “gender” to refocus “gender empowerment and equality” on women’s needs and inequalities is sorely needed in U.S. domestic law and foreign policy. For decades, these terms have referred to empowering women and decreasing the many historically and statistically documented inequalities between men and women. But since Obama’s administration, the term “gender” has more often been used to promote social acceptance of homosexuality and transgenderism domestically and internationally. If one doubts the extremity of Obama-era “gender” programming, one example of many is USAID’s Health Policy Plus (HP+) and its Gender and Sexual Diversity training module. It promotes the concept that an individual’s gender identity, defined as “one’s internal or inside experience of gender (or) how one wishes to define their own gender,” doesn’t always correspond with their biological sex (12.2.3). It also teaches “biological sex, gender expression, gender identity and sexual orientation all exist on separate continuums,” and is cautious to explain that “attempting to guess where someone is on one continuum based on where they exist on another is not only often wrong, it can be insulting” (12.2.5). Question: even if Americans agreed on this concept (and they do not), what does this have to do with U.S.-taxpayer funded foreign development and aid? Let’s Help Women by Ignoring Them Obama’s foreign policy actually turned funds allocated for “gender empowerment” away from supporting women and girls around the world. How terribly unfortunate, considering that initiatives to protect women and girls and advance their participation and rights are severely lacking in funding. Most countries don’t consider LGBT people a distinct class in need of special protections beyond those of other citizens. Consider that of the millions of victims of global human trafficking each year, 52 percent are women and 22 percent are girls under the age of 18 used for sexual exploitation and forced labor. Also consider that 40 percent of girls in the least developed countries are married before age 18, and 12 percent before age 15. These are only two critical areas where gender foreign aid should focus. Even with Obama’s foreign-policy push, LGBT activists failed to get “sexual orientation and gender identity” (SOGI) terms into any binding treaty at the UN. The terms are “mentioned in only a few non-binding resolutions … suggestions governments are free to ignore.” Neither does international law recognize SOGI terms, in large part due to non-consensus among UN member states on their use. Furthermore, most countries don’t consider LGBT people a distinct class in need of special protections beyond those of other citizens. The citizens of these countries don’t agree, either. Pew research shows that in most of 40 countries surveyed, half or more of their populations believe homosexuality is “morally unacceptable.” In seven countries, 90 percent or more of the population holds this view. Another survey found “widespread rejection in predominantly Muslim nations and in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and Russia” mainly in religious countries. Surely, based on these facts U.S. foreign policy and aid should be more sensitive to the traditional beliefs and cultures of other countries. Public Diplomacy and Foreign Policy In 2003, an independent task force was sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations to develop a strategy to respond to an alarming rise in anti-Americanism. The task force concluded that Washington faces challenges overseas that can’t just be won with military force, but with “willing” foreign partners created by “a strong and robust public policy—one able to win hearts and minds and show people that the United States can once again be trusted and admired.” And, to be effective, public diplomacy must help “explain how U.S. policies fit the values and interests of other nations.” The Trump administration’s instruction to strike references to “sexual reproductive health” and clearly define “gender” terms at the UN makes sense for U.S. foreign policy. It is one small step towards considering how U.S. policies fit the “values and interests of other nations,” respect national sovereignty, and focus on the real objectives of foreign aid and relations. This step will go a long way in improving U.S. public diplomacy and foreign relations around the world.

"464",464,"8 Truths That Destroy John Oliver’s Ignorant Rant Against Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers","Johnson","Abby",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-04-13"," Pregnancy Resource Centers (PRCs) are constantly in the crosshairs of the abortion industry. They are angry that PRCs take away clients who would otherwise use them for abortion. They lose lots of money to PRCs every year, and are vastly outnumbered. There are fewer than 800 abortion clinics in the United States, while PRCs number more than 3,000. That’s a big reason we’ve been seeing a major media smear campaign against PRCs. What kind of people target nonprofit organizations that offer free medical care and other resources to women facing the desperation of a crisis pregnancy? For one, HBO’s John Oliver. This week, he did a hit piece on PRCs that got things terribly wrong.     One of the producers of Oliver’s show “Last Week Tonight” called me to discuss their upcoming segment on PRCs. After all, they were using my photo and audio from a speech I did on PRCs a few years ago. I’m happy to talk to liberal media, and we often have good conversations. I was on their side not that long ago. Even in our conversation, however, it was obvious the show had based this particular segment on lies and misrepresentations. Exactly zero of what I told the producer made it into the piece. This is what I made sure he knew, but “Last Week Tonight” pretended it had never heard. 1. No Social Service Is Perfect In any business, there are facilities that excel at what they do and others that need improvement and further training. Many PRCs are excellent at helping women find the resources they need and the doctors to serve them. Others need a bit more training on those aspects. 2. Isolated Incidents Aren’t a Fair Basis for Broad Accusations It is incredibly unfair that the press zeros in on one PRC incident that makes them look bad and proceeds to paint all PRCs as replicas of that one place while declaring that every incident of an abortion facility skirting around the law, committing Medicaid fraud, covering up statutory rape, etc., is merely an “isolated incident.” This is hypocritical at best, malicious at worst.  3. Pregnancy Care Centers Have Higher Standards Than Planned Parenthood Does I worked at Planned Parenthood for eight years. I have helped more than 440 abortion industry workers, including seven abortion doctors, leave their jobs since 2012. Many of these have left Planned Parenthood. So I know well that Planned Parenthood does not use licensed professionals to perform medical procedures, such as ultrasounds or lab tests on patients. It is not even a recommendation in their policies and procedures. However, it is a recommendation from both Heartbeat and Carenet, the two biggest PRC networks in the country, that medical professionals be the ones performing these procedures in pregnancy centers. Women wanting to research health and safety violations of an abortion clinic they’re considering can see www.checkmyclinic.org. 4. These Two Kinds of Organization Are Not Comparable PRCs will never compete with the abortion industry and they have no reason to. More than half of Planned Parenthood’s revenue is tied to abortion, which PRCs will never provide. And the abortion industry will never provide what PRCs give to moms and babies: material assistance, professional counseling, true options counseling, grief counseling from past abortions, lactation support, parenting and childbirth classes, fertility care instruction, and so much more. PRCs help women and their children. The abortion industry gives women nothing except the elimination of their children.  5. Putting Our Best Foot Forward Is Basic Marketing, Not Deception Because of the negative media people like Oliver maliciously or ignorantly generate about PRCs, many women will never walk through the doors of a PRC, a place that is there to help them. That’s who PRCs need to reach. PRCs are not going to shy away from being pro-life and desiring to help moms and save their babies, and yes, aside from lying and manipulation, they are going to do whatever it takes to get that woman in the door, because the life of her child is depending on it. 6. It’s the Abortion Industry That’s Coercive The abortion industry states that pro-lifers are “coercive.” As a person who worked in the abortion industry for eight years, I can say unequivocally that the most manipulation I have ever witnessed was inside the walls of the abortion clinic. In fact, with 64 percent of women feeling forced or coerced into having abortions, you would think that Planned Parenthood would be taking every step possible to ensure that coercion, or even trafficking, isn’t taking place in their centers. On the contrary, it is Planned Parenthood that has opposed every single anti-trafficking bill pro-life legislators propose. Planned Parenthood also sponsored the Women’s March, which just tweeted that the closing of commerce site Backpage.com is a crisis for “sex workers.” Backpage is the worst facilitator of the sex trafficking of women and children in the modern age. It appears Planned Parenthood wants to protect abusers, not victims. 7. Real Assistance Is a Hand Up, Not a Hand Out The goal in the pregnancy center movement is to empower women, not to create dependency. So while these centers do provide material assistance, the hope is that the assistance will be temporary. They are trying to offer a hand up, not a hand out. 8. The Licensing Talk Is a Head Fake The abortion lobby will often talk about PRCs not being “licensed” to operate. But here is the reality: if pregnancy centers aren’t licensed, then neither are abortion clinics. Where licenses are required, pregnancy centers have them. Where licenses are not required, they don’t—and neither does Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood supported Whole Women’s Health’s journey all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to ensure they did not have to meet basic health and safety standards of their clinics. That case was about applying the same standards for similar medical facilities to abortion clinics, and Planned Parenthood vigorously opposed it. The dishonesty of the media who are clearly in the pockets of the abortion industry is not surprising. None of these truths made into Oliver’s story, but that will not stop me from sharing them.

"465",465,"For 100 Years, Planned Parenthood Has Silenced Millions Of Women, Including Me","Johnson","Abby",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-19"," Following Planned Parenthood’s celebration of their 100th anniversary over the weekend, where PP and allies proclaimed “100 years strong” a chorus of women are telling a different story. Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards said in a recent interview that she finds it “exciting” to hear women tell their abortion stories. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine also recently said they “trust women,” and that’s why they support abortion on demand and funded by taxpayers.  Why do Planned Parenthood and their allies only “trust women” and only want to hear women’s stories when they agree with Planned Parenthood? Why do they work to silence any women who disagree with them? Don’t our stories matter? Throughout history, women have often been treated as second-class citizens and their voices silenced. But this is 2016, and all women deserve to be heard. Planned Parenthood has consistently claimed to “care” for women “no matter what” and champion “women’s rights”—yet they frantically silence any woman who thinks women deserve better than Planned Parenthood. I Know Planned Parenthood Really Well At Planned Parenthood’s 100th anniversary, I find it important to tell my story, too. I worked for Planned Parenthood for eight years and was director of one of their abortion facilities in Texas. I got involved with their organization because I fell for their talking points and believed we were helping women and that Planned Parenthood wanted to reduce the number of abortions in America. I was wrong. In August 2009, and much to my surprise, I was told to double our abortion quota to increase our facility’s income. A month later, I saw a 13-week-old baby fight for his life against the abortion instruments. In that moment it became clear that Planned Parenthood doesn’t want to reduce the number of abortions and that women’s lives aren’t really their priority.  This was the exact moment when I realized I could no longer stay at Planned Parenthood. Abortion wasn’t an unfortunate solution to the problem of an unplanned pregnancy. Abortion was a product Planned Parenthood was selling, and at an astronomical rate. I left Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry in 2009, and I now stand together with more than 300 former abortion clinic workers in an organization called “And Then There Were None.” “And Then There Were None” is a network of former abortion clinic workers who are stepping forward to tell our stories about what really happens behind the closed doors of Planned Parenthood and abortion facilities across America. We are stepping forward because our voices deserve to be heard, and America deserves to know the truth. We are not the only ones who deserve to be heard. ATTWN is 300 strong, but we’re only one side of the story. Planned Parenthood Has Silenced Millions of Women What about the women who mourn the loss of their child after an abortion? What about the women who regret their abortions? And what about the women, like Tonya Reeves, who lost their lives after undergoing an abortion at a Planned Parenthood facility? Will Planned Parenthood allow their stories to be heard?  What about the beautiful stories of true female empowerment and motherhood, like Britney Spears’ little sister Jamie Lynn Spears, or “16 and Pregnant” star Catelynn Lowell? Don’t their stories deserve to be heard? What about the women like Claire Culwell, who survived abortion and now speaks publicly on the topic? Doesn’t Claire deserve to tell her story? At 13 years old, Claire’s mother had an abortion. A few weeks later, Claire’s mom went back to the doctor and was shocked to hear she’d been pregnant with twins. Only one of the two babies had been aborted. Claire was born several weeks early, with dislocated hips, was adopted by a beautiful family, and now is married with a child of her own. Will Planned Parenthood continue to silence Claire and her abortion story? Then there are the more than 7 million children Planned Parenthood has aborted. What about all of the baby girls who have been aborted in Planned Parenthood clinics, who are unable to speak for themselves? Planned Parenthood Cares, All Right—About Money Planned Parenthood has spent the past 100 years covering up the truth with creative rhetoric, political games like spending $30 million ahead of November’s election, and constantly referring back to their slogan: “Care, no matter what.” The American people are smarter than that, and we know America deserves better than anything Planned Parenthood offers. For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has told women they don’t have a voice unless they agree with Planned Parenthood. For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has pressured women into buying their rhetoric and joining their cause. For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has told women that they aren’t strong enough to be mothers and they can’t achieve their goals without abortion and birth control. For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has treated women as commodities. For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has exploited women to increase business revenue. For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has treated the children of the women they claim to serve as garbage—often literally throwing their bodies out with the trash. I am saddened that for eight years of my life I worked for Planned Parenthood and played a role in their deceit. Now I stand with the countless women of this great nation who proclaim Planned Parenthood isn’t 100 years strong, but rather 100 years wrong. Women deserve better than Planned Parenthood. Every woman deserves to be heard. Every woman deserves to feel truly empowered—and that’s something Planned Parenthood doesn’t offer.

"466",466,"The Texas Heartbeat Act Is Saving 100 Babies’ Lives Every Single Day","Parma","Rebecca",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-28"," Right now, more than 100 babies are being saved from abortion every day in Texas. The Texas Heartbeat Act is currently enforceable, even as the abortion industry and Biden administration attempt to thwart it. There has been much legal back-and-forth and misrepresentation of this life-saving law, particularly on the unique way in which it is enforced. Let’s cut through that confusion. The Texas Heartbeat Act prohibits elective abortion after the preborn child’s heartbeat is detected. Those who commit an abortion after this biological marker in the child’s development, as well as those who knowingly aid and abet in that illegal abortion, can be sued. The lynchpin that has allowed the law to take effect is that the state is not allowed to enforce the law; rather, it is the responsibility of private individuals to hold the abortion industry accountable for following the law.  So far in Texas, we are seeing the abortion industry comply with the new law. Eighty-five percent of abortions that previously would have been occurring in our state are now illegal. More than 100 babies per day are being given a chance at life. There have not been any credible assertions of violation. This means that the unique threat of private lawsuits under this law is successfully saving babies. Civil penalties are the most effective in pro-life laws because the abortion industry is profit-driven. The industry profits off killing preborn children and does not want to lose money. So it complies with pro-life laws (even as it fights them in the courts). That is why the Texas Heartbeat Act uses civil remedies — because it incentivizes compliance from the abortion industry. Not Vigilantism Despite the assertion by pro-abortion advocates and media, this is not vigilantism, and the civil remedies are not a bounty. The threat of a lawsuit and paying out at least $10,000 for a violation is the consequence set up under this law for engaging in an illegal activity, namely, performing an abortion after the baby has a heartbeat. Penalties function to deter illegal activity and to encourage compliance. Vigilantism implies lawlessness, and filing a lawsuit is not lawless. If a person believes an illegal abortion has been committed, she can bring a suit under the law, and a judge will evaluate the evidence and proceed from there.  The same holds for those who aid or abet in an illegal abortion. Rideshare platforms have ranted about this part of enforcement. However, Texas law already had a definition of aiding and abetting long before the Texas Heartbeat Act, and judges are used to applying this standard in other criminal activities. For a driver with a ridesharing platform to be sued under the aiding and abetting provisions of the Texas Heartbeat Act, he would have to know where he’s taking the pregnant woman, how far along in the pregnancy she is (is she past the point at which the baby’s heartbeat is detectable?), and whether she’s entering that abortion facility to obtain an abortion. This is the kind of high legal standard a judge would use in determining aiding and abetting of an illegal activity. No Frivolous Lawsuits The same goes for the fear of “frivolous lawsuits.” There is already a legal standard under which judges consider and dismiss frivolous lawsuits that existed long before this law. Even if you don’t trust the pro-life activist who can bring the lawsuit, trust our legal system and the judges who are used to handling these situations every day, and are equipped through legal and evidentiary standards to do so. The ability of any individual to bring a lawsuit under the Texas Heartbeat Act is a type of private enforcement that is already used in other areas of law (such as Medicaid fraud), including to a limited degree in other pro-life law. The Heartbeat Act merely extends this approach.  Besides, most pro-lifers who would bring a lawsuit under the Texas Heartbeat Act are not interested in monetary compensation — they are interested in preborn lives being spared from a violent and unjust death. That is why the law is clear that a pregnant woman cannot be sued under the law, because the purpose is to hold those who profit off the deaths of preborn children accountable: the abortion industry. But why try this unique enforcement mechanism in the first place? Because the pro-life movement is tired of district attorneys refusing to enforce pro-life laws and activist federal judges holding pro-life policies up in court for years on end, if not indefinitely. It is time to try a new approach. And that new approach is working. Texas is the first state to actually see a heartbeat law take effect — the Texas Heartbeat Act is the strongest pro-life law since Roe v. Wade. The anti-life mob is trying to cancel the Texas Heartbeat Act, but they have not been successful. So instead they are misrepresenting the law and constantly nitpicking and finding new objections. But the most important aspect of the law is this: Thousands of tiny Texans are being spared from the violence of death by abortion because of the way the Texas Heartbeat Act is enforced. No wonder those who promote abortion are so up in arms over its ingenuity.

"467",467,"There’s Room In The Democrat 2020 Field For A Pro-Life Candidate","Camosy","Charles","C.",NA,NA,NA,"2019-03-18"," It has not been a good past few months for supporters of abortion rights in the United States. A Democratic state delegate in Virginia calmly explained that her proposed legislation would allow for abortion up until the point of birth if a doctor confirmed that the pregnancy was affecting the mother’s mental health. A Democratic governor spoke with authority about how medical teams sometimes aim at the death of newborn infants. States like New York and Vermont passed some of the most abortion-permissive laws in the entire world.  All of this put a white-hot spotlight on late-term abortion (and even infanticide) in the United States. Extremist Politicians Even before these alienating events, rank and file Democrats were already opposed to the extremist views of their party’s leadership, which call for taxpayer-funded abortion on demand for any reason through all nine months of pregnancy. Twenty million Democrats identified as pro-life. Still more were broadly opposed to certain kinds of abortion—after 12 weeks and especially after 20 weeks. Especially significant for a party increasingly dominated by intersectional norms, economically vulnerable people of color were significantly more skeptical of abortion than were rich white people. But in the last month, average Democrats put even more distance between themselves and their party’s leadership. Axios did significant reporting on a new Marist poll that showed a “dramatic shift” on abortion. Given that Marist has been asking the same abortion questions for more than a decade, and their numbers have remained relatively stable over time, such a shift is very significant. In one month, remarkably, “pro-life” closed a 17-point gap with “pro-choice.” Both are now tied at 47 percent of the electorate.  Perhaps counterintuitively, Democrats led the shift. In February, 34 percent of Democrats identified as pro-life vs. 61 percent pro-choice. The January numbers were 20 percent pro-life and 75 percent pro-choice. Perhaps even more counterintuitively, Democrats under 45 moved the most: 47 percent now identify as pro-life and 48 percent as pro-choice. In January, those numbers were 28 and 65 percent. It’s an eyebrow-raising 19-point move in a pro-life direction. I’ve written at length about how labels like “pro-life” and “pro-choice” often hide more than they reveal. Rather than revealing something specific about their views on abortion polices, such labels are a signal more about one’s (lack of) comfort with a particular political or ideological movement. Lots of folks who identify as pro-choice, for instance, agree with pro-lifers on actual policy proposals, but have such serious problems with the pro-life movement that they just cannot use such an identifier. But it is in precisely this context that we can see how the shift reveals something important has happened. Proposals coming from pro-choice Democratic leadership over the past month have been so awful, so horrific, that large numbers of Democrats could no longer identify with the movement behind them. Americans absolutely loathe late-term abortion, with 87 percent (including large numbers of Democrats and others who identify as pro-choice) wanting it to be made illegal. And this was before the overwhelming majority of Democratic senators voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Significantly, all six of the major Democratic candidates for president outed themselves as wild extremists by actually voting against a bill requiring that newborn children be treated with dignity, given proper life-saving measures if that is what they need to survive. This includes the so-called moderate in the group, Amy Klobuchar, who has taken zero anti-abortion votes in her entire career.  It goes without saying that none of these candidates are poised to take advantage of the dramatic pro-life shift among Democrats. On the contrary, their extremism is sure to alienate those who made the shift. So what will millions and millions of pro-life Democrats do in 2020? Will they simply stay home? Maybe. Even probably. But what if they had a candidate to vote for in the Democratic primaries? “Nonsense,” a skeptic might say. “No pro-life Democrat could ever get enough delegates to be viable candidate.” An Opening For a Pro-Lifer? Don’t be so sure. Nate Silver thinks there may be 17 or more Democratic candidates running for president. According to him, when there are this many people in the mix, things “get weird.” Republicans learned this lesson in the huge field vying for the 2016 nomination. The reason Trump was able to win, despite his fairly low level of support throughout, was because overall vote totals were so diluted by the number of candidates running. This effect will be even more dramatic in the 2020 Democratic field. Close to 20 abortion-friendly candidates will be competing for handfuls of delegates, especially in the early states. Just one pro-life candidate could garner the votes of millions and millions of pro-life Democrats—including new converts who are super-disgusted and therefore super-motivated. Furthermore, depending how you define the concept, about 20 states have open presidential primaries—including early states like New Hampshire and South Carolina,  and other key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas. Think about how many millions of pro-life Republicans and Independents in these states would vote for the only pro-life candidate in the Democratic primary, especially given that Trump is likely to be without serious opposition in the GOP primary. Think about how many millions would vote for such a pro-life candidate in Texas alone. “Nonsense,” our skeptic might say. “There aren’t viable pro-life Democratic candidates who could actually run. And even if there were, the party simply wouldn’t let them run.” This is a more powerful objection from our skeptic, but it is not ultimately persuasive. Consider the debacle after the public learned the Democratic National Committee (DNC) tried to keep Bernie Sanders from winning the 2016 nomination. Under pressure, the party has restructured itself (due in no small part to reform of how superdelegates function) to not allow party leaders to put a heavy thumb on the scales. Thus, it is not nearly as closed a process as it used to be. Three Good Picks While there aren’t any home run candidates, there are at least three interesting people who could do well in this lane. John Bel Edwards, the current governor of Louisiana, takes backseat to no one in being anti-abortion (he’s also quite friendly to the Second Amendment). He also expanded Medicare and has accomplished major criminal justice reform in his state. A West Point grad who demolishes our lazy right-left political binary, Edwards would be a very interesting person to run in this lane. Katrina Jackson, a state representative also from Louisiana, is a pro-life Democrat and an African-American woman. Invited to speak at this year’s March for Life, she is the author of a state law limiting abortion providers to physicians who have admitting privileges at a local hospital—a law that is likely to become the first major abortion test for the new Supreme Court. Especially given the intersectional values of the Democratic Party, it would be difficult to keep such a formidable candidate out this particular lane. Then there is Sen. Bob Casey, Jr. of Pennsylvania. Despite some bad votes (from a left-leaning perspective), including voting against the confirmation of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, he is the most prominent pro-life Democrat in the United States—not least because of the pro-life legacy of his father, a legendary former governor of the state. But he has also voted correctly on a number of contentious issues, including voting for both the Pain-Capable Act and Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. He bucked party leadership both times and joined only handful of Democrats in so doing. Casey might be the best-positioned person to run, but he’d need to work overtime for the traditional pro-life movement to get behind him 100 percent. Even if one of these candidates were to run and ultimately be unsuccessful in procuring the nomination, the energy and attention he or she would receive could create major national attention for the pro-life cause. It could be a total game-changer for the abortion debate—in the pro-life movement, in the Democratic Party, and in the United States of America.

"468",468,"How To Establish Sanctuary Cities For The Unborn","Parma","Rebecca",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-07-30"," Every day we grow nearer to Roe v. Wade being overturned and states finally being able to fully restore the rights of preborn children after 46 years of deadly violence. After the Supreme Court of the United States decided Roe in 1973, and especially since the subsequent 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, state governments have enacted incremental protections for preborn children to the fullest extent possible under current court rulings. This strategy of step-by-step victories has saved millions of preborn children over the decades and has progressively undermined the legal foundation of the unjust Supreme Court ruling. Now, even local governments are stepping up to foster incremental pro-life victories.  Most Americans overlook that pro-life advances can be made at the local level as well. As a movement, we largely focus on passing legislative fixes at the state and federal levels, policies that are integral to our overall goal to end abortion in the United States. But most states do not have full-time legislatures, meaning state-level legislative progress is not possible for extended periods of time. Texas is one such state. Despite most Texans’ strong pro-life values, the state legislature in 2019 failed to ban any abortions, including the remaining late-term or discriminatory abortions, allowing preborn children to be targeted for the next two years. Citizens of most states can relate to Texans’ frustration at the lack of pro-life policies enacted in their legislatures, and all pro-life Americans know this frustration at the federal level. This is where pro-life advocates at the local level come into play, and Texas cities have taken matters into their own hands. Municipalities can pass an ordinance declaring themselves a “Sanctuary City for the Unborn,” classifying abortion as murder, outlawing elective abortion within the city’s limits, and prohibiting any abortion businesses from setting up within their jurisdiction. These ordinances allow cities to condemn Roe through exercising their constitutional right of self-governance, while making a rhetorical statement co-opting liberal language in defense of the truly most vulnerable population in our society. One of the primary purposes of these ordinances is prevention. If cities that do not currently house an abortion facility take action now, they can immediately prevent abortion businesses from moving into their cities and committing abortions, using the fear of future prosecution against abortionists once Roe v. Wade is overturned.  The ordinances do not penalize women who seek or undergo an abortion, nor ban referral for abortions outside the city’s jurisdiction. Expertly crafted ordinances acknowledge cities’ limitations of working within the existing legal framework of U.S. abortion jurisprudence while taking a bold stance in defense of innocent human life. Passing these local ordinances is an innovative, proactive strategy pro-lifers can employ to undermine the legal foundation of Roe v. Wade. Cities in Utah and New Mexico have already declared themselves Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn via symbolic resolutions, but this year Waskom, Texas, passed the first city ordinance in Texas to more powerfully outlaw abortion within city limits. Since then, several other communities have shown interest. As accompanies nearly every pro-life advancement made in the United States, the abortion industry has responded to these local pro-life initiatives with lies and threats of legal action. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) threatened to bring lawsuits against cities that pursue these ordinances. The goal of these ordinances is not to expose cities to potential lawsuits, but to prevent abortion groups like Planned Parenthood from opening in new territories and attack Roe v. Wade. As a movement, we walk a fine line with any and all advances we make. To end abortion in America, we must push as aggressively as we can for preborn rights within the current judicial framework, simultaneously recognizing that abortion giants will challenge many of these advances in court. All these reasons highlight the importance of carefully drafting ordinance language to protect pro-life cities from lawsuits to the greatest extent possible and take an assertive position for life.  Elective abortion was made legal in the United States through the court system, and that is where we must win to make abortion illegal. Because of this, we cannot be afraid of the courts. At the state and federal levels, we pass dynamic policies into law so they have the opportunity to be challenged, giving the U.S. Supreme Court the chance to dismantle Roe and showing us how much more aggressively we can push to protect preborn lives. However, a court challenge is not guaranteed. In 2013, Texas passed the Preborn Pain Act, prohibiting abortion on preborn children at five months post-fertilization because this is the point at which we know so far that they can feel pain. To date, this lifesaving law has not been challenged in court. Thus far, no Sanctuary City for the Unborn resolution or ordinance has been sued. This again emphasizes the importance of strategically drafting language and shows a lawsuit is not necessarily inevitable. The more communities that pass Sanctuary City for the Unborn ordinances, the greater effect they will have on courts considering abortion cases nationwide. Now is not the time to dismiss strategy, as our goal is so close at hand. Rather, now is the opportune moment to expand our arsenal, with pro-life city ordinances as another tool for dismantling the faulty legal framework of Roe. Pro-life citizens must stand now against the injustice of elective abortion by taking legislative action to protect preborn children at every level of government, especially those closest to home. These pro-life city ordinances can affect the abortion debate happening across the nation, and with your help, your city could be next. Read the ordinance language here.

"469",469,"Here’s A Primer On Pro-Life Responses To Common Counter-Arguments","Payne","Daniel",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017-01-30"," The annual March for Life—a massive yearly gathering of pro-life activists and individuals in Washington DC—took place this past Friday, although you may not have been aware of it. As a rule the media generally do not cover it that much, and even when they do, they typically don’t cover it very well. In any case, you may be wondering just what the pro-life movement is about. If you’ve gotten your information from the mainstream media, then your perception of pro-lifers may be woefully incomplete. If you’ve gotten your information from the liberal commentariat, then your perception of pro-life beliefs is likely distorted and wildly misleading.  The truth of the pro-life movement is much richer and more interesting than either of these sources would have you believe. If you have questions about pro-life ideas, it is best to get them from the movement itself rather than from people outside the movement or opposed to it. So this primer may be of use to you. To keep things brief, we will assume one of the basic tenets of the pro-life position regarding abortion: the unborn are human beings from conception onward, and deserve the full protection of the law just like any other human being does. For the most part, people who identify as “pro-life” believe this to be true. What are the objections to this position, and how does the pro-life movement frequently respond? A Fetus Isn’t Necessarily Human Pro-Choice Objection: “Actually, the unborn are not human beings!”  Pro-Life Response: This is incorrect. From the moment of conception—when a sperm meets, and fertilizes, an egg—the unborn are fully living, genetically distinct, and biologically self-directing autonomous individuals of the species Homo sapiens­­—i.e., human beings. Modern medicine, specifically embryology, is very clear about this. Unborn humans at various stages may be smaller, weaker, less-developed, stranger-looking, more helpless, and less personable than other human beings, but this does not make them any less human. Tiny Babies Are Like Acorns Objection: “This is wrong. The unborn—especially at their earliest stages—are potential humans, but they’re not yet humans. An acorn can one day grow into an oak tree, but that doesn’t mean you would call an acorn an oak tree, does it?” Response: This objection evinces a fundamental misunderstanding of human biological development. There is no such thing as a “potential” human; there are human haploid gametes, male and female, and when they meet, they create a fully actual human being, no “potential” necessary. After being created, a human being surely has a lot more growing to do, but the creation—the dividing line between nonexistence and actualized existence—has already happened. Full and complete humanity does not depend upon growth but rather origination—that is to say, fertilization.  The acorn-to-oak tree argument is a clever explanation of a flawed hypothesis. For the purposes of this analogy, the relevant feature of both acorns and oak trees is not their various stages of development but the fact that they both belong to the tree family Fagaceae. No serious person would claim that an acorn, simply by dint of being smaller and less-developed than an oak tree, is somehow less a part of Fagaceae than a fully-grown oak is. They are both part of the same family no matter what stage of their development. Of course, we don’t give basic rights to members of Fagaceae, but if we did, we would be logically obliged to extend those rights to all members of Fagaceae, acorn and oak alike. We do, however, recognize the rights of members of the species Homo sapiens, and thus we should extend those rights to all members of this species—born and unborn, big and small, strong and weak, vocal and silent. Human Beings Aren’t Necessarily Human Persons Objection: “Well, okay, maybe the unborn are human beings—but they’re not human persons, and therefore they don’t deserve the full benefit of the law.” Response: This is a metaphysical argument that acknowledges the obvious biological justification of the pro-life movement but subverts it in favor of pro-choice philosophy. In the eyes of many pro-choicers, the unborn are not “persons” because they have not yet reached an arbitrary benchmark of personal performance: they do not have self-awareness, they cannot speak, they cannot do anything on their own, they have not yet developed certain organs or begun certain biological processes. Ultimately this is a distinction without a difference. For one, the pro-choice “personhood” criteria generally apply equally to newborns, who are helpless, not self-aware, incapable of speech, underdeveloped, and for all practical purposes functionally indistinguishable from most of the unborn. Yet, for obvious and self-evident reasons, you will be hard-pressed to find pro-choicers who believe you should be able to stab a newborn in the head with an ice pick. The inconsistency betrays the fallacy. More to the point, a civilized human society does not assign “personhood” on the basis of functionality and capability. A human being in a deep but temporary coma fits most of the criteria for non-personhood. Is it okay to kill him? What about those who are in a deep sleep? What about the severely retarded and disabled? A criteria-based philosophy of human personhood must inevitably be okay with executing all of these people on the basis of their non-personality. Pro-lifers tend to believe otherwise: most of us assign personhood not on the basis of functionality or capability but rather innate capacity and intrinsic essence: we believe the unborn (possessing the full capacity of humanity) and the disabled (who are intrinsically ordered to that capacity, even if their specific individuality differs from it) are all persons, all worthy of life, and all worthy of protection under the law. It’s Her Body, She Can Do What She Want Objection: “Maybe all of that is true. Even so, a woman still has the right to do whatever she wants with her body. That includes abortion.” Response: A woman does indeed have a right to do whatever she wants with her body—but not with someone else’s body, and the unborn child inside of her is clearly not “her body.” Embryology is very clear on this point: from the moment of conception onward there exists in a woman’s uterus a genetically distinct, fully individual human being. A pregnant woman shouldn’t be allowed to kill this human being or harm him in any way. We acknowledge this reality in countless ways throughout our society. Consider that my home state of Virginia bans smoking in emergency rooms. Quite obviously this is meant to protect patients from the dangers of second-hand smoke. Do you think it would be acceptable if I marched into an emergency room, lit up a cigarette and said, “I have the right to do what I want with my own body?” Of course not. The hospital would throw me out, and rightfully so, because the thing I was doing to “my own body” was also negatively affecting other people. We prohibit all sorts of behaviors that nominally only affect our bodies but can have adverse effects on other people’s bodies, as well. Abortion is one of those behaviors, all the more so because (a) it is intended to harm another person, and (b) the full intent of that harm is death. I support the rights of women to do whatever they wish with their own bodies. I just don’t believe they have the right to do whatever they want with anyone else’s. Abortion Will Still Happen If We Outlaw It Objection: “Well, guess what? Outlawing abortion isn’t going to stop abortion. Women will still get abortions even if it’s illegal.” Response: Maybe so. But even if that’s the case, it is still not a persuasive argument for keeping abortion legal. Consider: the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865, outlawed slavery in the United States. Nonetheless, slavery still exists in America. Over a century-and-a-half later, the Thirteenth Amendment still hasn’t fully eradicated this terrible practice. Does that mean we should repeal it and allow slavery to once again be legal in this country? After all, “people will still do it,” even if it’s illegal! Nonsense. Just because some people will break a law doesn’t mean the law shouldn’t be in place. The obvious response to the continued presence of slavery in this country is to continue to fight it, not legalize it. Thus with abortion. We must stop giving it the full sanction of the law. And it is worth pointing out that the pro-life movement does not simply want to stop at making abortion illegal. We want to create a culture wherein abortion, legal or otherwise, is seen as unnecessary. We want to fully support desperate and frightened mothers who would be compelled to seek out this awful procedure. If and when abortion is finally outlawed, the pro-life movement will be mobilized and ready to provide for the women who would have sought otherwise-legal abortions. Should We Jail Moms For Aborting Babies? Objection: “So if you outlaw abortion, are you going to send women to jail if they get an abortion? Nobody would ever tolerate such laws.” Response: While a small minority among the pro-life movement does indeed believe that abortive women should go to jail, the wider pro-life movement believes something different: that abortive women are also victims of abortion, and thus do not deserve to suffer the punishment of anti-abortion laws. Most pro-lifers believe that it’s the abortion provider—the profiteer from a woman’s desperation and fear—that should go to jail. The Mother-As-Host Argument Objection: “Maybe all of these points are accurate. But just the same, we shouldn’t be forcing people by law to provide their own bodies for the benefit of someone else. You wouldn’t force someone to donate a kidney to a sick person, would you? Neither should you force a woman to donate the use of her uterus to an unborn human.” Response: Yes, we shouldn’t force people to donate organs or otherwise provide their bodies for another human being in such a way. But this misses the point of what pregnancy is, and more specifically how pregnancy comes about. In all but a small (and admittedly terrible) number of cases involving rape, pregnancy always results from two individuals having consensual sex (or from medical procedures meant to treat infertility). Of course, in many of these cases the man or the woman (or both) were using birth control and thus actively trying to avoid getting pregnant. But pregnancy is always a potential outcome of any heterosexual sexual activity. Even contracepting couples are aware of this (why else would they be contracepting?). As a result, a woman’s having any kind of consensual sex, contracepted or otherwise, is tacit consent to potentially being pregnant. The risk for pregnancy was always there, and the activity related to that risk was voluntarily undertaken. If pro-choicers wish to make pregnancy and abortion analogous to organ donation, they will have to argue for an organ donator’s right to take the organ back after he’s donated it. No reasonable legal system would ever allow for such a thing, nor should our law allow for a pregnant woman to take her child’s life away after she voluntarily created it. What About Government Services Objection: “Well, okay, fine. All of that may be true. But in the end, pro-life conservatives are only concerned about babies up until birth. Then they don’t care anymore. If pro-lifers were truly ‘pro-life,’ they’d be in favor of higher taxes to support larger welfare programs, better-funded public schools, and other government services for poor people. Pro-lifers are really only ‘pro-birth.’” Response: This has become a strangely common argument in recent years: the notion that, if a pro-lifer doesn’t support an expansive government and welfare state, then his anti-abortion ideas are somehow disingenuous. This is, on its face, a rather silly argument. The management of public education, the extent of welfare, the size of government—all of these are policy questions, and people of good will can disagree honestly and sincerely over individual policy prescriptions without sacrificing any ideological integrity over their pro-life beliefs. For instance, plenty of data suggest that throwing money at our public education system does not lead to better student outcomes, and that what’s needed isn’t more funding but genuine academic reform. If a pro-life person believes, based on this evidence, that we should be working to reform our nation’s education system as the likeliest avenue towards improving it, this doesn’t make him any less pro-life. Many pro-lifers and conservatives recognize the reality that, oftentimes, handing off a task to the government is the surest way to make a problem worse. To be sure, there are plenty of pro-lifers who believe in expanding the size and scope of government. The pro-life movement is as diverse as any other large political or social faction. Painting it with a broad policy brush makes no sense at all. Yet many pro-lifers and conservatives recognize the reality that, oftentimes, handing off a task to the government is the surest way to make a problem worse. Because of their love for women and children in desperate situations, lots of pro-lifers believe it is their duty to ensure services for needy mothers and their children are performed as well and with as much love and personalization as possible. This can be seen in the widespread pro-life commitment to pregnancy centers and other similar community service organizations. In the end, pro-lifers can both (a) believe it’s wrong to murder unborn humans and (b) disagree with prevailing progressive orthodoxy about government. These two things aren’t fundamentally incompatible. This is, in a nutshell, the pro-life position on abortion. You may never have encountered these ideas before, because our media are generally loath to report on the pro-life movement with much objectivity, and the vast majority of our commentators do not understand the pro-life movement and do not want to. Our message is a simple one: innocent human beings should not be murdered. Pro-life belief effectively boils down to that one simple maxim. It is not hard to understand. If, however, you are still confused about what the pro-life movement stands for, I encourage you to attend next year’s March for Life and see for yourself first-hand what a genuine, loving, vibrant culture of life really looks like.

"470",470,"Issue 1 Permanently Writes Planned Parenthood’s Business Model Into Ohio’s Constitution","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023-11-02"," Voters across Ohio are gearing up to vote in one of the most consequential elections in their state’s history. On the ballot Nov. 7 is Issue 1, a measure crafted and funded by outside activists to amend the Ohio Constitution to include an effectively unlimited “right” to abortion through all nine months of pregnancy.



If passed, Issue 1 won’t just give the abortion industry a free pass to end unborn lives and trample on parents’ rights, as local pro-life and parental rights groups have noted. The constitutional amendment will fundamentally and permanently change the way the state operates forever.



“This is not a vote against Ohio’s current laws on abortion,” Megan M. Wold, former deputy solicitor general in the Ohio attorney general’s office, said on a press call on Tuesday. “Some voters may not like some aspects of those laws. But this is a vote for a new legal regime that would remove from voters the ability to enact common-sense abortion laws in the future, including the very same kinds of abortion laws that exist in all of Western Europe.” 



The Ohio Capital Journal published several articles over the last few weeks claiming voters who check “yes” on the amendment are simply reaffirming the state’s status quo 22-week abortion law by rejecting a “controversial” six-week ban “with no exceptions for rape or incest” from taking effect. But that characterization of Issue 1 couldn’t be further from the truth. 



“Issue 1 is more than just stating a right to obtain an abortion like Roe v. Wade held, it’s actually creating the entire legal regime that would govern abortion in Ohio,” Wold said.



If passed, the Issue 1 constitutional amendment and its sweeping provisions would immediately supplant any of Ohio’s laws, including the state’s current 22-week abortion limit.  



“Issue 1 is not a resurrection of the status quo. Because constitutional language supersedes regular statutes, Issue 1 would upend long-standing Ohio laws governing the abortion process, including laws governing late-term or particularly unethical abortion practices, and laws governing parental notification,” May Davis Mailman, the vice president for legal, strategy, and communications of Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections and a senior fellow at the Independent Women’s Law Center, said on the same press call.



The activists who penned the ballot measure designed it to ensure abortion in Ohio can never be truly restricted, even though Ohioans overwhelmingly reject unlimited abortion through birth.



To achieve their goals, they littered the proposal with undefined terms such as “individual” and “reproductive decisions,” which groups such as American Policy Roundtable say can be easily expanded to include more than just adult women or abortion. If passed, the ballot amendment will be exploited to justify a multitude of decisions for men, women, and children alike. 



Other language in the proposal such as “fetal viability” does have an assigned legal definition but one that hinges on the subjective judgment of a doctor who is free to deem abortion necessary for a woman’s “health.”



“The state may not interfere with that broadly defined right unless it can meet an impossibly high burden of least restrictive means in order to further that individual’s health,” Mailman explained. “That is a far different and far higher burden than the pre-Dobbs legal regime.”



Before Dobbs v. Jackson, states were permitted to issue restrictions on abortions beyond viability, bans on taxpayer-funded abortions, and parental notification laws. If Ohioans pass Issue 1, they will be welcoming a new era of lawmaking in Ohio that effectively hampers them and their elected representatives from reining in abuses on a broad range of issues including contraception, assisted reproductive technology, abortion, the radical transing of children, and any of the other “rights” that might fall under the ambiguous terms included in the amendment.



“If it is enacted, Issue 1 effectively cannot be changed. Ohio has never repealed a constitutional provision that was enacted by initiative, and it’s unlikely to do so. The process is very burdensome,” Wold emphasized. “It is highly likely that this law will become the permanent law on abortion for the entire state. And in that way, Issue 1 is actually taking the abortion issue out of the hands of Ohioans.”



Instead, the power will be handed to Planned Parenthood and the other abortion activists who helped write the amendment to gain constitutional protection for their profits. 



“They are in essence, writing their business model into the state constitution. This gives them a level of legal privilege far beyond what other corporations have in Ohio,” American Policy Roundtable warned.

Wade Changes Everything — Just Not In The Ways Corporate Media Claim","Magness","Cheryl",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-05"," If you own a fainting couch, now might be a good time to list it for sale. Given the pearl-clutching panic currently on display among the pro-abortion crowd, you should make a pretty penny.



Notwithstanding the hysteria that has ensued in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling effectively overturning Roe v. Wade, not much has changed. Abortion is still widely available in this country and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Dobbs has not banned abortion in the United States, only given it to the states to regulate as they see fit. 



Still, perhaps the Chicken Littles are on to something. Let’s briefly consider what did and didn’t change when the court handed down its decision on June 24. 



What Dobbs Didn’t Change



If you want an abortion in this country, you can get one. Yes, trigger laws have led to more than a dozen states either banning abortion or beginning the process of doing so. 



But even if you live in one of those states, the pro-abort contingent is rushing to make sure you are aware of all the ways you can still obtain an abortion: by traveling to a state where it is allowed, by ordering abortion pills from an online pharmacy, or by purchasing them from an overseas provider. And companies like Amazon and Citigroup have promised to help their employees who want abortions to get them. It helps their bottom line, after all.



But more important than the ongoing availability of abortion is the continuing desire of women to obtain them. One Supreme Court case doesn’t alter people’s beliefs, nor does it change their hearts. As long as there are women who want to get abortions (and men who pressure them into it), the scourge of abortion will remain.



What Dobbs Did Change



Why, then, the celebration? If abortion is still with us, why are those in the pro-life cause so jubilant? 



Because while in one sense, nothing has changed — not the basic availability of abortion in the United States, the hearts and minds of those who promote and seek it, or the greed of those who will provide it — in another sense, everything has changed. No longer is the United States a country where abortion on demand is the default. No longer is the federal government in the express business of advocating for the “right” of a woman to have an abortion while ignoring the right of the child in the womb to live.



“Roe’s defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions,” the opinion explained, “but abortion is fundamentally different, as both Roe and Casey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called ‘fetal life’ and what the law now before us describes as an ‘unborn human being.’”



The Supreme Court’s refusal in Dobbs v. Jackson to continue a 50-year-old policy of preventing states from regulating abortion as they see fit is not going to lead to an immediate and wholesale change in the way Americans view abortion. But history shows that governments do affect the way people live. 



How Dobbs Could Have a Generational Influence



Whether or not one thinks Prohibition was a good policy, the fact is that it resulted in Americans drinking less. Recent studies show marijuana use has increased in the states in which it has been legalized. 



Other historical examples of how government policy has shaped behavior come from such things as seat belt laws and smoking. State laws requiring seat belts have resulted in people wearing seat belts (and thus dying less often in car accidents). State laws regulating the sale of alcohol and cigarettes to minors have made it harder for minors to drink and smoke, and governmental campaigns about the dangers of smoking have resulted in fewer people smoking. 



Americans like to think of ourselves as rebels and rugged individualists, but we are largely law-abiding citizens who respect our government and do what it says. Elections have consequences.



It’s going to take generations for us to see the effects of Dobbs on the number of abortions performed in the United States. But while we are waiting for those effects to materialize, there are some for whom Dobbs will change everything today, tomorrow, next week, next month, and next year. 



Because of this ruling, there will be babies born who otherwise would not have been. Their lives will be a gift and blessing to the world, regardless of whether the world realizes it. Given the demographic alarms sounding about population decline, this welcome realization may well come sooner than later. 



More than ever, it is the duty of pro-life Americans to uphold all children as the blessing they are by doing whatever we can to care for them and to support their parents, whether biological or adoptive. As pro-life organizations continue working for a recognition of the sanctity of life by every person in every place, the care of that life at all its stages and the promotion of pro-natalist policies become even more essential elements of our work. 



Death Pangs



Those who are making big money off of the abortion business are naturally going to scream about this ruling. Their screams are the screams of death as they face the realization of their increasing irrelevance. We owe them nothing. 



But the screams of those who are losing what they see as their necessary access to abortion are the screams of fear. Those of us who understand that life is a sacred gift from the Creator of the universe must not grow weary in sharing that understanding, in love, with those who need to hear it. 



Meanwhile, if anyone from Planned Parenthood is reading, I have a fainting couch for sale.

"472",472,"4 Problems With Telling Men To Shut Up On Women’s Issues","Bauer","Gary",NA,"Allott, Daniel",NA,NA,"2015-03-19"," Earlier this month, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken made a revealing comment at a gala celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of EMILY’s List, the nation’s most influential abortion rights political action committee. “First of all,” he quipped as he began his introduction of the group’s president, Stephanie Schriock, “I apologize for being a guy.” The former Saturday Night Live actor’s jest probably earned him a few laughs. But it also hinted at the absurdity of what has become an increasingly common refrain among abortion advocates—that reproductive issues are (or ought to be) the domain of women alone.  Franken’s remark was tame compared to what other abortion supporters have said. In 2013, former Sen. Alan Simpson told the Los Angeles Times that “men legislators shouldn’t even vote on” abortion. The year before, a Huffington Post writer penned a column titled: “New Rule: Only Women Legislators Should Be Allowed to Vote on Women’s Issues.” Sit Down, Men, You Have Nothing to Do with Babies The idea that men should keep quiet on reproductive issues undergirds much of Democrats’ ridiculous “war on women” attack against conservatives. To take one example, during Wendy Davis’s famous filibuster of a pro-life bill, the then-Texas state senator suggested that her male colleagues might not care about abortion rights because they “have never ever had to face [an unplanned pregnancy] and will never face it, because you don’t have the equipment. [But] I’ve got it and my daughters have it, and other women that I care about have it, and women who I don’t know have it.” If abortion advocates who believe men shouldn’t comment or vote on women’s issues were logically consistent, they would also support barring women from weighing in on ‘men’s issues.’ There are at least four problems with this line of thinking. First, those who employ it seem to believe that because women bear the physical and emotional burdens of pregnancy, they are more likely than men to support abortion. But that’s not true. Women’s views on abortion roughly align with those of men. And some polling has found that women are likelier than men to take the “no exceptions” pro-life position. Second, if abortion advocates who believe men shouldn’t comment or vote on women’s issues were logically consistent, they would also support barring women from weighing in on “men’s issues.” But no one has proposed that (nor should they). When California Sen. Barbara Boxer introduced the National Prostate Cancer Plan Act earlier this year, nobody suggested that she withdraw her sponsorship because, as a woman, she doesn’t, as Davis might put it, have the equipment.  Likewise when various congressional committees have held hearings on National Football League concussions and steroids in baseball, we don’t remember anyone ever proposing that women legislators recuse themselves because women don’t play in either the NFL or the major leagues. Politics Could Never Work This Way Taken a step further, Simpson’s logic might mean that the opinions of abled-bodied people should be discounted when considering policies that deal with disability. Or that the votes of immigrant legislators should count for more than those of the native-born on bills that address immigration. The possibilities—and the absurdities—are endless. Politicians are elected to office to represent their constituents. Third, when politicians vote, they don’t (or shouldn’t) consider only their own interests; they’re elected to office to represent their constituents. When Boxer introduced her prostate cancer bill, she may or may not have had strong personal convictions about improving prostate cancer screening and early detection. But she introduced the bill as the elected representative of millions of the people who live in her state, including the nearly 20,000 California men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. Similarly when Arizona Republican Trent Franks introduced the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in January, he had strong personal reasons for doing so. He was born with congenital defects including a cleft palate, and his brother had Down syndrome. When diagnosed prenatally, cleft palate and Down syndrome usually lead to abortion.  But Franks almost never alludes to his personal story when speaking about his pro-life position. When introducing the Pain Capable bill, he instead described it as legislation “all humane Americans can support if they understand it for themselves.” Abortion Is Also a Men’s Issue Which gets us to problem number four. Unlike prostate cancer and football concussions, abortion’s primary effects cross the gender line. Two lives are affected in an abortion, and the defenseless one has a roughly 50-50 chance of being a boy. Bonds between children and their fathers are created during the ‘magical moment’ when fathers see the ultrasound image of their unborn child. Science has also shown that men can be profoundly affected after a partner has given birth, miscarried, or aborted a pregnancy. New research out of the University of Wisconsin suggests that bonds between children and their fathers are created during the “magical moment” when fathers see the ultrasound image of their unborn child. To be sure, women should be given a certain amount of deference when these issues arise. After all, it is women—not men—who are sometimes abandoned to deal with the effects of reproductive decisions. No amount of book learning or study can compare with the lived experiences of women when it comes to pregnancy and its various outcomes. But this shouldn’t preclude men’s involvement or prevent them from speaking up. In fact, most abortion advocates really don’t want men to remain silent—so long as they support abortion. Consider a recent fundraising email from NARAL Pro-Choice America. With the subject line: “I’m a man. I support abortion rights,” John Brougher, NARAL’s chief technology officer, writes: As a man, people sometimes ask me why I work to defend abortion rights.
My answer: How could I not? Brougher goes on to announce that NARAL has launched a group called Men for Choice “to mobilize the support we need among men as well as women.” Consider also Gene Novogrodsky, a 76-year-old Texas man recently lauded by Planned Parenthood for biking 300 miles to raise money for the billion-dollar abortion business. “I have daughters, I have a wife. These issues are important to me because I care about the health and well-being of my family,” Nonogrodsky told reporters, when asked about his motivation for riding. What abortion advocates really seek is not to silence men per se, but to muzzle anyone—male or female—who opposes their ideas and agenda. But, like Novogrodsky, pro-life men have wives and daughters about whose health and well-being they care deeply. They, too, should be free to speak and vote their minds on the important issues that affect them—and to do so without apology.

"473",473,"Do Taxpayers Pay Planned Parenthood To Stymie Adoptions?","Mattox","Casey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-08-31"," Videos from the Center for Medical Progress are exposing Planned Parenthood’s multiple financial interests in a woman’s abortion decision, including the sale of her unborn child’s body parts. Congress and the states are responding by considering redirecting the roughly half billion per year we give to the nation’s number-one abortionist to federally qualified health centers and other options that outnumber Planned Parenthood almost 20 to 1. One of the primary funding streams to Planned Parenthood is Title X, run by the creepily named federal “Office of Population Affairs.” A close look at the details of President Clinton-era Title X regulations indicates that taxpayers may be paying Planned Parenthood to steer women away from adoption and toward the abortions that benefit its bottom line.  In 2014, according to its own numbers, for every 175 women who came to Planned Parenthood looking for supposedly unbiased—Title X-funded—information about their unplanned pregnancies and decided they could not keep their child, one chose adoption and 174 chose abortion. With only a handful of claimed adoption referrals every year and abortions increasing annually, Planned Parenthood’s ratio is subject to some fluctuation, but as recently as 2010 it performed 391 abortions for every adoption. Even those adoption figures may be inflated because former Planned Parenthood directors tell me there is no reporting system for adoption referrals (like there is for paid abortions) and they never saw such a referral. Nearly Five Times as Many Abortions as Adoptions Abortion ends roughly 1 million human lives every year in America. Adoption numbers are more difficult to discern, but given past statistics and trends we can estimate that around 150,000 children are adopted in the United States every year. According to Planned Parenthood’s own numbers, it is responsible for 327, 653 of those abortions and 1,880 adoption referrals (see above for doubt about even this number, and these are still claimed “referrals,” not actual adoptions). If you subtract Planned Parenthood’s numbers from the overall statistics to get a picture of the rest of America, you find that one child is adopted for every 4.5 aborted (672,347 divided by 148,120). If you subtract Planned Parenthood’s numbers from the overall statistics, you find that one child is adopted for every 4.5 aborted. This is a sad number. And it’s even sadder given the number of couples waiting to adopt. But compare that to the reality for women who walk into Planned Parenthood: one adopted for every 174 aborted. Women with an unplanned pregnancy who decide between abortion and adoption are 38 times more likely to choose abortion if they go to Planned Parenthood for advice. What does it say for Title X’s taxpayer-funded and supposedly nondirective options counseling program that its largest grantee, Planned Parenthood, seems to be steering so many women toward abortion?  Regulations Make Adoption Counseling Optional Replacing the Reagan- and Bush-era “gag rule” on abortion counseling in the Title X program (upheld by the Supreme Court in Rust v. Sullivan), the Clinton administration issued rules that supposedly require unbiased, nondirective counseling about all of a woman’s options. At least, that’s how it’s popularly understood, even on Capitol Hill. But this is a myth. Here are the instructions Planned Parenthood must follow in providing tax-funded options counseling: A project must:
Offer pregnant women the opportunity to provided information and counseling regarding each of the following options:
Prenatal care and delivery;
Infant care, foster care,or adoption; and
 Pregnancy termination. 42 C.F.R. 59.5(a)(1). (emphasis added) That’s right. Look at the conjunctions again. If a woman walks into Planned Parenthood to talk to a taxpayer-funded counselor about the full range of her options, that counselor is required by law to tell her about abortion. But information about the possibility of adoption is optional. Would it surprise you to know Planned Parenthood supported that rule? And if Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer-funded counselors do give a woman information about adoption, what might they tell her? When I last wrote about this topic in 2013 Planned Parenthood’s website included the following information for women about adoption: The psychological responses to abortion are far less serious than those experienced by women bringing their unwanted pregnancy to term and relinquishing the child for adoption. … Women who relinquish their child for adoption are at risk for long-term grief that can have physical, psychological, and relational repercussions. While this response is comparable to that of losing a child through death, the grieving response post-adoption is often more symptomatic and can be chronic in nature. It also instructed that “[r]esearch studies indicate that emotional responses to legally induced abortion are largely positive.”  Since Planned Parenthood’s disturbingly small adoption numbers have received public attention over the last few years, it has now removed that information (and its adoption numbers magically more than doubled), but there is no indication that its counselors have changed their tune on adoption. Between silence and telling women that adoption will be emotionally devastating while abortion is quick and easy, is it any surprise that women listening to Planned Parenthood’s sales pitch/nondirective options counseling almost never choose adoption? Abortion Makes Money; Adoption Doesn’t Planned Parenthood has total annual revenues of roughly $1.3 billion. But its health-center income, the amount its individual affiliates bring in from non-governmental sources for health services, was roughly $305 million in the last fiscal year. Since the Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of Medicaid and other taxpayer funds to pay for most abortions, this should include almost all abortion revenues. Planned Parenthood made $0 from its relative handful of supposed adoption referrals. According to the Guttmacher Institute, an average abortion costs $468. Given Planned Parenthood’s approximately 328,000 abortions, it brought in approximately $153 million from abortion revenues, just over 50 percent of its revenues for non-government paid health services. But however the percentage is calculated, $153 million is a serious revenue stream for any business. On the other hand, Planned Parenthood made $0 from its relative handful of supposed adoption referrals. As former Planned Parenthood director Abby Johnson explains, unlike abortion, adoption is not “revenue generating.” Women Deserve to Know Their Real Options At this point, one might object that it should not be surprising that women going to Planned Parenthood for advice about their pregnancies end up having abortions at such an alarming rate. Despite the organization’s name, its denials of the prominent place of abortion in its revenue stream, and its promises of neutral and unbiased counseling, maybe women do know what they’re getting and come to Planned Parenthood already planning to have an abortion. Maybe the word has gotten out, and women understand that Planned Parenthood is not really an all-options women’s health organization but is instead the world’s leading abortionist. Maybe. But if that is true, why should Title X taxpayer funds intended to help supposedly undecided women know about all of their options be spent on counseling where the outcome is such a fait accompli? Planned Parenthood wants women to believe they only have one option—abortion—and that Planned Parenthood is indispensable. Both benefit its bottom line. Both are lies. Women have much better choices (click for state-level maps!) than what Planned Parenthood is selling. Our taxpayer dollars should stop subsidizing Planned Parenthood’s deceptive sales pitch.

"474",474,"Elizabeth Warren Is Totally Wrong About Planned Parenthood","Peterson","Josiah",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-08-26"," To understand why Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is the unabashed Progressive icon of our day, look to her response to the controversy surrounding Planned Parenthood. Following the series of incriminating videos of Planned Parenthood officials negotiating terms for fetal body parts, few Democrats were eager to come to the organization’s defense. They preferred to ignore the issue, attack the investigators, or speak in terms of government shutdowns and ideological budgeting. Not Warren. She not only defends Planned Parenthood, but goes on the offensive against Republicans with all but the words “war on women.” Her speech on the subject has over 360,000 combined views from two YouTube videos, making it the third-most-popular video on the topic after  Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richard’s official response (450,000 views), and the original Center for Medical Progress videos (15 videos on their channel have a combined 8.4 million views). The speech is rhetorically powerful and warrants a thoughtful response. Warren’s remarks are italicized throughout, my fisking follows.  I come to the Senate floor today to ask my Republican colleagues a question: Do you have any idea what year it is? Did you fall down, hit your head, and think you woke up in the 1950s or 1890s? Should we call for a doctor? Unfortunately for Warren, the three MD’s in the Senate—John Barrasso (R-Wyoming), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky)—are all pro-life Republicans. Of course, Warren is not afraid to speak well of the past when it suits her argument, as when she spoke of the 1960s as a high point for the minimum wage. Her chronological snobbery apparently comes and goes with the issue. Because I simply cannot believe that in the year 2015, the United States Senate would be spending its time trying to defund women’s healthcare centers. This is deliberately misleading, suggesting that all women’s health care faces defunding. The proposed bill explicitly states: “All funds no longer available to Planned Parenthood will continue to be made available to other eligible entities to provide women’s health care services.”  Not only is Planned Parenthood the only organization facing defunding, but the defunding bill redirects all the money that was going to Planned Parenthood to other health-care centers. That means no diminution in overall funding for women’s health care. You know, on second thought, maybe I shouldn’t have been that surprised. The Republicans have had a plan for years to strip away women’s rights to make choices over their own bodies. Republicans promote all kinds of choice, including: school choice, health-care choice, and retirement planning choice. Even their opposition to Planned Parenthood is grounded, at least in part, in the fact that unborn children have no choice in whether they will have their organs harvested. Surely Warren isn’t suggesting that the unborn child is merely an extension of the woman’s body? Surely Warren isn’t suggesting that the unborn child is merely an extension of the woman’s body? In the aforementioned 1890s, there was greater scientific uncertainty about the nature of the unborn child, as Ernst Haeckel was popularizing his drawings of human embryos that looked more like birds and fish than human beings. Now we can look into the womb with 3D ultrasound—or a Planned Parenthood lab dish—and see a unique human life. To imply that the fetus is part of the woman’s body is to say that a woman has two sets of DNA, four arms, four eyes, and, if carrying a male child, well, you know.  Just look at the recent facts. In 2013, Republicans threatened to shut down the government unless they could change the law to let employers deny women access to birth control. First of all, employers can’t deny women access to birth control. It can be found, often without prescription, at any CVS, Walgreens, or even a cheap gas station vending machine, for a couple bucks. But it’s true, Republicans did seek delayed implementation of the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate back in September of 2013, just as they sought to delay implementation of all parts of the ACA that hadn’t kicked in yet. The contraceptives mandate—which included drugs that some consider abortifacients—received special attention as a matter of conscience, as Republicans weren’t sure which way the Supreme Court was going to go with the Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters of the Poor cases. Apparently the Supreme Court thought the Republican concerns were not only reasonable, but constitutionally required. In March of this year, Republicans held up a non-controversial bipartisan bill to stop human trafficking. Why? Because they demanded new anti-abortion restrictions to cover private funding meant to help the victims of human trafficking. Here Warren completely misrepresents what happened. It was the Democrats who held up Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas)’s Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, until they eventually traded it for a vote on attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch. They had no problem with the anti-abortion language in committee, but started an uproar when they “discovered” the language—on pages 4 and 5 of the bill—as it was coming up for a floor vote. The “new anti-abortion restrictions” were standard operating procedures in line with the Hyde Amendment when it first passed back in 1976. And human trafficking? In addition to current concerns that Planned Parenthood is trafficking human body parts, Live Action released a series of videos of Planned Parenthood workers in seven clinics across the country offering to help a pimp procure abortions for his underage sex workers. It’s good to know it’s not just Republicans who struggle to avoid micro-aggressions. In June, House Republicans passed a budget eliminating funding for the Title X Family Planning Program, the only federal grant program that provides birth control, HIV tests, STD screenings, and other preventive services for poor and uninsured people. About a quarter of Title X funding goes to Planned Parenthood. According to the House Appropriations Health and Human Services subcommittee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma), the proposal included: “eliminating funding for HHS Title X Family Planning grants, maintaining full support for community health centers and boosting funding for lifesaving biomedical research.” Was it designed to limit funding to abortion providers? Yes. Was it designed to harm community health centers? No. What does family planning have to do with HIV and STDs? Over the past few years, the Republicans have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times, including the portions that require insurers to cover contraception. Any honest assessment of Republican efforts to repeal ObamaCare admits the primary concern has been government overreach and incompetence. Contraceptives were comparatively low on the list of grievances. And let’s be clear, it’s not just Congress. Over the past five years, Republican state legislators have passed nearly 300 new restrictions on abortion access. This year alone Republican state legislators have passed more than 50 new restrictions on women’s access to legal healthcare. She probably got her statistics from the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, and the numbers are fairly accurate. What she doesn’t mention, probably because it goes against her narrative of inevitable, Progressive enlightenment, is that most of these measures are widely supported by the American people, who’ve always opposed the broad elective-abortions-at-any-stage-of-pregnancy policy imposed by Roe and Doe. So Mr. President—Madame President—let’s be really clear about something. It’s good to know it’s not just Republicans who struggle to avoid micro-aggressions. Apparently a female senator, probably Shelley Moore-Capito (R-West Virginia), was sitting in as president at the time. The Republican scheme to defund Planned Parenthood is not some sort of surprised response to some highly edited video. Why should it be surprising that an industry whose natural byproduct is fetal remains should have no qualms about trying to profit from those remains? While it’s true the popular Center for Medical Progress videos are highly edited, the unedited videos are also available for viewing and aren’t any more exculpating. As for the American people, abortion support peaked in the early 1990s. Nope, the Republican vote to defund Planned Parenthood is just one more piece of a deliberate, methodical, orchestrated, right-wing attack on women’s rights. And I’m sick and tired of it. Women everywhere are sick and tired of it. The American people are sick and tired of it. We’ll have to take her word on whether she is sick and tired of it. I’m sure some women everywhere are tired of it. But the 40 percent of American women who call themselves pro-life might not be, nor almost a third of the women in the Senate, including the bill’s sponsor, Joni Earnst (R-Iowa). As for the American people, abortion support peaked in the early 1990s, and now millennials are more pro-life than any generation but for those over 65 years old. Scheduling this vote during the week of a big Fox News presidential primary debate, days before candidates take trips to Iowa or New Hampshire, isn’t just some clever gimmick. It’s true the issue got a lot of play in the GOP debates, but liberal commentators have welcomed a resurfacing of the “war on women” and have used many of Warren’s arguments in chastising the candidates as being as sexist as Donald Trump. The truly pro-life Republicans were upset with the timing of the bill, having wanted the measure to be attached as an amendment to a “must pass” transportation bill. Proposed as a standalone measure, the bill stood little chance of garnering the 60 required votes to overcome a filibuster. This is an all-out effort to build support to take away a women’s right to control her own body and access to medical care she may need. “Need” is a strong word. If you distinguish abortion—“the purposeful destruction of the unborn child”—from “necessary medical treatments that are carried out to save the life of the mother, even if such treatment results in the loss of life of her unborn child,” then more than 1,000 experienced practitioners and researchers in obstetrics and gynecology affirm that direct abortion is “not medically necessary to save the life of a woman.” You know this affects all of us. Whatever your age, wherever you live, I guarantee that you know someone who has used Planned Parenthood health centers. No one may mention it at Thanksgiving dinner, or post it on Facebook for the whole world to know, but just look at the facts. One in five women in America is a Planned Parenthood patient at least once in her life. Every single year almost 2.7 million women, and men, show up for help at Planned Parenthood. These people apparently have incredibly low requirements for their healthcare provider. These numbers sound like they come from Planned Parenthood at a Glance, which can often be misleading. For one thing, the site says that one in five women has “visited” Planned Parenthood and does not go so far as to say that one in five become “patients.” It’s also unclear whether the 2.7 million showing up for help include repeat visits from the same person. Why do so many people use Planned Parenthood? Because they’re nonprofit and they’re open. These people apparently have incredibly low requirements for their healthcare provider. More than half of Planned Parenthood centers are located in areas without ready access to healthcare. You know, women who can’t get appointments anywhere else go to Planned Parenthood for pap tests and cancer screening. Couples go to Planned Parenthood for STD treatments and pregnancy tests. Young people go to young people for birth control… There are over 4,000 Medicare Certified Rural Health Clinics around the country. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide free or low-cost breast-and cervical-cancer screenings, state health departments provide free cancer screenings, and many community health clinics do, too. There are over 2,500 crisis pregnancy centers, compared to 700 Planned Parenthood affiliates. If areas are truly under-serviced, the $528 million freed up from defunding Planned Parenthood could go to opening new clinics in needy areas. And, as Ross Douthat points out in his New York Times op-ed, there’s no reason all these other services Warren wants to talk about need to be lumped together with an abortion provider. …and yes, 3 percent of patients visit Planned Parenthood for a safe and legal abortion with a doctor who will show compassion and care for a woman who is making one of the most difficult decisions of her entire life. Rich Lowry, writing at National Review, shows how the 3 percent figure comes through counting each service separately. “By Planned Parenthood’s math, a woman who gets an abortion but also a pregnancy test, an STD test, and some contraceptives has received four services, and only 25 percent of them are abortion.” In reality, compared with other services like cancer screenings and Pap tests, abortion comprises almost 30 percent of Planned Parenthood’s activity. Narrowing that to pregnancy services, abortions make up 92 percent compared to prenatal care and adoption services. As for “compassion,” even Richards had to apologize for a staff member who wasn’t being compassionate. Confessions of former employees also don’t bear well on this claim, either, as they describe rushed procedures by stressed-out physicians. Narrowing that to pregnancy services, abortions make up 92 percent compared to prenatal care and adoption services. But just to be clear, even though the abortions performed at Planned Parenthood are safe and legal, the federal government is not paying for any of them. Not one dime. For almost 40 years the federal government has prohibited federal funding for abortions accept for the case of rape, incest, and life endangerment. Most of the money Planned Parenthood receives from the government comes from Medicaid patients for medical care provided to low-income patients, the same payments that any other doctor or clinic receives for providing cancer screenings or other medical exams. The rest of Planned Parenthood’s federal funding comes from Title X, provides [sic] birth control to low-income and uninsured people, the same program House Republicans voted to cut in June. The government doesn’t fund abortions, period. A vote today to defund Planned Parenthood is not a vote to defund abortions, it’s a vote to defund cancer screenings and birth control and basic health care for millions of women. Where to begin? First of all, money is fungible, like when states claim that lottery funds subsidize the education budget then cut the original funding for education, Planned Parenthood can take funds received for non-abortion services and administration and cross-fund its abortion activities. The government gave Planned Parenthood $528 million dollars per year, more than 40 percent of its budget. This would explain why Planned Parenthood has been willing to spend almost $7 million in lobbying efforts in the past five years. But even if, by some miracle of accounting, no federal monies were going to directly pay for Planned Parenthood’s abortion activities, the federal government ought not be obliged to fund a company suspected of illegal activity. It’s as if Warren were suggesting that the government would have to keep funding a medical center known to be a front for the mafia or a drug cartel, simply because some of the services they provided were actually legal. If there is legal difficulty about this, adjusting the laws to remove the difficulties would be warranted. I want to say to my Republican colleagues, the year is 2015, not 1955, and not 1895. Women have lived through a world where backward-looking ideologues tried to interfere with the basic health decisions made by a woman and her doctor, and we are not going back, not now, not ever. The Republican plan to defund Planned Parenthood is a Republican plan to defund women’s health care for my daughter, for my granddaughters, for people all across Massachusetts and all across this country. I stand with Planned Parenthood and I hope my colleagues will do the same. Thank you, Madame President, I yield. Warren is desperate to link America’s leading abortion provider to uncontroversial medical services to defend them against a contrived war on women, but the logic and facts simply don’t support her argument.

"476",476,"Our ‘Devoutly Catholic’ President Is Neither Devout Nor Really Catholic","Busek","Robert",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-08"," Last week, President Biden vigorously defended allowing women to kill their inconvenient unborn children by denouncing the U.S. Supreme Court’s 5-4 refusal to block Texas’s abortion law from going into effect. He went on to accuse the court majority of fomenting “unconstitutional chaos” and to promise his administration would initiate a “whole of government” response to the Texas law. It’s remarkable that “Sleepy Joe” has worked himself up into such a lather over this. Other concerns might more legitimately qualify for a “whole of government” response, such as his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan or the ongoing crisis at the U.S. outhern border. If nothing else, Biden’s passion for the legalized murder of innocent children reveals his “devout Catholicism” is a cynical sham.  Abortion and Catholicism Cannot Mix Despite what some modern commentators claim, the Catholic Church’s opposition to abortion has been consistent from its very beginnings. The “Didache,” a first-century Christian instructional text, specifically states “you shall not murder a child by abortion nor kill that which is begotten.” This teaching distinguished Christianity from the pagan culture that surrounded it, a culture that cruelly embraced both abortion and infant exposure as legitimate methods of population control. Based on this and other texts from scripture and sacred tradition, the “Catechism of the Catholic Church” condemns abortion in no uncertain terms, calling it “gravely contrary to the moral law.” Indeed, the willful murder of the unborn is not only a mortal sin but a serious crime in the eyes of canon law. Based on Canon 1398 of the Code of Canon Law, anyone who procures an abortion or formally cooperates with the procurement of an abortion is subject to excommunication latae sententiae, or “by the very commission of the offense.” “Formal cooperation,” however, is usually narrowly defined by canonists to include only those directly involved in the abortion process, most notably the mother seeking the abortion and the doctor performing it. This creates a loophole for Catholic politicians who support abortion since, legally speaking, they only “materially cooperate” with the barbaric practice by supporting its legality, expanding its scope, and (in many cases) seeking to fund it through taxpayer efforts. Such legalistic double-speak allows leaders like President Biden to paper over their moral hypocrisy so they can identify as “pro-choice” while “personally opposing” abortion. Biden’s Cooperation With the Culture of Death By any objective standard, the president’s material cooperation with this grave evil has gone above and beyond that of previous Catholic Democrats, showing that his “personal opposition” to abortion is hollow at best. After supporting the Hyde Amendment for decades both as a senator and as vice president, he reversed course in 2019 knowing that he needed to call for federal funding for abortion (a policy that a majority of Americans oppose) in order to curry favor with the radicals who now control his party.  Almost as soon as he took the oath of office, President Biden reassured those radicals of the sincerity of his conversion by rescinding the expanded version of the “Mexico City Policy” put in place by President Trump. In last week’s speech attacking the Supreme Court, he revealed that he doesn’t believe human life begins at conception, a convenient flip-flop from the position he took in a 2015 interview with the Jesuit magazine America. His promised “whole of government” response to the Texas law is yet another sign of his “evolution” away from the “safe, legal and rare” thinking of the Clinton era and towards the “shout your abortion” approach now favored by Democrat thought leaders. President Biden gave no details about what his administration’s response to the Texas law would actually look like, but given his authoritarianism in other areas of public policy, we can expect something more substantial than a mere amicus brief when it is challenged in court. Since the Texas law went into effect on September 1, leftists have stepped up their calls to enshrine abortion in federal law, a move the president has said he supports. Biden might go even further to protect legalized child murder by attempting to pack the Supreme Court with leftist justices, a strategy that he conspicuously dodged questions about during his campaign. Either of these paths would certainly cement his legacy as the most pro-abortion president in American history. At Whose Altar Does President Biden Kneel? Despite all this evidence to the contrary, Biden’s allies in the corporate media continue to tout his religious bona fides whenever and wherever possible. Yet their efforts betray their fundamental misunderstanding of how Catholic doctrine works. “Cafeteria Catholicism,” although certainly popular nowadays, effectively makes all the moral teachings of the church optional, even those that have been part of the faith since its very beginning.  In clearly and consistently advocating the mortal sin of abortion, President Biden has, in the words of St. Thomas Aquinas, “[failed] in his choice of those things wherein he assents to Christ, because he chooses not what Christ really taught, but the suggestions of his own mind,” deifying himself and his individual will. Although Biden may technically remain a Catholic through his baptism and confirmation, one cannot serve both God and Moloch. Obviously, the president has made his choice. In July, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced its intention to issue a teaching letter on the centrality of the Eucharist in the life of the church. Predictably, Catholic Democrats rose up in arms, fearing they might finally be held spiritually accountable for supporting abortion. As the bishops formulate this letter (which is expected in November), they should remember that our country’s most prominent “devout Catholic” is really anything but.

"477",477,"Cecile Richards ‘Made Trouble,’ Alright: For Millions Of Babies, Their Mothers, And Our Humanity","Hawkins","Kristan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018-04-03"," Cecile Richards departs from Planned Parenthood with a bloody resume, a diminished business model, and the primary skills of promoting abortion while skillfully maneuvering politicians to advance her cause. As she launches her book tour for “Make Trouble,” her new book, she leaves a troubled organization just as the Department of Justice undertakes a long overdue investigation of Planned Parenthood’s handling of the sale and distribution of pre-born baby body parts. While masquerading as an advocate for a health-care provider, Richards’ Planned Parenthood model made abortion the non-negotiable part of its deadly business. That came at a cost.  Her transformation of Planned Parenthood morphed the abortion mega vendor from one hawking “choice” to one committed to coercion, advocating for the force of law against those who do not share her cavalier attitude toward life in the womb. While a pleasant face in the media, the policies Richards advocated stripped away the veneer of civil engagement, going instead for political power and predatory practices keeping everyone—from nuns to private business people—in business with her deadly industry. A Legacy of Profiteering Off Death According to Planned Parenthood’s own annual reports, under Richards 3.5 million children died unspeakably cruel deaths in barbaric acts of abortion. In fact, during her tenure, she increased Planned Parenthood’s abortion business by more than 10 percent. Some of these children’s bodies were then dissected for saleable parts. Planned Parenthood representatives haggled over prices for livers and brains. Planned Parenthood’s abortions skyrocketed under Richards as health services and the organization’s number of total clients plummeted year after year. Richards was a grassroots organizer before taking charge of Planned Parenthood. In public appearances, Richards unflinchingly trots out talking points about serving low-income communities and providing affordable health care. But Richards’ actions tell a very different story, a story of radical abortion zeal driven by an insatiable desire to profit, no matter what, especially from taxpayer support.  Richards reaped the rewards of more than half-a-billion dollars annually in taxpayer largess, made possible in part by cozy relationships with those holding Uncle Sam’s purse strings. To this end, Planned Parenthood’s political arm—also run by Richards—dumped $30 million into Hillary Clinton’s woeful presidential bid. In return, the once relatively moderate Clinton touted Planned Parenthood’s fringe talking points on the campaign trail, defending abortion until the moment of birth, poo-pooing any suggestion of abortion restrictions, and sitting shoulder to shoulder with Richards. On Election Day, the most-Googled query about Clinton’s positions was related to her abortion stance. Given Richards’ highly publicized position as a Democrat Party darling during the 2016 election cycle, Richards may have a lot more to do with voters rejecting Clinton than the mainstream media have acknowledged. Now aligned with Richards’ radical stance, Democrats are caught in a PR nightmare with their grotesque beliefs on full and intractable display. These out-of-touch views came to a head during the recent vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a piece of legislation the vast majority of Americans support but almost every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate voted against. Planned Parenthood’s entanglement with the Democratic Party has done little to bolster the faction’s popularity ahead of the 2018 election cycle. Abortion Quotas, Not Impartial Review of Clients’ Interest During her tenure at Planned Parenthood, Richards’ salary reached more than $590,000. Not surprisingly, during that same time, Richards mandated that all affiliates must commit abortions—Planned Parenthood’s big-ticket offering—and the abortion behemoth was even caught enforcing abortion quotas on affiliates. Staff have reported being rewarded with pizza parties and personal time off for meeting these quotas. Yet clinics closed and patients choose other care.  Before Richards, Planned Parenthood saw about 3 million clients a year. Today, the abortion giant does many more abortions than ever, but sees only 2.4 million clients total. Under Richards, its own client base has rejected Planned Parenthood. It’s interesting to note the declining popularity of Planned Parenthood among the Pro-Life Generation, who are actually more pro-life than their parents’ generation. For example, in its recent annual report, Planned Parenthood bragged about starting 50 new campus groups, while the organization I lead, Students for Life of America, started nearly 120 last year, and now has more than 1,200 student groups on campuses in all 50 states. Planned Parenthood reported training 750 young activists from 11 cities, while we at SFLA trained nearly 11,000 students from across the country. In fact, in our national training conference in Washington DC last month, we trained almost three times as many students in a day as Planned Parenthood trained in a year. But for a picture worth a thousand words, consider the youth and vibrant culture on full display at the March for Life compared to the tired Women’s March. While the abortion industry’s vacant rhetoric was on full display, in the Women’s March’s premier event in Las Vegas attendees mourned the lack of millennial faces, noting the crowd was made up of “women of a certain age.” Wherever she goes next, Richards takes with her a legacy of orchestrating extreme advocacy for abortion at a time in which polling indicates more than 3 out of 4 Americans want to limit abortion to the first trimester. Still, she prepares to bring her brand of abortion politics to the campaign trail, having announced her intentions to be politically visible leading up to the midterm elections. When you consider the severe losses the Democratic Party experienced during the time in which it fully embraced a Richards-like agenda—losing more than 1,030 elected seats since 2008—the question is, will she bring political poison to the grassroots given her out-of-the-mainstream abortion positions? Officeholders and organizations should keep that in mind before associating with a woman whose draconian worldview is at odds with nearly the entire American population.

"478",478,"In An Ectopic Pregnancy, It’s Medical Malpractice Not To Save The Mother’s Life By Removing The Baby","Surburg","Matthew",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-09-12"," The author is a family physician who spent eight years in obstetrics. Georgi Boorman’s article from Sept. 9, “Is Abortion Really Necessary For Treating Ectopic Pregnancies?” is laudable for her willingness to take a hard look at what might otherwise be an unexamined assumption. However, the conclusion she draws is not supported by the evidence, even as presented in her own article. Before responding, it’s important we establish several key points of common ground.  First, abortion is wrong. The fact that we allow children to be slaughtered by the millions for the cause of “choice” is a mark of shame upon our nation and  culture. While mothers who are dealing with unexpected pregnancies need our support, the fact that we, as a society, countenance the wholesale murder of children when they are inconvenient is unconscionable. As a nation, the United States has committed her share of grave sins, but in terms of scale — how exactly does one quantify human suffering? — it would be roughly on the order of slavery (although I pray it won’t last as long as that evil institution did). These and other historical wrongs are not unique to America, of course, but we must be willing to acknowledge and confront our national offenses without sugar-coating them. Second, medicine is a changing field. As one of my senior residents when I was a still-green, first-year resident, joked, “Truth changes.” The oral polio vaccine was superior to the injection Jonas Salk developed because even though it caused a few cases of polio, it prevented more than it caused — until polio became so rare, the oral vaccine was causing more cases than it prevented. Today, then, all polio vaccines in the United Sates are injected. Inhaled steroids were considered the best early treatment for chronic lung disease for years. In 2017, however, the internationally respected GOLD guidelines pointed out that, no, the data shows they should be used no earlier than third- or fourth-line.  There is a vigorous debate about the merits of universal screening for prostate cancer with the PSA (prostate specific antigen) test, due to questions about whether it affects rates of prostate cancer deaths (as opposed to more focused testing). In medicine, as in many other fields, the only constant is change. Third, if it is at all possible to save both pregnant mothers and their children, we should. Nobody who believes in pro-life principles wants to see children die needlessly. Before we go further, we must also define some terms. An abortion is the term for any time a child dies before delivery. If the child died of natural causes, this is a spontaneous abortion, also known as a miscarriage. (This has led to heartbreaking misunderstandings for mothers who received emergency treatment for a miscarriage, only to learn later that their condition was diagnosed as an “abortion.”) Other subcategories — threatened abortion, incomplete abortion, missed abortion — are beyond the scope of this discussion. This is, of course, distinct from an elective abortion, which is when a child is actively killed for any reason other than to preserve the life of the mother. An abortion that is performed explicitly to save the life of the mother is a therapeutic abortion. Yes, to pro-life ears this sounds like a fingernails-on-chalkboard oxymoron, but that is the technical term.  Boorman’s Data Is Problematic Now, to address Boorman’s article. She begins by introducing her topic and stating the perspective she plans to critique. She then cites a 2017 report in Obstetrics and Gynecology that between 2011 and 2013, 54 maternal deaths occurred from ectopic pregnancy. She then calculates a 0.023 percent death rate from ectopic pregnancies. To do this, she takes the figure of 11,838,612 total pregnancies (supplied in her footnote), multiplies it by 2 percent as the percentage of ectopic pregnancies, and divides this number (236,772.2) into the 54 reported deaths, supplying the number of 0.023 percent. Here’s the problem: What she has calculated is not the rate of death from all ectopic pregnancies. It’s the rate of maternal death from ectopic pregnancies with current treatment. As she notes, the doesn’t tell us “what the rate would be if abortion weren’t employed.” This is a critical distinction, as we will see. She also says it would help to have further data to clarify why the deaths occurred, citing delayed treatment and misdiagnosis as two possibilities. However, this is beside the point. When a mother dies from an ectopic pregnancy, it was the ectopic pregnancy that killed her, not a delay in treatment. Just as if a patient were to die from a missed heart attack, the physician who missed it might be preparing for a discussion with his malpractice attorney, but it was still the heart attack that killed the patient. She discusses autotransfusion (“suctioning out the hemorrhaged blood, filtering it, and reinserting it via IV”) as an option that can prevent maternal death if employed in a timely manner. This is certainly an option worth considering, but to offer it as the best alternative to abortion is not responsible. The study she cites showed a single death out of 632 cases. Unfortunately, if a study is investigating a particular undesirable outcome and there is only a single instance of that outcome, this means the study was too small to achieve statistical power. Interestingly, if we apply the 0.023 percent rate she cited earlier to the 632 patients in this study, we have a fatality rate not of 1 but of 0.144. Boorman’s numbers suggest that with a therapeutic abortion, that one patient need not have died. That’s another reason to suspect her calculation is off. Look at it another way: How many medical interventions are there in which it would be considered acceptable to allow one out of every 600 patients to die? Promoting Unnecessary Fatalities Two other problems arise with using this study to argue against therapeutic abortion to save a mother’s life. One is that there is no mention of a control group. A study without a control group really doesn’t provide any useful information. The second is a little more complex. While the study is too small to be statistically valid, let’s use it for the sake of argument. One out of 632, as Boorman points out, gives a maternal fatality rate of 0.16 percent. If we apply this to the 2 percent of pregnancies mentioned earlier (approximately 236,772), this yields 374.6. In other words, according to Boorman’s own numbers, using autotransfusion for every mother with an ectopic pregnancy between 2011 and 2013 would have yielded not 54, but 374 maternal fatalities. That’s 320 women who would have died unnecessarily. She notes that some also cite concern for fallopian tube damage and future fertility as a reason to abort in an ectopic pregnancy. I cannot speak to those for whom this is a driving concern, but for me, saving the life of the mother is paramount. Might the child in the ectopic pregnancy die anyway, and there be no need for an active intervention to abort? He might. Boorman’s data says that in one sample, between 47 and 82 percent died spontaneously. That means that between 18 and 53 percent continued to grow, potentially threatening the life of the mother. This is unacceptable. This is not simply a case of “Doctors don’t want to be sued for malpractice if a pregnancy develops complications.” To wait for a life-threatening hemorrhage because you want to see whether a condition will resolve on its own is malpractice. The Shortcomings of Current Technology What about the child? Boorman cites several reports spanning multiple decades with one example, which she admits is questionable, going all the way back to 1917. In doing so, she inadvertently highlights the problem with these anecdotal reports: They are so incredibly rare as to be nigh unto miraculous when they occur. If there were evidence that these are not rare, then that would be another matter and worthy of serious reexamination. I am aware of no such evidence, however. To rely on these cases to inform medical care, without statistical evidence to back it up, is wishful thinking. One instance Boorman cites, Heidi and Halle, represents a special case: the heterotopic pregnancy. In these cases (rare, but they happen), twins are conceived, but only one implants in the uterus, while the other implants in the fallopian tube. With current technology, the only way to save the the mother and the child in the uterus is to remove the other one. Or, rather than shy away from it, we should call the thing what it is: The only way to save two lives is to kill one. Sometimes, you don’t get any good choices; you just have to pick the least awful one. Now, make no mistake: If a technique for transferring a viable embryo from the fallopian tube (or elsewhere) to the uterus were to be developed, this would be a godsend. I pray such a thing would come to pass — without a 1-in-600 chance of killing both mother and child — because it would have profound implications for early pregnancy care. However, what can be explored in research medical centers with highly skilled surgeons, obstetrical nurses, neonatologists, and the dizzying array of skill sets that extremely specialized care involves is starkly different from what is the standard of care out on the front lines. Save the Life You Can Save The weakest line in Boorman’s argument is this: “Take note: This near-universal refusal to save tiny lives is a consequence of legal abortion, which promotes the idea that only one patient’s welfare – the larger, older one – must be considered when her health is at risk.” The glib dismissal of medical professionals, some of whom are among the most fiercely pro-life people I know, is disappointing coming from a writer as skilled and sensitive as Boorman. The sad fact is that with the current state of medical technology, in an ectopic pregnancy, nothing can save the life of that child. Nothing. To focus on the life of the mother is not to say she is more important than the child she carries. The better understanding is that of triage: You save the life you can save. You don’t have to like it, but when you are faced with a choice between one death and two, you do what you can to make it one. Boorman’s final assertion, that abortion is never the answer, is difficult to address because in just about any other conceivable instance, I would agree with her. However, there are other occasions in which a behavior may be prohibited in the vast majority of circumstances but allowed under very limited conditions. It’s wrong to ask a person to take off all her clothes and lie down on a table, and then cut her open – but that is a surgeon’s job. I cannot take a drill to someone’s mouth – but my dentist can. Likewise, to kill the child growing inside a mother is wrong – unless it is the only way to save the mother from significant risk of death. Boorman is to be applauded for asking a tough question, and for challenging the status quo. However, as a closer look at her own numbers demonstrates, when the question is whether abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother with an ectopic pregnancy, the answer, sadly, is yes. This article offers no medical advice for specific cases; in such circumstances, always consult your doctor.

"479",479,"It’s Time For Pro-Lifers To Realize They’re Losing","Kilgore","Bill",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-01-31"," When is it time to question the power of the pro-life movement? This week the state of New York passed a law that will mean babies can be killed up to the moment of birth. Babies that feel pain, cry, and could easily survive outside the womb will be brutally killed, chopped up, and sucked out like pieces of meat. Vermont is considering a similar bill. So is Virginia. Meanwhile, the annual March for Life had a huge turnout this year, estimated to be as high as 300,000 people. How do these two things go together? Perhaps big marches are not a sign of success.  A New York book store owner, who became somewhat famous after he shut down his store in protest of the new abortion law, put it this way: “When intense pro-life involvement is defined by going to an annual pep rally or giving five bucks to a pro-life lobbyist at a Sanctity of Life Sunday, it’s not surprising that someone hanging a sign in his window, turning off the lights and going home is viewed as heroic.” The pro-life movement has too much bark and no bite, too much signal and too little virtue. It takes participation in a march as more significant than legal victories ending abortion. The simple truth is that the pro-life movement is stagnant, dominated by an uncritical and defeatist attitude. It needs some new life. A friend who worked for a pro-life organization very much in the “the movement” confirms this. He became frustrated that people there ignore the evidence in front of them, and instead show excitement about the size of the marches, acting “as if our country is turning a corner and is getting closer and closer to life.” Meanwhile, they react more strongly to those who challenge their approved legal tactics or rhetoric than they do actual political defeats, as if questioning the success of the movement is some sort of heresy. Attitudes like this indicate that people in a group aren’t reflecting on their strategy honestly or taking a critical eye of what they have actually achieved. Successful organizations have ways to examine closely and honestly if they are achieving their goals. As Winston Churchill once said, “However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.” But how is the pro-life movement doing?  What Even Are Pro-Lifers’ Goals? To evaluate success, we would first have to agree on the aim. But what is the pro-life movement trying to achieve? Are we trying to end legal abortion any time soon? If so, abortion is still legal everywhere before 20 weeks. Many states allow it after that. New York and soon Vermont allow it until birth. Some success. Believing we will never end abortion in our time, are we simply trying to restrict it more? I could list all of the supposed successes in places like Alabama, West Virginia, or Texas, but it would be misleading. Every law meant to restrict it in any way, big or small, is failing in the courts, even in Texas, if it even gets that far. People in the pro-life movement seem to have few practical answers for what to do about activist judges. Meanwhile, supposedly pro-life Gov. John Kasich wouldn’t even sign a heartbeat bill in Ohio because he was confident it would fail and defending it will cost too much money. Too much money—let that sink in. Kasich is right, however: the bill will be challenged in the courts and there pro-lifers will let it die. Many people in the pro-life movement have stopped trying even to eliminate abortion, instead settling for mere restrictions. As a result, blue states are expanding access to abortion and red states, where pro-lifers supposedly dominate, can’t even restrict it if the baby has a detectable heartbeat.  Are we trying to maneuver toward some viable legal challenge to Roe v. Wade? If so, that isn’t working either. Every half measure is passed under the pretense that babies are not individuals with a right to life at conception. Each law that merely restricts abortion grants that women do have some right to choose death. And each law that is successfully challenged adds to the body of legal precedence that must be overcome. Each year that goes by establishes Roe v. Wade more. Each pro-choice law that passes in blue states makes undoing their legal work harder. No, This Isn’t the Most Pro-Life Generation Ever Are we trying to change public opinion to be against abortion? The tide isn’t turning in public opinion. No matter how successful the pro-life movement is in inspiring people to attend the March for Life, no matter how much we declare that this, this is the pro-life generation, nearly 60 percent of people nationwide support keeping abortion legal. This is no change from 1995—after 20 years of marches and movement. Are we trying to make pro-choice advocates less radical? That isn’t working either. Having dropped any pretense about being hospitable to pro-life people, Democrats are now unfettered to pursue their pro-abortion agenda with impunity. In the face of more and more science making the humanity of unborn children undeniable, the pro-abortion crowd has taken a hard left turn and shed any pretense that this is about anything but women’s liberation from nature. They openly celebrate killing babies for convenience. Are we trying to reduce abortions generally? There is some success there: “approximately 882,000 abortions took place in the United States in 2017—down from approximately 885,000 abortions in 2016 and 913,000 abortions in 2015.” Except it isn’t clear that this shift by 30,000 babies is a result of the pro-life movement or if it is just because people are no longer bothering to get pregnant. Thirty thousand babies saved is something in which to rejoice, but it pales in comparison to 882,000 killed. So in all only 50 or 60 million babies have been killed in the womb since Roe v. Wade, and each year close to a million more are added to the body count. There is no end to the slaughter anywhere in sight. Is that success? Don’t Believe Your Bleeding Eyes Despite all of this lack of tangible success, many in the pro-life movement insist it is succeeding. It is as if they no longer believe they can win the argument that abortion should be illegal, and so they shift the goal posts to merely “limiting abortion.” In this way, pro-life leaders seem to think they can show that they are winning the argument. People who argue we ought to stand firm on our convictions and not settle are deemed idealistic, as if ending abortion any time soon is unrealistic. If I were cynical, I might say pro-life organizations have a good business model. Are they interested in winning the argument and rendering themselves unnecessary? Are they trying to win the argument for life? How could we tell, given their track record? It is as if the pro-life movement lacks, well, life. It is as if many pro-lifers have accepted defeat and no longer believe in even the justice of their cause. They say they do, to be sure. The individual right to life is the cornerstone of the movement, they say. But like movement conservatism, the people in the pro-life movement appear to have become too comfortable in their role as beautiful losers, happy to pat themselves on the back for their moral purity while failing to question methods that have so far been shown rather ineffective. A Culture of Life Is Still Distant It is as if the pro-life movement has joined the rest of the let’s pretend world, meant in the way of the old Russian political joke: “We pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us.” People in the pro-life movement pretend to move, and abortion activists pretend to be concerned about it. Perhaps this is too uncharitable, and I am sure many pro-life people in pro-life organizations mean well. I know some of them and they do. But I am also frustrated, and I wonder if others are too. We are not moving toward a culture of life without abortion for convenience. In a time when slavery, something very similar to abortion, was the question of the day, President Lincoln told Congress, “The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise — with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.” It’s time for people to examine the pro-life movement closely and honestly. We need a change, and we need to be more than pro-life in name only. It’s time to actually fight for the unborn, instead of just saying we’re fighting.

"480",480,"New-Wave Feminists Are Pro-Life Advocates’ Future","Marcus","David",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-06-08"," The pro-life movement has always been a grassroots operation, a fact that too often gets lost in the culture wars. But on a recent night in a church basement in New York City, the real nature of the movement was on display. “Expect,” a new initiative from Human Life Review, hosted an evening with the New Wave Feminists. In a room filled mainly with young, hopeful fans of the latter, a torch of life was being passed. Human Life Review began in 1974 in the wake of Roe v. Wade. It is an academic journal dedicated to issues of life, including, among others, abortion, euthanasia, and genetic engineering. William F. Buckley called the publication “simply the locus of civilized discussion about abortion.” Founded by the late James P. McFadden, the Review is now edited by his daughter, Maria McFadden Maffucci.  This effort to pass the movement along led to the “Expect” initiative, ably directed by Ifeoma Anunkor. For its first event, “Expect” invited the New Wave Feminists to speak. They could hardly have made a better choice. Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa and Kristen Hatten, who comprise the New Wave Feminists, present a fresh approach to pro-life issues. Focused as much on women as fetuses, they use humor and classic ideals of feminism to fight for a culture of life. The Need for Joy When introducing the New Wave Feminists, Maffucci described becoming aware of them at a particularly dark time. It was last year, as David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress were releasing their videos of Planned Parenthood negotiations for the prices of fetal body parts. Amidst the despair she and her pro-life community were feeling, a ray of light appeared. Somebody shared with her a video from the New Wave Feminists that poked fun at Planned Parenthood. It was a much-needed escape, a moment of joy.
After everyone enjoyed their very appropriate Chick-fil-A box lunches, Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, who sports a shock of magenta hair, took the stage to talk about the mission of NWF and how their approach differs from more traditional pro-life activism. Perhaps the most important and novel aspect of this approach is focusing both on mother and child. Feminism and Abortion Her remarks began much the way many feminist critiques of modern culture do, with a focus of the hyper-sexualization of the female form. But this went well beyond the dangers of unrealistic body images. The deeper point was that abortion plays a critical role in defining women’s current sexual mores and practices. When Cosmopolitan magazine tells women their primary value lies in having sex with men, they are feeding the abortion industry. When the feminist Left tells women that a fetus is just a clump of cells with no value, it feeds the idea that sex is a hobby with no attendant responsibilities. Herndon-De La Rosa went on to argue that the acceptance and availability of abortion divorces sex from relationships. She told stories of young women who never had a boyfriend, but had multiple sex partners. These young women knew something was missing, and far too many young men are willing to take advantage of this attitude for their own pleasure without any responsibilities.  In the darkest moments of her presentation, she challenged the idea that abortion is always a woman’s choice. Coerced abortion, in which a man forcefully urges and pays for an abortion for a woman who is not sure what to do, is very common. This belies the notion that when we are talking about abortion we are always talking about “choice.” In the worst scenarios, victims of rape and even child molestation are given abortions to protect their abusers. Left-wing feminism, always eager to worship at the altar of abortion, fails women by refusing to grapple with these issues. In reclaiming the term “feminism,” NWF is taking the fight to pro-abortion advocates on their own terms. This approach, now widely being used by young conservatives (who were often raised with liberal orthodoxy) on many fronts is effective because it turns the tables on the Left and shows how wanting their theories really are. The New Way to Fight Abortion Kristen Hatten went on to explain how the new pro-life movement must fight abortion. She told of a rally in Texas, where NWF is based (both women have tattoos of Texas on their arms). Thousands of pro-life demonstrators were marching. Hatten saw one person holding a graphic and troubling sign that featured a bloody fetus on a crucifix. She jokingly told a friend, “That’s the picture that will be in the paper tomorrow.” She was right. Not only did the paper vastly underestimate the size of the crowd, they chose the most offensive image possible to portray the protestors. The point of the story is that the pro-life movement badly needs an image makeover. The typical older man holding up bloody pictures and screaming at women entering clinics is a dead end. NWF’s project, she said, was about branding and optics. She urged her fellow activists not to be that person, but rather to be happy warriors who celebrate life.  This, Hatten explained, is also where humor comes in. Abortion isn’t an issue that one tends to associate with big laughs, but satire is potent weapon. Humor allows the mind to relax and take in important ideas with a smile. One NWF video comparing Planned Parenthood to Joseph Mengele shows this perfectly. The gallows humor works, and far from minimizing the horror of destroying human lives, it betrays its grotesque nature. It’s a tool as old as Jonathan Swift. These Are the Activists We Need As I walked into the mild Manhattan night in the shadow of the United Nations after the event, I decided the New Wave Feminists were the most effective pro-life advocates I had ever seen. Human Life Review’s “Expect” initiative could scarcely have chosen a better program for the young crowd of pro-life men and women. The speakers, all of them women, were pointing in a new direction worth following. The good news is that the New Wave Feminists are attracting a following. They are regular speakers on college campuses. Unlike so many right-wing figures looking for a fight and a dis-invitation, they meet more cordial receptions. Both women told stories of changing minds. The event took place on the same day that Oklahoma’s legislature passed a bill (since vetoed) that would have made it a felony to perform an abortion. I asked each of the women who spoke what their feelings were about it. All of them seemed a bit confused, if not dismayed. After all, the law had little chance of ever being enforced. But more importantly, as the New Wave Feminists pointed out to me, abortion cannot be legislated away. It must end through a change in our culture. This is not to say that the pro-life movement should abandon the long slog of trying to overturn Roe v. Wade; that remains a noble fight. But it is to say that absent legislative avenues those who cherish lives can still save them through activism and advocacy. I urge everyone who abhors the practice of abortion to put the New Wave Feminists on their radar, share their work with others, and internalize their life-affirming and joyous message.

"481",481,"Supreme Court May Allow Mothers To Kill Babies For Being Disabled Or A Girl","Newkirk","Seth",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019-01-09"," On Friday, the Supreme Court delayed its consideration of a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision that struck down two Indiana abortion statutes. The first banned abortions that take place as a result of the child’s race, sex, or disability. The second mandates that the remains of unborn children be buried or cremated. This decision comes hard on the heels on the failure of a Republican-controlled federal government to take any action towards limiting abortion in the United States. Even Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, escaped unscathed, maintaining their government funding.  The Seventh Circuit’s rejection is even more frustrating considering the role abortion has played in legitimizing eugenics in both the United States and Europe. Such a resurgence is most notable in the plight of people with Down Syndrome. In Iceland, for example, every single mother with an unborn baby diagnosed with Down decided to end the pregnancy. Only two to three babies with Down are born in the country every year. The small island nation is far from alone in this regard. In Denmark, 98 percent of women choose abortion when they discover their child has Down Syndrome, and the issue is replicated at somewhat lower levels across Europe. In the United States, a smaller number of unborn babies diagnosed with Down are aborted compared to these countries, but our numbers are still unforgivably high. The best estimates claim abortion after prenatal diagnosis has reduced the total U.S. Down population by around 30 percent, a staggering amount. The first statute in the lawsuit would have banned this type of abortion. No longer would mothers be allowed to remove their children from the gene pool merely because they see their children as less desirable than they might have been without such a “defect.” The statute does not prohibit mothers from aborting disabled children for reasons other than their disability.  To understand why such a statute is necessary, it is important to understand what factors have led to the resurgence of eugenics in the West. Predominantly three have contributed to this tragedy. First: the legalization of abortion. The justifications for abortion provide mothers with a period of time when their unborn child is not considered human. If they decide the child is undesirable for any chosen reason, they may terminate it. Secondly, advancements in prenatal testing have led to increasingly reliable, simple, and accurate tests. The development of the noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), for example, has made prenatal diagnoses for a variety of disorders more accurate, less intimidating for the mother, and less dangerous for the baby. Lastly, cultural or social norms judge the desirability of the unborn based on the presence or absence of certain traits. A society must decide, or come to the conclusion, that human beings with Down Syndrome are either less desirable for parents or have a lower quality of life than if they had been born without a disorder. These three factors blend into one morally twisted cocktail. It allows individuals the ability to identify eliminate “undesirable” babies before they can be born. Eliminating children who are judged to be undesirable because of their genes is nothing short of eugenics, which simply means “purifying” the genetic pool.  Although medical technology and cultural norms both contribute to this reincarnation of eugenics, abortion is the lynchpin upon which the entire perversion exists. Dehumanizing any group of human beings never fails to bring immoral and unfair treatment to that group. If the baby is nothing more than another organ or clump of cells, then the decision of whether the unborn fetus has a future existence worth living becomes a commonplace decision with no serious moral weight. The treatment of babies with Down has proven to be no exception. Neither is this new iteration of eugenics limited to only unborn babies with Down Syndrome. Take, for example, how abortion has artificially created an overpopulation of men in China. Abortion is legal and, in some cases, mandated in China. Ultrasound tests allow parents to identify whether their unborn babies were desirable or undesirable, meaning male or female. The combination of China’s One Child Policy and the desirability of a male heir in Chinese culture meant that unborn women were aborted in order to produce more valuable male heirs. The result: a massive imbalance between the ratio of men and women in China. It is predicted that by 2020, there will be 30 million more men than women in the 20- to 48-year-old age range in the country, according to The Guardian. The same article referenced above cited a study conducted by a Chinese union which found that 70 percent of construction workers claimed “emotional loneliness [was] the most painful aspect of their lives.” Imbalance between the two sexes in China has led to a massive number of single men, unable to find a romantic partner. In short, the same three factors wiping out the Down population in the West created a massive imbalance between the two sexes in China. This behavior is by no means a fluke regarding abortion. It is a feature. It is morally unacceptable to claim that either women or people with Down Syndrome are less valuable than men or people without Down. Our country’s founding creed says “all men are created equal.” We claim to believe all people should be provided equality of opportunity, but those who are currently judged to be inferior in some way are never even given the opportunity to be born. Reintroducing genetic “purification” to modern society reveals the inherent problems with abortion: abortion dehumanizes the most vulnerable and pretends we can judge the unborn as unworthy of life based on arbitrary parameters. Parameters such as genetic makeup, sex, disability, or even convenience have become legitimate measures of worth in the age of abortion. If the Supreme Court ultimately declines the case, it would be another failure on the road to ending the injustices abortion perpetuates. Again, we show our inability to protect the most vulnerable among us. These types of decisions only perpetuate what will one day be seen as the one of greatest of American injustices. This article originally said the Supreme Court declined to consider the Seventh Circuit’s decision. Instead, the high court delayed its decision on whether it will accept the case. The article has accordingly been corrected. ","https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/09/supreme-court-allows-mothers-kill-babies-disabled-girl/",1,0,"male",2012,2012
"482",482,"Are There Reasons Why A Woman Shouldn’t Be Permitted To Abort?","Peace","Madison",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014-04-29"," Last week, 23-year-old British glamour model/call girl/tabloid queen Josie Cunningham announced that she was planning to have an abortion. Considering her circumstances, her decision shouldn’t seem all that peculiar. She works as a call girl at Leeds, doesn’t know who the father is (either a professional footballer or a surgeon she had as a client), and already has two young sons. These are all reasons, unfortunately, that a woman might choose to exercise her “reproductive rights.” What is unusual is that back in January, Cunningham was “thrilled” to be three months pregnant, bragging that she was getting a host of free dental work done (an NHS entitlement for expectant mothers), and saying that her “baby comes first.”  Why the sudden switch? Cunningham wants to be a contestant on an upcoming season of the reality TV show Big Brother and thinks that Channel 5 snubbed her after finding out she was pregnant. “That was when I started considering an abortion. After the operation I will be going back to them and asking if they will still consider me,” she told the Sunday Mirror last week. “An abortion will further my career. This time next year I won’t have a baby. Instead, I’ll be famous, driving a bright pink Range Rover and buying a big house. Nothing will get in my way.” Cunningham wants fame, and she made it clear last week that she’ll do whatever it takes to get it. Or so she thought. Thursday, she traveled to London to have the procedure and, after feeling the baby kick for the first time, decided to forgo it. “I’d forgotten what the feeling was like,” she told the Mirror. “It was magical. It was like the baby was telling me not to go through with it.” Cunningham’s admission that she was considering abortion in pursuit of fame garnered quite a bit of ire in the U.K. last week, and her second change of heart has critics wondering if the entire thing was a publicity stunt in which Cunningham got exactly what she wanted: people talking about her. Cunningham says it wasn’t but also says that she “must be doing something right because at least everyone knew my name. I had 13,000 Twitter followers overnight–I didn’t care if they hated me…People are going to hate me, so at least I was getting famous in the process.”  Admittedly, Cunningham is a woman the Brits love to hate. Last year, on the basis that she’d been bullied her whole life for being flat-chested, she had a £4,800 breast-enhancement surgery on the NHS’s dime, for which she was strongly criticized. Like Jersey Shore’s Snooki or any of the “Real Housewives,” Cunningham is the kind of person representative of what’s wrong with society. But the outrage over Cunningham’s abortion remarks–much of it vile and uncharitable itself–went beyond a basic dislike of Cunningham. Surprisingly, much of the pushback came from people who are nominally pro-choice, people who found themselves asking: Are there reasons a woman shouldn’t be permitted to abort? It’s a question worth considering–and a question that British law technically answers. Under the Abortion Act of 1967, a woman is permitted to abort up to 24 weeks only when two physicians agree that carrying a baby to term would be dangerous to her physical or mental health. Doctors interpret the law loosely, however, and in practice, a British woman’s right to abortion is rarely restricted. That pro-choicers are questioning a woman’s reasons for abortion is significant. Staunch proponents of choice found themselves having to defend Cunningham this past week, or at least having to defend her right to abort. The Guardian’s Martin Robbins argued that the outrage over Cunningham boiled down to “basic snobbery” and that “her actions are no different from those of thousands of women who exercise their reproductive rights in order to make informed choices about their future careers and families.” He continued:  The moment you introduce the language of “deserving,” you invite others to judge just  how deserving you are; and a right very quickly becomes a privilege…If we fail to defend  Cunningham, then we accept that only those women who are “deserving” enough should  be allowed to have an abortion. And if we accept that, then it’s only a matter of time  before others are deemed undeserving as well. “What would the reaction be if she were a little more refined, a little less Northern, a little less fake-tanned?” asked Paris Lees in Vice. And, “of all the reasons a woman might choose to have an abortion, ‘So I can maybe get on a reality show’ has got to rank among the least compelling,” Mary Elizabeth Williams wrote in Salon. But, that’s the uncomfortable reality of reproductive choice. It’s a lot like free speech–if you  truly believe in it, you wind up having to defend the rights of people who don’t have the  most responsible relationship with it to have it as well. These are all good points, and kudos to them for being consistent. If a fetus is nothing more than a clump of cells, if a woman has a right to abortion, what does it matter if she’s aborting in order to finish law school or vying for a spot on Big Brother? It shouldn’t matter. But I suspect that the outrage over Cunningham’s comments stems from the lurking feeling among even the nominally pro-choice think that the motives behind abortion do matter, because a fetus is more than just a clump of cells. But Robbins is right: Accepting “that only those women who are ‘deserving’ enough should be allowed to have an abortion” is a slippery slope to declaring that other women are undeserving. And then, instead of a right, you have doctors or the government practicing a kind of moral calculus, declaring that one woman’s reason for wanting to get an abortion is good enough and another woman’s isn’t. Of course, in the Cunningham case, this is all now a moot point. She’s decided to carry her pregnancy to term–and not because of all the Internet “trolls,” she’s sure to point out, but because she felt her child kick. But that pro-choice Brits questioned her reasoning for wanting an abortion may lead to some other questioning, as well: about whether they “truly believe” in the right to abortion after all, whether abortion itself is morally acceptable, and whether society should be in this business of deciding which lives are brought into the world and which are terminated to begin with. The coverage of the Josie Cunningham controversy has been a complete circus–a spectacle that left one wishing she’d  just stop talking to the press. If it leads to national soul searching about the nature of abortion and reproductive rights, however, it will be a spectacle well worth it.

"484",484,"Democrats Don’t Just Want To Keep Roe, They Want The Unlimited Ability To Kill Preborn Babies","Boyd","Jordan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-05-05"," Democrats are outraged that, according to a leaked version of the Dobbs v. Jackson opinion, the United States Supreme Court is poised to strike down Roe v. Wade — but their hypocritical insistence that abortion is the “law of the land” is fueled by the party’s determination to codify abortion without any restrictions. 



Polling suggests that a majority of Americans are opposed to killing babies in the womb up until birth. A 2021 survey from The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 80 percent of Americans believe abortion should be illegal in the third trimester of pregnancy. A more recent Fox News poll conducted shortly before the Dobbs opinion leak found that 54 percent of registered voters support laws restricting abortion after 15 weeks.  



Despite the fact that American voters are hesitant to endorse unlimited abortion, many elected Democrats have made it a key part of their party’s platform going into the 2022 midterms.



When asked “if he supports any legal limits on abortion,” Democrat Sen. Raphael Warnock refused to answer directly and instead said, “I support a woman’s right to choose.”



Pennsylvania’s Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who is running for a chance at a U.S. Senate seat, was even more straightforward about what he believes about unlimited abortions. 



“Are there any limits on abortion that you would find appropriate?” a reporter asked.



“I don’t believe so, no,” Fetterman replied after pledging to nuke the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade.

Democrat candidates have also joined the frenzy of leftists scrambling to proclaim their belief that women have “a right to choose” to end the life of an unborn baby at any time without question. 



When Fox News’s Bret Baier asked Ohio Democrat congressman and Senate nominee Tim Ryan whether he supports any limits on abortion, Ryan tried to skirt the question. 



“I think what we had established in Roe, is something that we can continue to work with, and I think those could be the parameters,” Ryan began. 



“My question is about any limits to abortion?  At any point? Late-term? Anything?” Baier asked. 



“You gotta leave it up to the woman,” Ryan said. 



When Baier pressed him again, Ryan said “you and I sitting here can’t account for all the different scenarios…”

Similarly, when NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Ohio Democrat gubernatorial nominee Nan Whaley “where do you draw limits on the issue of abortion?” she deflected.



“I think that we need to make sure we have access. I’ve fought with Pro-Choice Ohio and Planned Parenthood to keep our clinics open,” she said. “I don’t think government should be involved in it.”

Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke admitted on Thursday that when it comes to legal restrictions on abortion, he believes “this is a decision for a woman to make.”

Pennsylvania Senate candidate Conor Lamb acknowledged his support for unlimited abortion during his state’s Democrat debate this week.



“If your right is a right, it’s your right the whole way through pregnancy,” Lamb said. “This is a constitutional right that women have, and that they deserve to have.”



Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution this week that “My support of abortion is grounded in the belief that this is not the role of our government, it is not the role of lawmakers.”



“It is the responsibility of women and their doctors, women and their families, women and whomever they choose to bring into the conversation, but it is not the conversation for government to be having,” she said.



 Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs also insisted in a local interview that she is not a fan of imposing limits on abortion. 



“What would your limits be on this? This limits nearly all abortions after 15 weeks. Where do you draw the line?” the host asked. 



“Well, women deserve access to abortion care. Abortion is health care. I’ve been very clear on my position on that throughout my time in the legislature. So if I’m elected governor, that’s what folks are getting. And I will work with the legislature that’s in place to ensure that women have continued access to reproductive health care,” she said. 



The host once again pressed her on the issue. 



“But where do you draw the line though?” he asked. “I mean, if it’s not 15 weeks, is it 24 weeks? Where do you draw the line where you say, okay, abortions after this point of time, no, it’s a no go?”



“Abortion is a personal decision between a woman and her family and her doctor. And that’s something that needs to be discussed in the medical exam room, not by politicians,” she replied.

"485",485,"Are Democrats About To Reopen The Party To Pro-Lifers?","Camosy","Charles","C.",NA,NA,NA,"2017-04-21"," The United States has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the world. Most Americans do not support such policies. Seven-in-ten want abortion broadly illegal after week 12 of pregnancy, about 8-12 weeks before most current state thresholds. Furthermore, Gallup recently found those “who would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion” is at 21%, the highest number in the 19 year history of their asking the poll question. They also found 23% of pro-life Americans fall into this category, compared with 19% of Americans who identify as pro-choice.  This lean in favor of pro-lifers is likely to get stronger as Millennials come into their own. NARAL’s own research has found a profound “intensity gap” among young people on abortion—with 51% of pro-lifers considering the issue “very important” compared with only 26% of pro-choice Millennials. The intensity gap is even stronger in favor of pro-lifers, obviously, in certain states and districts. James Thompson, a Kansas Democrat who ran in recent special election this week, made the race far more competitive than most anticipated. Trump won the district by 27 points, but Thompson only lost by 8 points. In a Think Progress interview, Thompson blamed his lost on the “desperation” of the national Republican party paying for negative campaign ads which “attacked me on abortion, saying I support sex-selection abortion and late-term abortion and all of these things that I’ve never said, that riled up a lot of [pro-life] activists here and they were able to pull out a victory.” Thompson may never have said this, but it is now an implication of his support the Democratic Party’s official position on abortion. This position not only calls for repeal of even our current modest restrictions, it insists that abortion at all stages and for any reason—as “core to women’s, men’s, and young people’s health and wellbeing”—must be paid for with pro-lifer’s tax dollars.  Though Thompson quite understandably does not want to be tainted with support for the right to sex-selection abortion and to kill a prenatal child who can feel pain and easily live outside her mother’s body, he was justly tied to those positions as a matter of Democratic orthodoxy and purity tests—as enforced by Planned Parenthood and NARAL. These organizations got to Hillary Clinton early on in the 2016 campaign cycle—and, despite her past instance that abortion be “rare”, got her commitment to the above extreme positions and in return for their support. Indeed, both Planned Parenthood and NARAL helped beat back a challenge from Bernie Sanders, an insurgent candidate who rightly called them “the establishment” within the Democratic party. Their support of Clinton, and resistance of Sanders, paid off. Cecile Richards and Ilyse Hogue were now making the rules. Abortion extremism and purity tests ruled the party. And what a gift this hostile takeover was to Republicans and Donald Trump. How many hundreds of thousands of pro-life voters (20 million who identify as Democrats) in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Florida, and North Carolina held their nose and voted for Trump? How many hundreds of thousands of pro-life non-conservatives—even if they would never vote for Trump—couldn’t be convinced to show up at the polls and vote for the party of abortion extremism?  Multiple factors contributed to Trump’s victory, of course, but it is almost certainly the case that the Richards/Hogue doctrine lost multiple states for the Clinton campaign. Especially given the lack of pro-choice intensity in the next generation—and the disproportionately pro-life views of Latinos—the writing is now on the wall for all to see. If Democrats continue to enforce purity tests for their extremist positions on abortion, they will to be the minority party for the foreseeable future. Opening The Big Tent Sanders has enough independence from the Democratic Party establishment to call progressives to face the math on these questions and openly support pro-life Democratic candidates in certain districts. Yesterday he was joined by DNC chair Tom Perez in supporting Health Mello, a pro-life liberal running for mayor of Omaha. The Richards/Hogue Inquisition pounced, bullying the 37 year-old Mello into walking back his pro-life voting history, a practice that is now all too familiar for pro-life Democrats. But it was too late. Sanders and Perez had made it clear that a more realistic wing of the party is fighting back against the abortion extremists who want to take it off a cliff. The runner up for the Democratic nomination for president, and the DNC chair, had openly and firmly supported a pro-life candidate. Perez was clear: “In order to execute a 50-state strategy, we need to understand what’s going on in all 50 states, and attract candidates who are consistent with their messages but perhaps not on 100 percent of the issues. If you demand fealty on every single issue, then it’s a challenge.” He and Sanders have history on their side. Howard Dean, DNC chair during the 2006 midterms, used a 50-state strategy to help Democrats recover from huge losses by going into what some considered Republican territory. And winning. This gave Democrats the kind of majorities necessary to pass big legislation like health care reform. Indeed, a full quarter of the Democratic House caucus voted for the pro-life Stupak amendment in 2009 and these very same people would go on to become the necessary votes pass the Affordable Care Act. This Should Frighten Republicans Without these pro-lifers, Democrats will continue to be the minority party, unable to advance the kind of legislation most progressives have on their agenda. Even something like paid family leave looks difficult to pass, with single-payer health care being an absolute pipe dream. But if the Perez/Sanders plan wins the day, pro-life non-conservatives stand ready to work with pro-choice liberals to work to enact such legislation—much like they did in 2009. And they are there for the taking. Younger pro-lifers, in particular, are less likely to identify as conservatives or Republicans than are older pro-lifers. Even if they voted for Trump, huge pluralities did so with deep reservations, unsure of his actual position on abortion. Many are frustrated that the national GOP has refused to make abortion the priority they claim it is around election time, and are increasingly arguing that pro-lifers ought to dial down their loyalty to the Republican Party. If Perez/Sanders gain serious traction with their plan to open the big tent on abortion, this should make small-government Republicans deeply uncomfortable. It will almost certainly threaten their majorities in 2018 and beyond. And if successful, progressive programs like paid family leave, and even single-payer health care, will not be far behind.

"487",487,"What The Washington Post Didn’t Tell You About The Teenage Mom Who Decided Not To Abort Her Twins","St. Onge","Sarah",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-07-01"," When The Washington Post reached out to Jana Pinson, she believed it would be a good opportunity to share the work pro-life groups in Texas are doing to help women who are unable to access abortion due to the state’s strict regulations. She knew acquiescence was a gamble, but she had previously interviewed with the same reporter, Caroline Kitchener, and felt she would be treated fairly.  



Jana was asked if she knew any pregnancy center clients who might be interested in speaking about their experiences. When she asked her team of volunteers, they knew just who to recommend, excitedly exclaiming, “You have to introduce her to Brooke.”



Brooke Alexander was one of their success stories, what pro-life advocates call a “save.” Not only had they changed her mind about having an abortion, but in doing so they’d saved two lives — Brooke’s daughters, Kendall and Olivia.



Brooke agreed to speak with Kitchener about her experience of unplanned pregnancy. The resulting article was lauded by pro-life advocates as a success story — babies were saved and mom and dad were stepping up to the parenting challenge. But for those on the pro-choice side, the article illustrated their deepest fears: poor women would be forced to deliver babies they could not properly provide for.



Subtle Bigotry of Left’s Portrayal



Both sides held up Brooke as an example of why their interpretation was the morally correct one. Pro-life advocates acknowledged the realities of Brooke’s experience by hosting a virtual baby shower promoting her GoFundMe fundraising page and by providing long-term opportunities for Brooke to succeed if she chooses to, with her babies at her side. 



Meanwhile, pro-choice advocates saw one thing: a disadvantaged girl who wanted an abortion and couldn’t get one. The subtle bigotry on display was shocking.



While Kitchener mentions Brooke already had challenges in life, she focuses on lack of abortion access as the nexus of Brooke’s troubles. If Brooke had just been able to access abortion, she would be selling condos and headed to the beach vacation she dreamed of. Instead, she was living in her teenaged boyfriend’s bedroom, with sheets over the window to keep out the Texas heat.



The truth is much more nuanced. Brooke’s daughters did not set her on a course of stunted possibilities. She had been moving in this direction her entire life, shuffled between her parents’ homes throughout childhood, and dropping out of high school long before meeting the twins’ father. She had only recently made a move in a more secure direction – and this is a key point that Kitchener twists into advocating for abortion.



When Brooke walked into the Pregnancy Center of Coastal Bend, she had already decided to terminate her pregnancy. She had only been dating her boyfriend, Billy High, for a few months – becoming intimate with him almost immediately. She was pursuing a real estate license, a plan which didn’t require her to return to school and get her high school diploma. She had a plan for her life, which included getting out of Corpus Christi – dreams of a better life. A baby would put a fast end to all of her plans.



She was only at the pregnancy resource center for the free ultrasound, which an abortion clinic needed to ascertain whether she would be eligible for an abortion in the state of Texas.



Kitchener describes Brooke as being “lulled” by the serene atmosphere in the resource center, as if there was some nefarious reason they chose watercolors for their waiting room. While describing the next step of Brooke’s visit, Kitchener notes the informed consent booklet all Texan women are required to receive before an abortion focuses on “death” as a potential complication (death is also included as a potential complication on the websites of most abortion clinics). 



She doesn’t clarify whether she agrees with the publicly available pamphlet, but we can ascertain what her feelings may be by the tone of her language, as well as her unnecessary assertions that abortion is safer than other minor medical procedures. That claim is impossible to confirm since abortion complications are not recorded by the federal government as assiduously as other elective procedures, physicians often may not be aware of patients who incur complications when those women present at hospital, and abortion advocates encourage women to lie about their abortions when presenting themselves to the emergency room after experiencing abortion complications.



Changing Her Mind



Brooke’s determination to end the pregnancy wavered when she learned she was carrying twins. Then it crumbled into a quiet “yes,” she was keeping the babies, after her mother exclaimed the babies were miracles and promised to help her raise them.



Brooke, a single, 18-year-old, high school dropout, was going to be a mother, twice over.



In most cases babies are a cause for joy, but the overall theme of Kitchener’s narrative is one of despair. We learn about Brooke’s mother, who won’t provide consistent housing despite assertions she would help with the babies. Her father, while more caring, struggles with drug addiction and the instability substance abuse brings with it — his only contribution to the conversation is to support Brooke’s decision to have an abortion. 



Brooke’s boyfriend, Billy, is characterized as having few life aspirations, satisfied with working a part-time job and mastering skateboard tricks. More insidiously, he is made out to be a deadbeat before Brooke has even delivered their babies, and without having been part of the interview.



WaPo’s Bias



I concur with many observers that Kitchener’s article provokes a sense of rage – but not because Brooke was “forced” to deliver her babies, or even because all of the most important people in her life encouraged Brooke to terminate the pregnancy, telling her that despite the hype, girls can’t do anything they put their minds to. Our outrage should be at how the article guides the reader to a specific conclusion, interpreting the situation through a very narrow, abortion-friendly, lens – and that lens is saturated with urban, upper-class bias.



Left out of the article was Brooke’s plan to continue pursuing her real estate license, only put on hold because she was unsure which state she will be in once Billy has completed basic training. Her humble housing situation is painted in as drab colors as possible, without clarification that other housing situations have been offered to Brooke. But she has chosen to stay in Billy’s home because Billy’s family seems to have given her something her own family did not: a sense of stability. For someone whose formative years were spent in unsettled circumstances, Billy’s parents had proven to be a safe haven for Brooke.



The beginning of Brooke and Billy’s life together has been rough. They’ve certainly sacrificed for one another and for their daughters, but their responsible decisions indicate a future which can be as successful as they make it. And it was their daughters who made the difference in their life.



This leads to the crux of the story – whatever we take away from Brooke’s narrative, woven through it is the truism that sometimes life can be difficult, but the bonds we create with others can be more important than our financial situation and the life we imagine for ourselves. The Washington Post could have shared an empowered Brooke, but our society has told us for too long that parenthood can never be powerful, and that women will always be less than when they mother their babies. Especially young women.



Kitchener could have painted a picture of a young man who stepped up to his responsibilities, a family who embraced Brooke and gave her respite from an unkind world. She could have depicted fiercely independent young mother who desperately loves her daughters. But this would not have supported the Post’s theme: that Brooke’s life was ruined by her inability to access abortion.



We have the chance now to alter public perception and create the types of spaces where families like Brooke and Billy’s are valued in our society – a place where no baby ends up in a medical waste bin, and where no one is ever forced to choose between opportunity and the life of their child.

"488",488,"If Roe Is Overturned, Bishops Can No Longer Let Catholic Democrats Off The Hook","Busek","Robert",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022-05-17"," After months of accusing Republicans of using “phony, trumped-up culture wars” to divide the electorate, the Democrats have chosen abortion, the mother of all culture war issues, as the hill on which they will fight and die in 2022.



When Politico published a draft of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, the left’s reaction to its striking down of Roe v. Wade predictably combined wailing and gnashing of teeth with crass political posturing. With uncharacteristic speed and clarity, our “devoutly Catholic” president used the draft to encourage voters to support pro-abortion candidates in the November elections and call upon Congress to codify Roe into law.



Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then dutifully lifted up the banner of child murder, bringing a bill to the floor last Wednesday that would have legalized abortion up until the point of birth. Although this gambit was doomed to fail because the filibuster remains intact, all but one of the Democrats who identify as Catholic voted for it.



So, barring any justices bending to public pressure and changing their minds (which was likely the idea behind leaking the draft in the first place), the power to pass laws regarding abortion is going to be returned to state legislatures. This means Catholic bishops will finally have to choose between adhering to what the church teaches regarding those who support abortion and maintaining their Faustian bargain with the Democratic Party.



Nowhere to Hide Now



From its very inception, the church has taught that abortion is a grave moral evil. This teaching has been consistently upheld by canonists and theologians for more than 2,000 years. In 1974, on the heels of Roe v. Wade and similar efforts, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued its “Declaration on Procured Abortion,” which clearly stated not only that abortion is a mortal sin, but also that supporting its legalization (no matter one’s “personal opposition”) is as well:



It must in any case be clearly understood that whatever may be laid down by civil law in this matter, man can never obey a law which is in itself immoral, and such is the case of a law which would admit in principle the liceity of abortion. Nor can he take part in a propaganda campaign in favor of such a law, or vote for it. (Emphasis mine.)



Although a Catholic legislator’s vote in favor of legalizing abortion still falls short of the “formal cooperation” that carries with it automatic ex-communication, the church still considers such a vote a stain on the legislator’s soul. As such, unless he confesses his sin and does penance for it, he may not receive communion without committing the second mortal sin of sacrilege, a point that many American bishops and priests seem to have forgotten.



Giving unto Caesar What is God’s



On the issue of abortion, the Democratic Party demands that its Catholic members leave the moral teachings of their faith at the statehouse doors. Under the diabolical euphemisms of “reproductive rights” and “women’s health,” abortion holds a central place in the health care plank of its platform:



Democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion. We will repeal the Title X domestic gag rule and restore federal funding for Planned Parenthood… Democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights. We will repeal the Hyde Amendment, and protect and codify the right to reproductive freedom.



For years, it has been clear that Democrats must toe the line on supporting child murder or be purged from the ranks. No other issue comes close to this shibboleth of the left; to the party of today, a Democrat must favor unrestricted abortion or he is no Democrat.



For almost 50 years, the bishops have actively avoided holding these lawmakers accountable for promoting the Culture of Death in return for the party’s lip service to Catholic social teaching. 



True, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) showed some evidence of a spine last year when it announced the crafting of a teaching letter on the Eucharist, a move that caused much uproar among pro-abortion “Catholics.” Yet when the letter was issued in November, it contained no mention of disciplining abortion-supporting politicians. 



Instead, Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, the head of the USCCB’s Committee on Pro-Life Activities, offered some tepid comments about the bishops’ “responsibility to have dialogue and conversation with those who are Catholic but who act in a way contrary to our faith in this basic moral teaching.”



Time to Make the Real Choice



With all due respect to Naumann, the time for “dialogue and conversation” with these legislators is long past; their zeal for legalizing abortion shows that. There have already been legislative efforts in multiple states in anticipation of the Dobbs decision. 



Should the decision be handed down in its present form, these efforts will intensify, placing clergy and laity squarely in the crosshairs of pro-abortion ideologues who are openly anti-Catholic and have few qualms about resorting to intimidation or even violence to achieve their goals. Will the mounting number of attacks on parishes finally convince the bishops to act in accordance with Catholic teaching?



In Old Testament times, Elijah called the people of Israel to come to Mount Carmel and witness the battle he waged against the four hundred priests of the pagan god Baal. There, the prophet “came near to all the people, and said, ‘How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.’” (I Kings 18:21).



Catholic bishops throughout the country must now finally make a similar choice between God and Moloch. Obviously, their sheep in the Democratic Party have already made this choice and received their reward. As these leaders of the church struggle with their consciences, they would do well to remember the words of another prophet: “‘Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!’ says the Lord” (Jeremiah 23:1).

"489",489,"Pro-Life Democrats Are A Thing Of The Past","Pavone","Frank",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-09-27"," “The Democratic Party is a party of inclusion. We respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party.” — The 1996 Democratic Party Platform “Inclusion”? On abortion? Oh, how times have changed.  Twenty years ago, the above statement about respecting “the individual conscience of each American” on abortion followed a pledge in the Democratic Party’s platform to “the right of every woman to choose consistent with Roe v. Wade.” While the party was firmly favored Roe’s imposition of abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy, it still sought to include those who believe civil rights extend to all humans, born and unborn. No more. Today, you can’t be pro-life and expect to be “welcomed to participate” in the Democratic Party. The composition of the Democratic caucus in Congress painfully illustrates this transformation. In 1996, the House and Senate passed a federal ban on the gruesome procedure known as partial-birth abortion. Legislators from both parties voted to outlaw the procedure where a baby is pulled from his mother’s womb feet-first and then stabbed in the skull before his head is fully outside the birth canal. President Bill Clinton vetoed the measure, but the House of Representatives voted to override Mr. Clinton’s decision. Of the 283 members of Congress who opposed the president’s veto, 70 were Democrats. To them, protecting late-term babies from what amounted to infanticide was more important than loyalty to the leader of their party.  This is not to say there were 70 solidly pro-life Democrats in the House of Representatives in 1996. Undoubtedly, for some supporting the partial-birth abortion ban was an exception to their otherwise-consistent support for the Planned Parenthood agenda. But gaining that many Democrats to vote against the abortion industry today would be impossible. That Was Then, This Is Now Consider votes taken in Congress in the last year. In September 2015, the House approved the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The measure would have ensured that any child who lives through an abortion—and it happens—be given the same medical care as any other child born at the same gestational age. You would think that everyone would be in favor of helping babies who are already born. After all, we’re not talking about babies who are partially born, but who are completely outside their mothers’ wombs, breathing and gazing at the new world in front of them. Surely, a bill against outright infanticide would have universal support. But when the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act came before the current Congress, while it drew support from all 243 Republicans present, only five Democrats voted for the bill. One hundred seventy-seven Democrats voted against providing basic medical care to babies who were born, but unwanted.  Then there’s the matter of funding abortions through Obamacare. In 2009—not that long ago—pro-life Democrat Rep. Bart Stupak and pro-life Republican Joe Pitts offered an amendment to prevent abortion funding in the president’s Affordable Care Act. The House of Representatives voted 240 to 194 to approve the amendment, with 64 Democrats voting in favor of extending the Hyde Amendment’s abortion funding restriction to Obamacare. The Senate dropped the amendment, and when the Affordable Care Act returned to the House for approval, a group of pro-life Democrats led by Stupak held up its passage. They objected to the bill’s use of public money for abortion. About a dozen of these Democrats held firm until the last minute when a presidential executive order, which proved to be meaningless in its alleged funding restrictions, swayed their votes. Democrats Now Favor Aborting Babies Who Can Feel Pain In 2015, the House again voted to try to remove taxpayer funding for abortion from Obamacare. The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act would have written the annual Hyde Amendment spending restriction into federal law and extended it to all federal programs, not just those funded through the U.S. Health and Human Services appropriations bill. It passed 242 to 179, numbers similar to the House’s vote six years earlier to restrict abortion funding in Obamacare. This time, however, instead of 64 Democrats voting to limit taxpayer funding for abortion, there were only three. Last year, the House voted to try to protect from abortion unborn babies old enough to feel pain. A mere four Democrats voted in favor of doing so. Again last year, the House voted to try to end hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to the nation’s largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood. Only two Democrats supported the measure. The “pro-life Democrat” has become almost as non-existent in Congress as he or she is in the party’s platform. “The party of the little guy,” it seems, no longer has room for the littlest among us, or for those who care about them.

"491",491,"This Little-Known Option Saves Mothers From Killing Their Babies For Being Disabled","Griswold","Kylee",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-03-14"," President Joe Biden’s abortion-loving acolytes gave a standing ovation to Texas mom Kate Cox during his State of the Union last week. Guests of honor at the annual address tend to be Americans of courage or contribution, such as military heroes, cultural trailblazers, or victims of tragedies. But Cox is just a 31-year-old Texan who sued her state over its abortion laws, traveled to a different state, and killed her unborn baby for the crime of being imperfect. Stunning and brave.



Cox’s poor child had received a prenatal diagnosis of Trisomy 18, which is associated with growth obstacles and developmental delays. But while some babies with this diagnosis die in utero or within the weeks or months after birth, others thrive for years, even into their teens and twenties.



Cox’s child could have been one of these success stories, but we’ll never know.



Sadly, as prenatal testing advanced in the years following Roe v. Wade, the number of elective abortions in response to fetal anomalies rose. Parents in the United States kill an alarming percentage of preborn babies diagnosed — possibly incorrectly — with Down syndrome, Trisomy 18, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, and many other conditions. At best, it’s euthanasia. At worst, it’s eugenics.



Medical “advice” seems to be a major contributing factor to the rates of abortion after adverse diagnoses. The vast majority of OB-GYNs and other health care professionals automatically prescribe abortion for fetal anomalies, and they urge it repeatedly. A new study from the Family Research Council (FRC) bears this out. 



Perinatal Hospice



The study also shows a better path — one that honors the dignity of both the mother and child. It’s called perinatal hospice, or perinatal palliative care, and it seeks care and comfort for parents and their children from the moment of diagnosis through delivery and eventual death. It provides everything from emotional support and counseling to planning for birth and natural death, funerals and burial plans, prayer, support groups, pictures or mementos, and sometimes sonograms or memorial services. 



But research shows most women don’t know about it — and those who do know didn’t hear about it from their doctors.



Last year, FRC surveyed 82 women who went through perinatal hospice — and learned a lot about the demographics who most often receive that type of care. The vast majority of recipients were married (almost 94 percent), white (75 percent), religious (75 percent), and college-educated with above-average incomes. This is unsurprising in light of the women Planned Parenthood targets. In keeping with its racist, eugenic roots, the abortion giant sadly centers its facilities in low-income and minority neighborhoods, where single parenthood is common.



That’s one reason it’s important to get the word out about perinatal hospice. Women aren’t alone — they just don’t know it. Fewer than 1 in 5 of the surveyed women received perinatal hospice information from their OB-GYN after an adverse prenatal diagnosis. According to the FRC survey: 




Over 55 percent of the women received a recommendation of abortion by at least one of her doctors. Sadly, a majority of women who were advised to obtain an abortion reported that they received this advice on multiple occasions from doctors or healthcare professionals. Only 13 percent of women were encouraged by their first OBGYN to carry their pregnancy to term. Similarly, only 12 percent who sought advice from a high-risk pregnancy specialist were advised to carry their pregnancy to term.




While FRC also noted that only 25 percent of the women said their insurance covered the special care, PerinatalHospice.org, a top resource for this type of palliative care, says perinatal hospice is inexpensive. It reports that at least one insurance company covers it specifically, but most aspects of perinatal hospice work into what parents are already paying for delivery, birth planning, prenatal, and newborn care. 



This care is effective. Most women surveyed were pleased with their perinatal help. “Over 83 percent felt that perinatal hospice was very supportive emotionally,” FRC concluded. “Additionally, 67 percent found that perinatal hospice services were very helpful in the grieving process.”



After carrying babies with a scary prenatal diagnosis to term, many of the women understandably reported having a “better understanding” of why some expectant mothers would consider abortion under those circumstances. But it’s important to note that while a majority of the women surveyed already considered themselves “very pro-life,” 36 percent of respondents said carrying their babies to term made them more pro-life. 



A Pro-Woman Option



Women who went through perinatal hospice found it helpful, so what? You can almost hear the pro-abortion response. According to abortion advocates, killing the diagnosed child is still the best thing for the mother, who then isn’t forced to endure drawn-out grief, and for the child, who would suffer if he were allowed to live through natural death. 



But research refutes these lies. A longitudinal study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology showed that four months after aborting a baby because of a fetal anomaly, almost half of women (46 percent) “showed pathological levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms” — which continued 16 months post-abortion in more than 20 of the women.



One research article called abortion for prenatal abnormalities a “traumatic event” that “entails the risk of severe and complicated grieving.” And a study in Obstetrics and Gynecology found, “Women who terminate pregnancies for fetal anomalies experience grief as intense as those who experience spontaneous perinatal loss.”



The Perinatal Hospice website documents even more research showing the same and concludes that abortion “is not a shortcut through grief.” On the other hand, studies show that almost all women (97.5 percent) who decide to carry their babies to term do not regret that choice, and while they experience much of the same grief over the loss of their children, they avoid the intense guilt.



As for the babies, parents and health care experts familiar with perinatal palliative care describe the newborns as comfortable and “peaceful.” In hospice situations, medical care can either be administered if it would relieve pain or avoided if it would cause unnecessary discomfort, such as tests or vaccinations.   



Life-or-Death Knowledge



No expecting parents want the news that their child is a medical anomaly. It’s scary.



Scarier, however, is the way abortion advocates and hiveminded OB-GYNs exploit this fear. They throw around unscientific phrases such as “incompatible with life,” emotionally blackmailing already distraught parents with the lie that abortion is the safest and most compassionate option. 



It’s not, and no medical professional can know for sure what a child’s lifespan will be unless he snuffs it out. As the Perinatal Hospice website notes, “the term ‘lethal’ can be a subjective judgment about quality of life and can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.”



It’s not up to doctors to speculate about what another person’s quality of life will be before she even takes her first breath, or to withhold good medical options from parents. As the FRC study’s authors wrote in a Tuesday op-ed, “The lives of those with disabilities, no matter how long or how short, are just as valuable as every other person’s life. Americans must recognize this.”



So it’s time to tell women — and the OB-GYNs who don’t know — that there’s a better way. To stop assuming abortion is a solution. To come alongside young, poor, scared moms with hope and comfort instead of erecting abortion mills in their minority neighborhoods. And to stop applauding abortion seekers as brave and instead laud the parents who choose truly compassionate care.

"492",492,"Planned Parenthood Celebrates 100 Years Of Promoting Death","Scheer","Holly",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016-10-23"," Normally anniversaries, especially 100th anniversaries, are a cause for celebration. Many institutions close far before this mark, so persevering to change with the times yet survive is notable.
However, this week is such an anniversary, or birthday if you will, for Planned Parenthood. While some people are celebrating this birthday and focusing on PP’s reproductive health achievements, others mourn the death toll from abortion and the cultural shift to mainstreamed eugenics.
Few organizations are as divisive as Planned Parenthood. Supporters of the organization and of legal abortion view PP as an important provider of women’s health services and worry that any defunding or restrictions will limit women’s autonomy, increase disease rates, and cause families to parent children they don’t want or can’t afford to care for.
On the other side are those who consider abortion wrong, who think every child should have a chance at life, who see other ways to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and provide children with loving homes, and point to PP’s morally questionable practices that can cover up child abuse.
Telling the Truth that Hurts
The pro-life movement has not been quiet about this birthday. The Center for Medical Progress made headlines nationwide by publishing undercover videos about Planned Parenthood’s disposal of and financial gain from the bodies of aborted babies.
“Millions of Americans are becoming increasingly aware that Planned Parenthood, as the biggest abortion provider in the country, receives over half-a-billion taxpayer dollars annually, and then funnels tens of millions of dollars back into the campaigns of its political cronies to protect itself from scrutiny,” said David Daleiden, CMP’s founder and investigative lead. “Planned Parenthood claims it was founded to reduce out-of-wedlock births and abortion, but over its 100-year history, these outcomes have skyrocketed. Now, by its own reports, Planned Parenthood’s non-abortion services are dropping and it performs more abortions every year than it prevents.”
Daleiden was legally charged for making these investigative videos, and just recently those charges were dropped. Lila Rose, the president of Live Action, has also made undercover videos showing PP being willing to cover up abuses of suspected child sex trafficking victims. Rose’s activism has documented that PP officials are willing to hide abuse of underage women to help them access abortions, instead of connecting them with help to escape that abuse.
“I join with those who mourn the nearly eight million pre-born lives violently cut short in Planned Parenthood facilities since Roe v. Wade,” she said. “This is not a day to celebrate; instead, this is a day to reject Planned Parenthood’s inhumane and elitist ideology: that abortion on demand into the ninth month is acceptable; that some children, because of their handicaps or because they are victims conceived in rape, don’t deserve life and a place of love and respect in our society; and that the aggressive promotion of abortion is a solution to the challenges some minority and low-income women may face.”
Peoples Views Do Change
Outcry has also come from those who were once on the inside of PP, including Abby Johnson, a former director of Planned Parenthood and the founder of And Then There Were None. That’s an organization dedicated to helping workers from abortion clinics leave the abortion industry.
“For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has told women that they aren’t strong enough to be mothers or achieve their goals,” she said. “While Planned Parenthood celebrates their 100-year anniversary and claims #100YearsStrong, it’s time for America to set the record straight and proclaim that they are #100YearsWrong. America deserves better than Planned Parenthood and it’s time for us to bring an end to this nefarious organization.”
Johnson worked for PP for eight years, and has had two abortions of her own. Her shift from pro-choice to pro-life mirrors her current work to help others change their views on abortion and other life issues.
Seventy-eight percent of Americans support some limits to abortions, and 53 percent support restricting almost all abortions. The majority of those who want limits to abortion services support limiting abortion to the first trimester. Those in favor of eliminating almost all abortion want access restricted to cases of rape, incest, and danger to the life of the mother.
Despite more than half of Americans wanting changes to our current abortion culture, we’re facing the reality that our political system protects Planned Parenthood and legal abortion on demand. There is a disconnect between the people’s moral beliefs and our politicians’ pretense to represent all of us. This disconnect perpetuates policies that keep PP taxpayer-funded, running, and at the forefront of the American abortion industry.
There is irony in celebrating an anniversary as a birthday when that anniversary is for an organization that has prevented the birthdays of millions of Americans.
