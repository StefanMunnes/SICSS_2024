"1","Abby",270,"Former Pussycat Dolls star reveals abortion trauma women endure. Here’s my story","Abby Johnson",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," January 15, 2023 7:00am EST","Ex-Pussycat Dolls singer Kaya Jones said in a recent podcast appearance that abortion left her with pain and anger and warned women against making the same choices she did before turning to Christ.Is having an abortion crossing the line? What about two abortions? What about three, four, five? By the time most women procure their second, third, fourth abortion, there is no line, and she may be so deep in depression, regret and anger that she cannot even recall how she got to that point. There is a way out though and that’s what former Pussycat Dolls singer, Kaya Jones, bravely revealed when she decided to talk about her own three abortions.  She didn’t go and ""shout"" her abortions in efforts to normalize the procedure and make sure that line between right and wrong is as unambiguous as possible. She gave a heartbreaking interview about the regret she felt after choosing abortion, not once or twice, but three times. Her insight into how easy it was to choose abortion after that first time is telling. Yes, it is a slippery slope because once you learn to justify bad behavior and bad decisions, the darkness only grows more dense and oppressive. It is not freeing to choose abortion as those who want to shout their abortions tell you.  ABORTION SURVIVORS CALL OUT OPPOSITION TO BORN-ALIVE BILL ON CAPITOL HILL: ‘THIS IS INFANTICIDE’Unfortunately, I can relate all too easily to Kaya. I put some thought into my first abortion. I felt I had a good reason, so I went ahead and did it. The line between right and wrong became a blur. For my second abortion, it was a lot easier, and I started slipping down the slope. It was what some people would call an obvious choice given my circumstances because, really, it’s not hard to justify the wrong decision, especially if you’ve already done it once or twice.  Mother's Day arson attack at pro-life group Wisconsin Family Action.  (WKOW)My abortion decisions did not just affect me though. Since I worked at and ran a Planned Parenthood facility in Texas at the time, it became much easier to help women justify their own abortions who came through our doors. If they were wavering, I could almost always sway them to choose abortion. It was easy money.  It was through seeing an abortion happen on an ultrasound screen in front of me that ultimately changed my view and led me to leave Planned Parenthood. However, I distinctly remember women coming into the abortion clinic to have their seventh, eighth or ninth abortions. It was just another day for them and secretly, my conscience was pricked. That’s a lot of abortions. They obviously had no line drawn in the sand or if they did, it was wiped away long ago. When did they fall down that slippery slope? After which abortion did they decide that this was their new way of life? More importantly, did they ever have that moment of epiphany where they realized what they did and the immensity of their decisions?  For Kaya, that moment was seeing two little girls looking up at her during a concert after she had her abortions. I know what that feels like – the emptiness, the regret, the anger, the feelings of worthlessness. All of those emotions are so common for both women and men who have experienced abortion but of course, this isn’t talked about. If the abortion industry wants abortion to be mainstream and accessible, they should be brutally honest not only about what happens during an abortion but what happens afterward, including the destructive emotions that can wreak havoc after a woman has realized what she’s done.  One maternal suicide study done in Italy in 2019 revealed that suicides among mothers who had abortions were twice those of mothers who had given birth. Another study done in Finland in the mid-1990s on the same subject showed that women who had abortions were six times as likely to commit suicide than women who gave birth.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERIn the United States, a study was conducted on 173,000 women on Medicaid in California and it found that women who had abortions had a significantly higher risk of dying in the eight years following their abortion. It also found these same women had a staggering 154% higher risk of death by suicide than women who did not have an abortion.  It was through seeing an abortion happen on an ultrasound screen in front of me that ultimately changed my view and led me to leave Planned Parenthood. However, I distinctly remember women coming into the abortion clinic to have their seventh, eighth or ninth abortions. It was just another day for them and secretly, my conscience was pricked. It's not true that women feel fine after their abortions. They may feel initial relief but speaking from my own experiences, from the experiences of more than 630 former abortion workers I’ve helped through my ministry, and from the experiences of the thousands of abortions I helped to facilitate, there is significant pain after an abortion or multiple abortions. Once that line is crossed between right and wrong, so many people don’t even see the precipice they are standing on until they are falling.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe good news, like Kaya Jones said, is that there is hope and healing after abortion if women and men want to find it. There are multiple programs available for abortion healing. While abortion is an irreversible decision, choosing to live with the regret, pain, hurt, anger, and depression is not. I found forgiveness through the great mercy of God and through the love of my husband and family.  This journey has not been easy but the healing and mercy I’ve found has been worth the effort, and it is my sincere hope that women and men who are suffering after their abortions know that there is hope and healing for them, that just because they fell down that slippery slope doesn’t mean they need to stay in the darkness.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ABBY JOHNSONAbby Johnson is CEO and founder of And Then There Were None and author of ""Unplanned.""","https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/former-pussycat-dolls-star-reveals-abortion-trauma-women-endure-heres-my-story",5999,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,"female"

Because working in an abortion clinic is not normal. NPR SHOCKS BY AIRING AUDIO OF WOMAN GETTING AN ABORTION: 'DISTURBING AND EVIL ON EVERY LEVEL'Yet thousands of (mostly) women do it. I was one of them for eight years but for the past decade, I’ve traveled to Washington, D.C. every January for the March for Life to be a witness for all of us who did choose to work in abortion clinics. We march alongside thousands of other people who may not understand why we did what we did but thankfully have come to accept our small cohort of former abortion workers who have quite the story to tell. I loved getting asked what I wanted to be when I grow up when I was a kid because I knew exactly the answer: I wanted to be a doctor. I used to wheel my baby dolls around in a baby bed and pretend it was gurney. In a sick twist of fate and misguided morals, I did so much worse than my mind as a little girl could ever comprehend to those babies when I grew up.THE END OF ROE HAS PREVENTED AT LEAST 10,000 LEGAL ABORTIONS: REPORTI, like many, many people who work in abortion clinics, chose to do so because I thought I was helping women. That and the money. Abortions aren’t cheap and the money is pretty good working at these clinics. I thought that providing women with safe abortions was the most compassionate thing I could do, that I was instrumental in helping them fix their problem of being pregnant when they didn’t want to be. Working inside of an abortion clinic isn’t normal. It’s not normal to see women in the recovery room with completely blank stares and hollow eyes after their abortions when hours earlier they looked totally different. These clinic workers have seen and participated in the stuff of nightmares. I understand it’s a hard thing to imagine sometimes, why someone would choose to work in a place that took life instead of saving it but what many people cannot comprehend is that we are so normal, just like them. We have families to provide for, we have groceries we need to buy, tuition, electricity, and other bills to pay for. We like to hang out with friends, go shopping, relax at the beach, or go to the movies. There are honestly not that many differences between those who work in abortion clinics and those who have normal jobs. People don’t see that and while it was frustrating not to be seen without the attachment of my profession, it’s understandable. I mean, I ran a Planned Parenthood clinic in Texas. I came home with blood on my shoes some days from abortion procedures. I saw and did things I never should have done.FBI OFFERS $25K REWARD FOR INFO ON PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTER ATTACKS, VANDALISMYet working inside of an abortion clinic isn’t normal. It’s not normal to piece together the body parts of aborted babies. It’s not normal to assure a tearful woman on the table that everything is going to be just fine when she’s bleeding profusely after an abortion. It’s not normal to see women in the recovery room with completely blank stares and hollow eyes after their abortions when hours earlier they looked totally different. These clinic workers have seen and participated in the stuff of nightmares. They often feel alone, depressed, angry, and misunderstood. Yet they themselves are normal and shouldn’t be ostracized from the pro-life movement. They should be recklessly loved with compassion.After I left Planned Parenthood, I realized there were no organizations that specifically ministered to the needs of former abortion workers. I was surprised but then again, working in abortion clinics isn’t normal. HARRIS TO PUSH ABORTION DURING FLORIDA TRIP ON ROE V. WADE ANNIVERSARYI eventually began a ministry that did help former abortion workers to quit their jobs, to help them with finances, to offer retreats and counseling, and to connect them with other women who innately understood them and what they had been through. After 11 years, we have helped 645 people leave the abortion industry. To assist our ministry to serve those who leave the industry, we informally ask them about their experiences and have found shocking results. Thirty percent of those surveyed witnessed forced abortions on women and girls who did not give their consent. Thirty-six percent saw abortions done on suspected sex trafficking victims. Forty-nine percent said their clinics had abortion quotas. Thirty-six percent said they were sometimes or regularly under the influence of drugs and alcohol during working hours at the clinic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERSome women left comments on our survey that both brought tears to my eyes as I remembered my own experiences at Planned Parenthood and that also further strengthened my own resolve to tell their stories. One woman said, ""We manipulated and coerced women into having abortions and likewise deterred and prevented men from supporting their partner."" Another woman said she wouldn’t wish this job on her worst enemy and another said, ""I still can’t believe I used to rinse the aborted babies down the drain and then turn on the garbage disposal."" These are the women that you’ll see marching on Friday at the March for Life. They are in the crowd supporting life. They are women just like you and me who made really bad decisions to work in the abortion industry but have had the courage to leave and start over. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe end of Roe v. Wade doesn’t mean the end of abortion and in fact, I’d argue that it is abortion workers that we need to reach the most because if they quit and start telling their stories, clinics will shut down as we have seen already across the country. My hope is that every year at the March for Life and in state marches, more and more former abortion workers will be in those crowds until abortion becomes unthinkable. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ABBY JOHNSON Abby Johnson is CEO and founder of And Then There Were None and author of ""Unplanned.""","https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/planned-parenthood-clinic-what-should-know-about-workers",6422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,"female"

I had left my job as a Planned Parenthood clinic director only three months earlier and basically became overnight famous within the pro-life community.I had just undergone a radical conversion after witnessing the destruction of a 13-week-old fetus during an ultrasound-guided abortion. At the March for Life in Washington, D.C., there will be several former abortion workers in that big crowd, people who dispensed abortion pills to women maybe in that same crowd or held their hand as they laid on the table or coerced them into something they knew was wrong.71 PERCENT OF AMERICANS SUPPORT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS: POLLPro-life demonstrators hold signs during the March for Life 2020 rally in Washington on Jan 24, 2020. (Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images)I was wary heading to that first March for Life because I was on the opposing side of these people for years. I had angrily protested against them. I had said mean things to them, especially the people who prayed on the sidewalk outside my clinic. Would they judge me? Would they shove everything I had said back in my face? Even worse, would they say I wasn’t worthy of redemption, that abortion workers should be hated and despised for what they did?It didn’t exactly go the way I had expected. At that first March for Life, many people had heard my story of seeing the ultrasound and walking out of the clinic. Women were coming up to me and they were literally falling on me crying and sharing their stories of abortion regret.Yet I did hear that abortion workers don’t deserve love, that we are despicable human beings for working in abortion clinics. This was especially prevalent in the early years after I left Planned Parenthood and began to put a face to the people who worked in the clinics. We are human, too. We make mistakes, some bigger than others. But so many of us have had the courage to walk away and recognize the destruction we were causing to women, to their children, and to their families.I believe it is the stories of these abortion workers, stories of heartache and pain and redemption, that need to be told. Why? Because of my experiences, and those of many former abortion workers who have come with me to the March for Life, I’ve learned our stories of repentance have the power to heal those affected by the tragedy of abortion.Both men and women who have been hurt in some way by abortion needed to see our repentance because we represented so much to them. We represented those doctors who ended the lives of their babies. We represented the nurses that held their hands and told them, ""It would all be over soon,"" or in some cases, the nurses who physically held them down on the table when they screamed out in pain. We represented the clinic workers who lied and told them that their babies were ""just tissue"" and that they wouldn’t regret their abortion. And really, we represented a society that had regrettably normalized abortion - and these women didn’t even realize how much they needed to see a repentant abortion clinic worker until they saw me.It wasn’t even me necessarily. But seeing someone who had a hand in their pain cooled a burning spot of anger in their lives that maybe they had been holding onto for many years. Some of them didn’t even recognize the anger until they realized that it was gone.Most of the former abortion workers we help get out of the industry and then who attend the March for Life feel like they will be judged by the attendees. But they aren’t. Many people come up to them and thank them for their bravery and courage. Others offer to pray with them. It’s an incredibly humbling experience.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThen there are the protesters, those who appear along the route or at the Supreme Court. They have shouted down former abortion workers, including those who speak about the regret they have of their own abortion. It breaks my heart to watch this happen because I used to be on that side. I used to be screaming at pro-lifers. I was so, so angry. But at every March for Life, I get the opportunity to say I’m sorry to the women who have abortions, that I’m so sorry for my work in the abortion clinic. And afterwards, I see the peace in the faces of the women listening. They just want someone to acknowledge their pain and see them. And I do. All of us former abortion workers walking in the March for Life do.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWe’ll be there at the March, holding our signs that say we are ""Quitters."" Our stories are different but we, too, have our place in the movement.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone announced Friday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is barred from receiving Holy Communion due to her pro-abortion stance -- marking an escalation in a decades-long tension between the Roman Catholic Church and liberal Democratic politicians on abortion.Cordileone has written to the California Democrat, informing her that she should not present herself for Holy Communion at Mass, and that priests will not distribute communion to her if she does present herself.PELOSI LAUDS PROTESTERS USING ‘RIGHTEOUS ANGER' TO ‘MARCH AND MOBILIZE,’ AS SUPREME COURT SET TO OVERTURN ROE""A Catholic legislator who supports procured abortion, after knowing the teaching of the Church, commits a manifestly grave sin which is a cause of most serious scandal to others.  Therefore, universal Church law provides that such persons ‘are not to be admitted to Holy Communion,'"" he says in the letter. The Catechism of the Catholic Church is unambiguous on the question of abortion, both in procuring one and assisting in the practice: ""Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion,"" the catechism says. ""This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable.""""Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,"" it says, before calling abortion and infanticide ""abominable crimes.""It also declares that ""Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life.""However, despite that clarity, liberal Catholic politicians have consistently attempted to try and align their Catholic beliefs with their support of abortion rights. Then New York Gov. Mario Cuomo famously declared himself personally opposed to abortion in 1984, but said he could not impose that view on the country. But since then, Democrats such as Pelosi have been more full throated in their support of pro-abortion policies. President Biden, also a Catholic, had once supported the Hyde Amendment -- which prevented U.S. funding going to pay for abortions abroad. He flipped on that amendment when he ran for president in 2020, and recently described ""a woman’s right to choose"" as ""fundamental.""Sept. 8, 2021: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., meets with reporters to discuss President Joe Biden's domestic agenda including passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill and pushing through a Democrats-only expansion of the social safety net, the at the Capitol in Washington.

Scott Applewhite)Cordileone says in his letter that he wrote to her on April 7, informing her that ""should you not publicly repudiate your advocacy for abortion ‘rights’ or else refrain from referring to your Catholic faith in public and receiving Holy Communion, I would have no choice but to make a declaration, in keeping with canon 915, that you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion."" He says that since that time, she has not done so.""Therefore, in light of my responsibility as the Archbishop of San Francisco to be 'concerned for all the Christian faithful entrusted to [my] care"" (Code of Canon Law, can. 383, §1), by means of this communication I am hereby notifying you that you are not to present yourself for Holy Communion and, should you do so, you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion, until such time as you publically repudiate your advocacy for the legitimacy of abortion and confess and receive absolution of this grave sin in the sacrament of Penance."" he said.Pelosi has sparred with the Church for years on the matter as she has tried to present herself both as a ""devout"" Catholic, while also a full-throated supporter of a practice that the Catholic Church condemns as a moral evil.PELOSI'S BISHOP CALLS FOR MASSIVE ‘CAMPAIGN OF PRAYER AND FASTING’ FOR ‘HER CONVERSION OF HEART’ ON ABORTION In a 2008 interview, Pelosi claimed that ""as a devout, practicing Catholic,"" the Church has ""not been able to make that definition"" of when life begins -- a remark that brought a slew of criticism from a number of top U.S. bishops – and then said that ""the point is, it shouldn't have an impact on the woman's right to choose."" In that interview she also said she wanted abortion to be ""rare.""But in the wake of the leaked opinion this month suggesting that the Supreme Court will soon overturn Roe v Wade, Pelosi has not talked about reducing abortion, but she has continued to claim that her pro-choice stance is in line with Catholic teaching.San Francisco's Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone conducts an exorcism Saturday, Oct. 17, 2020, outside of Saint Raphael Catholic Church in San Rafael, Calif., on the spot where a statue of St. Junipero Serra was toppled during a protest on Oct. 12. (Jessica Christian/San Francisco Chronicle via AP) ""This [topic] really gets me burned up in case you didn't notice, because again I'm very Catholic, devout, practicing, all of that. They would like to throw me out. But I'm not going because I don't want to make their day,"" she said this month.""For too long Catholic public officials have created confusion and disunity by advocating for policies that destroy innocent human life – in direct contradiction of the teachings of the Catholic faith,"" Brian Burch, the president of advocacy group CatholicVote, said after Cordileone's announcement. ""The persistent disobedience of these public officials is a source of enormous sadness and scandal that begged for a response.""  Pelosi met with Pope Francis last year, where the Vatican did not say if the topic of abortion was discussed. Pope Francis has compared having an abortion to hiring a hitman but has also been cautious about suggesting politicians be barred from communion.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""I have never refused the Eucharist to anyone,"" the pope said last year, although he said that he did not recall a time when a politician stood staunchly against Church teaching on abortion and came to him for communion. He referred to communion as ""a gift"" and not ""a prize for the perfect.""  In that same interview, however, he emphasized that the Catholic Church views abortion as homicide. ""Whoever has an abortion kills,"" the pope said.

""It would negate Ohio's law that we've had on the books for many, many years that prohibits partial birth abortion.""The future of partial birth and late-term abortion in Ohio has become a prominent topic among opponents of Issue 1, including Protect Women Ohio who has pointed to a $100,000 contribution from Dr. Martin Haskell, a Dayton area doctor whom they describe as ""the inventor of the partial-birth abortion procedure,"" made in support of the constitutional amendment. OVER 100 OHIO BLACK PASTORS SIGN LETTER OPPOSING MEASURE ENSHRINING ABORTION IN CONSTITUTION: 'MORAL ISSUE'Ohio Gov Mike DeWine speaks to Fox News Digital in Columbus, Ohio  (Fox News Digital)""It also really strikes at parents rights and the relationship between a parent and in this case, a daughter,"" DeWine said. ""We have a law that says that you have to have parental consent in regard to a minor getting an abortion that would be knocked out by this constitutional amendment as well. So it would put Ohio in a small category of the most permissive states in the union in regard to abortion. I just don't think it fits Ohio. It's not who we are. It's not where we are.""DeWine told Fox News Digital that the groups supporting a ""Yes"" vote on Issue 1 have run deceptive ads about what the amendment would do.  ""I think that the people who are doing these ads that are for issue one are misleading people,"" DeWine said. One ad talked about the amendment guaranteeing help in regard to miscarriages, said DeWine, but that's not an issue. ""Medical assistance is out there. I mean, we have hospitals. They do what they do, doctors. So they're wrapping this into things that are certainly already well taken care of by the medical community and our hospitals and our doctors. So just, you know, I think it's a very misleading campaign that they're running.""CATHOLICS CALL FOR REMOVAL OF 'ABHORRENT' PRO-ABORTION AD OVER DEPICTION OF JESUS CHRISTOhio Gov. Mike DeWine said pro-abortion groups have misled voters on Issue 1, which will be on the ballot in November (AP Photo/Matt Freed)DeWine said he doesn't believe Ohio has ever overturned a constitutional amendment that was approved by the people, which means that if this amendment passes it is likely to be permanent. DeWine explained that even under Roe v. Wade, Ohio was permitted to implement some restrictions on abortion and that this amendment would go even further and invalidate those measures. Even Roe, and another abortion precedent-setting Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, ""allowed Ohio and other states to put some guardrails around abortion,"" DeWine said. ""Parental notification was one. Another law that we have in regard to someone with a disability, a child with a disability. You could not have an abortion specifically for the reason that that child was Down's syndrome. You know, these are guardrails… would just go away because this is a constitutional amendment.""Many political pundits have concluded that abortion, and the reversal of Roe v. Wade, was an issue that hurt Republicans in last year’s midterm elections preventing them from achieving a ""Red Wave"" result that gave them commanding control in Congress.OHIO ABORTION VOTE THIS NOVEMBER CONSIDERED 2024 PRESIDENTIAL BELLWETHER BY DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANSA group of people protests outside the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. (REUTERS/Seth Herald)However, every governor in the United States that signed abortion restrictions into law won re-election last November in states that included Iowa, Idaho, Florida, South Dakota, Tennessee, South Carolina, Wyoming, Georgia, and in even Ohio. DeWine signed a heartbeat law prohibiting abortions after 6 weeks and won a landslide re-election victory by 25 points.When asked by Fox News Digital how DeWine was able to effectively communicate the abortion issue, he said he has ""tried to focus on the science.""""Even if you have people who pro-choice and think that abortion should be allowed at some point up until a certain point, I don't know anybody who thinks that abortion should be permitted all the way up until birth,"" DeWine said. ""I mean that just strikes most people as going too far… I think part of my job is to try, and Fran and I, my wife and I were trying to do with this ad, is just to let people know exactly how radical this constitutional amendment is.""DeWine said that most voters he has interacted with don’t want to talk about abortion because it is an ""unpleasant subject"" which is why he filmed the ad from his kitchen to speak directly to Ohio voters and let them know that wherever they stand on the abortion issue, this measure is too ""radical"" to enshrine in the state constitution.When asked what he would tell an Ohioan who is undecided on how to vote on Issue 1, the governor said that voters ""don’t have to take my word for it"" but need only to ""look at the language of the constitutional amendment and look at how the courts have defined things in the past.""DEMOCRATS' GRUESOME ABORTION VISION IS ALREADY A REALITY IN SOME STATESOhio’s Republican Attorney General Dave Yost put together a comprehensive analysis of what voting ""Yes"" on Issue one and approving the amendment would mean for abortions in the state and wrote that the language of the amendment ""creates a new, legal standard that goes beyond what Roe and Casey said.""""The Amendment would not return things to how they were before Dobbs overruled Roe, and is not just ‘restoring Roe,’"" Yost said. ""It goes further.""Yost wrote that several abortion restrictions in the state would be invalidated if the new amendment passes including the Heartbeat Act, the Down Syndrome discrimination law, and the law prohibiting partial birth abortion.Additionally, Yost concludes that several other aspects related to abortion might not immediately be invalidated but will face serious legal challenges with an ""uncertain outcome"" in courts due to the language of the bill. Those issues include 24-hour waiting period and informed consent, Ohio law that requires a doctor to inform a minor’s parents before performing an abortion on a pregnant minor, abortion pill safety regulations, limits against taxpayer funds for abortion providers.Supporters of Issue 1, including Ohio Citizen Action, have made the argument that voters ""are faced with a critical choice to stand up for our personal autonomy"" and that ""personal decisions should be made by individuals and their families, free from intrusive government oversight.""""It's pretty clear that this constitutional amendment just goes farther, much further than what the average Ohioan approves,"" DeWine told Fox News Digital CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP An attendee holds a rosary as she prays during a ""rosary rally"" on Sunday, Aug. 6, 2023, in Norwood, Ohio.

If they're okay with that, then they should vote for this,"" DeWine added. ""If you think that parents need to be involved and your daughter or anybody's daughter needs parents to be involved, and you think that abortion should not be permitted all the way up until the time of birth, then this constitutional amendment is not right and people should vote against it.""Fox News Digital's Aubrie Spady contributed to this reportAndrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Ron DeSantis and cleared the way for the imminent enforcement of a 6-week ban, which Democrats have already attacked as ""MAGA extremism"", it also approved a ballot measure in November allowing Florida voters to decide whether to enshrine abortion access into the state constitution.The Florida ruling comes shortly after voters in Ohio, where Trump won by 8 points in 2020, overwhelmingly voted in favor of a constitutional amendment allowing abortion. Several pro-life advocates spoke to Fox News Digital about what the post-Roe v. Wade battle will look like in Florida.""The abortion businesses pushing this extreme amendment know the heartbeat law is supported by the majority of Floridians and second- and third-trimester abortion is wildly unpopular,"" Katie Glenn Daniel, Tampa lawyer and SBA Pro-Life America State Policy Director, told Fox News Digital. OHIO VOTERS APPROVE AMENDMENT ENSHRINING ABORTION ACCESS INTO STATE CONSTITUTIONA group of anti-abortion protesters crashes the Women's March Action Rally for Reproductive Rights at Mariachi Plaza in Los Angeles, California, on Oct. 8, 2022.

Despite the clear fact that emergency care continues to be available to pregnant women in all 50 states, they will rely on the lie women won’t receive medical care and sow confusion that puts women’s lives in danger.""Daniel explained that in order to avoid a similar result as Ohio, prominent Floridians must persuasively articulate what the abortion measure means for residents.""Gov. Ron DeSantis must be at the forefront of protecting Florida from Big Abortion’s attempt to eliminate the rights of unborn children, parents, women, and girls,"" Daniel said. ""Gov. DeSantis signed protections for babies who feel pain and have a heartbeat into law and now he must lead in defending those protections.""Since Roe v. Wade was overturned and the issue was given back to the states, Republicans have suffered several defeats at the ballot box that many pundits attribute to poor messaging on abortion from the GOP but some pro-life advocates, including Caitlin Connors, southern regional director for SBA Pro-Life America, have made the case that Democrats are not where the majority of Americans are on abortion. PRO-LIFE GROUPS REJECT MEDIA NARRATIVE THAT GOP CAN'T WIN ON ABORTION AFTER OHIO DEFEAT: 'NOT A LOSING ISSUE'""The media narrative that late-term abortion is a political winner is wrong.

Their extreme position is not a winner with the American people and Republicans must continue to expose the Democrat position for voters across America.""Prominent Democrats have already begun promoting the idea that a wave of turnout for the abortion measure will not only constitutionally override the state’s current abortion bans but could also benefit President Biden’s effort to carry Florida in November which would be a crushing blow to former President Trump’s campaign. ""More and more people are realizing how wrong these bans are and you've seen it across the country, whenever there have been ballot initiatives, no matter how red the state is, the people rise up for women's reproductive freedom here,"" North Carolina Democratic Gov.

The last time that a Democratic presidential candidate won Florida was when there was an anti-abortion measure on the ballot. So this is something that Floridians pay attention to. That was President Barack Obama in 2012. So I am optimistic that it will pass the finish line in November.""Republicans outnumber Democrats in Florida by a wide margin and a recent Politico analysis suggested that recent abortion ballot measures did not significantly boost Democrat turnout. Still, Biden campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez said on the zoom call, ""We definitely see Florida in play.""After the Ohio defeat, pro-life groups assessed that part of the reason for the result was being massively outspent and pointed to what they said was misleading language in the abortion amendment, two things that they say must be addressed in Florida. ""Our campaign will ensure that Florida voters won’t be fooled by the misleading amendment language and ensure that the abortion industry and out of state abortion extremists who have spent nearly $20 million on their campaign so far won’t succeed in their efforts to enact one of the most extreme abortion amendment proposals in America,"" Sara Johnson, grassroots director of Florida Voters Against Extremism, told Fox News Digital. ""No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider,"" the ballot measure, known as Amendment 4, states. ""This amendment does not change the Legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.""Florida Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody, in an amicus brief that was denied by the court, argued the wording is misleading for several reasons including not defining the term ""viability."" ""The ballot summary here is part of a … design to lay ticking time bombs that will enable abortion proponents later to argue that the amendment has a much broader meaning than voters would ever have thought,"" Moody argued in a previous brief.""The ballot language incorrectly implies that the amendment will not impact parental rights when their children seek abortions. Currently, Florida requires parental consent, with limited exceptions, before a physician can perform an abortion on a minor,"" SBA Pro-Life America argued in a brief. ""If the proposed amendment passes, this statute will likely be another casualty. The loss of parental consent is obscured in the ballot language, which highlights that the proposed amendment will not change the constitutional right to parental notification, leading voters to assume that the right to parental consent will be similarly untouched.""ABORTION PILL USE HAS SPIKED IN RECENT YEARS, NEW REPORT REVEALS: ‘SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE’Abortion rights adovcates gather in front of the J Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas (MOISES AVILA/AFP via Getty Images)""Not only will this measure bring dangerous late-term abortions back to Florida, but it will allow girls who aren’t old enough to get their ears pierced on their own get an abortion without a parent’s okay,"" SBA added in a press release. ""Those girls and the women who have abortions will be put at risk when this measure eliminates every abortion health regulation on the books.

""And with good reason—they stand to benefit most if Florida becomes a late-term abortion destination and the state cannot enforce basic health and safety guidelines or even inspect their facilities. One thing is certain, their message won’t explain how extreme this amendment is and won’t focus on the ACLU’s new lawsuit in Ohio where they’re challenging whether an informed consent law allowed under Roe is permitted after the amendment.""Pro-abortion groups have pointed out that abortion restrictions have been implemented across the entire deep south since Roe’s reversal and suggested the Florida vote will be a rallying cry against those nationwide efforts.Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said in a statement her organization had seen the negative impact from abortion bans on patients in Florida.

Brian Kemp won his re-election in the Peach State, it is unclear what role the ""winning issue"" will play in the Georgia Senate runoff between Sen. Raphael Warnock and GOP candidate Herschel Walker on Dec. 6.A Fox News poll from late October, conducted before the election, found that at 38%, inflation was the top issue to Georgians — an increase from 28% in July. Among inflation voters, Walker was ahead by 43 points. Abortion was the most important issue to 18% of voters and election integrity was on the top of the minds to 12%, with Warnock leading both groups by at least 40 points.

About 62% of Georgians either somewhat or strongly oppose the state's law, passed in 2019, that restricts abortions once cardiac activity can be detected by an ultrasound, which usually lands around the sixth week of pregnancy, while 32.3% either somewhat or strongly support the law. The poll was conducted from September to Oct. 4, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Though a majority of voters may disagree with Georgia's pro-life Heartbeat BIll — which restricts abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected and was recently blocked by a federal judge — it did not stop Governor Kemp, a strong proponent bill's, from winning his statewide race in November.Abortion was a leading issue of the 2022 midterm elections.

If the goal was to assuage concerns about his age and viability, it couldn't have gone worse.Shortly after the debate began and Biden began his notably halting, unsure and raspy performance, the takes began pouring in, and it didn't get better in the aftermath. From calls to step aside from the nomination to outright emotional reactions from his fervent supporters, here are 10 of the most eye-opening media responses to Biden's debate showing: BIDEN'S 'DISASTER' DEBATE PERFORMANCE SPARKS MEDIA MELTDOWN, CALLS FOR HIM TO WITHDRAW FROM 2024 RACEMSNBC host Joy Reid appeared downtrodden as she said her phone was buzzing with Obamaworld and Bidenworld figures frantically texting her with concerns that Biden appeared ""extremely feeble and weak,"" adding that his performance left many in his own party rattled heading into November.""My phone really never stopped buzzing throughout. And the universal reaction was somewhere approaching panic,"" Reid said.""The people who were texting with me were very concerned about President Biden seeming extremely feeble, seeming extremely weak,"" she continued. ""Joe Biden’s job was to reassure them tonight. His job was to calm his party, to make them feel that, ‘Yes, I can do this. I have four more years in me. I have the ability and the stamina and the strength to do four more' … He did not do that. He did the opposite of that.""MSNBC host Alex Wagner, who joined the channel from the debate spin room in Atlanta, painted a grim picture when asked about the mood among Democrats and Biden allies on site.""I am not going to put a fine sheen on it or a spin on it, even though I am in the spin room. There has been a uniformly negative reaction to Biden’s performance tonight,"" a dejected Wagner told viewers. The MSNBC host, who is married to former President Obama's White House chef, said Biden is ""battling a caricature of himself as an enfeebled person"" and did nothing to disabuse ""the notion that he is very old and was lost frequently in that debate.""""He turned a response on abortion into a mention of a migrant killing. I mean, this is a person that clearly was over-prepared and had a lot of different points that were sort of swimming around in his head, and as a result, it felt like the answers that were legible, if you will, were not nearly delivered with the force and the clarity that they should’ve been,"" she said. CNN political commentator and former Obama adviser Van Jones appeared close to tears following the widely panned debate showing.""I just want to speak from my heart,"" Jones said. ""I love that guy. That’s a good man. He loves his country. He‘s doing the best that he can, but he had a test to meet tonight to restore confidence of the country and of the base. And he failed to do that. And there‘s a lot of people who are going to want to see him consider taking a different course now.""""We‘re still far from our convention, and there is time for this party to figure out a different way forward, if he will allow us to do that,"" he continued. ""But that was not what we needed from Joe Biden, and it’s personally painful for a lot of people. It‘s not just panic, it’s pain of what we saw tonight."" Jones shared the clip on social media with the caption, ""I love Joe Biden. But tonight's debate hurt.""MEDIA CALLS FOR BIDEN TO WITHDRAW FROM 2024 RACE AFTER 'DISASTER' CNN DEBATE PERFORMANCE: ‘IT’S OVER'CNN’s Anderson Cooper took a serious tone when he welcomed Vice President Kamala Harris following the debate and quickly put an emphasis on Biden’s poor performance. ""Democratic lawmakers watching the debate were worried about the performance. One said it was a disaster and another called it a train wreck. Those are Democrats especially worried that Biden did not punch back on Trump‘s lies,"" Cooper said. Harris tried to pivot to lambasting Trump as a liar and laid out a detailed case against their opponent's record, but Cooper cut her off. ""All that may be true, but the President of the United States was not able to make that case to Donald Trump on the stage tonight,"" Cooper said. ""You debated against then-Vice President Biden four years ago, and he was a very different person on the stage four years ago when you debated him. That‘s certainly true, is it not?""Harris suggested that Biden’s record is more important than one 90-minute debate, but Cooper continued to press.""Can you say that you are not concerned at all having watched the president‘s performance tonight?"" Cooper asked. It's lost much of its sway, but the once-prominent news aggregator Drudge Report drew attention over its banner blaring Thursday night, ""OPERATION: REPLACE BIDEN.""""DEMS SCRAMBLE WITH 130 DAYS TO GO!

He Must Bow Out of the Race.""""I watched the Biden-Trump debate alone in a Lisbon hotel room, and it made me weep. I cannot remember a more heartbreaking moment in American presidential campaign politics in my lifetime — precisely because of what it revealed: Joe Biden, a good man and a good president, has no business running for re-election,"" Friedman wrote. ""The Biden family and political team must gather quickly and have the hardest of conversations with the president, a conversation of love and clarity and resolve,"" he continued. ""To give America the greatest shot possible of deterring the Trump threat in November, the president has to come forward and declare that he will not be running for re-election and is releasing all of his delegates for the Democratic National Convention.""He added: ""Biden has been a friend of mine since we traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan together after 9/11, when he chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so I say all of the above with great sadness.""Later in the day, The New York Times editorial board called for Biden to leave the race in a stunning piece. ""President Biden has repeatedly and rightfully described the stakes in this November’s presidential election as nothing less than the future of American democracy,"" the editorial board began Friday. ""Mr. Biden has said that he is the candidate with the best chance of taking on this threat of tyranny and defeating it. His argument rests largely on the fact that he beat Mr. Trump in 2020,"" the Time editorial board continued.

Wade ahead of the looming midterms elections. ""Everyone knows that the so-called mainstream media is dominated by Democrat reporters, so it should come as no surprise that when these Democrat reporters cover controversial issues like abortion, they're going to frame it in a way that fits their viewpoint,"" Article III Project founder Mike Davis told Fox News Digital. Davis, who has worked for all three branches of the federal government including for President George W. Bush, led the outside support team for Justice Neil Gorsuch’s successful confirmation to the Supreme Court. He believes the media makes ""pro-abortion activists"" look like they’re the mainstream while dismissing the views of pro-life conservatives, a practice that has been amplified since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year. MSNBC HOST CLAIMS PRO-LIFE CHRISTIANS ARE ‘PERVERTING THE GOSPEL,’ CLAIMS JESUS IS NOT ANTI-ABORTIONAnti-abortion demonstrators outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., after the ruling on Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022. (Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg via Getty Images)""The pro-life people, the Catholic people who oppose abortion, these reporters make them look like they're extreme and outside the mainstream. These reporters pretend like abortion up until the moment of birth is within the mainstream when it's absolutely not,"" Davis continued. ""But any reasonable restriction on abortion, including parental consent for minors, or limiting abortion in the second and third trimester, the media pretends like these are the most extremist measures."" NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck feels the media coverage and tone towards abortion is one that refuses to understand or even see the pro-life argument. While Davis senses many reporters and pundits dismiss pro-life conservatives, Houck isn’t sure coastal elites have even interacted in a meaningful way with Americans from outside their liberal bubbles. ""We often talk in the media business, or media watchdog business, about how the media have almost a zoo-like view of people with whom they disagree or with whom they have a different world view or life experience, where they come upon a pro-life or a conservative who is Christian, along with a lot of other mainstream conservative values, and they almost want to tap on the window, and tap on the glass, or they want to observe conservatives almost as if they're caged animals out in the wild, trying to study them and trying to understand them,"" Houck said, adding that many liberals can’t comprehend pro-life views.  ""They don't know many pro-lifers and conservatives in their families and in their friend group in Washington, D.C. and New York and Los Angeles, the three main media hubs in this country,"" Houck said. ""And so, because of that, a lot of stories that are important to pro-lifers, such as the attacks on pro-life centers following the Supreme Court decision and the draft leak overturning Roe v Wade, it really didn't occur to a lot of folks in the left-wing media to cover those things and I think a lot of it, some of it at least, was not out of purposeful censorship or cynicism. I think it all it just did not occur to them that this thing could be happening."" MSNBC’S JOY REID COMPARES SCOTUS ABORTION DECISION TO SLAVERY: ‘WHAT ALITO SAID IS, YOUR STATE OWNS YOUR BODY’""They are very hell-bent with almost religious devotion to their pro-choice views, and anyone trying to stand in the way of that is somehow hateful and sexist and bigoted and so on and so forth,"" he added. Another key factor in how abortion is covered by the media is a key lack of nuance and detail when it comes to reporting on conservative views, critics argue, as well as a willful double standard on nomenclature.""Every mainstream media outlet curiously uses the term ‘anti-abortion’ to refer to pro-lifers but doesn’t use the term ‘pro-abortion' to refer to ""pro-choicers,'"" conservative radio host for WCBM Amber Athey said. ""If you agree that a woman should have the ‘right’ or ‘choice’ to kill her child, then yes, you support abortion and are thus pro-abortion. These labels matter and are just one of the ways the media tacitly denigrates the pro-life movement in their reportage.""Davis feels that Democrats ""raise a significant amount of money for their candidates and causes from the abortion industry,"" so their allies in the mainstream media have a clear incentive to protect the source of cash. As a result, unpopular third trimester abortions are sometimes grouped with early-term abortions. ""There is overwhelming support to severely limit abortions in the third trimester, but the media tries to lump the first, second and third trimesters together to make any restrictions on abortions up until the moment of birth look like it's extreme and outside the mainstream,"" Davis said. ‘SICK’ JOURNALIST FANTASIZES ABOUT ALITO’S DEATH, COMPOSES ‘PREWRITTEN OBITUARY’ FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICEHouck agrees and feels there is a ""purposeful lack of nuance"" in the media’s coverage of abortion. ""I think that's very clear that there is no difference in the media's eyes between a 30-week abortion, 38-week abortion and a three-week abortion,"" Houck said.""The media loves to challenge the GOP on abortion, and they are running for office, so it's fair, but they don't challenge the Democrats on what limit -- if any -- they would place on abortion. Talking to all candidates on abortion would be balanced. But that is not happening,"" Kristi Hamrick of Students for Life told Fox News Digital.WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 19:  Pro-life activists try to block the sign of a pro-choice activist during the 2018 March for Life January 19, 2018 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) (Alex Wong/Getty Images)Examples of over-the-top abortion opinions and one-sided reporting are plentiful. CNN’s Ana Navarro controversially evoked her own family members who have special needs when attempting to justify abortion legalization. MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough suggested pro-life Christians are misbelievers because there is ""nothing"" in the Bible that says abortion is wrong, and his colleague Joy Reid compared states determining if abortion is legal to slavery. MSNBC’s ""The Cross Connection"" featured a debate in which a guest called pro-life Republicans ""fascists."" New York magazine claimed the pro-life movement relies on ""undemocratic tools."" ""The View"" co-host Whoopi Golberg told ABC viewers that God supports abortion. MSNBC’s Claire McCaskill said the GOP wants ""dogs sniffing women at airports"" to prevent out-of-state abortions.KAVANAUGH ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IGNORED BY SUNDAY SHOWS NBC News Washington correspondent Yamiche Alcindor recently claimed that she has spoken to a number of Republican women that are voting for Democrats for the first time because of ""enthusiasm"" surrounding abortion, while a Washington Post columnist likened support of abortion restrictions to a ""modern-day Inquisition."" Left-wing outlet Teen Vogue urged readers to ""fight like hell"" for Democrat Stacey Abrams in the Georgia gubernatorial election because ""lives are at stake"" over abortion restrictions.Other examples are more subtle, and on occasion, viewers have a good idea where reporters billed as nonpartisan stand on the polarizing issue even if they don’t acknowledge it until after leaving the industry. Kate Smith, who covered ""abortion access"" for CBS from 2018 until 2021, quit her job last year so she could speak out on abortion rights. She had long come under fire from conservative critics for bringing an agenda to her reporting during her time at CBS News and was once called ""Planned Parenthood's Ambassador to CBS News"" in a scathing profile by National Review. The profile noted Smith’s friendly coverage of Planned Parenthood and tendency to rely on pro-choice sources and opinions in her news articles. Last year when Smith quit CBS, she immediately spoke out about her support for abortion rights, and she has since joined Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, as its senior director of news content.FORMER CBS REPORTER BECOMES PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S 'NEWS CONTENT' DIRECTOR""It's noteworthy that CBS had Kate Smith as its abortion reporter and then Kate went in-house to Planned Parenthood. So, Planned Parenthood didn't have to have their outside spokespeople at CBS do their bidding anymore. They just brought Kate Smith in-house,"" Davis said. Sometimes bias is obvious only to viewers tuned into the media landscape despite attempts by the reporter or pundit to masquerade as neutral. Such was the case earlier this year, as CNN relied on then-chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin for punditry regarding the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The decision raised eyebrows, as critics felt Toobin has a severe conflict of interest.CNN BLASTED FOR HAVING JEFFREY TOOBIN DOMINATE SCOTUS COVERAGE AFTER HE PRESSURED MISTRESS TO HAVE ABORTIONToobin, a reliably liberal pundit who has since left CNN, fathered a child in 2009 with Casey Greenfield, the daughter of Toobin's one-time CNN colleague Jeff Greenfield. Toobin urged Greenfield to have an abortion, reportedly even offering money to terminate the pregnancy. Toobin was later taken to court after he denied the child was his, but was ordered to pay child support after he was forced to take a DNA test which proved he was the child's biological father.""Absolutely wild to have CNN go to Toobin for abortion commentary,"" GOP strategist Matt Whitlock reacted.""If anyone knows anything about forced abortion it's Toobin,"" Versus Media podcast host Stephen Miller quipped.Toobin offered a grim prediction if abortion becomes outlawed nationally, pointing to similar bans in Central and South American countries, saying, ""The rate of abortion does not go down when abortion is banned... what's different is that women die and women are horribly mutilated because abortion is conducted in an unsafe way.""Davis noted that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade more than two months ago, but Americans aren’t exactly seeing ""women dying in back alley abortions like the Democrats proclaimed would happen,"" which would surely command wall-to-wall coverage by the mainstream media if the tragic scenario predicted by Toobin actually occurred. ""What's happening is, democracy is working in the 50 states. Kansas just rejected abortion regulations, and so it's going to be up to the states instead of five unelected, lifetime-appointed justices on the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., who are deciding these issues,"" Davis said. Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider. The media has even attempted to hold corporate America’s feet to the fire when it comes to abortion. The Washington Post published a report on how the video game industry has been ""mostly silent"" on the fight to preserve Roe v. Wade and tried to get some of the biggest names in gaming to plant their flag on the battlefield. Business magazine Fast Company similarly sought out corporations to take a stand on abortion by urging them to take a ""survey,"" CBS host Nate Burleson pressed Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan about whether his company will cover travel expenses for women to get abortions in other states, and CBS' Gayle King asked United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby if he intends to ""speak out publicly about these issues.""Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh came alarmingly close to being the victim of an assassination attempt in June in the aftermath of the controversial Politico report of a leaked draft opinion indicating the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, but the media largely yawned at the development after an initial wave of coverage of the breaking news. The New York Times put the story on page A20 the following day, and the threat didn't make the front page of USA Today or the Chicago Tribune. MSNBC's primetime shows between 8 and 11 p.m. ignored it that evening, and the Sunday talk shows on ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN ignored it completely. LEGALLY RECOGNIZING 'PERSONHOOD' OF UNBORN BABIES WILL 'HARM' 'HEALTH' OF PREGNANT WOMEN: NY TIMES GUEST ESSAYA study by Houck's NewsBusters, a right-leaning media watchdog, found ABC, CBS and NBC's morning shows on Thursday, the day after the incident, devoted three times more coverage to previewing that evening's primetime Jan. 6 committee hearing than the threat to Kavanaugh's life.Many suspect that abortion will be highlighted ahead of the critical upcoming midterm elections, as Democrats and their allies in the press feel it’s an issue that could help them at the polls. ""We've been seeing from ‘CBS Mornings’ in particular, one of the broadcast network shows, that they are continuing to focus on abortion and try to make abortion a focus, portraying it as the number one issue for voters, while sometimes hilariously slipping into the piece either towards the end or buried somewhere in the middle, that, oh, actually, voters believe that is the economy,"" Houck said. Aaron Gardner, a Republican candidate for State Senate in Michigan, was recently featured in a four-minute segment on CNN. ""State of the Union"" anchor Dana Bash went around the Michigan State Fair speaking with attendees as the network’s on-screen graphic said, ""In battleground Michigan, abortion politics take center stage."" Bash spent the first two minutes of the segment speaking with voters who are concerned about the GOP stance on abortion, spotlighting Republican Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon’s conservative views and highlighting Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s pro-choice agenda. NBC’S ALCINDOR SAYS REPUBLICAN WOMEN VOTING DEMOCRAT FOR FIRST TIME OVER NEW ‘ENTHUSIASM' ON ABORTIONBash then spoke to Gardner, who was essentially the token conservative to offer the opposing view. He believes Michiganders are much more concerned with issues such as jobs, if their kids are safe in school, the housing market, the cost of gas, rising crime rates and the economy, but was only on-screen for about 20 seconds.""Mainstream media isn’t only informing the public about issues. They are putting their thumb on the scale by attempting to dictate what issues are important the voters by editing quotes to fit their narrative,"" Gardner told Fox News Digital. ""This is not journalism -- it is political advocacy. Right now, mainstream media is pushing an issue such as abortion, to misguide the public and distract them from the issues they think about upon waking up.""Bash managed to find a critic of Whitmer at the state fair, who told CNN that he preferred Dixon, but she needs ""to be more liberal with that abortion situation."" When CNN shared the clip on social media, the quote about needing to be more liberal with abortion was used to promote the segment. As Americans are hit with hidden agendas, bias by omission and refusal to understand the pro-life argument, Houck feels the ""pretty huge double standard"" can be easily summed up simply by noting the lack-of attention given to the March for Life compared to glowing coverage the Women’s March receives from the mainstream media. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""From 2013 to 2016, there was only a combined one minute and 40 seconds on those four Marches for Life. And in 2017, because Donald Trump had taken the White House with the support of pro-lifers, the coverage had ballooned to nearly 22 minutes, but that still paled in comparison to over 75 minutes on the broadcast network morning and evening newscasts looking at the Women's March, and things only went downhill from there,"" Houck said. Fox News’ Andrew Kugle, David Rutz and Joseph A.

Wade.According to new data published on Sunday by FiveThirtyEight, there were 10,570 fewer abortions that would have otherwise occurred in the two months after the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which allowed states to determine their own abortion limitations. Data released this week by #WeCount, a subsidiary of pro-abortion non-profit Society of Family Planning, projects that 60,000 fewer abortions will occur in the United States over the next year due to new abortion bans in 18 Republican-led states.Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the non-profit civil rights law firm that helped litigate the Dobbs case, celebrated the projection of fewer abortions in the #WeCount data, but also urged Republican states to continue to offer programs and incentives for helping women who won't receive an abortion.""We celebrate fewer abortions, but these decreases are not nearly enough,"" said Denise Harle, senior counsel for ADF. THE END OF ROE HAS PREVENTED AT LEAST 10,000 LEGAL ABORTIONS: REPORTHarle stated that corporate America and the Biden administration are pushing policies to ""advance an abortion industry-endorsed agenda"" with free transportation for abortion and time off, while ""pro-life states are offering real support.""Pro-life demonstrators outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on Friday, June 24, 2022.

Ron DeSantis discusses his campaign efforts in Iowa, the Colorado Supreme Courts decision to remove Trump from the ballot and the growing crisis at the border.In the second half of the Supreme Court’s 2023-2024, the justices are set to hear some blockbuster cases on topics ranging from First Amendment rights of social media companies, the abortion pill and the power of federal agencies. After a brief winter break, the high court will resume oral arguments on Jan. 8, which will continue through the spring, with opinions expected to be issued early summer.Here are some of the high-profile cases to watch.NRA FINDS SURPRISING ALLY IN ACLU FOR SUPREME COURT CHALLENGE TO NY BLACKLIST ALLEGATIONThe Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)ARGUMENT DATE: Not yet setAT ISSUE: Whether social media platforms’ handling of user content is protected by the First Amendment. THE CASE: Separate laws in Florida and Texas would require large companies like X and Facebook to host third-party communications and would prevent those businesses from blocking or removing users' posts based on political viewpoints. THE ARGUMENTS: The laws aim to address what some lawmakers call ""censoring"" of conservative messages and banning politicians like former President Trump for violating policies over offensive or ""problematic"" content. A federal appeals court had ruled for the tech industry in the Florida case, saying as private entities, those companies were ""engaged in constitutionally protected expressive activity when they moderate and curate the content that they disseminate on their platforms.""IMPACT: Trump and a coalition of 16 states are among those filing separate amicus briefs supporting Florida. The Biden administration has opposed the state laws.SPECIAL COUNSEL IN TRUMP CASE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, FORMER REAGAN AG SAYSA crew member throws a pollock fish while another sorts through the nets off the coast of Maine. (Photo by Mailee Osten-Tan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)ARGUMENT DATE: Jan. 17AT ISSUE: Potential far-reaching appeal over another legal effort to have the so-called ""Chevron"" deference overturned by the Supreme Court. That 1984 ruling says when congressional federal laws are not clearly defined, federal agencies should be allowed broad discretion to interpret and enforce those policies. THE CASE: Lead plaintiff Loper Bright Enterprises of New Jersey, represented by the Cause of Action Institute, challenges a federal mandate requiring Atlantic herring fishermen to pay more than $700 per day for monitors to ride their boats, observe their activities and report to the government.  SUPREME COURT DEALS FINAL BLOW TO ALABAMA GOP IN REDISTRCTING BATTLETHE ARGUMENTS: A federal appeals court found the National Marine Fisheries Service’s interpretation of a federal fishery law to be ""reasonable."" The fishermen argue Congress never granted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the authority to force fishermen to pay for monitors. Groups supporting them say the ""Chevron"" precedent forces courts to defer to an agency’s interpretation of ""ambiguous"" statutes. Those supporting continued deference say an adverse ruling would sow ""chaos"" across the federal government and would concentrate rulemaking authority with unelected judges, who are not experts in specific policy matters.THE IMPACT: Conservatives have long chafed at the ""Chevron"" decision. The high court has been incrementally reining in federal regulators, including a June 2022 decision limiting EPA authority over greenhouse gas emissions. Overturning ""Chevron"" or further weakening federal agency discretion would have enormous impacts on key areas like the environment, workplace safety, consumer protections, public health and immigration. The court has the option of broadly addressing the use of ""Chevron"" deference or clarifying specific areas of its application by federal agencies.ARGUMENT DATE: Not yet setAT ISSUE: Lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, one of two drugs typically used to induce a medical abortion.THE CASE: The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 to end a pregnancy, and it is used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol. That pill combination is approved for use up to the 10th week of pregnancy. SUPREME COURT TAKES CHALLENGE TO JAN. 6 CHARGE THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR TRUMPMifepristone, also known as RU-486, is a medication typically used in combination with misoprostol to bring about a medical abortion during pregnancy and manage early miscarriage. (Getty Images)THE ARGUMENTS: Groups opposing the FDA say it failed to follow proper procedures when determining the drug's safety risks. The Biden administration warned an adverse ruling would severely disrupt the way drugs are tested and brought to market. The Supreme Court has allowed the FDA to regulate the drug while the case is being litigated on its merits. While the case is still being litigated, a nationwide injunction could be issued by the judge, preventing medication abortions even in states where it remains legal. THE IMPACT: Any high court decision could impact 40 million women nationwide, and the Guttmacher Institute research group says more than half of all abortions in the U.S. use mifepristone. Supreme Court involvement in arguably the most contentious social issue could have enormous political implications in a presidential election year.ARGUMENT DATE: Not yet set AT ISSUE: Whether a bump stock device is a ""machine gun"" as defined under federal law, because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""THE CASE: In the wake of a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that bump stocks are machine guns. A bump stock is an attachment that allows a semiautomatic rifle to mimic a fully automatic weapon's ""cyclic firing rate to mimic nearly continuous automatic fire,"" according to ATF. The device essentially replaces the gun's stock and pistol grip and causes the weapon to buck back and forth, repeatedly ""bumping"" the trigger against the shooter's finger. Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several bump stocks under the ATF's rule. A bump stock is displayed on March 15, 2019, in Harrisonburg, Virginia. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File)THE ARGUMENTS: Mark Chenoweth, NCLA president and general counsel, said ""this is not a case about gun rights. It is a case about administrative power."" ""Congress never gave ATF the power to rewrite federal criminal statutes pertaining to machine guns—nor could it. Writing federal criminal laws is the sole preserve of Congress, and the Trump and Biden Administrations committed grievous constitutional error by trying to ban bump stocks without involving Congress. We are confident the U.S. Supreme Court will right this wrong for Michael Cargill and all Americans,"" Chenoweth said.THE IMPACT: Millions of lawful gun owners also own bump stocks prior to the ATF rule. Cargill’s lawyers say that ATF has admitted that the loss of property for law-abiding Americans, should the rule stand, would be upwards of $100 million. ARGUMENT DATE: Not yet setAT ISSUE: Whether a government regulator threatening regulated entities with adverse regulatory actions if they do business with a controversial speaker, allegedly because of the government's own hostility to the speaker's viewpoint, violates the First Amendment.THE CASE: The former superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), Maria T. Vullo, at the behest of then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, allegedly wielded DFS' regulatory power to financially blacklist the NRA – coercing banks and insurers to cut ties with the association, in an effort, the group says, to suppress its speech.THE ARGUMENTS: The NRA argues that Vullo’s actions were meant to silence the NRA – using ""guidance letters,"" backroom threats and other measures to cause financial institutions to ""drop"" the Association. The NRA's First Amendment claims withstood multiple motions to dismiss, but in 2022, after Vullo appealed the trial court’s ruling, the Second Circuit struck down the NRA’s claims. The court decided that in an era of ""enhanced corporate social responsibility,"" it was reasonable for New York's financial regulator to warn banks and insurance companies against servicing pro-gun groups based on the supposed ""social backlash"" against those groups’ advocacy. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE US NEWSTHE IMPACT: The NRA earned an unlikely bedfellow in the American Civil Liberties, who will argue in support of the gun rights group that they ideologically oppose, but agree that its free speech liberties were violated by the New York official.ARGUMENT DATE: Not yet set AT ISSUE: Whether a court of appeals correctly determined that the indictments in these three cases permissibly included a charge of corruptly obstructing, influencing or impeding an official proceeding, based on each petitioner’s violent conduct on Jan. 6, 2021.Then-President Trump supporters occupy the West Front of the Capitol and the inauguration stands on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021.

Camosy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," September 3, 2022 8:00am EDT","Planned Parenthood President Alexis McGill Johnson said on MSNBC's ""The ReidOut"" that abortion could be used as a political issue to ""save democracy"" in the midterms. There’s a bipartisan consensus that the Democrats' ""stunning turnaround"" in recent polls has a lot to do with abortion. Pew found that from March to August the percentage who said abortion was ""very important"" for the 2022 elections went from 43% to 56%. And during that time 538 recorded Republicans going from the 2.1% lead in the genetic ballot over Democrats to a 0.9% deficit. Abortion rights activists were ready to pounce as soon as Dobbs was decided. Much as what happened in Ireland when abortion activists there defeated their pro-life constitution, U.S. abortion activists have cynically seized on very rare (though admittedly difficult) cases involving the life and health of pregnant women — trying to paint a picture of massive numbers of women dying of laws protecting prenatal justice. But Irish law defended prenatal children as legal persons for decades, and they still had better health outcomes for women than their abortion-permissive neighbor, England. Poland has the lowest rate of maternal mortality in all of Europe despite having some of the strictest laws against abortion. Chile actually saw their maternal health numbers improve after they banned most abortions. RUBIO RESPONDS TO DEMINGS' COMMENTS, ACCUSES DEM OPPONENT OF SUPPORTING ABORTION 'AT ANY POINT'If U.S. pro-lifers had been ready for the activist onslaught, we could have been creating a (true) counter-narrative about the fact that pro-life hospitals and OB/GYNs are 100% committed to saving the lives of women. Graffiti and red paint found at Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center in Washington, D.C. (Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center)But not all the blame lies with activists. It is difficult to create a national counter-narrative, frankly, when the supposedly pro-life national party is running scared. Much attention was focused on the House special election for New York’s 19th District. As reported by Axios, the Democrat centered his campaign on abortion while the Republican ran away from the issue, focusing on the economy and crime. The Democrat won by the same margin Biden carried the district (two points) in 2020 — just the latest evidence that the expected red wave may be turning into a trickle. But what if Republicans in New York focused on the fact that the Empire State, after the passage of the Reproductive Health Act, is a haven for some of the worst abortion extremism in the entire world? What if Republicans all over the United States had a coherent campaign focusing on the fact that the Democratic Party itself stands for this same kind of extremism? Back in 2016 I wrote a joint op-ed in the Los Angeles Times showing that the party’s position was unequivocal support for abortion, with a pledge to repeal all state and federal laws restricting it. They even insisted that abortion was ""core to women’s, men’s, and young people’s health and wellbeing."" They removed protections for religious freedom and insisted pro-lifers should have to pay for abortions with our tax dollars. This position is about the most unpopular position one could take on almost any issue. Gallup consistently finds, for instance, that about 8-13% of Americans want no legal restrictions on abortion after 24 weeks. To put this into perspective, the worst approval rating for a president belonged to Harry Truman: 22%. The Democratic position on abortion is almost twice as unpopular as the most unpopular president in our history. If you can’t run against the Democrats on abortion, then you can’t run against them on anything. Here are just a handful of suggestions for the GOP to make the easy case against their opponents: The Democratic position on abortion is almost twice as unpopular as the most unpopular president in our history. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe GOP has been feckless on abortion for decades. Who could forget, for instance, Republican Timothy Murphy trying to coerce his mistress into having an abortion — despite his being a member of the congressional pro-life caucus!

With the limited equipment available at that time, the doctor could not detect a fetal heartbeat and suggested the parents terminate the pregnancy. Hopper said the doctor induced an abortion by giving her mother a shot. However, rather than die, Hopper was born at 3:25 a.m. on Nov. 29, 1955, weighing just 1 pound and 11 ounces. In the Faces of Choice video, Hopper said a nurse ""placed me in a bedpan on the back porch of the clinic."" Her grandmother and aunt later arrived at the clinic and contacted the police. A nurse helped transport Hopper to a hospital in Lakeland, Florida.The details of Hopper's account could not be fully verified. Hopper, who did not watch the GOP debate, said it was ""exciting,"" ""shocking"" and ""humbling"" to learn that DeSantis shared her story on the national platform. ""You know that you've known your story all your life, but you're not the only one out there to tell a story, that's got stories to tell.

Ohden is the founder and CEO of the Abortion Survivors Network. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)The number of abortion survivors in the U.S. is difficult to measure. According to the Abortion Survivors Network, only 10 U.S. states require reporting on babies born alive after attempted abortions, and these states have different standards on what it means to be ""born alive."" Some look for umbilical cord pulsation or a beating heart, and others state an infant born alive is an infant alive outside the mother's womb after an abortion procedure, the group says. Since 2019, the Abortion Survivors Network claims to have contacted nearly 650 abortion survivors — including Hopper. Founder and CEO Melissa Ohden, whose medical records show she survived an attempted saline abortion, told Fox News Digital there's a lack of public awareness that people can live through abortions. Her group will launch a campaign next month declaring September ""Babies Survive Abortions Awareness Month"" to challenge ""misconceptions"" and ""amplify personal stories that refute the notion that ‘Abortions don’t fail' and ‘There’s no such thing as an abortion survivor.'"" ""An abortion survivor is a baby who survives an attempt to abort them in the womb,"" Ohden said. ""Families are impacted by it. And so that's where we're launching this awareness campaign. But we don't just do awareness. We stand alongside moms who are experiencing abortions that fail, or they stop them."" Hopper's story will be featured in that campaign. She wants mothers who are pregnant and may be afraid that their pregnancy will ruin their lives to hear her story and have hope.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""There are organizations like Abortion Survivor Network that have created a platform for a woman to come and not only get and bring healing to this, to help her heal to the situation, but help her not choose abortion.

Not only was I a failed home abortion, but when I was transported to Lakeland regional, he would go out there and try to remove me because he thought I was going to be a burden,"" she recalled. ""As a child, I knew that my dad didn't want me as a baby because he would tell me, ‘I didn’t want you. But I love you now.'"" Hopper said that on his deathbed, her father ""looked at me, and he said, ‘Honey, I don’t know what I'd have done without you.' So all the pain, and all the rejection and learning my story, it made it worth it all. Both my parents loved me, and I love them dearly. And I have a brother that's my best friend.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to an abortion and that the matter should be decided by the states. In the aftermath, 14 states have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and two others have banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of gestation.The case now pending before the court concerns pro-life doctors and medical groups that sued the FDA in 2022, alleging that the agency unlawfully approved mifepristone in 2000 and that the drug is unsafe. Mifepristone, known by the brand name Mifeprex, is a pill taken with misoprostol in a two-drug regimen that first deprives an unborn baby of hormones it needs to stay alive and then causes cramps and contractions to expel the dead fetus from the mother's womb.In a highly controversial ruling, the district court in Texas where the case originated halted the FDA's approval of mifepristone, triggering an appeals process that has now landed before the Supreme Court. 20 STATE AGS WARN CVS, WALGREENS THAT DISTRIBUTING ABORTION PILLS VIOLATES STATE, FEDERAL LAWMifepristone is typically used in combination with misoprostol to bring about a chemical abortion during pregnancy and manage early miscarriage.

The restrictions include shortening from the current 10 weeks to seven weeks the time during which mifepristone can be used in pregnancy. The nine justices rejected a separate appeal from abortion opponents who challenged the FDA's initial approval of mifepristone as safe and effective in 2000.The case will be argued in the spring, with a decision likely by late June, in the middle of the 2024 presidential and congressional campaigns.Before the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal, Idaho, Kansas and Missouri moved to intervene in the case in the original district court. Texas U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk allowed the three states to join the lawsuit on Jan. 12, 2024, but by then the Supreme Court had already agreed to hear the case. Now, the Republican attorneys general say the Supreme Court should allow them to join the lawsuit as plaintiffs, asserting there are injuries their states have suffered that the pro-life doctors and medical groups are unable to address in court.

Cooper said the Florida Constitution contains an explicit ""right to privacy"" that is ""much broader in scope"" than any privacy right under the United States Constitution. He further ruled that a 15-week cutoff for abortions is not supported by sufficient state interest. The judge said that while the law has an exception for when abortion is needed to save the mother's life, there are other conditions that ""may not be fatal but can have profound and lasting implications for the patient, the family, and the neonate if the pregnancy is carried to term.""""Patients faced with a diagnosis of a fetal condition also need time to make the right decisions for themselves and their families, based on information from their prenatal care providers and from multiple sources with knowledge about the fetal anomaly at issue, discussion with family and other support systems, and consultation with their clergy, social workers, or other resources,"" Cooper wrote.Cooper's ruling granted an injunction barring Florida officials from enforcing the 15-week ban, but the state appealed, putting the law back into effect. In a 4-1 decision, the Florida Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' request for another injunction, but the justices did not give a reason for doing so.KAMALA HARRIS TAKES HEAT FOR OMITTING RIGHT TO ‘LIFE’ WHEN CITING DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE: ‘GARBAGE’Jasmine, 23, waits to receive an abortion at a Planned Parenthood Abortion Clinic in West Palm Beach, Florida, on July 14, 2022.

The Supreme Court remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit with instructions to dismiss the case as moot.In her dissent, Jackson criticized the court's application of Munsingwear vacatur, a legal doctrine that addresses what should happen to a court decision when the appealed case becomes moot while it is pending review by a higher court. The doctrine says such decisions should be vacated, with an important exception for cases where the party adversely affected by the vacated decision was not responsible for rendering the case moot. ""I am concerned that contemporary practice related to so called ‘Munsingwear vacaturs’ has drifted away from the doctrine's foundational moorings,"" Jackson wrote in her dissent.SEN.

Missouri law requires a pregnant minor to obtain permission from her parents to have an abortion. In certain circumstances, the law allows a minor to get court permission to bypass parental consent.When the teenager, referred to as Jane Doe, went to court in 2018 seeking permission to get an abortion, Chapman told her the court would have to notify her parents about the hearing. Doe instead traveled to Illinois, where she obtained court permission and later had an abortion.Chapman claimed immunity from the suit, but both a federal district court in Missouri and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit rejected her claim. However, the Supreme Court vacated the 8th Circuit's decision, agreeing with Chapman that the ruling should have been thrown out because the case was made moot by the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v.

The law went into effect immediately. ""With my signature, the Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act is now law and will begin saving the lives of unborn children immediately,"" McMaster said in a statement Thursday. ""This is a great day for life in South Carolina, but the fight is not over. We stand ready to defend this legislation against any challenges and are confident we will succeed. The right to life must be preserved, and we will do everything we can to protect it.""Planned Parenthood filed an emergency motion asking the court to block the law from taking effect while the lawsuit proceeds.""Unless S.B. 474 is enjoined, these patients will be forced to travel out of state and wait days or weeks for an abortion, if they can obtain an abortion at all, and endure financial, physical, and emotional costs of forced pregnancy,"" attorneys argued, according to court documents. Planned Parenthood's complaint points out that the new heartbeat law is ""nearly identical"" to a law struck down by the South Carolina Supreme Court in January. In a 3-2 decision, the high court said the previous law infringed on a woman's right to privacy under the state Constitution. Planned Parenthood had welcomed that decision as a ""win for freedom"" and a ""monumental victory"" for abortion rights in the South. SOUTH CAROLINA PASSES ‘HEARTBEAT’ ABORTION BILL THAT LIMITS ACCESS TO 6 WEEKS Governor Henry McMaster signed the Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act on Thursday, restricting abortion after about six weeks.

The court overturned Roe in 2022, ending federal protections for abortion and permitting states to regulate the procedure as lawmakers see fit. Since then, 14 states, including Texas, have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and two others have banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of gestation.Cox’s baby had a condition known as trisomy 18, which is when a baby has an extra copy of chromosome 18.

Larry Hogan of Maryland celebrates his victory in the Maryland Republican Senate primary, in Annapolis on May 14, 2024. (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser)Hogan, a moderate former two-term Republican governor, is vying to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin in blue-state Maryland.His position on abortion, clarified in interviews last week, puts Hogan to the left of most of his party. Republicans in several states have sought to strengthen abortion restrictions or ban the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, declaring there is no right to abortion protected by the Constitution. Democrats, including Biden, have hammered the GOP on the issue, claiming that abortion restrictions deny women healthcare options and that former President Trump would enact a federal abortion ban if he wins in November. Trump has denied the charge and said states should be left to determine their own abortion laws, so long as they contain exceptions for rape, incest and medical emergencies that threaten the life of the mother. Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to codify Roe into law, which would invalidate state abortion restrictions supported by many Republicans and pro-life Americans. REPUBLICAN AIMING TO FLIP KEY SENATE SEAT IN DARK BLUE STATE GETS PRAISE FROM THESE TOP DEMSFormer Maryland Gov.

In a follow-up interview with the Washington Post, Hogan, who was raised Catholic, said he is personally against the procedure, but his position that the government should protect abortion rights ""wasn't really a major transformation."" The latest Fox News Poll shows that the issue of abortion is the biggest single issue among self-described Democrats (24%), suburban women (24%), self-described very liberals (23%), Black voters (17%), those with a college degree (17%), and voters under age 30 (16%). Democrats are on defense as they fight to keep 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs in November, with their slim 51-49 majority in the Senate at risk.Republicans are targeting three of those seats in states that former President Trump easily carried in 2020 — Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, where Democratic Sen.

The threshold to place an initiative on the ballot is 383,923 signatures, which must be turned in to the Arizona secretary of state no later than July 3, 2024. With more than three months remaining to collect additional signatures, the coalition expects the amendment will be placed on the ballot even if some are invalidated during the verification process.""We regularly see high enthusiasm for the measure in communities all over Arizona.

Gretchen Whitmer leads Republican challenger Tudor Dixon in a new survey released just one week before voters head to the polls.According to a new WDIV/Detroit News poll, inflation and abortion are the top issues for Michigan voters, who will decide on Tuesday whether to grant Whitmer a second four-year term. The governor holds an 8.6 percentage point lead over Dixon (51.7% to 43.1%), although the good news for Republicans is that Dixon has managed to cut nearly half of Whitmer's lead since September, when the same poll found the incumbent was up by 17 points. Each candidate appears to have mostly consolidated support from those identifying as ""strong"" Republicans or Democrats, respectively.

Another 31.4% of voters said abortion and women's rights was their biggest motivating factor. Most women (45.9%) said abortion was the most important issue in this election, while a plurality of men (38.5%) said inflation was driving them to the polls. This statewide survey was conducted by the Glengariff Group, Inc., and polled 600 likely Michigan voters by live operator telephone between Oct. 26-28.

""In her past, she's voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion."" Democrats nationwide have clung to the abortion issue, believing that the unpopularity of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision overturning Roe v. Wade in June will shield them from expected losses in a midterm election year with a Democrat president occupying the White House. In Michigan, a proposal was added to the ballot that would amend the state constitution to establish a new individual right to reproductive freedom, including abortion rights.

"159","Christopher",496,"House speaker fight: The real reason why Kevin McCarthy still hasn't been replaced","Christopher Bedford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," October 22, 2023 8:00am EDT","FOX News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on dwindling votes for Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and the GOP dropping him as their nominee for House speaker.Republican infighting in the House of Representatives since the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy two weeks ago isn't so much creating dysfunction as it is exposing dysfunction. Over the past 10 months, strange coalitions have been built and dispersed, candidates have risen and fallen, and private animosities have burst into public view. While the D.C. legacy media press has proven itself incapable of explaining any of the above (see: its description for the ""hard right coalition"" of Reps. Matt Gaetz, Nancy Mace and Ken Buck), the squabbling has clarified just how cracked up the Republican Party truly is.The Grand Old Party (GOP) has long suffered from misalignment with its donor class and leadership holding completely different priorities from its voters and actually actual conservative members. The misalignment has been steadily widening for decades, but today, with some members openly calling on Republicans to align with Democrats just to keep the cash flowing, it’s clear the spine is broken. JORDAN OUSTED BY HOUSE GOP AS SPEAKER NOMINEE AFTER FAILED THIRD VOTEThose members just successfully derailed Rep. Jim Jordan’s campaign for the speakership of the House. A fixture in conservative circles for over a decade, Jordan co-founded the conservative House Freedom Caucus in 2015, two years after Republican leadership co-opted the once-conservative Republican Study Committee. When then-Speaker John Boehner iced conservatives out of his ruling coalition, Jordan joined a successful effort to oust the party leader. Since those combative early years, however, he’s become a team player with House leadership, earning the ranking position on the Oversight Committee when Democrats held the majority, and eventually landing the chairmanship of the powerful Judiciary Committee. He became an ally to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, able to hold sway with conservative members of the GOP conference while maintaining productive relationships with House leadership.That’s why McCarthy publicly backed Jordan in a speech on Friday to take the job he was ousted from. Still, even that move wasn’t enough for the roughly two dozen Republicans who blocked Jordan’s speakership. While some simply held a grudge over past personalities and battles, the broader reason was Jordan’s friendliness with the Republican right. Would he have kept the money rolling for the establishment, or would he have proven difficult for the appropriators to control?MULTIPLE HOUSE SPEAKER CANDIDATES EMERGE AFTER FAILED JORDAN BID AS GOP PLANS TO RECONVENE MONDAYWhile anger over the tanking of Rep. Steve Scalise’s run for speaker was apparent, the true interests of these establishment Republicans (and the major donors, who share their worries) were apparent in the headlines. From Reuters: ""US Republican speaker nominee Jordan known as Ukraine aid skeptic."" And from Bloomberg: ""Jordan’s lack of ties to business world making lobbyists nervous."" In Washington in 2023, these doubts constitute a black mark, damn the wishes of actual Republican voters.And to be clear, since the drama over McCarthy’s replacement began two weeks ago, Republican voters made their wishes known. In the days after Jordan’s nomination by the GOP conference, small-dollar donations poured into Republican coffers–just as angry phone calls and emails poured into the offices of those Republicans who voted against him.Those Republicans whined of ""intimidation,"" internally pressuring Jordan to condemn the attacks, as if he was ordering mean texts and phone calls to their offices from random Americans (he obliged, and condemned the attacks). Those Republicans balked at changing their position on Jordan, and proposed a deal to have a ""speaker tempore"" through the end of the year. In short: They would rather the speakership remain vacant than elect Jordan; they would rather break Congress than elevate someone they're not confident they can control. They believe money for Ukraine and other business-as-usual items are worth permanent institutional damage.WHY JORDAN COULDN'T GRAB THE SPEAKER GAVEL AFTER THREE FAILED BALLOTSAnd don’t be fooled: A speaker tempore is anything but tempore. In our fractured system, where the legislative branch has outright refused to fulfill its basic duties, temporary patches have a way of becoming permanent. That’s why Congress has passed continuing resolutions and omnibuses instead of real budgets for 27 years. That’s why, in a party as ideologically disparate as the GOP, a speaker tempore wielding all the power of a speaker could become standard fare.""In any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party,"" far-left New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez observed in a January 2020 interview. ""But in America, we are."" The same holds true for the conservative wing of the GOP, and the Republican appropriators opposite them. As small-dollar donors and populist candidates continue to displace traditional party power, these schisms will only continue to grow. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONDoes anyone think that 2023 will be the last year Washington politicians, be they Republican or Democrat, fail to agree on a speaker? That this will be the last time D.C. ignores the lawmaker whom the voters want to see in charge? The last time Washington is tempted to put a Band-Aid on cracking glass? Why take the wheel, when autopilot keeps the money flowing to special interests?Therein lies the incentive for placing the House in the hands of a temporary Republican leader indefinitely. Sure, there’s sweet revenge against the enemies of Scalise, and sure, yes, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is denied a win, but more importantly, appropriators on both sides of the aisle always win when no one’s taking control. Things like defense reauthorization, continuing resolutions, and omnibuses thrive on weak leadership. Fights against abortion, illegal immigration, and forever-funding for foreign wars, however? The fights the Republican base actually wants to see fought? They will never be priorities under a temporary leader.First and foremost, a hollowed-out speakership benefits those politicians who want to keep the good times rolling for their donors, and it cripples those men and women who came to Washington to make a difference. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThat’s why so many Republican and Democrat politicians alike want it to happen and are willing to damage the institution of the House to do it. This fight over the next Republican House speaker isn’t creating the dysfunction, it’s exposing the dysfunction–and its loyal patrons.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM CHRISTOPHER BEDFORDChristopher Bedford is the senior politics editor for Blaze News, and author of the thrice weekly newsletter, The Beltway Brief.","https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/house-speaker-fight-reason-kevin-mccarthy-hasnt-been-replaced",6937,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.9983,0.0017,"male"
"160","Christopher",505,"Republicans can win on abortion if pro-lifers tell their stories","Christopher Bedford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," December 1, 2023 2:00am EST","Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel says it’s ‘a losing strategy’ if the GOP doesn’t return fire against Democratic attacks over the combustible issue of abortion.Republicans and pro-lifers are in a bind. Republicans have lost several winnable elections since the Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade, with many voters citing abortion as the reason – but the Grand Old Party cannot drop the pro-life cause if it still wants to win nationally. Meanwhile, pro-lifers must face the reality that they need both the American voters on their side, and a majority of Americans don’t yet support a total ban on abortion. The GOP and the pro-life cause are tied together; if they’re to succeed, both will need to strengthen political messaging across the board.Democrat motivation is up, and it makes the difference in states like Virginia, where Republicans recently outperformed President Joe Biden’s results but still failed to hold the State House or to take the Senate. While inflation and crime worried voters, Democrats had blanketed the airwaves with ads claiming Republican victory would mean the end of abortion in the state, and internal polling showed the ads worked–particularly on women.Pro-abortion voters made the difference in Ohio and Kentucky as well. Last year, when the red wave failed to materialize, exit polls showed 31 percent of voters ranked inflation as their top priority but 27 percent ranked abortion as theirs–with 60 percent of all voters reportedly unhappy about the Dobbs decision.While left-wing activists claim pro-abortion messaging has always been Democrats’ best weapon, this isn’t true. Take the example of former Colorado Sen. Mark Udall, who was rated 100 percent by pro-abortion groups, while his challenger was rated zero. Udall sought to wrap his 2014 re-election fight around abortion and was defeated. ""It’s not that Democrats didn’t try to make voters care or that supporting Roe wasn’t popular,"" liberal blogger Matt Yglesias writes, ""it just wasn’t something that swung votes until it was gone.""CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONRecent defeats have given an in for those Republican elites who’ve long dreamed of ejecting social conservatives, positing that a fiscally conservative, socially liberal candidate is what the country really wants. While these Republicans are probably correct this is the kind of candidate who could win the governorship of Massachusetts or mayorship of New York City, the math doesn’t hold if they want national influence.One in 10 Republican voters will refuse to vote for a candidate who does not share their pro-life views. That’s the difference for a win or loss in the 2023 Mississippi governor’s race, which Republicans won. It makes the difference in the 2022 North Carolina and Wisconsin Senate races too, as well as that year’s Nevada governor’s race.OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE LED TO 32,000 ADDITIONAL BIRTHS, STUDY FINDSIn the 2020 national election, 10 percent staying home would have meant Donald Trump losing North Carolina and Florida, while putting Texas into play. In 2016, it would have meant Trump losing Nevada, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, giving Hillary Clinton a bigger win than even the liberal pundits had predicted.In short, to abandon the pro-life cause would be to abandon the legislature and most certainly the White House.That doesn’t mean there aren’t points to learn from the last two election cycles, however. Pro-life Americans need to understand that changing abortion views in hearts and minds is a crucial battle, but will take years. Meanwhile, the pro-abortion movement is defeating pro-lifers in every single ballot initiative yet held, including in Michigan, Kentucky, Montana, and most recently, Ohio, which in November enshrined late-term abortion without parental consent in the state constitution.Nationally, 55 percent of voters think abortion should be illegal in the second trimester. The number rises to 70 percent for the third. Ohio is more church-going, Christian, and conservative than many of the states included in that average. So how did this constitutional amendment happen?The answer is pro-life overreach combined with Democrat fear-mongering. Ohio’s Republican heart-beat bill had effectively banned abortion after six weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Ohioans were turned off by this, and switched sides.This cannot stand. Pro-lifers are faced with a house fire, and tens of thousands of children are stuck inside. We can save some, or none. In the future that might change, but for now, more Ohios and Michigans is unacceptable. The first step to winning is changing the messaging. In short, it’s been terrible.The number of pro-choice voters has grown since Dobbs. Americans are primed to respond to talk of ""rights,"" the romance of ""allyship,"" and ""the new civil rights."" When you combine that with celebrity support and the reality that few people have ever thought deeply about the brutal physical and emotional realities of abortion, this surge isn’t surprising.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDemocrats are perfectly happy putting rape victims and pro-abortion doctors on camera to speak directly to the voters. These storytellers pull at the heartstrings and obfuscate abortion’s cruel realities. Pro-lifers should learn from this. Their stories are heart-breaking and heart-warming stories, with real people as well. Let those people have their say.People gather in the parking lot of the Hamilton County Board of Elections as people arrive for early in-person voting in Cincinnati, Nov. 2, 2023. Ohio’s new constitutional projections for abortion access are supposed to take effect Dec. 7. But existing abortion-related lawsuits are moving again now that voters have decided the question, creating uncertainty about how and when the amendment will be implemented. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)Put the woman on camera who was pressured into an abortion, and has regretted it her entire life. Show the woman who’s experienced the pain of infertility. Let her talk about how callous pro-abortion politicians have been with the precious gift of life. Show the adopted child whose mother bravely decided against abortion. Feature the woman who is 18-weeks pregnant, and let her describe to you the child she feels moving inside her womb.Put the doctor on camera who once performed abortions. Let her walk viewers through an ultrasound, a heartbeat, the baby the size of a grapeseed who grows to the size of a cantaloupe. Let her tell about the baby born at 23 weeks who is now a 6’3"" linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks. Or tell the story of the baby who survived the abortion, only to be left to die, gasping for breath unheld on a cold operating table. Let the expectant mother who lost her child when she was hit by a drunk driver speak about what that life meant to her–and how little it means to the Democrat Party.Let real people tell the joyful and the painful stories alike, straight to the voter. The Democrats have defined what they say is at stake, framing the issue as if it’s about supporting or not supporting women and rape victims.The pro-life movement needs to let the voters know what’s at stake here is a lot more real than the feel talk of ""choice"" gets across. They can and must frame the story in real-life terms with real people and real consequences. Tell the painful truth. The American people can handle it.

Wade.In a legal opinion, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) said that the mailing of mifepristone and misoprostol, two prescription drugs that are commonly used to produce abortions, does not violate the Comstock Act. The original 1873 law originally worked to ""prevent the mails from being used to corrupt the public morals,"" but the 150-year-old statute worked to prevent mailing of writing later deemed protected under the First Amendment’s free speech clause.Congress also has largely repealed its references preventing contraceptives – such as the birth control pill – to be sent by mail. ""Federal law does not prohibit the use of mifepristone and misoprostol. Indeed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') has determined the use of mifepristone in a regimen with misoprostol to be safe and effective for the medical termination of early pregnancy,"" the opinion says.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a case on access to the abortion pill and its approval process, which has been defended by the Biden administration. The nation's highest court agreed to consider appeals from the Biden administration and drug manufacturer Danco defending several moves by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration intended to make it easier to access and use the mifepristone pill in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year.In overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to an abortion and that the matter should be decided by the states. In the aftermath, 14 states have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and two others have banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of gestation. The Biden administration and the maker of the drug mifepristone are asking the high court to reverse an appellate ruling that would cut off access to the drug through the mail and impose other restrictions, even in states where abortion remains legal. The restrictions include shortening from the current 10 weeks to seven weeks the time during which mifepristone can be used in pregnancy. The nine justices rejected a separate appeal from abortion opponents who challenged the FDA's initial approval of mifepristone as safe and effective in 2000.SUPREME COURT DECLINES TO HEAR CHALLENGE TO NEW YORK LAW ALLOWING ABORTION CLINIC BUFFER ZONESThe case will be argued in the spring, with a decision likely by late June, in the middle of the 2024 presidential and congressional campaigns.In reacting to the decision Wednesday, Katie Daniel, state policy director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, championed in a statement to Fox News Digital how the Supreme Court ""and the entire country will hear the facts about Democrats’ dangerous mail-order abortion scheme."" Mifepristone, also known as RU-486, is a medication typically used in combination with misoprostol to bring about a medical abortion.  (Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images)""Working hand-in-glove with the abortion lobby, the FDA has misled the American people with its repeated claims that the abortion pill regimen is ‘safe and effective,’ all while they removed basic safeguards like in-person doctor supervision,"" Daniel said. ""This not only flies in the face of science and common sense, but the 5th Circuit agreed it most likely broke the law. The people aren’t buying it, either – especially when they learn the FDA doesn’t track serious complications other than death."" ""Under multiple Democrat administrations, the FDA has put politics before its duty to protect health and safety, with tragic results. Without oversight, abortion pills easily get into the hands of abusers and jealous exes. Not only have countless babies died, mothers have also died. The FDA is not above the law, and there must be justice for the harm they cause,"" she added. Mifepristone, made by New York-based Danco Laboratories, is one of two drugs used in medication abortions, which account for more than half of all abortions in the United States. More than 5 million people have used it since 2000, according to The Associated Press. The second is misoprostol, which some health care providers say is less effective alone in ending pregnancies. Pro-life advocates filed their challenge to mifepristone in November 2022 and initially won a sweeping ruling six months later revoking the drug’s approval entirely. The appeals court left intact the FDA’s initial approval of mifepristone. But it would reverse changes regulators made in 2016 and 2021 that eased some conditions for administering the drug.The justices blocked that ruling from taking effect while the case played out, though Justices Samuel Alito, the author of last year’s decision overturning Roe, and Clarence Thomas said they would have allowed some restrictions to take effect while the case proceeded.BIDEN SLAMS 'LEGAL AND MEDICAL CHAOS' IN TEXAS AFTER WOMAN FORCED TO SEEK OUT-OF-STATE ABORTIONThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case on the abortion pill in the spring of 2024.

In its appeal, the Democratic administration said the appeals court ignored the FDA’s scientific judgment about mifepristone’s safety and effectiveness since its approval in 2000.Lawyers for the pro-life medical groups and individual physicians who have challenged the use of mifepristone had urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeals.""The modest decision below merely restores the common-sense safeguards under which millions of women have taken chemical abortion drugs,"" wrote lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which describes itself as a Christian law firm.

As many as one in five women will suffer a complication such as hemorrhage or infection, and I have cared for many of these women in the ER,"" Skop said in a statement. ""The Biden administration’s decision to weaken commonsense safeguards and remove doctors from the process shows they prioritize abortion on demand over the mother’s safety.

Wade. At a press conference Tuesday, Becerra detailed the five steps HHS will be taking to support President Biden’s promise Friday to ensure medication abortion is available ""to the fullest extent possible"" and that women can travel safely from states where abortion is banned to states where abortion is legal. Becerra recalled how he was at a Planned Parenthood in St. Louis, Missouri, Friday morning when, through the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, ""five Americans decided to use the vast power bestowed upon them by our democracy and our Constitution to unconscionably put at risk the life and health of millions of their fellow Americans."" ""They chose to unconscionably limit Americans’ established freedom and autonomy to control their own body – decisions usually made in consultation with their doctor, not a politician,"" Becerra said, condemning the justices.

The impact was visible and real.""In outlining HHS’ first step to increase access to medication abortion, the health secretary noted that federal law requires programs to provide medication abortion in limited circumstances, including life of the mother, rape or incest. Becerra argued that ""now more than ever it is imperative that all federally-supported programs and services are complying and providing this under the law.""The second step involves Becerra directing the Office for Civil Rights within HHS to ensure patient privacy and nondiscrimination for patients seeking reproductive health care, as well as for providers. Third, Becerra said he directed his department to examine its authority under the Emergency Medical Treatment Act (EMTALA) to ensure that clinical judgment of doctors and hospitals is supported in treating pregnant patients, ""including those experiencing pregnancy loss or complications, and reaffirming that abortion care can be appropriate to stabilize patients.""   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe secretary’s fourth step involved the department ensuring all providers, from doctors to pharmacists and clinics, have appropriate training on how to refer patients for abortions. Lastly, Becerra directed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to protect family planning, including emergency contraceptives and long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as IUDs. ""Health care is a matter to be decided by patients and their providers, not politicians,"" he said.

"177","David",125,"Americans support abortion bans prohibited by Roe v. Wade but claim to support Roe - is media bias why?","David Rutz","Peter Hasson",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," July 11, 2022 9:37am EDT","The Media Research Center's Brittany Hughes argues that since the overturning of Roe v. Wade sends the question of abortion access to the states, those who support unrestricted abortions can see if the public is truly with them.A majority of Americans support abortion bans that would be illegal under the Roe v. Wade standard, while also claiming to oppose the overturning of Roe v. Wade, multiple national polls show – a contradiction that media critics say can only be explained by the liberal slant in mainstream media's abortion coverage. Under the Roe v. Wade standard, abortion bans before fetal viability – around 24 weeks – were prohibited. But Americans don't share that view. Gallup's long-running surveys on abortion bans shows that a majority of Americans say abortion should generally remain legal in the first three months of pregnancy, but not in the second and third trimesters. A Harvard-Harris poll released last week found that 72% of Americans support banning most abortions from 15 weeks onward – a standard more permissive than in many European countries but still unallowable if Roe v. Wade were the law of the land. NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST OPINION SECTIONS STRONGLY NEGATIVE ON SUPREME COURT ABORTION RULING: ANALYSIS Demonstrators march and gather near the state capitol following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in Austin, Texas. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is being sued by health care providers over allegedly threatening ot prosecute abortion providers. (AP)""The American people are much smarter than the media elites in New York and Washington give them credit for,"" said Penny Nance, CEO and President of Concerned Women for America. ""Since in 1973 when seven out of nine men decided abortion policy for every state the world has changed and science caught up with the lie of abortion.""At the same time, Americans consistently say that they don't support the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Fox News' polling shows that, since Fox News first started polling the question in 2018, around 60% of Americans have consistently said they support upholding Roe v. Wade. Gallup's most recent surveys show a similar level of support for Roe among Americans - 63%. That dissonance in Americans' abortion views – supporting bans on abortion while also claiming to support a standard that would disallow those same bans – suggests Americans lack a clear understanding of what Roe v. Wade required. To many media critics, that's a clear sign that the liberal hive mind in many newsrooms is misleading the public. Media outlets have consistently cited polling showing a majority of Americans oppose the overturning of Roe v. Wade, but Brittany Hughes of the conservative Media Research Center said journalistic lack of nuance in assessing people's true abortion views made that a ""deceptive statistic."" Roe v. Wade, she told Fox News Digital, has given supporters of unrestricted abortion a ""wall to hide behind"" that's now been taken away.BIDEN'S STORY OF CHILD RAPE VICTIM TRAVELING FOR ABORTION ‘VERY DIFFICULT' TO PROVE, WAPO FACT-CHECKER SAYS ""If public support for abortion was as strong as the left and the media want to think it is and say that it is… they should have no problem with Roe v. Wade being overturned and abortion restrictions being sent back to the states, because all people would have to do and all representatives in their states would have to do in state legislatures would have to do, is simply pass laws codifying Roe in that state,"" she said. ""So if public support were that strong in favor of elective induced abortion through nine months, no restrictions whatsoever… they should have nothing at all to worry about,"" she said. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, told Fox News Digital that abortion activists had been ""gaslighting Americans for years"" with the aid of the press.Pro-life activists react to the landmark Supreme Court decision overruling Roe vs. Wade. (Fox News Digital)""But despite what many in the media says, if you like limits on abortion, you never liked Roe,"" she said. ""But the media consistently publishes push polls that fail to ask follow-up questions, creating virtual peer pressure for abortion. Many in the media function as de facto abortion spokespeople, cherry-picking data to ‘prove’ that people support abortion and Roe, without explaining that means allowing abortion through all 9 months, for any reason, and sometimes with taxpayer funding. But for those of us actually talking with people who are targeted for abortion, we know there is a more complex story to be told.""""For 50 years, abortion bullies used the courts to shut down conversation and policy debate, but things are changing,"" she added. ""We will have real options on how best to protect life, and the blanket assertion that ""everybody"" supports abortion will be tested with real policy choices.""KAMALA HARRIS CAUGHT IN WORD SALAD WHEN ASKED IF DEMOCRATS FAILED TO CODIFY ROE V WADEThe framing of abortion in the press has been a sore spot for conservatives for decades. Mainstream media outlets frequently employ the rhetoric preferred by pro-choicers, using the term ""anti-abortion"" instead of ""pro-life"" when depicting abortion foes in their reports. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough in 2015 said there was strong ""built-in bias"" on the issue in the media, calling it a cultural issue with journalists. While most right-leaning outlets could hardly contain their joy over the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the mainstream and liberal media reaction to the Supreme Court overturning of Roe v. Wade ranged from solemn to deeply alarmed.NBC's Chuck Todd said the Supreme Court justices could no longer be considered to be wearing black robes, but rather ""red and blue"" ones, while ABC’s Terry Moran proclaimed the ruling was another indication that America now has a ""very, very strongly activist, conservative court."" MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace fretted, ""the conservative majority on the Supreme Court has completely transformed, for the worse, the lives of all American women.""CNN's Brian Stelter wondered if conservative complainants might have a point about bias in the form of one of his ""Reliable Sources"" guests last month, Planned Parenthood news director Kate Smith. Smith previously covered abortion issues for CBS News, where she frequently drew complaints that she was biased against the right; one National Review writer even scathingly called her ""Planned Parenthood's Ambassador to CBS News"" in 2020, two years before she officially joined Planned Parenthood itself.Liberal radio host Leslie Marshall, a Fox News contributor, said there were many nuances to abortion views in the United States, and she challenged those who oppose abortion to consider the difficult choices a woman considering terminating a pregnancy faces, rather than demonizing her.Protesters shout as they join thousands marching around the Arizona Capitol after the Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion decision Friday, June 24, 2022, in Phoenix.  (AP Photo/Ross D.

""To me, that's something that's very private and personal between my doctor and me, my husband and me… Maybe talk to some people that have had an abortion…  I don't think people understand the severity of the decision for the person making that decision.""Marshall called for more attention to be paid for the plight of children who aren't adopted and improved social and health services for poorer parents.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""I can't stand the finger-pointing and judgment on either side of the aisle,"" she said.

The decision to delay the vote sparked anger from rural Republicans, who said the party shouldn't be looking to cut any more from the agriculture bill.HOUSE CONSERVATIVES HUNGRY FOR BIDEN IMPEACHMENT AFTER MCCARTHY’S COMMENTS: ‘GROUND SHIFTED’House Republican leaders were forced to call off a planned vote on an agriculture spending bill after intraparty divisions led to doubts about the vote count (Left, Speaker Kevin McCarthy; Right, House Freedom Caucus Policy Chair Chip Roy) ""I just have very serious concerns of when you absolutely gut an [agriculture] appropriations bill, I mean, it has catastrophic effects on the safety of our food, cuts USDA inspectors, [affects] the export market – cutting important programs"" said Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, who represents a heavily Republican rural district.""It’s also catastrophic for our animal disease control – right now we’re trying stop . . . African Swine Fever, and when you gut this bill, you no longer have the funds to protect our animals here in the U.S.,"" he said.Feenstra was careful not to directly blame the Freedom Caucus or its allies to Fox News Digital, but warned, ""Whoever wants to take a big whack at this"" that they were affecting ""the breadbasket of the world.""Abortion policy was another point of division in the GOP this week. The agriculture bill included language that would curb access to mail-order abortion pills, a provision that conservatives said would be needed to secure their vote.But the inclusion of that language is a problem for other Republicans.""Some in the Freedom Caucus wanted significantly more spending cuts than were agreed upon. And so that is a big factor in this, as well as some of the language related to abortion that many of us expressed concerns about. And so those are coming forward,"" said freshman Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who last year took a seat held by a Democrat.HOUSE, SENATE HEADED FOR SPENDING SHOWDOWN AFTER SENATE PUSHES FOR $13.7 BILLION EXPANSIONRep.

Bob Good, R-Va., said it’s ""certainly not true"" that the cuts they are calling for would derail valuable programs. ""Let me clarify, [agriculture] is, other than the military [and veterans bill], is the one with the very least amount of cuts,"" Good said.Good also repeated the Freedom Caucus demand that they need to see what all 12 spending bills look like before they can start supporting them on the House floor.""We want to know how all the bills fit together, how the whole puzzle fits together before we go down the road with, you know, some bills, and we don't know we've got the cuts in place for the remaining bills,"" he said. ""And as it applies to [agriculture] specifically, we want to maintain all the conservative policy that's been in there.""Freedom Caucus Policy Chair Chip Roy, R-Texas, agreed that a full view of the spending picture is needed before anything else happens. When asked to respond to the comments from rural Republicans, Roy said, ""Get in a room, and figure out how to get the cuts we need across the board.""ONLY FOUR DEMS VOTE WITH GOP TO PASS DEFENSE POLICY BILL ROLLING BACK ABORTION POLICY, 'WOKE' INITIATIVESRep.

Ben Cline, R-Va., also challenged the notion that cuts the Freedom Caucus was seeking could be harmful, and suggested that specific reductions were suggested to House GOP leaders.""The idea that there's no waste or bloat in the bureaucracy is ludicrous . . . in the [agriculture] bill, we have found some of it, quite a lot of it, actually,"" Cline told Fox News Digital. ""We identified for leadership exactly where those areas are, and hopefully we can find a consensus that gets us across the finish line.""Rep. Bob Good, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said the idea that the $1.47 trillion topline his group is calling for would ""gut"" needed programs was ""not true"" With Friday’s canceled vote, House lawmakers now have from Sept. 12 until Sept. 30 to pass the remaining 11 of 12 spending bills or some other form of appropriations for the next fiscal year, or risk a partial government shutdown.

Likewise, that bill also stops funding from going toward transgender health care-related measures for ICE detainees.The defense spending bill also bans funding from being used for programs like drag queen story hour, and prevents hiring of drag performers as military recruiters.

It's Abortion.""LifeNews.com’s X account said a similar thing, stating, ""Abortion is the number one killer of kids in America."" The pro-life outlet also shared an article, which stated, ""National Right to Life estimates almost 900,000 unborn babes were aborted in 2020, based on research by the Guttmacher Institute.

This range excludes infants under one year old, who have a unique risk of age-specific causes of death.""The piece added, ""Similarly, capping the age range at 17, instead of 18 or 19, also alters the result, as children aged 17 and under have a greater risk of dying of vehicle-related injuries.""However, the CDC has reported that recent years have seen guns become the leading cause of death for U.S. children. In 2022, CDC data showed that, while studies in 2016 found that motor vehicle accidents surpassed gun deaths for children, a roughly 30% spike in the latter between 2019 and 2020 made firearms the leading cause of death for children, who it defines as children and adolescents 19-years-old or younger.The center reported 4,368 child deaths by gunfire in 2020, the vast majority of which were homicides, followed by suicides. Unintentional gun deaths and deaths where a motive could not be determined accounted for a very small portion of the data.The governor's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the backlash.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFor more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion and channel coverage, visit foxnews.com/mediaFox News Digital's Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.Gabriel Hays is an associate editor for Fox News Digital. ","https://www.foxnews.com/media/gavin-newsom-challenged-declaring-guns-1-killer-kids-america-abortion",5711,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.9935,0.0065,"male"

They asked me to leave the area. I said they didn’t have the power to do that, since nobody has the power to control what I think in any particular place. And because I refused to leave, they said therefore I was breaching and I could be issued with a fine.""Connor-Smith added that he did receive the fine and refused to pay based on what he believed were absurd reasons behind it. LAWYER FOR PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST ARRESTED BY FBI BLASTS ‘OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE OF POWER’ FROM DOJ: ‘PURE INTIMIDATION’Adam Smith-Connor was fined for silently praying outside an abortion clinic. (ADF UK)He said that for some time he never heard back from legal authorities about refusing the fine, so he and ADF UK believed that the Bournemouth Council had dropped the citation.Though, once the legal group posted a press release proclaiming that the case had been dropped, the council summoned Connor-Smith to court. He told Fox News Digital, ""They raised the summons and summoned me to court with only about two- or three-weeks’ notice, which I appeared on the 9th of August where I pleaded not guilty to breaching the PSPO.""Connor-Smith also noted that during a previous encounter with police officers – not Bournemouth Council authorities – at the same clinic, they told him that him standing there praying silently was not breaking the law.Price explained a bit about Connor-Smith’s charge of violating the PSPO, stating, ""What he was engaged in – as he has said and he has done on a number of occasions – was silent prayer. And the council officials, the local authority, decided that was in breach of an extraordinarily wide order that covers what they call a PSPO, or really what is a buffer zone or a censorship zone around the abortion clinic.""The legal counsel expressed that these buffer zones, which are intended to prevent harassment of clinic patients, are ""about the size of an American football stadium,"" and noted that there are an ""extraordinarily wide series of things that are prohibited within that zone, including as we’ve now discovered according to the council, silent prayerful activity.""Price added, ""So as Adam said, this is a clearly a breach of human rights law in this jurisdiction and also the longstanding rights and liberties connected to the constitution of this country, where public places really, allow people to gather and express a view. And that’s just why we think that this legislation, not just in Adam’s case but in many other cases across the United Kingdom, is so harmful and so destructive to these longstanding rights.""Talking to The Washington Times, Rachael Clarke, chief of staff at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, decried Mr. Smith-Conner: ""This is essentially a stunt designed to provoke arguments in this way because ultimately, he is not a local person"" in the Bournemouth area.""

On Saturday, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler threw cold water on President Biden’s latest abortion talking point about the reversal of Roe v. Wade forcing a 10-year-old rape victim to travel out of state to get an abortion.According to Kessler, who has a history of being soft on Biden, the president’s story is ""very difficult"" to verify.Kessler’s analysis piece began with a claim Biden made during his Friday speech announcing an executive order he signed to protect abortions in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Biden recounted how ""Just last week, it was reported that a 10-year-old girl was a rape victim — 10 years old — and she was forced to have to travel out of state to Indiana to seek to terminate the pregnancy and maybe save her life.""HARASSMENT OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES APPALLS PRO-CHOICE WAPO COLUMNIST: 'BEYOND THE PALE'Protesters shout as they join thousands marching around the Arizona Capitol after the Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark Roe v.

""This is the account of a one-source story that quickly went viral around the world — and into the talking points of the president,"" he wrote, seemingly doubtful of its certainty.Kessler began by outlining, ""The Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a right to abortion, has led a number of states to quickly impose new laws to restrict or limit abortions. Ohio was one of the first, imposing a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape and incest.""He then explained that the story about the 10-year-old rape victim originated in a July 1 Indianapolis Star article titled, ""Patients head to Indiana for abortion services as other states restrict care."" The article mentioned how Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist, Caitlan Barnard ""received a call from ‘a child abuse doctor’ in Ohio who had a 10-year-old patient who was six weeks and three days pregnant."" The Star reported that the child ""was on her way to Indiana to Bernard’s care.""Though as Kessler pointed out, ""The only source cited for the anecdote was Bernard.

We have no additional comment at this time.""Kessler then mentioned how that one flimsy claim made its way into headlines around the world. ""The story quickly caught fire, becoming a headline in newspapers around the world. News organizations increasingly ‘aggregate’ — or repackage — reporting from elsewhere if it appears of interest to readers. So Bernard remained the only source.""Kessler made the additional point that ""Under Ohio law, a physician, as a mandated reporter under Ohio Revised Code 2151.421, would be required to report any case of known or suspected physical, sexual or emotional abuse or neglect of a child."" Whether such a report to law enforcement was ever made remains unclear, and as noted by Kessler, Governor Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, press secretary Dan Tierney was ""unaware of any specific case.""WASHINGTON POST FACT-CHECKER THRASHES BIDEN OVER $500 UTILITY SAVINGS CLAIM: 'FANTASTICAL'Kessler claimed, ""As a spot check, we contacted child services agencies in some of Ohio’s most populous cities, including Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton and Toledo. None of the officials we reached were aware of such a case in their areas.""Kessler concluded his analysis by giving his ""Bottom Line."" He wrote, ""This is a very difficult story to check. Bernard is on the record, but obtaining documents or other confirmation is all but impossible without details that would identify the locality where the rape occurred.""Biden's claim that a ten-year-old rape victim was forced to travel out of state for abortion is based on one dubious source.

His bill contains narrow exceptions for rape, incest and life-threatening pregnancies, but not for severe fetal anomalies or pregnancies that are otherwise nonviable,"" the columnist stated, adding that his only answer for the woman consisted of ""duplicitous anti-abortion talking point about global abortion laws.""The author criticized one of Senator Graham’s main talking points for the bill, that ""The developed world has said at this stage into the pregnancy the child feels pain, and we’re saying we’re going to join the rest of the world and not be like Iran."" Goldberg explained, ""Graham was making an argument, common in anti-abortion circles, that American abortion laws are unusually permissive, and that banning abortion at 12 or 15 weeks would bring us in line with Europe.""Though she dismissed that argument, stating, ""This is, at best, a highly selective reading of European abortion laws. It ignores the fact that, on most of the continent, abortion is state-subsidized and easily accessible early in pregnancy, so women aren’t pushed into later terminations as they struggle to raise money.""WASHINGTON AND OREGON VOTERS SAY ABORTION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING AMONG TOP ELECTION PRIORITIESNew York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg claimed that Sen. Graham's abortion bill cruelly victimizes women who find out their pregnancies are nonviable after 15 weeks.  She also asserted that ""restrictions on later abortions have broad exceptions.""Goldberg expressed bewilderment at the fact that Graham’s bill did not leave the exception for women to petition for an abortion ""in cases of severe fetal disability"" past the 15-week mark. ""Why did Graham leave such an exception, which the vast majority of Americans would almost certainly support, out of his proposed abortion ban?""""There are two possibilities,"" she answered, claiming, ""Either he was pandering to the anti-abortion activists who, on Monday, sent a letter to Congress demanding federal action against states with liberal abortion laws, or he simply hasn’t thought very much about what pregnancy entails.""Goldberg cited a New Jersey abortion provider who told her, ""Most of the time we make diagnoses around things like fetal abnormalities, genetic abnormalities, at around 15 to 20 weeks, when we can do an amniocentesis."" She also claimed, ""Then, at 20 weeks, pregnant patients are typically offered an anatomy scan, which checks, among other things, for problems like anencephaly, in which a fetus’s brain and skull fail to develop.""According to these figures, the columnist argued, ""Graham would condemn every single woman who gets disastrous news from her amnio or her anatomy scan to carry a doomed pregnancy to term, unless she could prove that it was going to kill her.""""Whether thoughtless or deliberate, the cruelty of this is almost unfathomable,"" Goldberg declared. Pro-life crowd cheers over SCOTUS decision.

""I had groups in my district where the IRS was targeting those conservative groups back there in 2012.""""And it's like a small nonprofit that just talking about the Constitution under Obama, they did it,"" DeSantis said. ""No one was held accountable for doing that.""
""So you're going to keep getting these outcomes until you have a president that comes in and drops the hammer,"" DeSantis also said.The Florida governor said that Americans will ""see major accountability because if we want to change the way this government operates, you've got to hold the people accountable who are responsible for the madness.""""And I will do that,"" he added.Fox NewsFlorida Gov. and GOP presidential candidate DeSantis participated in an exclusive town hall event hosted by Fox News' Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum Tuesday night. The event was second in a lineup of highly anticipated town hall events the week ahead of the Iowa caucuses.
DeSantis was addressed by both the co-moderators and audience members. Iowa voters pressed DeSantis on issues including abortion, education, border security, Donald Trump, Joe Biden and more.In the final minutes of his primetime hour, DeSantis took aim at Haley for her comments on abortion from Monday night's town hall saying she has ""chastised pro-lifers"" by saying ""you shouldn't be talking about putting women in prison.""""Nobody's talking about that. I've not met a single pro-lifer that has ever talked about that,"" DeSantis said.Baier and MacCallum will host GOP frontrunner Donald Trump
 for a final evening of town halls in Iowa on Wednesday night. The event will run for one hour on Fox News Channel beginning at 9 p.m. ET.With six days to go until Iowa's caucuses kick off the Republican presidential nominating calendar, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis no longer predicts victory and instead vows that ""we're going to do well here.""
DeSantis, at a Fox News town hall on Tuesday in Iowa's capital and largest city, emphasized that the battle for the GOP nomination ""is a long process"" and pledged that he's ""in it for the long haul.""DeSantis, who was convincingly re-elected to a second term as Florida governor 14 months ago, was once the clear alternative to former President Trump in the Republican White House race. He was solidly in second place behind former Trump, who remains the commanding front-runner as he makes his third straight presidential bid.But after a series of campaign setbacks over the summer and autumn, DeSantis saw his support in the polls erode.Rival Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served as ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, in recent weeks has caught up with DeSantis for second place in the polls in Iowa and in national surveys. Florida GOP Governor Ron DeSantis' rivals for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination took aim at the populist presidential candidate after his Tuesday town hall event.DeSantis joined Fox News for a town hall event in the Hawkeye State ahead of the famous Iowa Caucus, where the governor spoke on inflation and government accountability and took questions from the audience.
Following DeSantis' town hall discussion with Fox News' Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, though, the Florida governor's GOP rivals fired off their thoughts on his performance.Former President Trump's campaign went off during the town hall event, attacking DeSantis' record on the COVID-19 pandemic and claiming in one post that the Florida governor ""issued some of the most draconian Covid restrictions of anywhere in the United States.""In another post, the Trump campaign wrote, ""Ron DeSanctimonious PRAISES Trump's COVID Task Force, says Fauci and Birx were doing a good job,"" with a clip of DeSantis from during the COVID-19 pandemic.""Ron DeSantis and his allies have set him up for devastating failure,"" the Trump campaign tweeted. ""Everything he does is one giant astroturf that will be exposed in just a few short days.""...
Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley's campaign chirped at DeSantis during his town hall, too, slamming the governor over his answers to various questions, from inflation to his polling numbers against President Biden.""RON DESANTIS on inflation: ‘This was created by Washington,’"" Haley's campaign tweeted on Tuesday. ""Uh, Ron, you were in Washington and you voted to increase the debt limit.""GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis declared that ""we can never send American troops over to fight in Ukraine.""
DeSantis made the declaration during his Tuesday Fox News town hall in Iowa where he took shots at fellow Republican presidential candidate when asked to respond to her Monday remarks on the Ukraine war.The Florida governor blasted Haley for her recent comment suggesting New Hampshire voters ""correct"" the electoral process started by Iowa voters as well as the former South Carolina governor's stance on Ukraine.""We have a lot of challenges in national security. One is our own southern border,"" DeSantis said ""And you have people like Nikki Haley that care more about the Ukraine border than she does about our own border here in the United States.""
DeSantis noted that China is America's ""number one threat"" and cited his military service while calling for ""more naval power in the Indo-Pacific to be able to deter China's ambitions.""The Florida governor said that, if he could, he would ""snap"" his fingers and ""give all of that territory back to Ukraine"" and that Russia ""had no right"" to invade the country. He also said that America's European allies are ""not pulling their fair share"" in supporting Ukraine.""I think we need to work with the Europeans for them to do more. I am willing to work with them because we have military relationships to help to do that, but we can't just have a blank check and we can never send American troops over to fight in Ukraine.""Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis scolded a group of environmentalist protesters holding banners after they attempted to interrupt his Fox News town hall in Iowa on Tuesday night.""No oil money, no oil money,"" several protesters began shouting as they rushed toward the stage interrupting the event. ""You live and you learn with these people, right?"" DeSantis responded with a laugh.""You guys didn't get that one right,"" DeSantis quipped at the protesters, to applause from the audience.
The protesters were quickly removed from the room by security drawing an applause from the crowd.""Ron DeSantis roasts leftist disruptors,"" a DeSantis campaign account posted on X with a video of the incident.Ron DeSantis vowed that under his administration, the U.S. military would follow rules of engagement on the southern border and would shoot cartel members attempting to breach sovereign U.S. territory.
""Rules of engagement. Let her rip! That's absolutely appropriate to be able to do to defend your country,"" DeSantis said after reiterating his promise to declare a national emergency over the border and use the military to stop the ""invasion.""""Another thing I’m going to do that other presidents haven't been willing to do: We're going to treat the Mexican drug cartels like terrorist organizations,"" he said.DeSantis said that cartels had killed ""way more"" people in the U.S. than any terrorist group combined when accounting for fentanyl deaths, and vowed he would be the president to solve the problem ""once and for all.""He added that he would send troops into Mexico to kill cartel members ""among other assets.""Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images
""I can tell you I would love to run against Biden,"" DeSantis said Tuesday night. ""I'm not going to let him hang out in his basement. We would run him ragged around this country. I would love to be able to be in a debate with Biden and be able to hold him accountable for his policies.""DeSantis said on Friday that he's looking at ways to keep President Biden off the ballot due to the ""invasion of 8 million"" at the southern border — though he said he also believes efforts to bar former President Trump from the ballot are wrong.
""I do think the US Supreme Court is going to have to take the case,"" DeSantis told reporters following a campaign event in Iowa. ""I do think they're going to have to rein this in, because I just think if you look at it, it just becomes too different.""But DeSantis said in the meantime that Florida is looking at whether it could block Biden from the ballot for policies he says have led to an ""invasion"" of immigrants into the U.S. over the southern border.""You could make a case — we're actually I'm actually looking at this in Florida now. Could we make a credible case that Biden, because of the invasion of eight million?"" DeSantis said.Sean Rayford/Getty Images
Ron DeSantis suggested that it's a real possibility President Biden will be replaced by another Democrat in the 2024 general election, but that he hopes to run against him because he would ""run him ragged"" across the country.""This guy is a few fries short of a happy meal. That's just the reality,"" DeSantis said when asked if he foresaw Biden being replaced.""Most Americans see that so, what are the Democrats going to do going forward? I can tell you I would love to run against Biden. I’m not going to let him hang out in his basement. We would run him ragged across the country. I would love to be in a debate with Biden and hold him accountable for his policies,"" he added.The presidential hopeful has also taken a firm in his stance on the Biden family and investigations into any wrongdoings. During a NBC News interview earlier this month, DeSantis was baffled when asked if he'd pardon Biden's son, Hunter Biden, of charges including three felonies and six misdemeanor counts if elected president.""Why,"" he said. ""No!""He also rejected the possibility of asking GOP lawmakers to halt investigations into Biden himself.Recently, DeSantis shut down rumors that he would drop out of the race for POTUS if he loses the Iowa caucuses.""Totally made up,"" he said to Fox News’ Bill Melugin at a town hall event in Grimes, Iowa.Fox News' Gabriele Regalbuto contributed to this report.""You know, I'm not exactly sure, because I think it's kind of a novel issue,"" DeSantis said when asked whether Trump should be immune from prosecution -- as the former president's attorneys argued in court earlier Tuesday.
""I think the D.C. Circuit will rule against him. I mean, it's a liberal circuit, and I think they're going to hotwire this thing that. But I think it raises the issue for Republicans is what do we want the 2024 election to be about? Because, you know, if Donald Trump is the nominee, the election is going to be about legal issues, criminal trials, January six. It'll be a referendum on him. It'll be a referendum on a lot of these issues that are not going to put us in a position to hold Biden accountable.""In early December, DeSantis asked whether Trump was seeking a second term in the White House to fulfill his personal retribution against his perceived enemies or to help improve the future of everyday Americans.When asked on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" about Trump campaigning on promises to get back at his enemies, DeSantis challenged the former president with a single question: ""Why are you running?""""If he's running for personal retribution, that is not going to lead to what we need as a country,"" the governor said. ""You got to be running for the American people and their issues, not about your own personal issues. And that is a distinction between us. I am focused on the folks. I am focused on what they want to see done for this country in a positive direction. I’m the vessel, but ultimately, it's not about me.""In mid November, DeSantis said Trump would be a risky
 2024 GOP nominee, saying he has a ""small"" chance of beating President Biden, and would have a tough time attracting the necessary talent to ""get the job done"" should he win.Fox News' Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.Fox News DigitalFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis defended the strength of his campaign in Iowa despite former President Trump large lead in the polls by pointing to the enthusiasm of his supporters and his organized ground game.
""First of all, just to boil down this choice on caucus night, Donald Trump's running for his issues, Nikki Haley's running for her donors issues. I'm running for your issues, your family's issues and to turn this country around and that's my sole focus,"" DeSantis said when asked if his messaging is ""getting through"" in Iowa.
DeSantis continued, ""If the media doesn't want me, if they're trying to do everything they can to stop me, well, I must be doing something right and I must be a good candidate for you. So I wear that as a badge of honor. I think what you're seeing us do in Iowa is do it the old fashioned way. You're lining up people who are committing to caucus for you. We have massive numbers of people. I think we have more commits than anyone's ever had in an Iowa caucus. We have all the counties organize. People that have been involved in this process say it's the best yet. That's not something that necessarily is a poll or not, because a poll is based on who's going to turn out and who's not. Our people are turning out.""Ron DeSantis took a jab at Republican rival Nikki Haley early in tonight's town hall, reiterating that her recent claim New Hampshire voters will 'correct' the Iowa caucus results were ""deeply offensive.""""It's tough for me to take something from somebody that goes to another state and then says Iowa's votes not to be corrected. You know, I found that to be deeply offensive,: DeSantis said when asked to respond to a clip of Haley accusing him of wanting to be an ""isolationist.""
DeSantis added that he'd traveled to all of Iowa's 99 counties, and met ""patriotic"" voters who ""represent the best of America.""Haley made the comments while campaigning in Milford, New Hampshire, last week, telling a large crowd listening to her that ""we have an opportunity to get this right. And I know we’ll get it right, and I trust you. I trust every single one of you. You know how to do this. You know Iowa starts it. You know that you correct it.""Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this update.Fox News""Well, look, Israel is a rock solid ally of ours,"" he said. ""They're the strongest ally we have in the Middle East. As president, I will stand with Israel in word and indeed in public and in private. And what Joe Biden is doing, he's got a schizophrenic policy because he first said he was for Israel. Then he's got his far left, who doesn't like Israel. So he's kind of bouncing back and forth.""In mid October, DeSantis touted an evacuation operation his administration supported that led to nearly 300 American citizens evacuated from Tel Aviv, Israel, and landed in Tampa International Airport on October 16, 2023.DeSantis told Fox News at the time that he saw a lack of actionable leadership on the part of the Biden administration and decided to see what Tallahassee could do to execute what he claimed Washington could not.
""It was sad because the State Department and the embassy over in Israel were not helpful to these people. If you think about it, illegal aliens come across our southern border and the federal government will fly them all over the country for free,"" he said, noting how illegal immigrants also get taxpayer-funded hotel stays and other perks the average citizen could never attain.Office of Gov. Ron DeSantisIn one of the odder attack adds, so far, of the 2024 campaign cycle, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was accused of eating pudding with his fingers. 
An attack ad launched by Make America Great Again PAC in April 2023 shows a man in a suit eating pudding with his fingers while text on the screen chides Ron DeSantis for putting his ""dirty fingers"" where they don’t belong. ""I don’t remember ever doing that,"" DeSantis said in an interview on Fox Nation.""Maybe when I was a kid, but it’s interesting there’s a lot of people who when they go at you, sometimes they have really good ammunition like, ‘You’re a crook, you did this, you did that,’"" he added. ""For me, they’re talking about pudding, and I’m like, ‘Is that really the best you’ve got? OK, bring it on!’""The rumor originates from a story reported by the Daily Beast where an anonymous former staffer claimed that DeSantis ""enjoyed a chocolate pudding dessert—by eating it with three of his fingers,"" on a private flight from Tallahassee to Washington, D.C.Fox NewsPublic outcries, lawsuits, and investigations continue to fuel the fiery feud between Gov. Ron DeSantis and Disney that erupted over the past year.Disney initially criticized DeSantis' Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act, a bill that prohibits discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom, saying in 2022 it ""should never have been signed into law.""DeSantis hit back at ""The Most Magical Place on Earth,"" grouping their public outcry of the bill
 as part of the ""woke"" movement.""""You have companies, like at Disney, that are going to say and criticize parents' rights, they’re going to criticize the fact that we don’t want transgenderism in kindergarten in first grade classrooms,"" DeSantis continued. ""In Florida, our policies have got to be based on the best interest of Florida citizens, not on the musing of woke corporations.""To add more fuel to the fire, the Walt Disney Company filed a lawsuit against DeSantis in May 2023 after the governor signed a bill that would revoke the corporation’s development agreements over its resorts in the state.""Sometimes you just need an executive to come in and tell them to pound sand,"" DeSantis said of the lawsuit in an interview with The American Conservative.
In one of the most recent developments, a group established by DeSantis, the Central Florida Tourism Oversight Board, recently accused Disney of taking payoffs and not following through on promises based on examination findings. Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesGov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., frequently touts his economic record in Florida as a reference to how the economy would look under his presidency.""In Florida, we run budget surpluses, we have the second lowest per capita debt ratio in the entire country,"" DeSantis says. ""We’ve paid down debt, I’ve vetoed billions and billions of dollars of excessive spending. As president, you’ve got to be willing to lean in and use the veto pen to be able to battle against this excessive spending.""
The Florida Governor placed blame on both Democrats and Republicans for high inflation, arguing that President Joe Biden and GOP frontrunner former President Donald Trump were dually responsible for surging prices over the past few years. ""Both parties have done it,"" DeSantis said in a December campaign ad. ""Both parties have been involved. And actually, Republicans are very tough when they're out of power. But when they get in power, you know, they basically go on a spending binge too. And I think you've seen it over the last five or six years."" DeSanits rolled out a ""Declaration of Economic Independence"" in the summer of 2023, an economic blueprint for America if he is elected in 2024.""We will declare our economic independence from the failed elites that have orchestrated American decline, from the reckless federal spending that has inflated prices and plunged this nation to the brink of bankruptcy. We will declare our economic independence from the Chinese Communist Party,"" the candidate said during a speech in New Hampshire. ""We will seek independence from a class of progressive corporations looking out for every interest under the sun except the interests of the American people.""Getty ImagesFormer Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have clashed in recent days after an unprecedented set of judicial rulings in Colorado and Maine set the two against each other.The Colorado Supreme Court, and a judge in Maine, have determined that under the Insurrection Clause, President Trump is not eligible to appear on their state ballots.""If they’re going to behave in that unconstitutional way, the Republican candidates can actually stop this form of election interference,"" Ramaswamy said in an interview with News Nation Prime,""So I said I would remove my name from those ballots, and I called on the other Republicans in the race to do the same thing,"".
""Just absurd. I mean, I have a responsibility to accumulate delegates,"" DeSantis said in an interview Tuesday. ""I’m not gonna unilaterally cede any, I’m gonna win as many as I can, and I’ve been very clear about both of those decisions and those states.""""So, we can play this game all along, I think it’s not going to end up well for our country,"" DeSantis continued. ""But I do know this, that if any of the other ones of us had gotten kicked off the ballot, Trump would be spiking the football. Let’s just be clear, that that is just the fact of the matter.In November, Ramaswamy slammed DeSantis' order to shut down pro-Palestinian campus groups as ""utter hypocrisy.""

""And one of the biggest reasons is, you have George Soros funding these radical left-wing district attorneys that get into office and they say they're not gonna prosecute crimes they disagree with.""""The inmates start running the asylum,"" he went on.

""I'm running for president because I think we need somebody that can win and get the job done. I would much rather do my final two years as governor than be vice president. I don't think it's a position that offers much.

Ron DeSantis appeared to be a favored candidate for GOP nomination following the 2022 midterms, but a heated Republican primary race resulted in a significant drop in the polls.
A USA Today/Suffolk University survey in December 2022 suggested DeSantis led former President Donald Trump 56%-33% among Republican voters when asked whom they prefer as the 2024 nominee.A Wall Street Journal poll dropped just one day later also found that in a hypothetical DeSantis-Trump face-off, the Florida governor beat the former president 52%-38%.While DeSantis appeared to be favored among the GOP for several months after the midterms, the governor soon saw his poll numbers plummet, and he has been unsuccessful in bringing them back to their high water marks.A Suffolk University survey in the fall of 2023 suggested Trump is the front-runner of the race, with former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley now leading DeSantis by 9 percentage points, 19% to 10%.Most recent polling by Quinnipiac University in December shows former President Trump holds firm his commanding lead in the primary race with support of 67% of Republican and GOP-leaning voters, while DeSantis tied with former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley for second place with only 11% support.The Florida governor has recently said that presidential polling this far out from the election is “useless.”DeSantis for PresidentCasey DeSantis is presently the first lady of Florida and wife of potential GOP 2024 presidential hopeful Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.DeSantis, whose full maiden name is Jill Casey Black, has campaigned alongside her husband and has escorted him to many political events in the past and present. The couple married in September 2010 at Disney World and have two daughters, Madison and Mamie, and a son, Mason.She is an Ohio native who graduated from the College of Charleston with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics as well as a minor in French. Before becoming Florida's first lady after her husband's election in 2018, DeSantis enjoyed a long career as a television host, reporter and anchor. She worked at a local news station in Jacksonville, Florida, where the family lived for nearly a decade.
DeSantis was also a three-time equestrian national champion and a runner-up NCAA Division One champion. Since becoming the first lady of Florida, DeSantis has expanded her work through Hope for Healing Florida, which provides financial assistance and resources to struggling families and individuals across the state.In October 2021, DeSantis was diagnosed with breast cancer, according to an exclusive report released by Fox News Digital at the time. She later opened up about her successful battle with the disease during a Fox News town hall in October 2022. Previously, she had been featured in campaign advertisements for her husband, discussing how he took care of the family during that period.
During an interview with Fox News' Harris Faulkner, DeSantis recalled her battle with cancer.""The day that I ultimately found out it was Ron who was the one that told me because I couldn't listen to the doctors, I didn't want to hear any of the opining,"" Casey said. ""I didn't know if I was going to see my kids graduate from kindergarten, let alone going off into high school or watching them walk down the aisle, so I had him every step of the way there as a shoulder to cry on.""Presidential candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis contrasts how the Sunshine State handled the coronavirus pandemic to the rest of the country. 
""Florida, since COVID, has outperformed virtually any state in the country when you look at all these significant metrics. I mean, we're booming, we've got people moving in here, wealth is coming in here,"" DeSanits said during a podcast appearance. ""And so, I think when people look back, you know, that 2020 year was not a good year for the country as a whole. It was a situation where Florida started to stand alone. So I think that that's an important contrast.""DeSantis has charged that former President Donald Trump ""destroyed millions of people's lives"" by turning the country over to Dr. Anthony Fauci.
In recent months, the governor held a roundtable discussion where he and Florida's surgeon general urged individuals under the age of 65 not to get the updated COVID-19 vaccines. ""Once again, Florida is the first state in the nation to stand up and provide guidance based on truth, not Washington edicts,"" DeSantis reiterated that Florida stood up during the pandemic.DeSantis for PresidentThe 2024 Iowa Caucuses are set for January 15, and the first votes for a potential president will be cast. Iowa has long enjoyed the role of being first among kingmakers. Its place in the primary contest calendar ensures its interests, namely agricultural, are communicated to presidential contenders.
Iowa can be a proving ground for candidates, often spending large sums of donated funds, time, effort and sweat on old-fashioned campaigning. Before one can schedule stadium-filling rallies leading up to the summer conventions, presidential hopefuls are sitting down to breakfast in diners and shaking hands at county fairs.""I think the candidates who, you know, spend all the money on TV but aren't actually down on the ground visiting folks, they tend to under-perform and the candidates that have that organization tend to over-perform,"" says Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, one of the candidates for the GOP's nomination. DeSantis spoke with the FOX News Rundown podcast while between campaign events in Des Moines.
Fox News' Eben Brown contributed to this report.Ron DeSantis FacebookRon DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has a military background marked by service in the United States Navy. He graduated from Harvard University in 2001, earned a law degree from Harvard Law School in 2005, and then chose to join the military before entering into his political career. In 2004, DeSantis was commissioned as a Judge Advocate General (JAG) officer in the U.S. Navy.In August, DeSantis' campaign leaned into his military background with a digital ad highlighting his time as a Navy officer.""When our country was under attack, Ron DeSantis fought back,"" a narrator says in the video.""Ron DeSantis embodies service over self,"" the narrator continues. ""And the father of three young children – he understands the importance of the fights ahead and why we must never back down. Ron DeSantis – the fighter we need as President.""During his military service, DeSantis was deployed to Iraq as an advisor to the U.S. Navy SEALs. He earned the Bronze Star Medal (meritorious service), the Navy
 and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (gold star in lieu of second award), the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Medal, among other distinctions.His active duty service lasted from 2004 to 2010, and he subsequently served in the Navy Reserve. DeSantis' military background , particularly his Iraq deployment and role as a JAG officer, has often been highlighted as a testament to his dedication to service and country.GOP Congressman Chip Roy, a surrogate for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on the 2024 presidential campaign trail, spoke to Fox News Digital about a week out from the Iowa caucus and said DeSantis is surging at the right time and is on track to outperform expectations next week. ""There's a massive surge going on for governor DeSantis,"" Roy explained.

Ron DeSantis delivered his annual State of the State address on Tuesday just hours before his Fox News town hall in Iowa and touched on a variety of issues including criticism of President Joe Biden.
“In this time for choosing, the state of Florida has chosen well,” DeSantis said.”We have chosen facts over fear. We have chosen education over indoctrination. We have chosen law and order over rioting and disorder. We have chosen fiscal responsibility over debt and profligacy. Our choices have produced results that are second to none in this country.”
“We have earned rankings of number one for education, number one for education, freedom, number one for parental involvement in education,” DeSantis said. “Number one for talent development. Number One for public higher education. Number one for domestic in-migration. For the third consecutive year. Number one in new business formations. Number one in GDP growth amongst large states. And better than almost all countries throughout the world. We are number one for entrepreneurship, and we have set the standard for limited government. Florida has the fewest state employees per capita and the lowest state government costs per capita in the entire United States. Our crime rate is at a 50 year low and we have the lowest unemployment rate of all large states.”""The state of our state is strong,"" DeSantis said. ""Let's keep doing what works. Let's continue to make Florida the envy of the nation.""During the speech, DeSantis hit the Biden administration on illegal immigration and pointed out invited guests in the crowd who were victimized by crime committed by people in the country illegally. “Still, with all our successful efforts to provide law and order, the impacts of the Biden administration’s open border policies have made their way to Florida,” DeSantis said. “Here today is Bryan Ramos, who was the victim of a hit and run that tragically also took the life of his friend Nico Bagalihog at the age of 28. The driver who ran over Bryan and Nico was an illegal alien, and when the suspect was arrested by FHP, they found he had been previously deported three times and had no right to be in this country,” DeSantis said. 
“Also here today is Paula Fredrick, the mother of Amy Fredrick who was killed by fentanyl at just 25 years old. Fentanyl that undoubtedly was trafficked across our porous Southern Border.”DeSantis continued, “We refuse to sit idly by while Biden’s Border Crisis ruins lives across the nation. Since President Biden won’t stop the flow of illegal immigrants and dangerous drugs across the border, Florida has been forced to pick up the slack. We’ve now sent over 100 Florida State Troopers and dozens of FWC officers to help Texas with border operations, banned sanctuary cities, and instituted policies to deter illegal immigration into our state.” “The Biden Border Crisis has made every state a border state – and Florida is fighting back!”Fox NewsRepublican candidate Ron DeSantis will sit down with Fox News' Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum this evening for one hour.The town hall event will begin at 6 p.m. ET and be aired live from Des Moines, Iowa ahead of the caucuses less than one week away.Earlier Tuesday, the Florida governor gave his annual State of the State address in Tallahassee before jumping back on the campaign trail and making his way to Iowa. DeSantis has been governor of Florida since 2019.The exclusive Fox News event tonight is the second of three town halls hosted by Fox News this week.
On Monday, Baier and MacCallum hosted a town hall with GOP hopeful Nikki Haley in front of a live audience.

""Rather, I aim to start a constructive conversation about where we go from here in our divided country.""""Abortion is a deeply personal topic for both women and men. I understand why. Someone’s body and someone else’s life are not things to be taken lightly, and they should not be politicized,"" she continued. ""The issue should be addressed with sensitivity and respect, not judgment and hate.""""Most people have a story that has brought them to their views about abortion.

That is my goal. To do that at the federal level, the next president must find national consensus. That might sound strange to many people. Under Roe, consensus was replaced by demonization.

Everyone goes to the barricades and attacks the other side.

Wade’s overturn, going as far as to call for them to be shut down across the country.But the women who run these centers say nothing could be further from the truth.  Fox News Digital hopped on a call with four Mississippi crisis pregnancy center leaders for an interview and learned how these centers are supporting the families they serve from pregnancies and beyond.SEN.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have attacked pro-life pregnancy centers in the wake of Roe v. Wade's overturn. (Reuters/Elizabeth Frantz)Karen Sims, the executive director for the Hope Clinic of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, said that her clinic has ""set the strong foundation of our services and we're just going to grow and expand.""""We are a medical facility at Hope Clinic in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and we offer free pregnancy testing, free ultrasound counseling, and education,"" Sims said of the services her clinic offers. ""We have a program called Connections where we work with young ladies and give them those practical needs, so baby material assistance and mentoring and just following them throughout their pregnancy and helping them.""Shannon Bagly Busby, director of the Center for Pregnancy Choices (CPC) of Vicksburg, Mississippi, told Fox News Digital that their care for expectant mothers is different from pro-abortion clinics like Planned Parenthood because they provide for their patients beyond the ""initial desire for the walk in the door.""""So they come to us wanting one thing, but they get all of these other services that are offered to them,"" Busby said. ""They can have sonograms, they have baby boutiques, earn where you learn, that goes anywhere from teaching them about the first trimester to money management.""""They get a partnership with us. They get a place that they can actually come to and after time after time, year after year after year, and we are able to help them and pretty much a lot of their areas,"" she continued.The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)Busby noted that their clinic also helps place expectant mothers and fathers find jobs to support their new, growing families and that they perform weddings, baptisms, and christenings, as well.Michelle Johnson, director of client services at CPC of Vicksburg, which receives its funding from local churches, told Fox News Digital that the intersection between faith and the clinic she works for is what makes them ""unique.""""We believe that life has great value. And so, because we believe that, we don't just talk to the mom. We don't just talk about the baby,"" Johnson said. ""We talk about the life as a whole…. We believe that life is important.""Johnson said that she believes ""that's one of the reasons why pro-life people have been misunderstood, because people don't understand"" that the pro-life pregnancy centers care for the families after the baby has been born.PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CLINIC HIRED 24-HOUR SECURITY, SHUT DOWN MOBILE CLINIC, DIRECTOR SAYS IN SENATE HEARINGFor months, the U.S. has faced a baby formula shortage, but stockpiles at pregnancy centers like CPC of Vicksburg have helped to ease the burden on the families they serve.Busby said, amidst the shortage, CPC of Vicksburg saw ""double"" their usual traffic for baby formula as store shelves sat bare. She noted that, prior to the shortage, baby formula used to sit on their shelf ""for quite a long period of time,"" but now they ""can’t keep it on the shelves.""Sarah Smith, executive director of CPC of Meridian, Mississippi, said she worked as a ""car seat technician"" — helping parents install the car seats given to them by CPC clinics.Smith also said her clinic offers classes where parents can cash-in points for necessities, like ""maternity clothes, baby items, baby gear, breastfeeding equipment, postpartum supplies and toys, and ""also cribs, bouncies, all those kind of things.""""But also we recently started working in partnership with the Department of Health because our state has some maternal health equity issues…,"" Smith said. ""And one of the things we thought would be good is to start training more people to serve as a doula because we saw a lot of women who came through were single moms and they had nobody.""Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been a loud critic of Roe v. Wade's overturn and has vilified pregnancy centers, accusing them of ""torturing"" women. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Warren this month accused pro-life crisis pregnancy centers of ""torturing"" pregnant women seeking abortion information and called on the federal government to ""shut them down all around the country.""  ""In Massachusetts right now, those crisis pregnancy centers that are there to fool people who are looking for pregnancy termination help outnumber true abortion clinics by three to one,"" Warren told NBC 10 Boston. Crisis pregnancy centers, or CPCs, are typically faith-based and offer reproductive health care, prenatal care and counseling to help expecting parents choose life over abortion. Most centers offer free STI testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal vitamins, ultrasounds, post-abortion care, parenting classes, adoption referrals, and even free baby clothes and diapers once the baby is born. The centers receive funding primarily through private donations and grants from religious organizations, but many states also allocate public money to the centers via programs like ""Choose Life"" license plates, according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute. As of 2021, there are approximately 3,000 crisis pregnancy center locations in the U.S., the Charlotte Lozier Institute says. A 2019 study by the institute revealed 8 in 10 locations offer free ultrasounds and nearly all locations offer free material assistance for new families.  CPCs all over the country have reported an uptick in vandalism and threats in the wake of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, which ended the federal right to an abortion and returned the issue to the states. Within a week of the Court’s draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization being leaked to the media, at least five CPCs were attacked, and dozens more have been targeted since then. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America issued a study in June reporting more than 40 ""incidents of violence, vandalism and intimidation"" since the May 2 leak.MICHIGAN STORE OWNER SAYS BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE GETTING WORSE: ‘NONEXISTENT RIGHT NOW’Democrats like Warren say CPCs disseminate misinformation about the risks associated with abortion in an effort to persuade women to give birth. She introduced the Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act last month, which would ""direct the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe rules prohibiting disinformation in the advertising of abortion services, and for other purposes."" In June, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a bill directing the state health commissioner to investigate CPCs in the state to determine their ""impact"" on pregnant women’s access to care.Busby said that having discussions in the media helps to combat the ""Facebook education"" going on in America, noting that the social media giant’s algorithm ""shows you what you want to see.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""I think that also it's our responsibility to educate those who support us, but help them today to do the message as well, because we're just one person representing each clinic and sometimes there might be those who their approach is a little bit more on the aggressive end,"" Busby said. ""And that's what we've been kind of battling sometimes more in-house than anything.""""So I think that it's important for us to show the love and the compassion, but yet the truth at the same time,"" she added.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File)He said the states should decide, both voters and lawmakers, and that some would set more conservative limits and others looser ones.The former president made no mention of any time limits.Which means things will proceed under the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling exactly as if he had made no statement at all.Trump did take credit – not that he had much choice – for appointing the three conservative justices who helped overturn the 50-year precedent of Roe v. Wade. He thanked all six conservative Supreme Court members by name.""Many states will be different, many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others, and that’s what they will be,"" Trump said in the video. ""At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people.""Biden hit back hard, particularly at the assertion that legal experts on both sides wanted Roe thrown out.""Trump is simply lying. There was no groundswell of support in America for overturning Roe.

He's worried that since he's the one responsible for overturning Roe, the voters will hold him accountable in 2024. Well, I have news for Donald. They will.""WILL A SECOND-TERM TRUMP BE RADICAL, RESTRAINED OR ROUTED BY THE RESISTANCE?But look at the difference. Trump makes a video, the Biden campaign puts out a statement. The president loves statements, but they do little to drive television and online coverage. Unless he gets before a camera on this issue, he will have forfeited a prime opportunity – eclipsed, like the sun across America.The ex-president did disappoint some on the pro-life side with his remarks. The president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said she was ""deeply disappointed"" and Sen. Lindsey Graham, who favors a 15-week ban, said ""the states’-rights-only rationale today runs contrary to an American consensus that would limit late-term abortions and will age about as well as the Dred Scott decision"" – the 1857 ruling that slaves were not American citizens and could expect no federal protection even if they lived where slavery was outlawed.People celebrate outside the Supreme Court in Washington after it ended constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years, a decision by its conservative majority to overturn the court's landmark abortion cases. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)Trump responded to Graham's criticism by saying he ""is doing a great disservice to the Republican Party, and to our Country. At first, he wanted no Abortions under any circumstances, then he was up to 6 weeks, where you’re allowed Abortion, now he’s up to 15 weeks, where you’re allowed Abortion, but what he doesn’t understand, or perhaps he does, is the Radical Left Democrats, who are destroying our Country, will never approve anything that he or the Republicans want.""Looking back at my Mar-a-Lago sit-down with the former president, he used language remarkably similar to what he released yesterday.""The Democrats are the radicals on this issue because it's okay to have an abortion at seven, eight, nine months and even after birth,"" he told me. That last part was a reference to comments by former Virginia governor Ralph Northam – who later walked it back and said he’d only been talking about rare cases involving fetal abnormalities.THIS MIGHT BE A ‘TURNING-POINT’ FOR THE WHITE HOUSE: HOWARD KURTZTrump also told me that ""you have to have the three exceptions…now there are a few places where you don't."" He cited the example of Doug Mastriano, who got creamed in the Pennsylvania governor’s race after opposing the exceptions. Trump yesterday emphasized the need to allow abortions in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother. And, he said to me, ""But I tell people, number one, you have to go with your heart. You have to go with your heart. But beyond that, you also have to get elected.""Yesterday: ""You must follow your heart or in many cases, your religion or your faith.""Former President Trump said in a video released Monday morning that abortion restrictions should remain up to individual states, avoiding the topic of implementing a federal ban on the procedure.

In fact, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, in his own CNN sitdown, would not rule out ignoring the court order, saying ""everything is on that table."" And Republican Rep.

The Supreme Court in 2020 blocked Trump’s plan on a 5-4 vote. But in that case the issue was resolved by the courts. Even if Trump had engaged in slow-walking during the court fight, how does it help AOC’s case to say, well, the other side does it too?

Don’t all candidates, at every level, try to convince voters that they are people of integrity who share their values? Now that matters a whole lot less than it did a decade ago. Now what matters is winning, period. MIDTERM ATTACKS: HERSCHEL WALKER HIT ON ABORTION PAYMENT REPORT, DR. OZ ON ALLEGED QUACKERYGOP senatorial candidate Herschel Walker speaks at a rally headlined by former President Donald Trump, in Perry, Georgia, September 25, 2021.  (Reuters)Both sides are so convinced that the country would be doomed if the other side seizes or maintains power that everything hinges on victory. If that means ignoring, minimizing or rationalizing their nominee’s manifest flaws, so be it.I’m talking here about the Herschel Walker accusations, but the roots of this mentality go back decades.Americans elected Bill Clinton despite knowing about his draft avoidance and Gennifer Flowers affair allegation (which he lied about). And while many Democrats criticized his personal conduct with Monica Lewinsky (which he also lied about), they said he shouldn’t be impeached – and Clinton emerged fairly popular.George W. Bush ran as someone who had beaten alcohol abuse at age 40 – and a final-weekend disclosure of a DWI didn’t stop him from taking the White House.And then there was Donald Trump, who won the presidency although everyone knew he’d had affairs during earlier marriages, beyond a slew of new allegations from women, and whose ""grab ’em"" talk was revealed by the ""Access Hollywood"" tape.So Americans don’t expect their politicians to be perfect. Uh, Anthony Weiner somehow thought it was a good idea to run for mayor after his sexting scandal, and Eliot Spitzer ran for New York City comptroller after resigning as governor for patronizing prostitutes. Both Democrats got clobbered. But Republican Mark Sanford won a congressional seat in South Carolina after ""hiking the Appalachian trail"" as governor (to cover an affair with an Argentinian woman) and fending off an impeachment attempt. And Democrat Gavin Newsom won the California governorship years after acknowledging an affair with a staffer who was the wife of his close friend and campaign manager.TRUMP, MCCONNELL, EXTREME INSULTS AND A CLIMATE VIOLENCEMost paid a price. Back in 2012, Missouri GOP congressman Todd Akin, running for the Senate, was asked about abortion and rape. ""If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,"" he said.There was a national uproar, and the comment sunk Akin’s candidacy.In the case of Georgia Senate nominee Herschel Walker, his denial of a Daily Beast report that he paid for a girlfriend’s abortion more than a decade ago is not terribly convincing.While Walker, who wants a total ban on abortion, calls the allegation a ""flat-out lie,"" the Beast has a copy of his $700 check to the unnamed accuser, a get well card from him and the woman’s $575 receipt from an abortion clinic. Asked about the check by Fox’s Sean Hannity, the former football star said: ""I send money to a lot of people… I believe in being generous.""Walker, who has admitted to severe mental health problems and had not acknowledged several of his children, now faces fierce criticism from his son Christian. The 23 year old accuses him of lying, not raising his children and making violent threats against the family – echoing allegations from his mother.But the Republican Party has largely closed ranks behind Walker.Heisman Trophy winner and Republican candidate for US Senate Herschel Walker speaks at a rally on May 23, 2022, in Athens, Georgia. (Megan Varner/Getty Images)Trump declared that ""Herschel Walker is being slandered and maligned by the Fake News Media and obviously, the Democrats."" Without addressing any specifics, Trump said he has ""no doubt"" of Walker’s denial, adding: ""They are trying to destroy a man who has true greatness in his future, just as he had athletic greatness in his past.""Conservative radio host Dana Loesch said on her podcast that she doesn’t care about the abortion payment allegation:""I want control of the Senate. If the Daily Beast story is true, you're telling me Walker used his money to reportedly pay some skank for an abortion? And Warnock wants to use all of our monies to pay a whole bunch of skanks for abortions."" SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIESConservative Washington Post columnist Henry Olsen said the allegation ""won’t faze Republicans… The choice between Warnock and Walker isn’t a hard one for Republicans or pro-lifers. Warnock is a solidly progressive Democrat who has largely backed his party’s agenda. That’s disqualifying for any partisan Republican.""And there you have it, an updated version of Vince Lombardi’s famous quote: ""Winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.""Once you go there – that personal misconduct doesn’t matter – you’re in Trump’s ""shoot someone on Fifth Avenue"" territory.

Trump said he’d heard ""horrible"" things about Raphael Warnock.In an incident that surfaced in the last campaign, the senator’s ex-wife accused him of running over her foot with a car during a dispute (medical officials found no injuries).

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.For half a century, the two parties were locked in mortal combat over the emotional and seemingly intractable issue of abortion.Almost everyone believed that nothing would change. The Roe v. Wade decision seemed to guarantee that. And while the pro-life movement chipped away with restrictions, both sides could use strong rhetoric because the constitutional right appeared to be settled law.KAMALA HARRIS STUMBLES ON QUESTION ABOUT ABORTION LIMITS: 'SHE DOESN'T ANSWER'Then the Supreme Court overturned Roe, and pro-lifers celebrated at the issue being returned to the states. One man took credit for this dramatic development, and justifiably so: Donald Trump.It was Trump who appointed three of the nine justices, all of them anti-abortion conservatives without whom Roe would still be the law of the land. He regularly reminded those on the right that after five decades of protests, he was the one who had gotten it done. (Emily Elconin for The Washington Post via Getty Images)But then things got messy. Red states such as Kansas voted in favor of preserving abortion rights, and the red wave expected in last year’s midterms dissipated in part because of the new abortion reality. Don’t take my word for it, that’s what the 45th president says.On Sunday’s ""Meet the Press,"" Trump cast himself as the man who can square the circle of this difficult issue. DESANTIS WARNS PRO-LIFE VOTERS TRUMP WILL 'SELL YOU OUT' AFTER EX-PRESIDENT'S CRITIQUE OF 6-WEEK ABORTION BANHe said he would ""sit down with both sides and I’d negotiate something, and we’ll end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years.""What’s more: ""Both sides are going to like me. I’m going to come together with all groups, and we’re going to have something that’s acceptable.""This is not a knock on the former president to say there’s no way everyone on both sides is going to like him. Most activists and ideologues are dug in, either believing that abortion is murder or a woman’s right to choose is sacrosanct.Now you may well argue that Trump taking credit for the SCOTUS Dobbs decision and floating an abortion compromise–he wouldn’t say what he’d sign as president – is contradictory.The Supreme Court of the United States on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2022 in Washington, DC.  (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)But the fact is that his political instincts are on target. Republicans who favor a complete ban – Trump has always supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother – are running headlong into a majority sentiment that some abortions should be allowed, with limits (for instance, barring late-term procedures). Trump was fuzzy on the details, saying, ""It could be state or it could be federal, I don’t frankly care."" He has drawn flak from some pro-life groups.But as a presidential candidate, he’s using his middle-ground stance to slam some of his rivals.FROM SEXISM TO SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS, ACCUSED PUBLIC FIGURES FESS UP, DENY OR DENOUNCERon DeSantis quietly signed a six-week ban in Florida last spring, with exceptions, though he hasn’t talked about it much until recently. Critics say some women don’t even know they’re pregnant at that point.Trump, invoking the governor, told NBC’s Kristen Welker: ""I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake.""The DeSantis campaign pushed back with a tweet: ""He says it’s a ‘terrible thing’ babies with heartbeats are protected in Iowa, Florida and South Carolina,"" adding that the governor ""will NEVER sell out conservatives to win praise from corporate media or the Left.""In an interview on Sunday’s ""Media Buzz,"" Mike Pence told me that Trump is not a true conservative because he’s ""trying to relegate the question of abortion to states only,"" when it should also include ""the American people.""  (Fox News)The former vice president, who often speaks about his Christian faith, says he recognizes that ""most of the progress for pro-lifers is going to happen in the states."" Pence favors a national ban, but starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy, a stance he never would have entertained as VP.

(Getty Images)Based on the audio of Tuesday’s oral arguments, most justices across the ideological spectrum are opposed to outlawing these pills.With the exception of Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas, leaders of the anti-Roe wing, the justices made clear that they don’t want to get into this fight.More than two decades after the FDA approved the use of mifepristone as safe and effective, it looks like the drug will remain widely available.WHY THE TRUMP BOND CRISIS LOOKS LIKE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO RUIN HIMWhen you have Ketanji Brown Jackson and Neil Gorsuch embracing the same point, that is the judicial equivalent of a flashing green light.Abortion has been a difficult subject for Republicans in the post-Roe era. Democrats have won numerous special elections with candidates who ran heavily on the issue. On Tuesday, one such Democrat flipped a Republican seat in the Alabama House.Boxes of the drug mifepristone sit on a shelf at the West Alabama Women's Center in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on March 16, 2022. On Tuesday, March 26, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court will take up a case that could impact how women get access to mifepristone, one of the two pills used in the most common type of abortion in the nation.  In my Mar-a-Lago interview with Donald Trump, he said Republicans who take too hard a line on abortion, such as opposing exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, are destined to lose. In embracing a ban on abortions after 16 weeks of pregnancy, later modified to 15 weeks, he said something that stuck with me: ""You have to follow your heart. But you also have to get elected.""The stakes are high in the Supreme Court case because mifepristone is now used in 60 percent of all abortions in America. The skeptical justices expressed concern about the impact on federal regulation if they substituted their views on complicated subjects overseen by the likes of the Food and Drug Administration.Anti-abortion protesters celebrate outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Friday, June 24, 2022.

At the same time, he acknowledged to NBC yesterday that the $700 check he sent to his accuser was his (she’s now the mother of one of his kids), and the ceremonial badge could remind people that he’d lied about being in law enforcement.But that wasn’t the most important thing that happened on that stage.It was that Walker changed his position on two issues that were crucial to his winning the nomination, with Donald Trump’s backing.GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATES CLASH ON DEBATE STAGE DURING THEIR ONLY FACE-OFF AHEAD OF MIDTERMSGeorgia Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker speaks during a campaign stop at Battle Lumber Co. on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2022, in Wadley, Georgia. (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard)One was his 100% pro-life position on abortion, with no exceptions, no way, no how. This fueled the criticism from opponents that he allowed himself an exception in sending that check to his girlfriend back in 2009, but wouldn’t give Georgia women the same choice.But in the debate, Walker backtracked. He said he now supported the Georgia legislature’s ban on abortion after six weeks, complete with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother in medical emergencies or if their pregnancies cannot successfully be brought to term.By way of explanation, Walker said he is a Christian but is ""also representing the people of Georgia"" and would ""stand with them.""The other change was on the stolen-election front. Back in late 2020, Walker said, ""I can guarantee you, Joe Biden didn’t get 50 million voting for him. But yet people think that he’s won this election."" In the debate, he said Biden had won the election. (It was with 81 million votes, by the way.)Walker’s got some company in the GOP; he’s just the most recent example. When Blake Masters won the Senate nomination in Washington state, he quickly scrubbed his website of harsh anti-abortion rhetoric and support for a personhood amendment, as well as talk of a rigged election.It’s true that candidates in both parties inch toward the center during a general election. Democrats try to placate their liberal wing and then backpedal, saying, well, Medicare for All has its good points but I’m not saying you should lose your private insurance.But when it comes to such fundamental issues as abortion and election fraud, did these Republicans believe what they were saying then–or what they are saying now?Given the majority support for the now-defunct Roe v. Wade – and the pro-choice victory in a Kansas referendum – are these nominees just afraid of the real-world consequences? The Supreme Court building is barricaded following the Roe vs. Wade ruling.  (Joshua Comins/Fox News Digital)Or you could describe it as wakeup to political reality – it was easy to take a maximalist pro-life position when it was theoretical, and now being against exceptions – such as forcing a woman to give birth to her rapist’s baby – can sound heartless.In Minnesota, GOP nominee Scott Jensen said last spring he would ""try to ban abortion"" as governor, and didn’t support any exceptions unless the mother’s life was in danger. Jensen, a doctor, has since made a video saying his previous comments were ""clumsy"" and he now supports rape and incest exceptions.WALKER V. WARNOCK: ATLANTA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON HOTLY CONTESTED US SENATE RACEIn Iowa, Republican House candidate Zach Nunn wrote an op-ed saying he’s pro-life but supports the exceptions: ""I share the frustrations of many I’ve spoken to on both sides of the issue who seek a compassionate and pragmatic discussion around life.""In Michigan, Republican House candidate Tom Barrett called himself ""100 pro-life–no exceptions,"" but has now removed any reference to his abortion views on his website. Instead, he denounces Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin for ""some of the most extreme abortion policies of anyone in Congress."" And that raises a crucial point. Many Democrats, worried about angering their base, refuse to say they are against late-term abortions, which could continue up to the ninth month. Such very late procedures clearly goes against the mainstream consensus that is more supportive of abortion in the first two trimesters. Arizona gubernatorial candidates Katie Hobbs, left, and Kari Lake, right, stump ahead of their showdown next month.  (Reuters)On CNN, Dana Bash repeatedly pressed Katie Hobbs, the Democratic nominee for Arizona governor, whether she would support any limits on abortion, and Hobbs, looking uncomfortable, kept saying this was between women and their doctors.SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES""When you’re talking about late-term abortion, that is incredibly, extremely rare… something has gone incredibly wrong in that pregnancy… Politicians do not belong in that decision,"" Hobbs said.She is running against Kari Lake, a Trump-backed Republican who had taken a no-exceptions stance but now is more vague.

The files show Twitter executives scrambling to come up with a reason for the blockade and debating whether ""hacked materials"" would hold up as an excuse. (The laptop was not hacked, what the New York Post obtained was a hard drive that the Democratic nominee’s son had left with a Delaware repair shop, but that wasn’t clear at the time.)The files also show that Twitter acted on its own, not in response to a request from the Biden campaign, which did later ask that tweets with pornographic images of Hunter Biden be removed. And while one official at the liberal company did raise the prospect that Trump could be elected, Taibbi flatly said there was no evidence of government involvement.TRUMP-LINKED LAWYER HARMEET DHILLON WEIGHING BID TO REPLACE MCDANIEL AS RNC CHAIRStill, Trump used this to advance his two-year-old crusade to show, without evidence, that the election was stolen from him.Here’s the entire post:""So, with the revelation of MASSIVE & WIDESPREAD FRAUD & DECEPTION in working closely with Big Tech Companies, the DNC, & the Democrat Party, do you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION?

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Treating ectopic pregnancies is still legal in all states where abortion is banned, despite media personalities, celebrities and even elected officials spreading false information about its legality following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade.An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, typically in one of the woman’s fallopian tubes. It’s a rare complication, occurring in only about 1.5% of all pregnancies, and can be life-threatening if left untreated. The pregnancy is never viable, and the most common way to treat it is through medication to end the pregnancy or through surgery to remove it.After the Supreme Court decided last month to overturn Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion and returning the question back to the states, pro-choice advocates argued that the decision would kill women. Some of them even claimed that seeking treatment for an ectopic pregnancy in some states could land a woman behind bars.""’Do I abort this ectopic pregnancy to literally save my life or do I go to jail?’"" Daily Beast columnist Wajahat Ali mused on Twitter. ""Question women in America now have to ask.""""A lot of these state laws are very poorly written,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said in an Instagram rant Friday.

Wade being overturned – Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. There are also five additional states – Alabama, Arizona, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin – that still have an abortion ban on the books from before Roe v. Wade that will go into effect now that the 1973 landmark law is overturned. All of those states include exemptions for medical emergencies and allow abortions to be performed if the mother’s life is at risk. Many states also have laws specifically exempting treatment for ectopic pregnancies under the states’ abortion statutes. Additionally, federal law currently requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide abortion medication in limited circumstances, including rape, incest or if the life of the woman is in danger.Protesters march around the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix after the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Will members of the GOP ever accept that Americans in both parties are not going to part with fundamental freedoms? THE REAL REASON REPUBLICANS AREN'T WINNING SWING VOTERSAs interim president of EMILYs List, a group that is laser focused on electing Democratic pro-choice women up and down the ballot, I often think about what Justice Samuel Alito said in his writing as our constitutional right to an abortion was handed over to the states in the 2021 Dobbs decision, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" And in every election since then, we have taken Alito’s words to heart. We have risen to the challenge and we continue to win – over and over and over again. Voters are too smart to believe the fake promises of ""compromise"" because we know that one of the most important decisions of a person’s life – when and how to start a family – does not belong in the hands of politicians. And as both Democratic and Republican voters continue to speak loudly at the ballot box on this topic, the question remains: Will extreme anti-choice Republicans hear us and stop trying to control our bodies? ROLE ABORTION RIGHTS PLAYED ON ELECTION DAY: UNDERESTIMATED BY GOP OR OVERSTATED BY DEMOCRATS?One day after the incredible victories in Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky, we saw Republicans at the GOP presidential primary candidates double down on their anti-choice stances. And after voters in Ohio made their position on abortion access clear through a referendum, Republicans are still planning to work overtime to block the will of the people. This is not the anti-democratic America that any of us, no matter party affiliation, should be working toward. Instead, we should be working to maintain the practices that represent the views of the majority. That is why the work I do every day is so very important. My colleagues and I know that government works best when it truly represents the interests of the people. The fact remains that on the topic of abortion, the people have spoken. Will Republicans listen? The answer to this and all of my questions is seemingly no – not as long as extremism continues to grip the GOP in a tight chokehold with no plans of letting go. That especially seems to be what has happened even at the highest ranks with the new speaker of House, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La. Hailing from a state with one of the highest maternal death rates in the nation, Johnson does not seem to care about the reproductive health of women nor that he is out of step with the American people. REPUBLICANS HAVE TO GET REAL ABOUT ABORTION TO WIN IN 2024In 2021, Johnson co-sponsored a bill that would be a total federal abortion ban from conception with no exceptions. This federal abortion ban would overrule any state laws, even in states that have protected abortion rights.Johnson celebrated efforts to punish providers, specifically praising a Louisiana law that would mean those who provide abortion care can be ""imprisoned at hard labor for 1-10 yrs & fined $10K-$100K.""He has made his intention around abortion no secret, saying, ""Roe and Casey created a so-called constitutional right to abortion in air quotes. They created it out of thin air.""Johnson also voted against the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation that would codify the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIt is clear that in the places where it counts – in the halls of power, Republicans aren’t listening to the American people, including a large number of registered Republican voters. They continue to hide their true intentions, but what American voters know is that a ban is a ban, no matter how you slice it. There is no compromise when it comes to our health and our freedom. If Republican candidates continue to refuse to listen, Democrats will continue to win.Republicans, can you understand that?CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPJessica Mackler is the interim president of EMILYs List, the nation’s largest resource for women in politics.","https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/few-questions-republicans-about-abortion",4923,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,"female"

(Alito wrote the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization finding no right to abortion in the Constitution.)This sinister charade is also an assault on religious freedom. The Satanic Temple threatens everyone’s religious liberty protections with its ill-advised plan linking its pro-abortion propaganda with alleged religious practices.Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito (Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File)Despite its name, The Satanic Temple doesn’t ""believe in the existence of Satan or the supernatural,"" as its website explains. Rather than exalting anything divine, it exalts the self with its saying, ""Thyself is Thy Master."" (The King James English makes the beliefs sound more theological.) PENTAGON TO PROVIDE TRAVEL FOR SERVICE MEMBERS GETTING ABORTIONS, PLULS PAID TIME OFFThe Satanic Temple disdains those who believe in God, religion and the supernatural, taunting those believers with its Satanic imagery. The organization’s approach to religious freedom mirrors its approach to religion: It doesn’t actually support religious freedom for anyone but will invoke religious freedom for itself if it can denigrate that same freedom in the process.The Satanic Temple also strongly supports abortion, thus the reason for its announcement that its affiliate, TST Health, would establish the New Mexico ""telehealth"" facility that ""will provide medication for safe abortions through the mail for members and for those who wish to perform TST’s Abortion Ritual,"" part of which includes the woman reciting the ""Personal Affirmation"": ""By my body, my blood, By my will it is done.""A Baphomet statue is seen in the conversion room at the Satanic Temple in Salem, Massachusetts, on Oct. 8, 2019. (Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images)This facility faces numerous obstacles. Federal law currently prohibits the mailing of abortifacients. Abortion drugs have side effects that harm women – especially when the women and girls taking them do so via ""telehealth"" and without proper medical evaluation. Also, there is now a major dispute over whether the Food and Drug Administration properly approved the use of these drugs as abortifacients.In anticipation of these legal obstacles, The Satanic Temple will likely seek ""religious"" exemptions so it can dispense abortifacients through the mail. But that effort will face significant hurdles.First, the Supreme Court has interpreted the free exercise clause to mean that religious adherents cannot get exemptions from laws that are neutral on their face about religion and that apply generally to all. It would be difficult to win a lawsuit seeking a religious exemption from the federal law that prohibits sending abortifacients through the mail.The Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)If The Satanic Temple seeks an exemption under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it is still likely to fail. Under this statute, the government can burden one’s religious exercise when it has a compelling state interest implemented in the least restrictive way. The government undoubtedly has a compelling interest in protecting innocent human life from destruction.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERReligious liberty laws like RFRA are not automatic ""get out of jail free"" cards. Aztec or Molech worshippers do not escape criminal punishment for homicide just because their religious beliefs require human sacrifice. Similarly, The Satanic Temple’s exemption efforts would fare no better.The Satanic Temple may additionally argue that laws protecting unborn life violate the establishment clause because they are allegedly based on religious doctrine. But the Supreme Court in 1980 correctly ruled that a law does not violate the establishment clause simply because it coincides with the beliefs of a religious group. If that were not so, then laws against burglary and shoplifting would be unconstitutional because they match the Ten Commandments’ ""Thou shalt not steal.""Pro-choice protesters gather in St. Louis, Missouri, following the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe vs. Wade. (Fox News Digital)A third problem nags The Satanic Temple: Does it hold sincere religious beliefs, or did it adopt them just to mock and jeer religious traditionalists? It is uncommon in religious-liberty litigation for questions to arise about the sincerity of the group’s religious beliefs. But The Satanic Temple’s own account of its tenets, especially its rejection of all things supernatural, creates a real question whether the group’s beliefs are just secular beliefs dressed up in Satanic imagery to scorn and taunt religious people.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFor example, The Satanic Temple is an odd name for a supposed ""religious"" group that doesn’t believe in Satan or anything supernatural. The group mocks religious pro-life people by calling its proposed facility ""Sam Alito’s Mom’s Satanic Abortion Clinic."" The group is even selling T-shirts with a cartoon of Justice Alito’s mother saying, ""If only abortion was legal when I was pregnant,"" implying that Mrs. Alito would have aborted her son in 1950 if abortion had been legal, so he would not have grown up to write the decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

And for decades, the federal government has been making one of these nightmare scenarios real by making dangerous chemical abortion drugs available to women and teenage girls and stripping away basic safeguards.But—finally—that nightmare just got a big wake-up call. On Friday, in a lawsuit in which Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys represent four medical associations and four doctors, a federal district court in Texas halted the Food and Drug Administration’s 2000 approval of chemical abortion drugs—drugs that have caused serious harm to countless women and girls in the past two decades. The Biden administration has seven days from the issuance of the decision to appeal before the court’s stay order goes into effect.The FDA violated its authority to approve these drugs, but since 2000, it has recklessly allowed corporations to sell these dangerous drugs to women and girls. In 2021, the agency made things even worse by allowing online pharmacies to send these dangerous drugs through the mail.FEDERAL JUDGES ISSUE DUELING DECISIONS ON ABORTION DRUG MIFEPRISTONEAnd all along, the FDA has stonewalled efforts to challenge its illegal actions. As the court wrote in its decision, the ""FDA ignored [the Plaintiffs’] petitions for over sixteen years, even though the law requires an agency response within ‘180 days of receipt of the petition.’ Had FDA responded to Plaintiffs’ petitions within the 360 total days allotted, this case would have been in federal court decades earlier. Instead, FDA postponed and procrastinated for nearly 6,000 days.""It’s no surprise why. The FDA, in collusion with pro-abortion politicians, never properly tested these drugs for safety in the first place and has continued to dismantle safety protections, so that it is now perfectly simple for a teenage girl, for example, to obtain chemical abortion drugs without a single physician visit or her parents’ knowledge—even though these drugs have been shown to cause intense pain and bleeding, and can often progress into worse complications, like hemorrhaging, life-threatening infection, and loss of fertility.Teen girls facing an unexpected pregnancy are particularly vulnerable. They are trying to navigate a frightening, highly emotional situation; they often have fewer resources and less support; and their bodies are still developing, so abortion presents greater risks. Sometimes teens even try to get abortions in secret. This vulnerable group should be protected and cared for, but the government has ignored their unique situation.SCHUMER SAYS JUDGE'S MIFEPRISTONE ABORTION PILL RULING 'COULD THROW OUR COUNTRY INTO CHAOS'Chemical abortion consists of a two-drug course that includes an endocrine disruptor called mifepristone. When the FDA approved these drugs in 2000, it did not rely on any studies that looked at how these drugs affect women under the labelled use; all the studies at which it looked had safeguards in place that the FDA either never required or stopped requiring, like an ultrasound to determine gestational age or an in-person follow-up visit. And none of the studies focused on teen girls.Attorneys general in twelve Democratic-led states sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, challenging their restrictions on the distribution of mifepristone, an abortion pill, alleging that they arent supported by evidence. (Reuters)Here’s an illustration of just how big of an oversight this was: Imagine a study said that wearing a helmet when playing football makes the sport safe. Then imagine that the NFL relied on that study to determine that football is safe but then didn’t require players to wear helmets. Later, when someone points out that this is a dangerous situation, the NFL officials protest that they did plenty of research and proved that football is safe.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERAnyone can see that the officials, in this scenario, are not creating a safe environment—but this is just what the FDA did—and kept doing for 22 years. Putting endocrine disruptors like mifepristone into a teen girl’s developing body and reproductive system is a risky thing to do, and the FDA doesn’t have any valid evidence to the contrary. Allowing teenage girls to take drugs that have been shown to cause hemorrhage, severe cramping, life-threatening infections, and incomplete abortions is dangerous. One in five women who take these drugs seek medical attention afterwards. But the FDA refused to acknowledge any of this and just kept removing safeguards.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhether you support abortion or not, everyone should be able to agree that teen girls should not take dangerous, unproven chemical drugs—and that teens should not be able to purchase these drugs through an online pharmacy, as the FDA allows, without ever visiting a doctor and without even telling their parents that they are pregnant.Fortunately, the federal judiciary is finally holding the FDA accountable. Soon, under the court’s order to halt the approval of chemical abortion drugs, parents will no longer have to worry that the federal government is nudging their daughters towards a nightmare scenario.CLICK HERE TO REMOVE MORE FROM JULIE MARIE BLAKE  Julie Marie Blake, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom (@ADFLegal), represents four doctors and four medical associations, including the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)As the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, Chief Justice John Roberts agreed with the majority in upholding a Mississippi law restricting abortion, but wanted to stop short of overturning Roe itself.The high court ruled 6-3 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, to uphold a Mississippi law that banned abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Republican-led state of Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to strike down a lower court ruling that stopped the 15-week abortion ban from taking place.
However, while concurring with the majority in upholding the Mississippi law, Roberts was critical of his colleagues in taking the additional step of overturning both Roe and the 1992 Casey v Planned Parenthood decision.""We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the court's opinion.
But Roberts, in his separate concurrence, said he would take ""a more measured course."" He faults Roe and says its ""viability"" standard -- whereby a woman is said to have a right to an abortion until the fetus is deemed to be able to survive outside the uterus -- set by Roe should be discarded (""That line never made any sense"") and the right to an abortion ""should therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further -- certainly not all the way to viability.""Read more by Fox News' Adam Shaw: Roberts wanted Supreme Court to stop short of overturning Roe v.

“Today’s decision recognized that the weak legal reasoning in Roe v. Wade has done more to provoke conflict than to resolve it, as the late Justice Ginsburg observed. In a meticulous and well-reasoned opinion, the court dispensed with a flawed precedent, as it has rightly done in landmark decisions throughout history.""“For many Americans, including myself, this decision is about far more than correcting a flawed legal analysis in Roe; it means that the rights of the unborn are no longer in jeopardy by our federal government.

“Regardless of your views on this issue, or any other issue for that matter, we all should respect the role of our impartial judiciary and the decisions that it renders. We’re blessed to live in a country where the people play a leading role in how we are governed.

“For 50 years, states have been unable to enact even modest protections for unborn children. More than 90% of Europe restricts abortion on demand after 15 weeks, but every state in America has been forced to allow it more than a month past that, after a baby can feel pain, yawn, stretch, and suck his or her thumb.

Now the American people get their voice back.""""The Court has corrected a terrible legal and moral error, like when Brown v. Board overruled Plessy v. Ferguson. The Justices applied the Constitution. They carefully weighed the complex factors regarding precedent. The Court overturned mistaken rulings that even liberals have long admitted were incoherent, restoring the separation of powers. I commend the Court for its impartiality in the face of attempted intimidation.""
“Democrats’ disgraceful attacks on the Court have echoed Democrats’ outrage at Brown v. Board in 1954. Today’s Democrats are jaw-droppingly extreme on abortion. 97% of Washington Democrats support legislation that would effectively require nine months of abortion on demand until the moment of birth. Only 19% of Americans share this radical view but 97% of Democrats in Congress embrace it. They would rather attack our institutions than let the American people enact the reasonable protections they want.""“Millions of Americans have spent half a century praying, marching, and working toward today’s historic victories for the rule of law and for innocent life. I have been proud to stand with them throughout our long journey and I share their joy today.”In their dissenting minority opinion Friday, Supreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan wrote that Roe and Casey ""understood the difficulty and divisiveness of the abortion issue,"" and by overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, a woman ""has no rights to speak of.""
""The Court knew that Americans hold profoundly different views about the 'moral[ity]' of 'terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage,'"" they wrote. ""And the Court recognized that 'the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting' the 'life of the fetus that may become a child.'""""So the Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete,"" they wrote. ""It held that the State could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman’s life or health.""""It held that even before viability, the State could regulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful ways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court held, a State could not impose a 'substantial obstacle' on a woman’s 'right to elect the procedure' as she (not the government) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances and complexities of her own life,"" they continued.
""Today, the Court discards that balance,"" they wrote. ""It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of.""The justices wrote that with overturning Roe v. Wade, a state can now ""force"" a woman to bring ""a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs.""""An abortion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever rational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law. And because, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life is rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of restrictions,"" they wrote.The justices also reference states with strict abortion laws, like Mississippi, which bans abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy.
""Under the majority’s ruling, though, another State’s law could do so after ten weeks, or five or three or one—or, again, from the moment of fertilization,"" they wrote. ""States have already passed such laws, in anticipation of today’s ruling. More will follow.""""Some States have enacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, including taking medication in one’s own home,"" they continued. ""They have passed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is the victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapist’s child or a young girl her father’s—no matter if doing so will destroy her life.""""States may even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for protecting a woman from risk of death or physical harm,"" they wrote. ""Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child.”

In addition, dozens of pro-life pregnancy centers were vandalized since the opinion leak, Catholic churches were targeted for protests and unrest, and a suspect was charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Wade.Federal U.S. code 1507, states that any individual who ""pickets or parades"" with the ""intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer"" near a U.S. court or ""near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness, or court officer"" will be fined, or ""imprisoned not more than one year, or both."" Despite the language included in the federal statute, Attorney General Merrick Garland has not issued a public statement addressing the protests outside conservative justices' homes. And the Department of Justice (DOJ) did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Garland's silence and the reason why protestors have not been arrested.PENCE DECRIES PLANNED ABORTION ACTIVIST DISRUPTIONS OF MOTHER'S DAY CHURCH SERVICES: 'TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE'According to senior fellow at the National Review Institute and Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy, the Biden DOJ is being silent on this for the same reason as the White House: ""They are elevating their political interest in portraying the draft Supreme Court opinion as extreme over their constitutional duty to execute the laws faithfully and protect both the Court and the justices.""Attorney General Merrick Garland testifies during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing to discuss the fiscal year 2023 budget of the Department of Justice at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, April 26, 2022.

Not only was it untrue that schools were under siege; the relationship between parents and schools is a state and local issue, not a federal one — hypothetically, if a parent were to assault a teacher, it would be a state crime, not a federal one,"" continued McCarthy.McCarthy referred to a DOJ memo from last fall, directing the FBI to investigate ""threats of violence"" at school board meetings in order to combat threats against school officials by angry parents. Garland received massive backlash for his directive because it came just days after the National School Board Association (NSBA) wrote a letter to Biden asking his administration to treat parent protests at school board meetings as possible acts of ""domestic terrorism.""""By contrast, the protection of the Supreme Court as an institution, and of the justices’ security, are patently federal matters over which federal law-enforcement has clear jurisdiction. It is inexcusable that the Justice Department is so silent and passive now, when it was loud and active over a manufactured controversy as to which it had no jurisdiction,"" McCarthy told Fox News Digital.Protestors stand outside of conservative Supreme Court justices' homes to object to Roe v. Wade overturn. (Fox News)America First Legal senior advisor Ian Prior also reacted to the department's silence, telling Fox News Digital: ""It says all you need to know about how politicized this Department of Justice is.

Planned Parenthood is also assisting in the signature collection process. In addition, a coalition of local pro-choice groups, including Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom (ORF) and Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights (OPRR) submitted the language of the amendment for review, which was approved in March. Now the groups supporting this amendment have until July 5 to obtain over 400,000 signatures from Ohio voters in order for the amendment to appear on the ballot in November 2023.Courtesy of Protect Women Ohio (Courtesy of Protect Women Ohio)Protect Women Ohio (PWO), which is leading the fight against the amendment, said there is no public information on the status of the signatures, but the group is operating under the assumption that the amendment will be on the ballot in November. ""We are going directly to voters … educating them on the intentionally broad and vague language that the ACLU and Planned Parenthood drafted,"" PWO Press Secretary Amy Natoce told Fox News Digital. ""We are confident that once voters understand the dangers of this extreme anti-parent amendment, they will vote it down.""She said the amendment would ""end debate"" on future policy and ""completely eliminate"" the passage of any laws going forward that deal with abortion or parental consent laws.""The exact language of the amendment says that it forbids any law that would burden or interfere with an individual's reproductive decisions,"" Natoce said. ""We know that the ACLU in other states has argued that the word burden means parental consent, so they are now bringing that fight to Ohio.""""The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are supporting and bankrolling these efforts like they have done in other states,"" she added. ""We know that they are going to spend tens of millions of dollars and [we] fully expect to be outspent by these out-of-state special interest groups… that really underscores the seriousness of what we're up against and the lengths that the ACLU and Planned Parenthood will go.""FLORIDA LEGISLATURE PASSES SIX-WEEK ‘HEARTBEAT BILL’ TO LIMIT ABORTIONPWO specifically points to comments made in February by Jessie Hill, an attorney for the ACLU of Ohio, who told local media that conflicting laws ""should not be enforced,"" as evidence of the organization's offensive position regarding parental rights.  After the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June, Ohio banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, but the ban was reversed by a judge who reinstated laws permitting abortion up to about 22 weeks into pregnancy. It is unclear how the amendment would affect Ohio's existing abortion laws regarding minors if it was passed on the November 2023 ballot, but Hill made the ACLU's position clear. While he said some existing laws regarding abortion might remain on the books, he indicated that the current law requiring women under 18 to get parental consent or a court order before having an abortion would not stand if the amendment was passed. Abortion rights advocates gather in front of the J Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, on March 15, 2023. (MOISES AVILA/AFP via Getty Images)""When you pass a constitutional amendment, it doesn't just automatically erase everything and start over,"" Hill said. ""But it would mean that laws that conflict with it cannot be enforced, should not be enforced.""PWO claims the ACLU has been taking aim at parental rights for decades, directing Ohioans to a page on its website that details the organization's opposition to parental notification when a minor chooses to have an abortion. Natoce also pointed to the ACLU's past litigation and legal stances as evidence that they have a ""well-documented track record"" of ""fighting against parental consent."" In 2016, the ACLU was part of a lawsuit that fought to undo parental notification laws in Alaska and in 2017, the organization said Indiana parental consent laws created an ""unconstitutional undue burden on emancipated minors who do not have the consent of their parents and who wish to obtain an abortion."" In New Hampshire, the ACLU in the state is also part of a coalition of advocacy groups that opposes legislation that would codify and expand parental rights in education into law, the Concord Monitor reported last month. ""What this does is completely strip away any existing and future regulations that would require a minor to obtain parental consent or notification before obtaining an abortion or other reproductive procedures,"" Natoce said. ""Right now in Ohio, minors do need to obtain parental consent before obtaining an abortion, and this amendment would completely strip that away.""COLORADO HEALTHCARE CLINIC SUES STATE OVER LAW BANNING USE OF HORMONE THAT REVERSES EFFECTS OF ABORTION BILLShe also said it ""completely strips the legislature of their ability to do their job, to legislate.""""It would just completely take this out of the hands of Ohio voters and our elected representatives who are supposed to be representing our interests,"" she added. ""That's why this amendment is so dangerous. Once we're talking about codifying something into the state constitution, we are ending debate on it"" and ""making the government a co-parent in this situation.""As part of a $5 million statewide initiative headed by PWO, two separate video advertisements will air across the state, featuring concerned mothers Libby McCartney and Linda Corbitt, who detail how they believe the ACLU-backed amendment would eliminate parental notification and consent requirements. In one ad, Ohio mother Libby McCartney criticized the amendment for not differentiating between a minor and an adult. ""If you as a parent want to be involved in these big decisions in your child's life, read the amendment,"" she warned. ""You'll come to the same conclusion that this is about parental rights. It's not just about abortion like they say it is.""She slammed the ACLU for the way ""it was intentionally written using broad and vague language"" in a statement to Fox News Digital. Courtesy of Protect Women Ohio (Courtesy of Protect Women Ohio)""The words 'woman' and 'adult' appear nowhere in the amendment, meaning it applies to minors,"" she said. ""It says an 'individual' can make 'reproductive decisions including but not limited to' abortion. This means any procedure that affects reproduction is legal, even sterilization.""Ohio mother Linda Corbitt appeared in another ad condemning the amendment, calling out its drafters for using ""loose language terms"" like ""reproductive decisions"" to extend its reach beyond abortion.

The legislation allows exceptions to save the life of the woman and in the case of pregnancy caused by rape or incest until 15 weeks of pregnancy, but does not allow the mailing of abortion medication. The six-week abortion limit is expected to go to Republican Gov.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.With almost biblical certainty, most mainstream media reports indicate that abortion will be the issue to save the Democratic Party from the malaise generated by a feeble president, a stumbling economy and failed attempts at international peace. Specifically, abortion is presumed to be the way to energize young voters, certain targets in a race already too close to call.  That focus on abortion – the human rights issue of our day – has remained in the headlines since Roe v. Wade was tossed on the ash heap of history. With the youth vote reportedly one-third of the electorate and headed to a majority, getting past Planned Parenthood slogans to the fine print of policy will be vital for campaigning legislators. And on the issue of abortion, a significant number of youth voters are reachable and winnable for conservatives.  For the fifth year in a row, Students for Life of America took a look at the abortion views of registered youth voters or Millennials and Gen Z. Working this time with YouGov, our Demetree Institute for Pro-Life Advancement found that, far from being driven to vote for abortion, nearly two-thirds of young voters (65%) want limits on abortion.  AHEAD OF MARCH FOR LIFE, MISSISSIPPI UNVEILS MOBILE APP TO HELP PREGNANT MOMSIn fact, fewer than one in 10 voters support the radical abortion views of the Democratic Party of unlimited abortion through all nine months, up to and including infanticide for babies surviving a botched abortion. Democratic Party leadership can name no abortion they oppose. They support the radical, so-called ""Women’s Health Protection Act"" and oppose the ""Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act."" With the U.S. Capitol in the background, anti-abortion demonstrators march toward the U.S. Supreme Court during the March for Life, Friday, Jan. 20, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) But that’s not true for youth voters. For three out of four, abortion should not be legal at all after a baby can live outside the womb, and nearly all (91%) supported medical care for a child who survives a botched abortion.   And 37% support limits when a baby’s heartbeat can be detected or better, and more than half (54%) said legal rights begin in the womb.   For political leaders looking to make a connection, 31% said that they would be willing to consider more limits on abortion if more services for mothers and young families were in place.   When asked about a number of services that interested them, about six-to-seven in 10, they supported plans like parental leave, childcare subsidies, healthcare assistance and a number of policy items that legislators of all political parties should advance.   What they did not support was the Biden administration’s chemical abortion pill policies that expose women to abusers, infertility, injury and death. Though once again, nearly all (nine in 10) supported the health and safety standards now being debated before the Supreme Court, and their intensity of support increased.  Nearly all young voters (91%) also strongly supported environmental testing to determine if government-sanctioned, corporate dumping of chemically tainted blood, placenta tissue and human remains following a chemical abortion were harming the planet and all its inhabitants.    Even if you support abortion, that’s not an argument in favor of the reckless abortion policies of the Democratic Party. Interestingly, nearly two-thirds of the youth vote (65%), supported a national abortion reporting law that includes tracking both the number of abortions and the complications, something not taking place today. How odd for the Democratic Party and Planned Parenthood to insist that abortion is safe, while vigorously fighting to prevent true tracking of the effects of a procedure that abortionists claim impacts so many women.   Pro-life supporters march in Washington D.C., United States on January 20, 2023. (Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe poll also unpacks data on the youth vote response to messaging used in ballot initiatives, currently a get-out-the-vote Hail Mary for Democrats, finding that highlighting abortion extremism – the fact that such measures allow for abortion through all nine months – to be very important.   In 2024, abortion will be on the ballot in every state, as it is now possible to limit this deadly violence earlier in pregnancy, for the first time in the lifetimes of today’s youth voters. For conservatives, connecting with those concerned about abortion radicalism will be key. Consider the results of 2020. In Georgia, youth voters by 58%-39% went for Biden, accounting for 20% of the total vote, and he won by just 11,779 votes. In Arizona, young people voted 59%-37% for Biden and accounted for 16% of the total vote, giving him a win with just 10,457 more votes. That same kind of math carries into Wisconsin, Nevada and Pennsylvania.  For political leaders looking to make a connection, 31% said that they would be willing to consider more limits on abortion if more services for mothers and young families were in place.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOur analysis of youth voter participation data indicates that small, single-digit increases among conservative young voters can impact swing state outcomes, and that’s our plan. Appealing to a principled, pro-life plurality among the youth vote can be a game-changer for Republicans this election.

In an open-mouth-insert-foot kind of tweet, he passed the buck for the recent GOP election failures of his chosen candidates to those who believe that America should extend legal protection to human beings no matter their age or stage of development and who reject prejudice against the innocent for things out of their control.Not only did Trump throw the baby out with the proverbial bathwater, but he also tossed out their defenders as well, those quiet, hardworking volunteers who make up the ground game of GOP politics – the door knockers, the phone bank callers and texters, and the donors who put principle first and ask their leaders to do the same. Taking his talkers straight from hostile abortion supporters, Trump’s first mistake was muddying the discussion with the term ""exceptions"" that allows the abortion lobby to justify more than 63 million abortion deaths since 1973, while making multi-millions in profit each year.Life of the mother protections have almost universal support spelled out in every pro-life bill passed nationwide. Pro-life leaders like myself have been clear that it’s not an act of direct abortion when the struggle is to save two lives, but only one will make it.  PENCE SIDES WITH PRO-LIFE GROUP HITTING BACK AT TRUMP FOR BLAMING MIDTERM LOSSES ON PRO-LIFE REPUBLICANSYet, trying to conflate protecting both mother and child with prejudice against children based on the circumstances of their conception has been a long-term tactic of Corporate Abortion, built on a fabric of deliberate false statements. And the former president lent them a hand. Rather than addressing the impact of abortion on an innocent life or challenging the idea that the violence of abortion somehow cures the violence of rape, Trump pushed a knee-jerk narrative that challenging 50-year-old talking points is the problem.How regressive. Society did once penalize people based on the events of their conception. Those born out of wedlock did not have access to education, property ownership, inheritance protection, and the full protections of the law. But society evolved and now firmly rejects that prejudice.Today, many also reject prejudice against the preborn based on age, sex, race, stage of development, perception of abilities, a parents’ income, or manner of conception. And given the long-term track record of a pro-life position as vote earner, we also reject the self-serving analysis of a single election cycle. In November, many leaders who embraced the challenge of opening political dialog in new and effective ways saw great results. In the states of Texas and Florida, as well as Arizona, where ground-breaking political change in defense of life is taking place, current laws protect children no matter how they were conceived. Such protections were in 15 of 22 states that passed new pro-life laws this session. Leaders like Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Ted Budd, and Sen. Marco Rubio who talked about their pro-life convictions proudly won in landslides. Meanwhile, Trump backed politicians like Dr. Mehmet Oz and Blake Masters who failed to clearly define their pro-life convictions – whatever they were – failed to win votes. Consider the disastrous flip-flopping of Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen who proclaimed his new-found love for abortion while holding his infant grandson, something I parodied during the campaign.This November, virtually every state legislator who championed SFLAction inspired pro-life bills – from chemical abortion pill regulation to heartbeat legislation – was re-elected.

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOur country has had a sometimes-terrible history of mistreating people after devaluing them as less than fully human, less worthy, and less deserving of full rights under the law. That kind of fundamental problem won’t end in a day, but we can’t change that by starting our negotiations on pro-life legislation deliberately leaving some people out in the cold. It’s a work in progress to have these conversations, though in some states and in some debates, the outcome will not include protection for those conceived in rape and incest. Still, as part of that conversation and in the hearings to come, we hope to hear from those most impacted by this – from children conceived in rape and women who found abortion after rape to be another horrific burden to bear. We need to talk about the kind of support systems and criminal justice responses needed for these victims. The pro-abortion lobby will push their narrative, so let’s not ignore ours.  Trump is wrong to shut down debate. While pro-life Americans won’t always win the argument, we are not afraid to make the case that human worth is not diminished by events outside of an innocent child’s control. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KRISTAN HAWKINSKristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action, with more than 1,400 groups on middle and high school, college and university, medical and law school campuses in all 50 states.

UK authorities have dropped charges against a woman who was arrested for silently praying outside an abortion clinic in December, but warned she may face additional charges.Last December, Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, the director of the UK March for Life, was standing near the BPAS Robert Clinic in Kings Norton, Birmingham, when police approached after an onlooker complained she might be praying outside the abortion facility.Vaughan-Spruce was standing in an area under a Public Spaces Protection Order (""PSPO""), which establishes a ""safe zone"" around abortion clinics and prohibits ""engaging in any act of approval/disapproval,"" including praying. Despite the dropped charges, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) warned Vaughan-Spruce charges ""may well start again"" in the near future, according to a report by Alliance Defending Freedom UK. ""This is a warning prosecutors can issue when they expect that further evidence will be received,"" the legal nonprofit organization representing Vaughan-Spruce argued. Isabel Vaughan-Spruce (Courtesy of Alliance Defending Freedom UK)UK WOMAN ARRESTED FOR PRAYING NEAR ABORTION CENTER WARNS MORE ARRESTS MAY COMETo get a clear answer on whether silent prayer near abortion clinics is unlawful, Vaughan-Spruce says she will now be seeking a clear verdict in court.The pro-life activist says she intends to continue supporting women seek alternatives to abortion.""It’s important to me that I can continue my vital work in supporting women who’d like to avoid abortion if they only had some help. In order to do so, it’s vital that I have clarity as to my legal status. Many of us need an answer as to whether it’s still lawful to pray silently in our own heads. That’s why I’ll be pursuing a verdict regarding my charges in court,"" explained Isabel Vaughan-Spruce in a statement shared by ADF UK on Friday.She blasted the PSPO buffer zones which made her silent prayer a ""criminal"" activity.""It can’t be right that I was arrested and made a criminal, only for praying in my head on a public street. So-called ‘buffer zone legislation’ will result in so many more people like me, doing good and legal activities like offering charitable support to women in crisis pregnancies, or simply praying in their heads, being treated like criminals and even facing court,"" Vaughan-Spruce added.Charges were dropped against Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, who was arrested for praying outside an abortion clinic last December, seen here with Jeremiah Igunnubole, legal counsel for ADF UK. (ADF UK)UK MAN FINED FOR SILENTLY PRAYING OUTSIDE ABORTION CLINIC: REPORTVaughan-Spruce's legal counsel, Jeremiah Igunnubole, commended her next steps as necessary because of the CPS's warning more charges may be underway.""Isabel is right to request proper clarity as to the lawfulness of our actions. It’s one thing for the authorities to humiliatingly search and arrest an individual simply for their thoughts. It’s quite another to initially deem those thoughts to be sufficient evidence to justify charges, then discontinue those charges due to ‘insufficient evidence’, and then to warn that further evidence relating to the already unclear charges may soon be forthcoming so as to restart the entire grueling process from the beginning,"" he explained.Several other local councils have adopted PSPO zones, raising concerns about freedom of speech under threat across the UK.The ADF UK legal counsel warned these buffer zones chill freedom of ""expression and thought.""""This is a clear instance of the process becoming the punishment creating a chilling effect on free expression and freedom of thought, conscience and belief. ADF UK remain committed to supporting Isabel’s pursuit because no one should fear prosecution for silent prayer and thoughts in the privacy of their mind,"" commented Igunnubole.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOn ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" the pro-life activist revealed that abortion supporters have also expressed concern about these anti-protest laws.Equating it to George Orwell's dystopian ""1984"" novel, she described her case as really about ""freedom of thought"" rather than abortion rights.""This is more to do with freedom of thought here,"" she said.

Several political insiders suggest economic burdens felt by Americans will be the major driving force for voters in November, but others have their doubts.As inflation continues to rise, Republicans are pointing fingers at President Biden and Democrats for the economic burdens being felt throughout the country. Meanwhile, Democrats are relying on the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade to have a meaningful impact on the midterms, concluding that it will play a larger role than some may think.The Labor Department said Thursday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 0.4% in September from the previous month. Prices climbed 8.2% on an annual basis. Those figures were both higher than the 8.1% headline figure and 0.2% monthly increase forecast by Refinitiv economists, a worrisome sign for the Federal Reserve as it seeks to cool price gains and tame consumer demand with an aggressive interest rate hike campaign.With chatter among the two parties about what are, or are not, the main problems Americans face, the question remains whether pocketbook issues will turn out more voters on November 8 than protections for abortion. To better understand whether voters are now more concerned with the economy as opposed to abortion, Fox News Digital contacted political experts from both sides of the aisle to get their assessment.INFLATION SURGED MORE THAN EXPECTED IN SEPTEMBER AS PRICES REMAIN STUBBORNLY HIGHA man is shown displaying an empty wallet.

They now seek to distract from their failed economic policies and rising crime rates by spreading false narratives about abortion. The American people do not believe we should be begging Saudi Arabia to pump more oil when we can produce energy in our own country, if only the government would get out of the way. Nor do they believe we should force taxpayers to pay for abortions up until the moment of birth and trample on the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. Democrats’ extreme economic and social policies will rightly be rejected by the American people.""Star Parker, founder of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education.

(Phil Singer)SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS TO SEE BIGGEST COLA INCREASE SINCE 1981""Politics is all about timing, and both are trending in the wrong direction at the worst possible time for President Joe Biden and the Democrats. On back-to-back weeks, the Administration suffered major setbacks on the issues polls show are top of mind for voters: inflation and the economy. Last week, Biden face planted on the world stage when the OPEC cartel ignored his pleas to produce more oil. Since Biden has been hell-bent on keeping domestic and reliable sources of energy in the ground, our country finds itself at the mercy of foreign producers while paying sky-high prices in the meantime.""""The crippling interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve are so far failing to reign in inflation as intended, but they are threatening to drive the overall economy into a flat-out recession. Biden and team are out of time to shift the economic narrative, and these are the issues voters will take to the ballot box in three short weeks. The Democrats may be wishing the election fell closer to the Supreme Court decision in June, and the Dobbs decision will no doubt generate voter turnout on the left, but it won’t be enough to overcome the economic uncertainty coursing through our nation right now.""Colin Reed, founding member of South & Hill Strategies who served as campaign manager for former Massachusetts GOP Sen.

As more of these traumatic stories emerge, Republican candidates are doing everything they can to try and shift voters’ attention away from their cruelty against women and girls and towards issues like inflation, crime and immigration. Some Republicans have even taken to scrubbing their abortion stances from their websites and shamelessly changing their position in public, while GOP strategists desperately attempt to neutralize the abortion issue for supporters who otherwise lean Republican.

Whether it is purchasing groceries, gas, heating a home or paying rent, every American is concerned with rising costs. Inflation does not recognize political parties. When wages have increased to nearly one-half where inflation is rising to, everyone feels the pain.""""The Democratic Party would like to hide their losing agenda behind the Dobbs decision. However, the democrats are the ones failing women. Women generally, buy the groceries, find housing for the family, pay health care costs for aging family members and do so much more. Women, pay attention to what comes in and flows out of their pocketbook.

It’s why attacks about being soft on crime and dismissive of public safety are landing when leveled against Democrats like John Fetterman and Mandela Barnes. It’s also why Republicans have been blasting the Biden Administration’s misguided fiscal policies and their failure to tame inflation.""""Voters in swing states and districts are sick of high gas prices, potential tax increases, slow economic growth, and uncontrolled spending by Washington Democrats. They’ll vote with their pocketbooks and that will favor Republicans.

Wade.The constitutional amendment, backed by a campaign named Value Them Both (VTB), would have given elected representatives the ability to pass legislation regulating abortion in Kansas, which was restricted after the state's Supreme Court previously found the 1859 Kansas Constitution grants a ""natural right"" to abortion. At the time the AP called the race, voters had rejected the amendment by more than 20 percentage points.In 2019, the state's supreme court struck down a ban on surgical abortions in a 6-1 decision, ruling that the state's constitution protected women's choice to engage in that activity as a ""right.""OUT-OF-STATE DONORS SPENDING MILLIONS TO PROTECT ABORTION IN KANSAS AHEAD OF STATEWIDE VOTESigns in favor and against the Kansas Constitutional Amendment On Abortion are displayed outside Kansas 10 Highway on August 01, 2022 in Lenexa, Kansas.

Wade overturn and how these activist groups are targeting churches on ‘Special Report.’Several pro-choice protests and vandalism at Catholic churches across the nation following a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court which showed that federal protections for abortion may soon be in jeopardy. But whether such demonstrations will have an impact on Catholic voters is uncertain.Plans for the Mother's Day protests — orchestrated primarily through social media sites like Twitter, TikTok and Reddit — appear to target the religion of some Supreme Court justices after the draft high court draft opinion striking down its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which grants federal protections for abortion, was leaked to the public last week.ACTIVISTS LAY OUT PLANS FOR ROE V.

In addition, reports of churches being vandalized surfaced last week after the release of Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion.Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, a non-profit conservative political advocacy group, told Fox News Digital over the weekend that he believes Democrats are in hot water amid the ongoing church protests as midterm elections near.REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHAT THE SUPREME COURT'S LEAKED DRAFT OPINION MEANS FOR CONGRESS""Democrats are in a difficult position,"" Burch said. ""Their base is clamoring for a full-throated, restriction free, abortion rights policy, yet the majority of voters aren't with them. I think this is another example of Democrats misreading the public and overreaching. They've done it on parental rights, on schools, curriculum, race, and now abortion.""""The leaked opinion is actually a compromise on abortion,"" Burch said. ""It merely returns the issue to the states to work out how to best care for unborn children and their mothers. It imposes nothing. As far as Catholics are concerned, Catholics are very practical voters, which is why many of them swing both of the political parties. I think Democrats need some Catholics in order to win many key races and to the extent that Democrats align themselves with the extreme left, I think they're playing with fire.""Burch, discussing the destruction of Catholic churches over the years, said he believes there will be ""universal condemnation among Catholics"" regarding the recent vandalism. ""Both Democrats and Republicans do not want to see their houses of worship defaced or destroyed or their shrines and symbols destroyed.""Vandalism on the Sacred Heart of Mary Church.  (Mark Haas)Burch also took aim at the Biden administration's response to recent protests targeting the Catholics and their faith, saying it is ""shameful that he has yet to say anything against these open threats.""""I think this president has made clear that he prioritizes his political success over his faith,"" Burch said. ""He's done that on policy, and now he's doing it on a very pressing issue, a significant issue, when it comes to threats on the property of Catholic churches.""Ultimately, Burch said he believes that Biden ""won't have a choice"" in speaking out against the protests should they get out of hand.

""You're just seeing the activists on both sides here.

""They do support it in terms of rape, incest, life of the mother, they don't support abortion in the second and third trimesters and all of that is definitely been very, very stable over the years, frankly. So, I don't think that the ending of Roe changes that aspect of public opinion.""Noting that he believes the ""reasoning is important,"" White said he believes a reversal of Roe v. Wade, should a dissent cite that abortion is not a right enumerated in the constitution, opens up a ""kind of pandora's box on privacy rights, birth control, gay marriage, and so forth.""ROE V.

""The decision may motivate them more, but they were already with the Republicans, generally, anyway. It's not necessarily religious identity that people carry first and foremost into the voting booth like they did, say in 1960.

""We don't have the final opinion, but you have to think what is going to be the most on the minds of voters come November. Is it gonna be inflation, the economy or is it gonna be this issue?

George Santos, traded barbs during a debate when asked about a number of topics – including immigration and abortion.Democrat Tom Suozzi, a former lawmaker in the House who unsuccessfully ran for governor of the Empire State twice, and Republican Mazi Pilip, a former Israel Defense Forces soldier and relative political newcomer serving as a Republican county legislator, met face to face on Long Island in the first and only debate in the special election for New York’s 3rd Congressional District.Hosted by News 12 Long Island, the pre-taped debate featured a number of topics that are top of mind as voters weigh who to vote for in the contentious election.Asked by a voter in the district who attended the debate what steps they would take to address the migrant crisis in New York City and the impact it's having on those who live in the district, Pilip replied, ""Before we even address the issue inside, we have to make sure first and foremost we need to secure the border. After that, then we have to come up with a plan. We have to know who's here. We don't even know who all those people are.""DEMOCRAT SUOZZI RUNNING FOR GEORGE SANTOS SEAT TAKES HEAT FOR 2019 POST ON ICE AMID NEW YORK'S MIGRANT CRISISDemocrat Tom Suozzi and Republican Mazi Pilip met face to face in the first and only debate, which aired Thursday night, in the special election for New York’s 3rd Congressional District.

""Once we secure the border, we have to review to see who those people are and what we should do with them.""Responding to Pilip's remarks on the topic, while not addressing the question specifically about how he would handle the immigration issue himself, Suozzi said, ""Mrs. Pilip points out there's a problem, there's a problem, there's a problem. She has no solutions. There's a solution that's been proposed in the United States Senate that would actually build more wall, would get more border agents, would deal with asylum seekers, would reform the laws to make it better, and would give money to the state of New York and the city of New York to deal with the migrant crisis that we currently have.""""Right now, they wanna try and put more migrants over at Creedmoor,"" he continued. ""I've already registered my complaints with the city of New York, saying ‘don’t put anymore at that location.' The reality is, I know how government works, I know how to get things done, I know who to talk to, how to stop things, and how to make things happen My opponent in this race is very good at pointing out the problems … except her opposition to this bipartisan deal will result in the border staying open for years and years and years, and more migrants coming to New York. She has no solutions whatsoever. … That's not how you govern.""The bipartisan ""solution"" referenced by Suozzi in the back and forth between the candidates appeared to be the supplemental spending agreement that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan as well as an ambitious border security and immigration package that failed to pass the Senate on Wednesday.Former Rep.

Pilip told Fox News Digital that the post to Facebook at the time demonstrates that Suozzi ""can't run away from his record of supporting Joe Biden's open borders, sanctuary cities, and lawlessness.""On the topic of abortion, Pilip, who noted she was ""pro-life"" and the mother of seven children, said, ""I’m not going to force my own beliefs to any woman, therefore I’m not going to support a national abortion ban.""Pushing Pilip on the issue, Suozzi questioned Pilip about whether she would vote to codify Roe v.

Turnout for the abortion vote could meet or even exceed turnout for the 2008 presidential race. Asked about the decision from Kansas voters and whether it is a signal for what may be to come in the midterm elections, Michael McAdams, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), insisted in a statement to Fox News Digital that Democrats created an ""economic mess"" that voters will carry with them to the polls in November.BIDEN TO SIGN SECON EXECUTIVE ORDER TO EXPAND ABORTION ACCESSPro-choice protesters gather outside the Supreme Court in Washington on June 24, 2022.

The law does not include exemptions for minors who may have been raped by their parents, but a biological father who raped his daughter and caused her pregnancy cannot pursue civil action.The Tennessee statute is similar to the ""abortion trafficking"" law enacted in Idaho last year.

The congregation argued that Jewish law ""does not consider life to begin at conception or at 15 weeks"" and refusing an abortion could violate their beliefs.Though Rubin questioned whether this would sufficiently infringe on ""First Amendment rights and the state constitution’s free-exercise clause,"" she still considered the issue ""important.""""In any event, this is an issue the forced-birth crowd should care about.

My peers wake up and scroll through social media; I wake up and scroll through all the hateful and threatening comments I’ve received overnight. These past few days have been especially terrible as I’ve received more than 20,000 messages after a pro-abortion comedian made a viral video attacking my pro-life beliefs. I’ve been told that I should have been aborted and should get killed or raped — so ""pro-woman,"" right? However, while I find it very disturbing, I can’t say I’m surprised. The abortion lobby supports violence in the womb when a baby is deemed an inconvenience … so of course they support violence against people like me, as I’m also inconvenient to their narrative. That’s why when a popular TikTok creator made a video criticizing me, her audience immediately flocked to my social media accounts to spread hate, find out my personal information and wish horrific violence upon me. 'ABORTION IS OK' HIGHWAY BILLBOARDS ANGER SURVIVORS: 'ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING'The video, posted a few weeks ago, already has more than 3 million views. Popular creators are echoing support for bashing me, including transgender celebrity Dylan Mulvaney who commented, ""Nailed it."" Lydia Taylor has been threatened with rape and murder because of her pro-life support. Hey Dylan, I thought abortion supporters believed in ""No uterus, no opinion.""  I’ve since posted response videos, pointing out that while the abortion lobby claims to support women, they send actual death threats to females who have differing opinions. Pro-abortion commenters didn’t care; they told me that I deserved it all.  I deserve hatred online because I dare to think babies are precious? To be attacked in public bathrooms like I was earlier this year because I think women deserve better than abortion? To be continuously stalked, spit on and harassed because I think all humans deserve equal rights?  Abortion supporters’ moral compass is clearly broken.  Yet when asked why I continue on despite all the backlash I’ve faced, my answer is simple. While I am a victim of pro-abortion intimidation and violence, the greatest victim of abortion will always be the preborn children killed every day. With such an inhumanity happening, I can’t bring myself to be silent — and especially while it is celebrated. I’ve been told countless times by abortion supporters that they are going to get pregnant and name the baby ""Lydia"" after me just so they can abort it. How can I sit back when such injustice is accepted?   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONI can’t — so I continue to respond in love and offer help to women considering abortion. As a Students for Life of America (SFLA) spokesperson and intern, I’ve worked hard to make my state of North Carolina pro-life. This summer, I organized and led several protests and rallies in support of pro-life legislation. We successfully passed a 12-week abortion prevention act which both saves preborn lives and grants funds to pregnancy resource centers (and it’s only the beginning).  My school's SFLA group works hard to make a pro-life impact on campus, as well. During my freshman year of college, we worked to pass a resolution to provide more accessible pregnancy resources to students, and it became the first pro-life resolution ever passed at my university. I also went on to change more than 120 students’ minds on the abortion issue — all while getting death threats slipped under my dorm door.  This is what being a part of the Pro-Life Generation is about: ignoring the abortion lobby’s extreme attempts to silence us and persevering to the win.  Lydia Taylor is a pro-life college student and this is one of many thousands of messages she got for her for beliefs.

Several people have told me that the hatred they’ve seen from the abortion lobby towards me has convinced them to never support the pro-abortion side. Their true colors were revealed, and it turns out hating women and the preborn is pretty ugly looking — so keep up the good work.   Regardless of how long this hostility goes on (and I’m not holding my breath), our mission as the pro-life movement to promote a life-affirming culture is clear. That’s why I’m okay waking up every day to be met with threats and hatred…because every night I go to sleep knowing I am fighting on the right side of history. Lydia Taylor is the Students for Life of America president’s brand and marketing intern, as well as a student at a university in North Carolina. ","https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/pro-abortion-radicals-want-raped-killed-just-because-pro-life-college-student",4781,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,"female"

With the Supreme Court poised to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, Democrats in the Senate will seek to codify the right to an abortion into federal law with a vote Wednesday that is doomed to fail, but will lay the groundwork for midterm campaigning.But in a very crowded Democratic primary election in Chicago to succeed retiring Rep. Bobby Rush, one candidate is running on a pro-life platform that he hopes will propel him to Congress and force the Democratic Party to rethink its abortion stance.PRO-LIFE DEMOCRATS SOUND OFF ON SUPREME COURT LEAK, DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM NATIONAL PARTY LEADERS""My pro-life position is a distinguishing factor which is important in a 17-way race,"" Democratic candidate Chris Butler told Fox News Digital. ""If folks want to vote for somebody who is going to go to Congress and take the very unpopular position of abortion on-demand up to the ninth month of birth paid for by tax dollars… they've got 16 people to choose from.""""That's the thing about the Democratic primary, if you do not sign on to that extreme orthodoxy, then you have only one candidate.""Chris Butler is a pro-life Democrat running in a crowded primary in Illinois' First Congressional District to succeed the retiring Rep.

(Photo courtesy of Chris Butler campaign )Butler, 37, is a pastor at Chicago Embassy Church Network and said it's a ""huge mistake"" for the Democratic Party to position itself as pro-abortion which signals to certain people of faith there's ""no room"" for them. Butler is endorsed by former Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski, a longtime anti-abortion Democrat in Congress who was booted out of office by a pro-choice challenger, Marie Newman, in 2020. If he wins, Butler says his victory should ""stir something"" on the national level and help ""the party to see that Democrats need to make room for pro-life Democrats in the party.""The bill Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is bringing for a vote Wednesday is the Women's Health Protection Act. It's been criticized by pro-choice Republican Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, as ""overly broad,"" including striking down state limits on abortion, even bans on gender-based abortion. SCHUMER TO FORCE DOOMED ABORTION 'SHOW VOTE,' AS TOUGH MIDTERMS LOOM FOR DEMOCRATSKristen Day, executive director of Democrats For Life of America, called out the Democratic Party for actively pushing out anti-abortion Democrats and going ""way off the rails"" with extreme abortion legislation, including the Women's Health Protection Act.Kristen Day, Executive Director of Democrats For Life of America  (Democrats For Life of America)""It's a huge mistake,"" Day said of Schumer forcing a vote on the abortion bill. ""He thinks he's motivating his base, which maybe he is, but he already has that base. So who is he trying to reach? Because he's alienating people like me with doubling down on this extreme abortion policy goes further than Roe. It's like Roe on steroids. It basically eliminates all health and safety regulations across the nation.""Day worries the party is alienating some 20 million pro-life Democrats with its legislative agenda and official stance that ""abortion is health care."" She calls that messaging ""ridiculous."" Abortion, she said, ""is the death penalty.""The House passed the Women’s Health Protection Act back in September and just one Democrat voted against it — moderate Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar — in a sign that the pro-life Democratic caucus is in the verge of extinction on the federal level.As a life-long Catholic, Cuellar said he's pro-life and won't support ""extreme"" positions like late-term or partial birth abortion. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., announced Tuesday he would join with Democrats in voting in favor of the bill to ensure access to abortion nationwide despite calling himself ""pro-life."" The announcement is notable since he's the son of the prominent pro-life former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey who is the namesake of the landmark 1992 Supreme Court case on abortion restrictions, Planned Parenthood v. Casey.UNITED STATES - JANUARY 27: Sen.

""His spine must be made of jelly,"" she said. For his part, Sen. Casey said he's concerned about a number of states banning abortion outright if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, as expected by the leaked draft opinion. He's also troubled by Republicans in Congress seeking legislation to impose a six-week ban nationwide. ""I don’t support a ban on abortion,"" Casey said Tuesday.The Senate abortion bill marks a political line in the sand, but it's expected to fail Wednesday without the necessary 60 votes. Republicans oppose the measure and they are likely to get the support from the one remaining pro-life Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said the vote is needed to show Americans exactly ""where their elected representatives in Congress stand.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Every senator will have to explain whether they defend the right of every person to have control over their own bodies and their own futures,"" Warren said in a speech Tuesday. ""Or whether they will stand by as women’s constitutional rights are brazenly stripped away.""Butler, the Democrat running in Chicago, said there should be no litmus test on abortion for Democrats. He wants the pro-life Democratic caucus in Congress to grow beyond Cuellar and Manchin.Pro-life Democrats who could be outstanding candidates are too afraid to run because ""they know that the party … would rather smack them down on this one issue than see them provide leadership,"" Butler said.Fox News' Caroline McKee and Tyler Olson contributed to this report. Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

"385","Marjorie",364,"Overturning Roe vs. Wade was huge, but this abortion case is the biggest yet","Marjorie Dannenfelser",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," April 11, 2023 6:00am EDT","The HHS secretary also scorched the Texas judge's ruling on the abortion pill as un-American.After more than two decades, the whole sordid truth about how the Food and Drug Administration put politics before safety to approve the abortion pill is finally coming out in Texas. After hearing hours of oral arguments in the most important abortion-related case since Dobbs, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas halted FDA approval of the abortion pill, to take effect in seven days pending appeal.  In a separate case in the Eastern District of Washington state, a federal court granted a preliminary injunction blocking any change in the status quo on mifepristone only in the plaintiff states, but declined to issue a nationwide order.Because the Texas decision pertains to the original approval of the abortion pill in 2000, while the Washington state case is about more recent changes to FDA rules, the Texas order will control.For over 20 years, doctors and other advocates for authentic, life-affirming health care have challenged the FDA’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone. For as many years, their pleas have gone unheard. Finally, last November, a group of physicians led by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine sued the FDA.SCHUMER SAYS JUDGE'S MIFEPRISTONE ABORTION PILL RULING ‘COULD THROW OUR COUNTRY INTO CHAOS’The FDA is a federal agency with one job: protecting Americans’ health and safety. With countless women injured or even dead because of mifepristone, this major lawsuit is an indictment of their failure to do that job.The FDA disregarded its own rules in more than one way. In order to take advantage of their accelerated approval program to fast-track the abortion pill, they redefined pregnancy as an ""illness."" They also performed no studies focused on girls under 18, as they are required to do. No one knows how this potent drug might affect young girls’ development, because no one bothered to find out.Since the late 90’s, the FDA has ignored challenges and multiple citizen petitions raising the red flag on the lack of oversight and safety against the abortion pill. Under every Democratic president from Clinton onward, standards have been lowered – most recently when the Biden administration decided to permanently allow abortion pills to be sent through the mail, without anyone ever needing to set foot in a doctor’s office.Meanwhile the peer-reviewed science and data on the dangers of abortion drugs has kept piling up. Major international studies show that the abortion pill carries four times the risk of complications as surgical abortion. A 17-year longitudinal analysis found that the rate of abortion pill-related emergency room visits has spiked more than 500 percent since mifepristone was approved.Mailing abortion drugs is against federal law and the laws of many states for good reason. Without a real exam, not just a Zoom call, there’s no way to screen for conditions like ectopic pregnancy. The cramps and bleeding a woman may be told to expect as part of the abortion process can mask signs of a life-threatening emergency. Without being able to look the patient in the eye or speak with her confidentially, there is also no way to tell whether a coercive boyfriend, husband or sex trafficker is standing just out of view.Americans recognize that this is reckless – and the government’s protestations that mifepristone is ""safe and effective"" despite all these flaws tends to undermine the FDA’s credibility, not bolster it. New, in-depth polling conducted by CRC Research for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America finds that 61 percent of Americans believe it is not safe to mail abortion drugs with little or no supervision, due to the risks of coercion and abuse. Sixty-two percent don’t feel confident knowing the FDA doesn’t track side effects other than death. A whopping 75 percent think the FDA should have studied the effects of the drug in young girls before approving it for minors. On every question, a majority are clearly uneasy about trusting the FDA.The Biden administration is pushing for a district judge to rule in favor of federal approval for an abortion drug, mifepristone, in the name of the 'public interest.' (REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs/Illustration)There are dire medical consequences as well. OB-GYNs in states like Texas are regularly called upon to address serious complications that Planned Parenthood doesn’t treat – and that the FDA hasn’t tracked for years. It isn’t the abortion pill suppliers who end up holding the hands of desperate, scared patients who come to the ER needing a blood transfusion, surgery or treatment for a severe infection. This is especially dangerous for women in rural areas who might drive for several hours to get to their doctor appointment. Women also suffer emotionally and don’t know what to do when they see the body of their child, visible and recognizably human, delivered into the toilet.Does that sound like a drug that is supposedly ""safer than Tylenol""? That is one of the radical abortion lobby’s favorite talking points in the Dobbs era, as more and more states enact strong protections for the unborn and their mothers. However, pro-abortion activists’ extreme behavior – personal attacks and even death threats toward the judge, questioning the legitimacy of the process, and acting like this case spells the end of public health as we know it – suggests that even they know the facts aren’t on their side.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERAmid the contentious and even violent climate created by pro-abortion misinformation, most Americans can agree on matters of common sense. Abortion should have far greater limits, say seven in 10 Americans, including women, Independents and almost half of rank-and-file Democrats. Our children deserve protection during some of the most vulnerable years of their lives. Women deserve better than dangerous drugs that put them at risk. And with nearly 3,000 pregnancy centers and maternity homes nationwide, the pro-life movement stands ready to connect them with the gamut of resources they may need – without judgment and with true compassion.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pro-life advocates proudly stand with the overwhelming majority of OB-GYNs who want nothing to do with the violence of abortion and work hard to give every mother and baby the best possible care. We welcome the chance to make the case against mifepristone using science and data, to educate the public, and to hold the FDA accountable.The battle is not over. In the Dobbs era, the radical abortion lobby will fight tooth and nail to keep its ‘insurance policy’ of mail-order abortion pills. However, we believe and hope this case could result in much stronger protections for women and girls as well as unborn children. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARJORIE DANNENFELSERMarjorie Dannenfelser is president of SBA Pro-Life America. ","https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/overturning-roe-wade-huge-this-abortion-case-biggest-yet",6934,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,"female"

The position of today’s Democratic Party – abortion on demand until birth, paid for by taxpayers – has never been popular. Even immediately after Dobbs, it garnered only 10% support. Florida Senator Marco Rubio won by going on offense against his opponent's abortion extremism. (Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images)In the presidential election cycle that’s just beginning, it is a given that candidates must go on offense – but it’s not sufficient. They must also center a strong, pro-life GOP agenda around national minimum protections for the unborn child and mothers. One prominent Democrat pollster conceded the party’s fear of this debate, saying, ""Debating [gestational] weeks is not where we want to be,"" and blaming voters: ""People are terrible at math and terrible at biology.""The kernel of truth is that Dobbs posed the best chance Democrats will ever have to use the abortion issue politically and energize a demotivated base. It was a unique, once-in-a-lifetime, seismic event. During this general election, Democrats spent an unprecedented $391 million on abortion-focused TV ads alone, compared with only $11 million on the GOP side – outspending them more than 35-to-1. Combined with the primaries, Democrats spent more on advertising than McDonald’s Corporation did last year (albeit less than Planned Parenthood’s annual taxpayer funding). Republicans who weren’t prepared were susceptible to bad advice. They did their best imitation of an ostrich – burying their heads in the sand, letting their opponents define them. Dr. Oz’s loss in Pennsylvania and Adam Laxalt’s in Nevada are two disappointing examples.For Democrats who spent millions casting their opponents as heartless villains who don’t care if women die, and were met with silence or a weak response, lying worked.  But for those whose Republican opponents not only strongly refuted them, but also went on offense and challenged them to defend their actual agenda, pro-abortion extremism became a liability.  Republicans will likely still take back the House majority.  Republican Senate candidates who won were clearly the reasonable adults in the room on abortion policy, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, North Carolina Senator-elect Ted Budd and Ohio Senator-elect J.D. Vance. They exposed their opponents as extremists who support abortion on demand without limits, in contrast to a well-articulated pro-life position centered around consensus measures such as protections for unborn children when their heartbeat can be detected or they can feel pain. Republican Senator-elect J.D. Vance of Ohio won with a well-articulated pro-life position. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete)Starting in mid-September, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham’s legislation to set a minimum national limit on abortion at 15 weeks provided a concrete backstop against the Democrats’ smears. All three winning Senate candidates embraced this political gift to their advantage. Rubio deserves special mention as the first Senate colleague to co-sponsor Graham’s bill, and he didn’t hesitate to call out his opponent Democrat Val Demings’ record of opposing any limits. The clear takeaway for GOP candidates entering the 2024 presidential cycle is this: Winners define their opponents, contrasting their extremism with a well-articulated pro-life position centered around consensus measures such as protections for unborn babies when their heartbeat can be detected or when they can feel pain. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERPro-life governors also did particularly well. Governors Greg Abbott, Ron DeSantis, Mike DeWine, Kay Ivey, Brian Kemp, Henry McMaster, Kristi Noem, Kim Reynolds, Kevin Stitt and others were handily re-elected. The smallest margin of victory among them was eight points, the largest 37 points. Each has signed ambitious pro-life protections into law. Dobbs did not sneak up on them, because they had already spent months or years preparing and debating the issues. By the end of the week, Kari Lake in Arizona could join the winners’ ranks.

WADE OVERTURNEDThis dark vision means gruesome late-term abortions could become normalized procedures and the trauma they inflict  on post-abortive mothers would be downplayed or ignored. Survivors of  botched abortions would be left to suffer their first and last minutes outside the womb alone, cold and in excruciating pain – because  pro-abortion radicals have fought against policies requiring they be afforded basic medical care. In the abortion activist’s utopia, all pregnancy resource centers and maternity homes would be shuttered despite all the financial and physical resources they provide women and their kids. This is wildly unpopular with the American people, as polling from this year shows 91% of Americans support them. They would even want to force pro-life or ambivalent Americans to shut up and fund these procedures in their health care plans.   What a horrifying, dystopian vision, right?  Tragically, this vision is already a reality in some places throughout our country.   To date, six states plus our nation’s capital of Washington, D.C., allow abortion up until birth, while 17 states do not offer protections for babies that can feel the pain of dismemberment abortions in the womb. But Democrats and abortion activists say these states don’t go far enough to fight for even more radical policies that don’t serve women or save children. For example, in Maine they’re voting to pass a bill allowing abortion at any point up to birth. Supporters of the bill claim such late-term abortions would only be allowed if ""deemed necessary by a licensed physician,"" but anyone who has followed abortion policy throughout the past half-century knows that such loopholes have been exploited for pretty much any  reason, including ""mental,"" ""emotional"" and even ""financial"" health. ABORTION-BY-VENDING-MACHINE IS MUCH WORSE THAN IT SOUNDSAs if that weren’t enough, Maine’s state Senate  blocked a proposed amendment that would have put limits on the trafficking of fetal remains from late-term abortions.In Maryland,  this past year an ""all-trimester"" abortion clinic opened. Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin admitted that there isn’t a single limit on abortion that he supports. ""It’s up to women to make that decision,"" he said.  And who could forget, the jaw-dropping admission from former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who shamelessly voiced his support  for infanticide on air.  Northam’s words rightly shocked Americans, many of whom thought they’d never live to see an America where babies were killed after birth.   But elective up-to-birth abortions are real. A shameless, recent feature in the Atlantic glamorized the nauseating history of  Colorado’s late-term abortionist Dr. Warren Hern. Hern, the article writes, ""has been performing late abortions for half a century."" Disturbingly, Hern shared that half, if not more, of the women who come to his clinic do not have ""medical diagnoses"" for late-term abortions but he performs abortions for them anyway.

Just last year,  the nation was shocked at the discovery of five fully-formed, mutilated  bodies of aborted babies in a box headed for the incerator, possibly victims  of illegal partial birth abortions, linked to his  late-term abortion facility the Washington Surgi Clinic.  Santangelo is also currently the  subject of a  medical malpractice lawsuit  alleging that an abortion he performed caused a woman’s death.

The risk is increasing as these chemicals are found in more and more places in higher amounts.""Among all types of PFAS, the one that had the most adverse impact on fertility was perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). PFAS (perfluoroalkyl substances) are chemicals that are often found in drinking water and ordinary household products. (iStock)PFDA is found in the environment and also in coatings on carpets, couches and food packaging, according to the National Library of Medicine.Other chemicals that affected fertility in the study were perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (a key ingredient in stain repellents), perfluorooctanoic acid (found in Teflon and GoreTex) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (an environmental contaminant).The study’s senior author Dr. Damaskini Valvi, assistant professor of environmental medicine and public health at Icahn Mount Sinai in New York City, believes that PFAS pose multiple risks to public health. SPERM COUNTS AND CONCENTRATIONS DECLINING GLOBALLY SINCE 1970S BUT FERTILITY IMPLICATIONS UNKNOWN: STUDY""In girls and women in particular, PFAS exposure has been further associated with delayed puberty onset, as well as increased risk for endometriosis, PCOS and breast cancer, which further supports the adverse effects that PFAS have on the female reproductive system,"" he told Fox News Digital in an email. Women with a combination of seven PFAS in their blood were 30% to 40% less likely to conceive and deliver a live birth, according to new research.  (iStock)PFAS have also been shown to increase the risks for thyroid diseases, high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes and chronic liver disease, as well as certain types of cancer, such as kidney and testicular cancer, Dr. Valvi added.Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, medical toxicologist and interim executive director at the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C., said PFAS exposure is also associated with increased risks of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, as well as decreased fetal growth and reduced birth weights.She was not involved in the study. MATERNAL DEATH RATE IS ON THE RISE IN THE US, THE CDC REPORTS""Since PFAS chemicals are known to cross the placenta, they can potentially affect the health of both the mother and the fetus,"" she told Fox News Digital in an email. Lead study author Dr. Valvi noted that population studies in the U.S. and many other countries have identified adverse health effects from exposure to even very low amounts of PFAS.""There is also continuous PFAS exposure through the consumption of contaminated drinking water, contaminated food and consumer product use — which means PFAS accumulates in our body over time, potentially increasing our risk for chronic diseases in later life,"" he said.PFAS chemicals can potentially affect the health of both the mother and the fetus.""At the current time, we don’t have enough data to tell us what a ‘safe’ level of PFAS exposure is,"" said Dr. Johnson-Arbor. ""There are ways to monitor the levels of PFAS in human blood, but these tests are not readily available in hospitals or doctors’ offices and are typically used for research purposes only.""Dr. Valvi stressed the importance of limiting exposure to PFAS, given the health risks.""However, because PFAS are widely used in several consumer products and we now face a global contamination PFAS problem, we cannot fully avoid exposure without stricter regulations that ban the use of PFAS as a class,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""There are more than 10,000 PFAS released in our environment, but current regulations consider only 10-20 of those. That’s not enough.""To avoid PFAS exposure, the study author recommends using stainless pans instead of non-stick cookware. (iStock)""To effectively address the PFAS problem, it is important to advocate for stronger regulations that ban the presence of PFAS as a class in consumer products and drinking water in the U.S. and globally,"" Dr. Valvi continued.US TO PROPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON ‘FOREVER CHEMICALS’ IN DRINKING WATER AFTER PREVIOUSLY UNDERESTIMATING ITS RISKSEarlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed new federal regulations of PFAS chemicals in drinking water, which would limit them to the lowest possible level that can be measured.The proposal calls for limiting the PFOA and PFOS chemicals to 4 parts per trillion, and would also limit four other PFAS as a mixture.Action would ""mark a major step toward safeguarding all our communities.""""EPA’s proposal to establish a national standard for PFAS in drinking water is informed by the best available science, and would help provide states with the guidance they need to make decisions that best protect their communities,"" said Michael S. Regan, EPA administrator, in a press release on the agency’s website. ""This action has the potential to prevent tens of thousands of PFAS-related illnesses and marks a major step toward safeguarding all our communities from these dangerous contaminants.""""Based on the results of this study, it is reasonable to recommend avoidance of excessive PFAS exposure for women who are trying to become pregnant or who are experiencing infertility,"" said Johnson-Arbor. With PFAS present in everything from cookware and carpets to drinking water and the air we breathe, it can be difficult to completely avoid exposure. However, there are some steps people can take to reduce the risk.Of all types of PFAS, the one that had the most adverse impact on fertility was perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), which is found in the environment and also in coatings on carpets, couches and food packaging. (iStock)Dr. Valvi recommends using a certified water filter that removes PFAS in the home, and also using stainless pans instead of non-stick cookware.""It’s best to avoid stain-resistant and water-resistant products, because almost all of these products contain multiple PFAS,"" he added.SCIENTISTS REVEAL SIMPLE NEW PROCESS THAT MAY HELP ELIMINATE TOXIC CHEMICALS FROM EVERYDAY ITEMSStudy co-author Dr. Nathan Cohen, a postdoctoral research fellow with the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told Fox News Digital that diet is a very common source of exposure to PFAS.PFAS are found in drinking water, as well as on some couches, carpets, cookware and food packaging.""Women who are planning pregnancy should avoid foods that have been shown to be associated with increased PFAS exposure in previous studies,"" he said. ""These primarily include take-out and fast foods that are packaged in materials that may contain PFAS, such as fast food, popcorn and pizza.

Wade.""If no one went and checked for a fetal heartbeat before performing an abortion, we have a problem,"" said attorney Briscoe Cain, a Republican state representative in Texas helping with the case, who spoke with Fox News Digital.Silva claims in the suit that his then-wife learned she was pregnant in July 2022 and kept the pregnancy a secret from him while she coordinated with two friends to obtain abortion-inducing medication.The lawsuit bases many of its claims around alleged screenshots from a group chat between the wife and the two friends. The alleged texts show the friends attempting to help her terminate her pregnancy and sending her information about Aid Access, an organization that sends abortion-inducing medication through the mail, according to a report from the Texas Tribune.5 WOMEN SUE TEXAS OVER ABORTION BAN, SAYING IT RISKED THEIR LIVESA Texas lawsuit may threaten the nationwide availability of abortion-inducing drugs.

""If I told him before, which I’m not, he would use it as [a way to] try to stay with me.

The two women have not faced criminal charges in the case, and the ex-wife is not named as a defendant due to state laws that specifically exempt pregnant women from prosecution.Cain told Fox News Digital that they are also trying to find out who manufactured the medication, arguing they could also be held responsible in the case.""They're illegal,"" Cain said of the pills the pregnant woman took. ""We don't know the manufacturer or the supplier of them, but should we find out in discovery, they will be added to the lawsuit as the defendant.""He also believes the ex-wife's friends showing a desire to keep the text message exchanges secret from Silva shows they were aware that what they were doing could be against the law.Texas State Capitol (Tamir Kalifa / Getty Images)JANE FONDA SUGGESTS 'MURDER' TO FIGHT ABORTION LAWS IN WILD APPEARANCE ON 'THE VIEW'""I think it goes toward the culpable mental state of those helping the mother by saying, ‘Don’t keep him informed,'"" Cain said.

The July 2022 incident happened shortly after the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision – but a month before a state law went into effect that makes performing an abortion a crime that carries a sentence of up to life in prison.But Cain argued that state statutes that predate Roe remained part of Texas law and went back into effect following the Supreme Court's recent landmark decision.The U.S. Supreme Court (Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images)PENTAGON BANNED FROM FUNDING ABORTION TRAVEL FOR SERVICE MEMBERS UNDER NEW GOP BILL""Our pre-Roe statutes … they were never repealed,"" Cain said.

""Courts don't write laws nor do they actually strike laws, that's not how it works.

Therefore, the average teacher’s pay will increase by half to $144,620 in the 2027-2028 school year, it says. That figure would equate to more than double the median household income in Chicago, according to Census Bureau statistics. The Chicago Tribune reports that the CPS budget will exceed $9 billion this year, up nearly 30% from $7.4 billion just five years ago. Much of that increase is reflected in teacher salaries, which are among the highest of any big-city teachers in the country.Last school year, the district spent more than $21,000 per student, far above the national average of $14,347, according to census data. Gates’ plan also calls for teachers and counselors to be paid a stipend of $1,000 per student per semester when they are assigned a number of students above contractual limits and a retirement bonus of $2,500 for employees with more than 30 years of service.""We are asking you to give us an opportunity to tell our story,"" Gates said in a speech in March referring to the union’s plans.

The two incidents took place on June 4 and 5, 2021. Prosecutors argue that the activists violated the 1994 FACE Act, a federal law that prohibits physical force, threats of force or intentionally damaging property to prevent someone from obtaining or providing abortion services. One of the defendants in the case, Lauren Handy, was sentenced last week to four years and nine months for organizing a similar protest in Washington, D.C., in 2020.

Minutes later, Christopher Moscinski and Audrey Whipple came through the front door.Several of the defendants then began handing out roses to patients and pleaded with them not to go through with abortions.The staff then tried to take the patients out of the waiting room and McDonald is alleged to have ""forcefully grabbed a patient’s body"" and told her not to have an abortion.After the workers asked the activists to leave, the police arrived, but the activists began occupying the waiting room floor by lying down or kneeling, according to the complaint. ""All of you staff, your paychecks are from blood money of the innocent children you’re ripping to shreds… God has a plan for your life and this is not it.

Wade's precedent, MSNBC's Joy Reid claimed that the court was filled with ""religious zealots"" who ""lied"" about precedent to get past ""gullible senators"" and land a spot on the Court. Two days after the ruling, NBC's Chuck Todd, during an interview with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., read off a statement from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., who said that he was ""alarmed"" by the ruling and ""trusted"" the justices to uphold the precedent. Todd noted that it seemed Ocasio-Cortez believed that Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch lied to Manchin; Manchin was the only Democrat who voted for both judges. He voted against Justice Amy Coney Barrett.""They lied,"" Ocasio-Cortez replied. Sirus XM shock jock radio host Howard Stern claimed that the Supreme Court lied publicly and said that it undermined their reputation. He added that they sat on TV and told America that they ""would never"" overturn Roe v.

The columnist pointed to notes published by The New York Times indicating Kavanaugh explained his respect for precedent when asked about Roe v. Wade, but never made any promises.

They claim that Kentucky’s legislators unconstitutionally imposed ""sectarian theology"" with their abortion restrictions.

Studies show the drug, which is often taken privately without medical supervision, has four times the complication rate of surgical abortions.The lawsuit comes as the Biden administration continues to promote the use of abortion pills as a way to maximize abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Health and Human Services said it will fight against future restrictions against abortion pills at the state level and warned that a refusal from pharmacies to provide access could be a violation of civil law.In December, the FDA made permanent a pandemic-era decision to allow women to receive abortion pills via mail and allowed doctor visits to obtain prescriptions to be done virtually.Fitton said he is concerned the FDA ""is playing politics with the safety of this drug.""""The Biden administration wants the pill to have wide access, so anything that threatens that agenda will be kept secret,"" Fitton told Fox News Digital. ""If this pill is as important as the Biden administration suggests, then American women have the right to as much information as possible on its safety and efficacy.""Abortion pills have steadily increased in popularity over the past two decades.

The FDA approved mifepristone to be prescribed and sold in the U.S. in 2000, and the agency continues to monitor its use through its Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, which require reports of adverse events for drugs deemed to have serious health risks.However, the Obama administration in 2016 ended requirements to report adverse events after taking the drug, such as hemorrhages and ectopic pregnancies, so long as they do not result in death.Dr. Ingrid Skop, a senior fellow at the Charlotte Lozier Institute with more than 25 years of experience as an OB-GYN, said the federal government owes its citizens answers on abortion pills, especially considering its documented risks.""Judicial Watch’s action shines light on the FDA’s lack of transparency regarding the dangerous drug mifepristone,"" Skop told Fox News Digital. ""After 22 years, and progressively diminished supervision, the American public still has no reassurance regarding the quality of the manufacturing process or the quantity of complications because the FDA does not mandate complication reporting unless it results in a woman’s death.""The FDA and HHS did not respond to a request for comment.Mifepristone terminates a pregnancy by stopping the woman’s production of progesterone, which is the hormone that develops the fetus. The pill is usually followed by another drug, misoprostol, which causes cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus of the no-longer-living fetus.DEMOCRATS POUR CASH INTO ABORTION ADS IN EFFORT TO TURN FOCUS FROM THE ECONOMYPresident Biden tugs at shirt collar while in White House.

The Population Council was then tasked to find a pharmaceutical company through Danco Laboratories to manufacture the drug and eventually settled with a Chinese company after a European one backed out in fear of protest from pro-life activists.The agency claimed earlier this year that U.S sold mifepristone manufacturing site switched from China to Europe, but declined to provide information on if, when, and how it changed pharmaceutical companies.GenBio was approved to distribute the first genetic version of mifepristone in 2019, which had previously only been sold by Danco Laboratories under the label Mifeprex.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMeredith Di Liberto, an attorney for Judicial Watch, said the health risks of abortion pills makes this information essential to the wellbeing of the public.""The question is simply what is going on — and if there’s nothing nefarious, then let us know,"" Di Liberto told Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Samantha Hendrickson)""Ohio voters rejected an effort by Republican lawmakers and special interests to change the state’s constitutional amendment process. This measure was a blatant attempt to weaken voters’ voices and further erode the freedom of women to make their own health care decisions,"" President Biden said in a statement. ""Ohioans spoke loud and clear, and tonight democracy won.""The result was a rare defeat for Republican power in Ohio, a one-time premiere battleground state that has trended red in recent election cycles and where the GOP controls the offices of governor, secretary of state, attorney general and both chambers of the state legislature.HOW THIS CRUCIAL MIDWESTERN BATTLEGROUND SHIFTED FROM PURPLE TO REDTina Ramirez, a National Institute of Family and Life Advocate (NIFLA) board member and single mother, told Fox News that ""yesterday’s vote was not just a referendum on abortion access, it was a referendum on the constitutional rights that are most at risk of being infringed upon by opportunistic special interest groups and progressive lawmakers.""And she argued that ""by retaining a low threshold on constitutional amendments, Ohioans continue to run the risk of losing their right to control their children’s education, self-defense, and other values that are supposed to be protected by our government.""The sound defeat of Ohio's Issue 1 appears to be the latest victory for the abortion rights movement since the Supreme Court's conservative majority overturned the landmark nearly half-century old Roe v. Wade ruling, which allowed for legalized abortions nationwide. The decision by the high court moved the divisive issue of abortion back to the states. Abortion rights advocates won high-profile votes last year in Michigan and Kansas, and the GOP's stance on abortion was blamed by plenty of political pundits for turning an expected red wave in last November's midterm elections into a red trickle.An attendee uses a sign to shield the sun during a ""rosary rally"" in Norwood, Ohio, on Sunday.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.A new study claims to have found a ""significant"" gap in the federal government's reporting on complications from the abortion pill known as mifepristone – raising questions about how informed officials were when they deregulated its use in December.Last month, the Food and Drug Administration cited its adverse event (AE) reporting data in justifying its decision to remove the drug's in-person requirement. ""FDA determined that the data support modification … to reduce burden on patient access and the health care delivery system and to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh the risks,"" the agency said.A Mifeprex (mifepristone) pill, also known as the RU-486 abortion pill. (Tribune News Service via Getty Images) But a group of physicians from the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG) is claiming that available data shows a ""significant discrepancy"" between FDA data and reporting from sources that inform those numbers. Determining the FDA's accuracy is relatively difficult as it requires comparing the agency's own data with those of private entities like Planned Parenthood. The FDA relies on AE reporting from Danco Laboratories, which manufactures the abortion pill and uses AE's reported by Planned Parenthood. Danco did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Dr. Donna Harrison, a co-author and CEO of AAPLOG, told Fox News Digital that 2009-2010 offered the best opportunity for comparing data sources and that the ""situation which allows a direct comparison does not exist outside of 2009 [and] 2010.""FDA LOOSENS RESTRICTIONS ON TELEMEDICINE ABORTIONS AS THE SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS ROLLING BACK ROE V.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which has backed deregulating mifepristone's use, criticized the study in a statement to Fox News.""Decades of rigorous scientific data conducted separate from government mandated reporting measurements indicate that medication abortion is safe and effective, with risks similar to or less than other common medical procedures,"" said ACOG's Dr. Nisha Verma. CHEMICAL ABORTIONS SAW 500% INCREASE IN RATE OF ER VISITS FROM 2002-2015: STUDY""ACOG supports the FDA’s recent removal of specific restrictions on mifepristone, a decision that was based on careful review of the extensive data. This study contains potential methodological flaws and likely inappropriately drawn conclusions that contradict the decades of science and practice demonstrating the safety of medication abortion in the US.""ACOG did not respond when asked for specifics on potential flaws in the study. Dr. Mitchell Creinin, who co-authored the Cleland study, cautioned against gleaning too much from the study. ""FAERS is a passive reporting system primarily meant to catch rare outcomes,"" said Creinin, who currently serves as director of family planning at UC-Davis.  ""With such large numbers of medical abortions, small differences in numbers means nothing.  FAERS did not identify any volume of unexpected outcomes, which is really the main goal of reviewing that data source.  Prospective studies with known numerators and denominators are the most accurate sources of data.  The findings from the Cleland study are very much in line with the rest of the peer-reviewed medical literature. For this and other reasons, I am confident that even if small differences exist, they are not massive as the paper attempts to suggest."" In a statement to Fox News, the FDA said: ""In general, the FDA does not comment on specific studies.""It added that ""[a]s with all drugs, FDA continues to closely monitor the postmarketing safety data on mifepristone for the medical termination of pregnancy.

More specifically, chemical abortion visit rates increased by 507% (8.5 to 51.7 per 1,000) between 2002 and 2015. During that same period, the surgical abortion visit rate increased 315%.CLI's study also aligns with one from Finland, which has a single-payer system that makes tracking the issue easier.

Debate has swirled over whether it means simply guaranteeing equal opportunity or eliminating systemic biases against races, ethnicities and other marginalized identities.Regardless, rhetoric around systemic inequality – particularly systemic racism – has included arguments about abortion's disproportionate impact on minorities.BLACK PRO-LIFE LEADERS PAN PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S SANGER DISAVOWAL: ‘LIKE CHANGING THE NAME OF AUSCHWITZ’Despite their lower population levels, non-Hispanic Black women accounted for the largest percentage of abortions (38%) in 2019, while non-Hispanic White women accounted for 33%. And compared to White women, ""abortion rates and ratios were 3.6 and 3.3 times higher among non-Hispanic Black women and 1.8 and 1.5 times higher among Hispanic women,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. The agency has attributed this to ""disparities in rates of unintended pregnancies, structural factors, including unequal access to quality family planning services … economic disadvantage, and distrust of the medical system.""Portrait of cute baby boy with Down syndrome on the bed in home bedroom. (iStock)And out of 1,000 live Black births, 390 Black children were aborted in 2016, according to the CDC. The Guttmacher Institute, which previously functioned as the research arm of Planned Parenthood, similarly reported that Black, non-Hispanic women saw the highest abortion rate (27.1 per 1,000 women aged 15-44) in 2014, compared to other racial groups. That was nearly three times the rate of White abortions (10 per 1,000 women aged 15-44). It's difficult to obtain comprehensive data for abortions in response to genetic anomalies, but evidence points to even more lopsided proportions. The battle has played out at the state level as abortion providers have fought for abortion access, regardless of prenatal diagnosis. In 2019, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Indiana attempting to reinstate its Down syndrome abortion ban. However, the court's only Black justice, Clarence Thomas, authored an opinion in which he warned that abortion could be used as a tool for eugenics. ""[A]bortion has proved to be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics,"" he wrote. Those preferences extend to fetal sex as well. A 2019 study also argued that sex-selective abortion had created a gender imbalance in certain parts of the world with ""23.1 million missing female births globally.""Abortion rights advocates and anti-abortion protesters demonstrate in front of the United States Supreme Court on Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021, in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Planned Parenthood hasn’t elaborated on how many of its 300,000-plus abortions every year are performed on Black mothers. Regardless, several analyses have shown that Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics in general tend to disproportionately find their way in or around Black neighborhoods. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S NIECE REBUKES GILLIBRAND ON ABORTION: 'CIVIL RIGHTS BEING IN THE WOMB'The uneven abortion rates seemed to have impacted certain populations as a whole. In 2017, CBS noted that Iceland had almost eliminated Down syndrome as nearly 100% of women who received that prenatal diagnosis terminated their pregnancy. A 2015 study reportedly concluded the Down syndrome population in the U.S. was 30% lower than it would have been without abortions resulting from prenatal diagnoses. Another study similarly found a 27% reduction in the Down syndrome population for Europe in 2015.Abortion in the U.S. has also lopped millions of potential years off Black life, according to one study. A 2016 report examined the top causes of death among Black, White and Hispanic Americans, and measured how much that cost individuals assuming their life expectancy was 75. Using data from 2009, the authors found that induced abortion siphoned 25,431,750 years of potential life from Black people compared to 22,721,475 from Whites and 15,479,100 from Hispanics.In October, the Charlotte Lozier Institute published a paper in which Dr. Monique Chireau Wubbenhorst, a Black woman, reviewed data on Black abortions.She noted that ""at every gestational age up to 21 weeks, more abortions are performed in African American women than any other ethnicity.""""They are thus more likely to be exposed to the risks and adverse outcomes of second trimester abortion. African American women are also two to three times more likely to die from abortion. The impact of abortion on maternal morbidity and mortality, fetal mortality and population health in African Americans is considerable, without any apparent benefit proportional to the disparities in risk and outcomes.""That's why advocates like Alveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, have decried abortion as a deviation from the civil rights hero's vision. Responding to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in 2019, King told Fox News: ""I need for her to understand that abortion is a civil wrong. And of course, if you're pro-life, you can't be racist because you're defending life for the most defenseless population on the planet -- the little babies in the womb.""King himself supported limiting family sizes while his wife accepted an award from Planned Parenthood on his behalf in 1966. Despite Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger's controversial statements about Black Americans, Corretta Scott King praised Sanger, saying that ""[b]ecause of her dedication, her deep convictions, and for her suffering for what she believed in, I would like to say that I am proud to be a woman tonight.""Planned Parenthood, the nation's leading abortion provider, says its services provide an answer to systemic racism. Pregnant women, it says, face disproportionately higher barriers to reproductive services compared to those of other races and ethnicities.This appears to have led the organization to set up facilities in Black communities across the U.S.KANYE WEST GETS EMOTIONAL ON PRO-LIFE CAUSE AT FREEWHEELING EVENT: 'NO MORE PLAN B. PLAN A.'A Life Issues Institute report indicated in 2017 that a spate of new PPFA ""mega-centers"" targeted women of color. ""Our research revealed that an alarming 88 percent (22 of 25) target women of color. Disturbingly, 80 percent target Black communities, 56 percent target Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods and 80 percent target one or more colleges. In total, 96 percent (24 of 25) of the mega-centers target women of color, college women, or both,"" it claimed.Guttmacher has pushed back on the claim that abortion clinics targeted minority neighborhoods by publishing data showing that most abortion providers (six in 10) have been located in majority-White neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the proportion of majority-Black neighborhoods was much smaller (6%).The conversation around what constitutes systemic racism has been ongoing and complicated. Do disproportionate economic pressures constitute systemic bias? If so, would that bias extend to abortions resulting from social and economic pressures? Data has shown that financial reasons are among the top motivating factors for women obtaining abortions.Terrisa Bukovinac, who founded Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, told Fox News Digital that abortion redistributes oppression in several ways.'BABY LIVES MATTER' MURAL PAINTED IN FRONT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC""Capitalism and White supremacy have exploited people of color at disproportionate rates who have often experienced generational trauma and extreme poverty since colonization,"" she said Monday. ""Big Abortion is exploiting families and redistributing this oppressive reality lethally onto another vulnerable group, the unborn. The industry is lining their pockets and gaining immense political power on the backs of those utterly incapable of defending themselves. Abortion is violent, state-sanctioned oppression against Black babies, and we will not stand for it. We demand economic and racial justice for all, and that includes the unborn and their parents. None of us are free until all of us are free.""In a lengthy statement, Planned Parenthood rejected the idea that Black women were participating in a genocide against their own race. CareNet President Roland Warren had suggested as much when he compared a New York clinic to Auschwitz.""Black women are free to make our own decisions about our bodies and pregnancies, and want and deserve to have access to the best medical care available,"" said Nia Martin-Robinson, Planned Parenthood's director of Black leadership and engagement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Any insinuation that abortion is Black genocide is offensive and infantliziling.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., joined 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss his stance on abortion ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health overturning Roe v. Wade, corporations have sought creative ways to provide employees access to abortion. A slew of businesses have promised to pay abortion travel benefits to employees who must travel out of state or long distances to receive desired abortion services. These businesses include Amazon, Bank of America, Comcast, Goldman Sachs, Kroger, Starbucks, Yelp, and the list goes on. But employers providing such benefits may want to think twice. Their new policies open the door to expensive, time-consuming employment discrimination lawsuits.Federal employment law includes prohibitions against discrimination based on sex, pregnancy, and religion under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and against discrimination based on disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Under both laws, employers must not discriminate with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Travel benefits certainly qualify.DANNENFELSER & KREIFELS: WOKE CORPORATIONS PROMOTE ABORTIONTitle VII and its subpart, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, neither require nor preclude an employer from providing abortion benefits. The employer who chooses to provide abortion benefits, however, must do so in a non-discriminatory manner. In other words, an employer who grants a financial benefit to an employee who travels to access abortion services to terminate a pregnancy must provide an equivalent financial benefit to an employee who travels to access medical services to maintain a pregnancy or to obtain medical care for an unborn child.  Under the newly announced abortion-travel benefits, employers promise a cash benefit to formerly pregnant employees who return from travel no longer pregnant due to abortion while promising no cash benefit to pregnant employees who return from travel still pregnant. This is pregnancy discrimination plain and simple.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency tasked with enforcing Title VII and the ADA, has issued guidance that makes clear that discrimination based on an employee’s intention to continue rather than terminate a pregnancy violates Title VII. Related regulations explain that benefits for pregnancy-related conditions must be ""the same"" as for other conditions. In short, any abortion-travel benefit must have a corresponding benefit for pregnant employees who do not choose abortion.Abortion travel benefits may constitute not only pregnancy discrimination but also disability discrimination. Under the broad protections of the ADA, an employer that provides healthcare travel benefits to an employee who wants to travel for abortion services may need to provide equivalent benefits to an employee with a disability who wants to travel for healthcare services.  In its ADA regulations, the EEOC has recognized that employer-sponsored wellness programs—which are required to be voluntary on the part of employees in order to be nondiscriminatory—can be coercive rather than voluntary when the employer provides a financial benefit to the employee who participates. Similarly, an employer-sponsored abortion program can be coercive rather than voluntary when the employer provides a significant financial benefit to the employee who participates.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEREmployers should also consider the impact of their abortion benefit policies on employees whose religious beliefs prohibit abortion. As EEOC religious discrimination guidance explains, ""Title VII is violated when an employer ... explicitly or implicitly coerces an employee to abandon ... a religious practice as a condition of receiving a job benefit or privilege.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe public would benefit from the EEOC’s providing education and guidance on this pressing issue. Under the law, employers must not tip the scales by subsidizing employees' abortions while disenfranchising employees who choose both career and childbirth.Rachel N.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has felt like a gut punch -- not only because women deserve every opportunity that men have, but because I had an abortion 15 years ago.Mine is not the kind of story that any mother who has been in my position wants to relive, believe me. But we are desperate to get far right politicians to see the damage they will do if they eliminate access to safe abortion.When I made the decision to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons, I was 37 years old. My husband and I were thrilled when we found out we were pregnant but a little apprehensive with the extra caution required when you’re over 35. SUPREME COURT ROE V WADE DECISION REAFFIRMS WHY WE MUST FIGHT TO ELECT PRO-CHOICE, DEMOCRATIC WOMENAt our 12-week ultrasound, everything seemed right on track, so we shared the exciting news with our family. Our 5-year-old daughter was ecstatic and immediately started talking to my belly, telling her little brother or sister she loved them. I felt so much joy watching her sweet face full of excitement.I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that it was the right decision for me and my family, including my unborn child.But then a few days later, I got the call from the doctor that my blood test indicated Trisomy 18 — a chromosomal disorder that they classify as ""incompatible with life."" Essentially, my pregnancy would end with the death of our child, either a stillbirth or my baby living a very painful short life of only minutes outside my womb before dying. We were stunned.They asked me to come in immediately for a genetic test that eventually conclusively confirmed the diagnosis. My perinatologist and my OB both recommended termination because of my age and because I had young children who depended on me. SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINIONAfter a week of sleepless nights researching Trisomy 18 and searching for any hope that the doctors could be wrong, all while my daughter continued kissing my belly, talking to her little brother or sister -- the result was always the same.My heart was breaking into a million little pieces. The decision seemed impossible. I kept trying to imagine what my husband and I would say when unsuspecting friends or even strangers happily asked when I was due or if we knew the baby’s gender. And then there was the crippling vision of our youngest daughter, who’d only be 6-years-old, burying her sibling who she had come to love so much. My doctor checked in several times that week and always reminded me how hard pregnancy is on the body. My daughter’s birth had been no walk in the park. Then she asked: Is it worth risking your life and possibly leaving your daughters without a mother only to delay the inevitable? I knew what I had to do and scheduled the abortion.SUPREME COURT RULING PROVES WE WEREN'T 'HYSTERICAL,' WE WERE RIGHTI have absolutely no doubt in my mind that it was the right decision for me and my family, including my unborn child.I hope and pray that my daughters never have cause to consider such an impossible decision.  But it’s devastating to think that, should the worst happen, they might not have the same freedom to choose what’s best for their family.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The Supreme Court’s decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion is a disaster. Even Americans who like the outcome because they oppose abortion should find the ruling deeply troubling because it treats the sacrifice that women undertake in reproduction as if it were a minor inconvenience. In particular, the opinion manifests no appreciation for what women who do not want to be pregnant endure when the government compels that status upon them.Many people think that because the Constitution says nothing about abortion, it follows that the Constitution does not protect abortion. But that kind of logic does not suit a Constitution written in general terms to serve the people over the course of centuries. The Constitution does not contain the word ""Internet,"" but the Supreme Court, in Reno v. ACLU, rightly construed the First Amendment to protect online speech. To similar effect, the Supreme Court long ago ruled, in Rochin v. California, that the government violates the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause when it ""shocks the conscience"" by inducing a criminal suspect to vomit narcotics that he allegedly swallowed, even though the Constitution does not contain guidance on the practice and we have no history of prohibiting the use of emetics by government or private individuals. SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINIONWhen the government forces a woman to remain pregnant against her will, it thereby generates an enormous amount of often-crippling nausea, far more than it does by giving a criminal suspect an emetic on one occasion. So why is the emetic shocking and thus unconstitutional, while forced pregnancy is not?The Supreme Court has also said, in Winston v. Lee, that ordering surgery on a suspect on the basis of mere probable cause (to believe his body contains evidence of crime) is unconstitutional. Forced pregnancy will frequently lead to surgery as well. In the United States, C-sections account for about a third of deliveries. Why would the Constitution protect criminal suspects from forced surgery but allow laws that will effectively require thousands of women to conclude an unwanted pregnancy with unwanted surgery?Now one might object that the right to liberty ends when its exercise results in harm or death to another. If one thinks that a zygote, embryo, or fetus is a human being entitled to life, then one could say that the interest in that life outweighs the infringement of a pregnant woman’s liberty that abortion prohibitions impose.SUPREME COURT ROE V WADE DECISION REAFFIRMS WHY WE MUST FIGHT TO ELECT PRO-CHOICE, DEMOCRATIC WOMENThat is a fair point. Reasonable people can disagree about when and how to balance a woman’s liberty against the interest in life of the zygote, then embryo, then fetus developing inside her. Members of the Supreme Court pose for a group photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, April 23, 2021. Seated from left are Associate Justice Samuel Alito, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, Chief Justice John Roberts, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer and Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Standing from left are Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Associate Justice Elena Kagan, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch and Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett.  (Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File)What makes Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion in last week’s abortion case so unpersuasive is that it dismisses altogether and barely even discusses a pregnant woman’s interest in termination.The majority says nothing about the nausea, vomiting, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, pain, insomnia, anxiety, and many other kinds of sickness that pregnancy often inflicts. The majority also says nothing about rape or incest, even though the Mississippi law before the Court contains no rape or incest exception.Instead of acknowledging the tremendous costs of forced pregnancy that women will immediately suffer after last week’s opinion—including a woman’s substantially increased risk of death —the opinion departs from the particulars of the 15-week ban at issue in the case to tell legislatures that from the moment of conception, bans are a-okay.SUPREME COURT RULING PROVES WE WEREN'T 'HYSTERICAL,' WE WERE RIGHTIf I disagreed with someone I respected about a matter that the majority acknowledges is ""a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views,"" I would—in addressing them—make sure to ""show my work,"" as math teachers like to say. I would discuss the countervailing considerations, especially if I were writing upwards of 70 pages. Justice Alito, however, fails to do so. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito addresses the audience during the ""The Emergency Docket"" lecture Thursday, Sept. 30, 2021 in the McCartan Courtroom at the University of Notre Dame Law School in South Bend, Ind.  (Michael Caterina /South Bend Tribune via AP)Indeed, in an opinion that ignores the individual interest at stake for women experiencing an unwanted pregnancy, the majority quotes from seventeenth century English jurist Sir Matthew Hale. Hale said that terminating a fetus at or after quickening (when the woman can feel the fetus moving inside her) is a ""great crime."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERHale, proving his bona fides as a misogynist from over 300 years ago, sentenced two women to death for witchcraft, spoke enthusiastically of every husband’s legal and moral entitlement to force intercourse upon his nonconsenting wife, and promoted the sexist (and factually unsupported) view that jurors must bring a profound skepticism to the claims of the remaining rape victims (those whose alleged assailants could not take advantage of the marital rape entitlement).Crowds outside the Supreme Court reacting to the Dobbs ruling. (Joshua Comins/Fox News)One walks away from the Court’s abortion opinion with the sense that even a one-celled zygote takes absolute priority over the lives and experiences of women. Indeed, the Court says nothing about whether the Constitution would stop the government from banning an abortion needed to save the life of the mother.I understand that people who regard themselves as pro-life may not be ready to change their minds. But I hope I have helped readers understand why I and many others regard the abortion decision as among the most disrespectful to issue forth from the high court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPJustice Alito had a month and a half to change his leaked draft into something less dismissive and contemptuous of pregnant women who feel the need to exit their pregnancies.

(iStock)When their child turned three years old, they completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), which ""has been widely used in studies of neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in young children,"" per the study.The women completed the 99-item CBCL questionnaire that asked them to rate their child using a three-point scale on a variety of behaviors, such as restlessness, avoiding eye contact and not wanting to sleep alone. The mothers were interviewed at baseline to evaluate for depression and the level of stress during pregnancy. The study found that approximately 42% participants reported using acetaminophen during pregnancy, with a third of women going through labor induction and 29.4% undergoing a Cesarean delivery.The women who used acetaminophen were also more likely to have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, have private insurance and be non-Hispanic white.The study noted several limitations, including not determining the dose or frequency of use of acetaminophen among the participants’ pregnancies. (iStock)These women were more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression before their pregnancy and were more likely to report high levels of stress during their pregnancies. They were also more likely to have ingested other non-prescription drugs in addition to acetaminophen, compared with women who did not take acetaminophen.COW-CUDDLING AS STRESS RELIEF: IT'S ‘NATURALLY RELAXING,’ SAYS AN ANIMAL SANCTUARYWhen the study analyzed the data without controlling for confounding variables, it found ""acetaminophen use was associated with higher scores in three areas: [children who are] withdrawn, [have] sleep problems and [have] attention problems.""Health care professionals should balance the benefits with the risks in recommending acetaminophen during pregnancy, the authors of a new study suggested. But after the study accounted for variables that could confound the results — such as stress during pregnancy — the researchers found the children of women who used acetaminophen during pregnancy were significantly more likely to have sleep problems and attention problems compared to the children of women who did not take acetaminophen during pregnancy. OHIO WOMAN'S SECOND BABY AS ‘A RESULT OF CO-SLEEPING’: WHAT IS CO-SLEEPING?The authors noted that the association between acetaminophen use and adverse child behavioral outcomes was ""mitigated"" after controlling for the participants’ stress — which suggests that stress and the use of acetaminophen may independently affect behavioral outcomes in children. The study noted several limitations, including not determining the dose or frequency of use of acetaminophen among the participants’ pregnancy and also not stratifying the use of acetaminophen by trimester. The study only assessed the child’s behavior via the mother's observations and impressions — not via a trained psychologist.The researchers may have also underestimated acetaminophen use among the participants because the women were only asked about their medication history at one time period during their pregnancy.  The study also only assessed the child’s behavior via the mother's observations and impressions — and not via a trained psychologist.The pregnant women were only asked about their medication history at one time period during their pregnancy, not consistently throughout the pregnancy. (iStock )This study concluded in its findings ""an association between acetaminophen use and child behavioral problems at the age of three years.""Health care professionals should balance the benefits with the risks in recommending acetaminophen during pregnancy, the authors suggested. The FDA is aware of previous research that has shown an association between acetaminophen and the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children born to women who took the pain medication during pregnancy.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERThe agency reviewed the research — but because of potential limitations in design and sometimes conflicting results, it has not found a reliable conclusion, according to its website.""Pregnant women should always consult with their health care professional before taking any prescription or OTC medicine,"" the FDA said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Women taking pain medicines who are considering becoming pregnant should also consult with their health care professionals to discuss the risks and benefits of pain medicine use.""","https://www.foxnews.com/health/acetaminophen-pregnancy-linked-attention-sleep-problems-young-children-new-study",7082,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,"male"

(Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue)In May, the Planned Parenthood Advocacy Project Los Angeles County Action Fund released a letter that slammed Caruso for his past support of anti-abortion politicians and organizations. It called on Caruso to clarify in writing his stance on reproductive rights, as well as issue a public apology for ""the countless actions you’ve taken that put women’s health and well-being at risk."" The letter also urged him to participate in a listening session with reproductive rights leaders.That same month, Caruso tweeted that he ""profoundly disagrees with the draft decision,"" adding he is pro-choice.""If it becomes final, the justices in the majority will have taken away the rights of millions of people in this country and put lives in jeopardy,"" he tweeted at the time. My position has always been clear. Like most, I support a woman's right to choose and if made final, this will hurt many of our fellow Americans.

Caruso changed back to Republican in 2016 — a year when he served as California campaign co-chair for Republican John Kasich’s presidential bid — and then to independent again in 2019. He became a Democrat shortly before entering the mayoral race in February.He’s donated to candidates in both parties, which has led to criticism from Democrats who point to his financial support for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, among others. And he’s been routinely attacked for an opulent lifestyle, including owning a nine-bedroom yacht.In June of this year, Los Angeles Magazine noted that Caruso secured a slew of celebrities to endorse his mayoral run, including Kim Kardashian, Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg, among others.KATY PERRY ESCAPES HOLLYWOOD 'BUBBLE' BY LIVING IN KENTUCKY: 'HOLLYWOOD IS NOT AMERICA'My position has always been clear.

Now they are sharing their perspectives that often seem glossed over by the mainstream media.""I think a part of me always had a sensitivity to animals,"" Bukovinac told Fox News Digital. After growing up in a pro-choice church, Bukovinac said she shared the same ideas, but she said losing her religion compelled her to become more in-tune with the sanctity of life.PROGRESSIVE PRO-LIFE GROUP LAUNCHES, SAYS ‘ABORTION INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX’ PUTS PROFITS OVER PEOPLEProgressive Anti-Abortion Uprising members Terrisa Bukovinac and Kristin Turner.

And I bet you support Planned Parenthood, don't you?' I didn't really think about that because losing this belief in a life after death and a belief that God is going to right all the wrongs in the end is kind of what kept me out of the abortion debate for a long time,"" she said.Turner, on the other hand, said her experiences with sexual abuse, a pregnancy scare that compelled her to consider abortion as an option and her realization of how the procedure is performed forced her to change her pro-choice stance.""I researched, and I watched the abortion procedure videos, and stuff like that made me realize, 'Wow, that's a human being.' Silently killing them would never undo the trauma that I faced,"" she said.""I had a sense of identification with a child because I felt inhuman [following sexual assault]. I felt unseen because of the abuse I faced.

""I think it's really interesting that they do have to use such labels to try and fit a specific idea of what a pro-life position is. And I think that that's pretty much been their only go-to strategy in terms of media messaging for the last 50 years.""MSNBC didn't reply to a request for comment.Turner says the mainstream media feeds off people's identities – especially the identities of marginalized groups – to create further division on the issue.""As somebody who belongs to marginalized identity groups, I find it very problematic that they're weaponizing that to dehumanize unborn human beings,"" she said.Bukovinac had a similar media experience to Turner's when Salon published an article about ""Republican Karens"" fighting to ""end legal abortion"" and featured her image in the thumbnail.

Anthony (SBA) Pro-Life America is urging Republican candidates not to stick their heads in the sand ahead of the 2024 elections, but rather paint Democrats as unpopular on abortion.Since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned nearly 50 years of precedent that effectively legalized abortion, Democrats have attributed political wins to the unpopularity of pro-life causes.But SBA said in a memo, sent to Republican leaders and committees Monday, that Democrats' message is more fearmongering than fact, and it wants GOP candidates to emphasize that Democrats want to place America ""on a short list of the most pro-abortion countries in the world.""HERE ARE THE TOP 4 MOMENTS FROM THE 2024 MARCH FOR LIFE""There are no protections for the unborn that Democrats can bring themselves to support, and they are consistently on the record opposing the protection of unborn babies when they can feel pain, even legislation to provide basic health care for a baby born alive after a failed abortion,"" the SBA memo says.Pro-life supporters take part in a ""Rally for Life"" march and celebration outside the state Capitol on Jan. 27, 2024, in Austin, Texas.

The research was conducted by Adam Schaeffer of Evolving Strategies, a behavioral science and political data firm.The WHPA passed the House in 2022, but failed in the Senate. Billed as a codification of Roe v. Wade, the measure goes beyond enshrining the 1973 abortion ruling and effectively would make it impossible to restrict abortion at any stage, according to SBA. ""In our test, the WHPA was characterized as sweeping federal legislation that would wipe away nearly all state limitations on abortion, even those that limit late-term abortions on healthy babies and ensure parental involvement when a young girl becomes pregnant,"" the SBA memo said. The other part of the ""winning"" message involved support for pregnant women and help for mothers – including expanding child tax credits.""GOP support for mothers in need was characterized in our testing as offering women real options to choose life and embracing policies that would streamline adoption services, increase the child tax credit, make baby items tax-free, and provide funding to pregnancy care centers and maternity homes. Further, women should be informed about the financial help and adoption services available so she can make an educated choice,"" the SBA memo said.PRO-LIFE CONSERVATIVES ARE 'DISAPPOINTED' IN TRUMP'S NEW ABORTION POLICY, BUT STICK BY HIM: 'ONLY ONE OPTION'SBA said it is committed to delivering its message to key presidential and congressional battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Montana.But without individual candidates joining the messaging, SBA indicated that Democrats would continue to see success in their spreading ""falsehoods and fearmongering"" in favor of abortion access.SBA Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser, right, has urged Republican candidates to be clear about their commitment to protecting life in the womb.

He had just called for a federal 15-week ban on abortion, which didn’t sit well with the decidedly pro-life crowd, nor does it mesh with what the rest of the pro-life movement wants. Yet I can’t help but think that Pence was right. For the sake of both principles and practicality, we should rally around a federal 15-week abortion ban.Pro-life activists protest outside a Planned Parenthood clinic on Jan. 20, 2022 in Washington, D.C. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Don’t get me wrong: Like any good Catholic (for that matter, like anyone who’s pro-life or pro-science), I support ending abortion, full stop. Abortion is an injustice that hurts both mothers and children, so it should be driven from America as soon as possible. NIKKI HALEY HITS MEDIA FOR NOT PRESSING BIDEN, HARRIS ON LATE-TERM ABORTIONS: THEY KNOW ‘IT’D BE REAL TELLING'Yet saying that is fundamentally different from making it a reality. If we’re ever going to get there, the pro-life movement needs to meet Americans where they are now, so we can set the stage for continued progress.Right now, we’re at risk of losing the progress we’ve already made. Since the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade last year, about two dozen states have taken steps to protect mothers and children, with some ending abortion altogether. These laws have already saved tens of thousands of lives, with more children given a chance at life with every passing year. Yet abortion advocates have responded with a coordinated campaign to pass ballot measures that eliminate all abortion restrictions whatsoever – even in red states like Kansas and Kentucky. They hope to achieve similar success in Ohio this fall.Abortion activists are comfortably rolling back pro-life protections because they’re able to depict Republicans as abortion extremists. It’s a rich claim, since Democrats support murdering unborn children up until the moment of birth, even when the children are healthy and could lead happy lives outside the womb, with countless families willing to adopt them. Yet since the right is all over the place on when abortion should be ended, the left is able to fear-monger that Republicans are going to end all abortions everywhere. And abortion activists can advance this narrative without admitting that they want no restrictions on abortion – anywhere, anytime, for any reason.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONMessage discipline matters in politics. Right now, Republicans have no unified message, which gives Democrats the opening they want to expand abortion beyond even the permissive Roe era. Yet if Republicans coalesced around a federal 15-week ban, the pressure would be reversed. The national conversation could move away from Republicans banning abortion on the first day of pregnancy to Democrats backing abortion up to the last day of pregnancy. That’s a conversation the left doesn’t want to have. As mainstream polling has shown, more Americans support a 15-week ban than oppose it, and we live in a democracy where the majority rules.Only the pro-life movement can move the GOP in this direction. Pro-lifers are the beating heart of the Republican Party, just as the pro-abortion camp is core to the Democratic Party. If we rally around a federal 15-week ban, we can rally voters and lawmakers to enact this policy in future years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThat would be a huge improvement over the abortion regime that existed under Roe, and the states that want to go further still could. While a 15-week ban is far from perfect, it would give the pro-life movement a chance to prepare for the bigger fight that lies ahead. Let’s protect as many mothers and children as we can today, so we can redouble our efforts to change minds, win hearts, and transform the culture tomorrow. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM BUSCHTim Busch is the founder of the Napa Institute, a Catholic organization.","https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/pro-lifers-should-back-federal-15-week-abortion-ban",4152,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,"male"

(CREDIT: Bishop Robert Barron) FIRST ON FOX — Bishop Robert Barron — one of the most popular Catholic clergymen in the United States — held his first interview with a Democratic lawmaker on social issues important to the Catholic faith.California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna spoke with the bishop in the latest episode of ""Bishop Barron Presents"" to be released this week.Khanna and Barron discussed hard topics including religious liberty, Big Tech and abortion in a gesture of bridging ideological gaps.Khanna — a Hindu whose father was arrested for support of Mahatma Gandhi in India — expressed intense support for faith's role in the public square and the necessity of religious belief in shaping good policy.In the interview, he praised the shared value of hesitation to respond to violence with violence found in both Hinduism and Christianity.HOW ST PATRICK'S SAYS IT WAS TRICKED INTO HOSTING TRANS ACTIVIST FUNERAL, WHY IT HELD MASS OF REPARATIONCalifornia Rep.

(Word on Fire)""We need faith informing politics because otherwise, someone hits you, someone strikes you, and the human response is you want to strike them back,"" Khanna said. ""What faith at its best does is make us pause and ask ‘What is the ideal way to live?’""""That doesn't mean we can always live in an ideal way in a fallen world […] but certainly it should help shape the action and give us pause,"" he added.Barron, who serves as the bishop of the Diocese of Winona–Rochester and previously served as an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles, asked Khanna about perceived hostility toward religion coming from the Democratic Party.""What I've noticed in the last, say, 30 years, is the Left becoming increasingly hostile to religion,"" Barron told Khanna. ""Not even indifferent to it, I mean actively hostile to it. And that worries a lot of us.""Khanna recounted an incident in his youth when his family moved to a town that worried the new Hindu family would not be willing to put out the traditional Christmas candles that all other houses used to illuminate the neighborhood — a tradition the Khannas were more than willing to join.""In my view, having a robust engagement with people's faith is a better way than telling people ‘Don’t have faith in the public square,'"" Khanna told the bishop.MOST POPULAR PRIEST ON SOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO VIRAL TIKTOKS ABOUT GOD, INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BIBLECalifornia Democratic Rep.

""We, in my view, should be funding border agents, we should be funding immigration judges, we should be funding technology. We should be saying clearly that a nation needs safe and secure borders and not be demonizing the border patrol or not funding it.""Abortion proved the most contentious issue during the interview, with a calm but increasingly tense back-and-forth on the humanity of unborn babies.""The framework in my standing, California, is that you can have an abortion up until viability. And then after that, it's an exception for the health of the mother in that circumstance, which is very, very rare,"" Khanna told Barron in response to the bishop's assertion that abortion is the single biggest issue responsible for Catholics disaffiliating from the Democratic Party. The representative continued, ""Now, my view is that that decision should be for the woman and her doctor in getting that healthcare.

So if Democrats are willing to say 'We'll restrict [abortion] here or there,' great — and I think the Church would embrace that and say, 'At least we're moving in the right direction.'

Wade on 'Special Report.'As some raise concerns that a federal bill to codify abortion rights may not be constitutional, another avenue to enshrine abortion rights – a constitutional amendment – does not appear to be open for Democrats. ""Constitutional amendments are something that the parties use as messaging opportunities,"" R Street Institute senior fellow for governance James Wallner told Fox News Digital. ""They're not serious efforts to amend the Constitution.""The process for a constitutional amendment is extremely arduous, and there is effectively no chance of an amendment enshrining abortion rights making it past any of the several steps involved. Wallner said even the decades-long process of changing the balance of the Supreme Court is easier. ""It's a lot easier to win an election, get a president in office, to nominate a judge, to get that judge on the bench, and then find sympathetic litigants to mount a case that goes through the federal court system, that ends up in the Supreme Court, and then they change the Constitution,"" he said. ABOLISHING FILIBUSTER FOR ABORTION IS ‘MADNESS,’ WAPO COLUMNIST WARNS DEMS: ‘BLINDNESS TO POLITICAL REALITY’The Supreme Court last month overturned Roe v. Wade, shifting the decision on whether abortion should be legal back to the political branches of government. (Fox News Digital/Lisa Bennatan)To amend the Constitution, an amendment must be proposed by two-thirds of both the House and Senate. A constitutional convention could also be called by two-thirds of the states to propose an amendment. However, the Senate already cannot pass abortion legislation over its 60-vote filibuster threshold, meaning it is extremely unlikely it could get 67 votes for the same policy. It is also unlikely more than a couple of House Republicans would vote for such a bill, and almost certainly not the more than 70 that would be needed to pass an amendment. LOUISIANA SUPREME COURT SAYS ABORTIONS MUST REMAIN LEGAL FOR NOW, DESPITE ‘TRIGGER LAW’Further, there are already 20 states with severe restrictions or an outright ban on abortion, according to Planned Parenthood. Republicans hold majorities in more than 60% of legislative chambers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. It is not likely those states would be willing to support an amendment that would undermine their laws. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are plotting a legislative response to Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, but a constitutional amendment is unlikely to be part of their plans.

(Photo by Joshua Comins/Fox News)Even if one of those hurdles was cleared, an amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states, before its expiration, in order to take effect. Wallner said an amendment ""is just by definition not going to happen.""""You can't pass a constitutional amendment if you can't pass a bill,"" Wallner said. ""And Democrats don't even have 51 votes to pass a bill right now, setting aside their willingness to put in the effort to overcome a filibuster, which they also don't have.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBoth sides commonly propose constitutional amendments, largely for messaging purposes. Republicans, as recently as this year, touted the idea of a balanced budget amendment. Democrats, on the other hand, do not appear set on using that strategy in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion and returning the issue to the states.A Senate Democratic aide told Fox News Digital that it is possible a member could bring up the idea of a constitutional amendment as Democrats deal with the Dobbs fallout. That aide said there is no plan for any coordinated effort among Democrats to push for such an amendment, or try to bring it to the floor for a vote. In the House, a senior Democratic aide said members of that chamber are not currently planning to push a constitutional amendment on abortion rights. However, the aide told Fox News Digital, other bills Democrats plan to vote on, including data protection for women, the right to travel to get an abortion and the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA), will put a squeeze on Republicans. It will be interesting, the aide said, to see how Republicans vote on these issues in a post-Roe world, when they are ""playing with live ammo.""Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.","https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-democrats-not-pursuing-constitutional-amendment-abortion-rights",4718,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.9762,0.0238,"male"

Wade or whether they identify as ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice,"" but rather presents in-depth questions about abortion issues, probing Americans' public policy opinions rather than identity markers.""When asked about their actual opinion, 71% of Americans support real restrictions that are more pro-life than federal law and the laws of many states,"" Timothy Saccoccia, vice president at the Knights of Columbus, said on a press call regarding the poll. He noted that 54% of Americans identify as ""pro-choice,"" but this label does not translate to a support to unlimited abortion.The poll presented six options on abortion restrictions: ""abortion should be available to a woman at any time she wants one during her entire pregnancy""; ""abortion should be allowed only during the first six months of a pregnancy""; ""abortion should be allowed only during the first three months of a pregnancy""; ""abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother""; ""abortion should be allowed only to save the life of the mother""; and ""abortion should never be permitted under any circumstance.""Most Americans (71%) said that abortion should be restricted to the first three months of pregnancy (22%) or in other limited circumstances such as rape and incest (28%), to save the life of the mother (9%) or not at all (12%). Only 17% of Americans said abortion should be available during an entire pregnancy and 12% said it should be restricted to the first six months.Knights of Columbus/Marist poll on abortion restrictions (Knights of Columbus/Marist Poll)Even almost half of Democrats (49%) supported tight restrictions, with only 31% saying abortion should be available during all nine months of pregnancy. A vast majority of Republicans (93%) supported tight restrictions on abortion, while only 1% said abortion should be available throughout all of pregnancy. Most Independents (70%) also supported tight restrictions, while only 19% said abortion should be available throughout pregnancy.CHRISTIANS FROM DIFFERENT RACES, DENOMINATIONS AND PARTIES GATHER TO PRAY BEFORE SUPREME COURT ABORTION CASESupport for tight restrictions has remained consistent over time, with between 64% and 86% of Americans supporting restricting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy, cases of rape, incest, or threats to the life of the mother, or banning the practice entirely.Knights of Columbus/Marist poll on abortion restrictions (Knights of Columbus/Marist Poll)The poll also found that a plurality of Americans support banning abortion at the point in which the unborn baby can feel pain. ""If abortion remains legal in the United States including for cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, at which point should abortions for other reasons be limited?"" pollsters asked. Forty-two percent of Americans said abortion should be banned at ""the point at which a fetus can feel pain,"" while 36% said it should be banned at ""the point at which a fetus can live outside the womb,"" the position established in Roe v. Wade. Many Americans (11%) said they are unsure on that question.NEW DEM GROUP AIMS TO ‘PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF THE ABORTION INDUSTRY’Rather than just asking whether respondents support Roe v. Wade or want it overturned, Marist asked respondents what the Supreme Court should do when it considers the Roe v. Wade ruling.Although 36% of Americans said abortion should remain legal without restrictions, a position more in line with Roe, most Americans (61%) would either have the court make abortion illegal (17%) or have the issue determined by each state (44%), both positions that would involve overturning Roe. A September Fox News poll found that 65% of Americans said they support Roe v. Wade when asked directly about the decision, not about the specific policy issues. Knights of Columbus/Marist poll on Roe v. Wade ""Roe v. Wade was wrong when it was decided, and its legacy is the tragic destruction of more than 60 million unborn lives and countless wounded women,"" Supreme Knight Patrick Kelly said.

Gov.

She reported the incident to police, but no charges against Azaiez have been filed.In a text message chain attached to the document, the woman wrote to Azaiez, ""No I will not get an abortion I will pay the consequences as you threatened me. This baby has a heartbeat. I will not kill it.""Round Rock ISD photo of Hafedh Azaiez (Round Rock ISD)""For the last time I am telling you please get an abortion you don't know what you are getting yourself into,"" Azaiez responded. ""I will make you pay this you will not make me lose everything … Don't make me go after you and make you pay the consequences for you and this baby.""On July 18, the woman called the police, reporting that someone had broken into her home. An iPad, two iMacs, and a diary had gone missing. She suspected Azaiez, although he has not been charged for the crime.Mary Nix, the attorney representing Azaiez, noted that ""all applications for protective orders, including the one to which you refer, contain ‘allegations’ which are unproven and are not ‘facts.’ As I succinctly stated in a January 5, 2022 press release, we have objective evidence that the alleged assault, which is the genesis of this controversy, did not occur and we believe that evidence to be incontrovertible.""""Finally, knowing that the application to which you refer contains unproven allegations about a personal matter, the Round Rock ISD school board rightfully made its hiring decision based on Dr. Azaiez's professional qualifications,"" Nix added.In her Jan. 5, 2022, press release, Nix wrote that ""the personal dispute between Dr. Azaiez and the third-party complainant was amicably resolved and there is a confidential settlement agreement. An agreed-upon civil restraining order was entered into by and between Dr. Azaiez and the complainant.""Nix did not elaborate on the nature of the evidence, besides repeating that it is ""incontrovertible.""Azaiez's former girlfriend declined to comment to Fox News.The Williamson County Sheriff's Office arrested Jeremy Story, a father of seven children who lives in the district but whose children attend school outside it, and Dustin Clark, a father of four children in RRISD schools, on Sept. 17, 2021, on one misdemeanor charge each of ""Hinder Proceeding by Disorderly Conduct."" Jeremy Story getting escorted out of a Round Rock ISD school board meeting. (Jeremy Story)The charge against Story traced back to an Aug. 16 board meeting in which Story attempted to voice concerns about Azaiez. During that meeting, then-Board President Amy Weir cut Story off, warning him not to speak about a topic unrelated to the meeting's agenda. After he uttered the words ""protective order,"" RRISD police escorted him out of the meeting.Weir previously told Fox News that ""there has never been an attempt to silence Mr. Story."" She noted that, as per normal procedure, Story wrote on a card indicating what he would say at the meeting, and he wrote that ""unlike the board, citizens are not required to speak on items on the agenda,"" thus indicating that ""he was planning to speak on a topic not listed for the meeting,"" Weir said. Jenny LaCoste-Caputo, a spokeswoman for the school district, said, ""At no time were speakers not allowed to speak in accordance with state law and board policy at a Round Rock ISD board meeting.""TEXAS SCHOOL BOARD HOLDS CLOSED MEETING ON SUPERINTENDENT UNDER INVESTIGATION""I’d provided documents for this [application for a protective] order to the board months ago,"" Story told Fox News Digital shortly after the document's release. ""I also testified to them in the school board meeting."" ""In spite of all this proof, five members of the board have worked to hide their own unlawful actions and the superintendent’s,"" he added. Neither Azaiez nor members of the school board have been charged with violating the law or have been accused of professional misconduct.Story claimed that the board had done much to ""violate my free speech rights and silence me and put me in jail.""He called on the TEA to expand its investigation and he demanded that members of the school board investigate ""themselves for their own malfeasant actions.""""If the board is truly innocent, they would welcome such an investigation,"" Story claimed. Yet the board recently voted, 5-to-2, against an investigation.Story also shared with Fox News documents he obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request: a Travis County Sheriff's Office report of the break-in on July 18, and an alleged assault report, naming Azaiez and the woman.For his part, Clark said the publicly available document ""confirms my suspicions, and corroborates the information I had been made aware of back in July of 2021 regarding the allegations of assault by the Round Rock ISD Superintendent against his pregnant mistress."" He described it as ""shocking"" to learn that Azaiez allegedly told his former girlfriend that ""Weir had assured him she would help protect him during the fallout from this.""Weir did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on these claims. She does not face accusations of professional misconduct.""The information in the sworn statement regarding me is false as all texts and emails show,"" Weir claimed in a statement to Fox News after the publication of this story.""The allegations of assault, and allegations of collusion by the Board President are reprehensible, and neither party should be allowed to make decisions that involve the over 45,000 women and children in our school district,"" Clark told Fox News Digital. He claimed that when he and others spoke out, ""Dr. Azaiez and Board President Amy Weir escalated tensions by collaborating to suppress speech.""He mentioned a Sept. 14, 2021, school board meeting in which RRISD only set up 18 chairs in a room that accommodates 300 people, and prevented members of the public from entering. ""These actions seemed to be an effort to intimidate parents and control the optics by arbitrarily restricting the capacity of parents and community members allowed in the boardroom,"" Clark said. He spoke up at that meeting, was removed by police, and was arrested three days later.He called the board's actions ""further attempts to suppress and intimidate other community members from speaking out about these allegations of domestic violence, and the subsequent effort to ignore and conceal it from the public."" (In Texas, violence against a dating partner would be ""dating violence,"" not ""domestic violence."") He called on both Azaiez and Weir to ""do the right thing by resigning so that this community to begin to heal.""Story and Clark, along with two school board members – Danielle Weston and Mary Bone – had expressed concerns about Azaiez during the hiring process. Story had previously claimed to Fox News Digital that Azaiez – who had previously served as superintendent at Donna ISD – ""had used the police in his former district to silence a 68-year-old grandmother."" (In both Round Rock and Donna ISD, superintendents command a school board police force, separate from local and state police.)He presented a June 14 video of police officers delivering a trespass warning to Raquel Gonzales Martinez, an order barring her from setting foot on school grounds for two years. Martinez said she had uncovered corruption, but Donna ISD and LaCoste-Caputo declined to comment on the incident. Fox News does not have evidence corroborating alleged corruption.Despite these concerns, the five other school board members voted to hire Azaiez rather than wait to investigate him.TEXAS SCHOOL BOARD TRIES CENSURING CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS: ‘NAKED POLITICAL HIT JOB’Amy Weir, who served as board president at the time Azaiez was hired, declined to comment on the document to Fox News Digital. Amber Feller, the current board president, pushed back on the idea that the board rushed Azaiez' hiring.Round Rock ISD Board of Trustees President Amy Weir (Round Rock ISD)""The superintendent search was in no way rushed,"" Feller told Fox News Digital on Thursday. ""The process included multiple focus groups with hundreds of stakeholders, five community-wide meetings, and a community survey that yielded 5,000 responses to determine a candidate profile, and followed the typical timeline for a superintendent hire in Texas. The national search began in early March 2021 and Dr. Azaiez was named the sole finalist in late May. A state-mandated 21-day waiting period followed, and Dr. Azaiez was officially appointed in June.""""The allegations detailed in the court document occured after Dr. Azaiez was hired, so it is not possible for the Board to have heard these allegations prior to his appointment,"" Feller noted. ""At this time, these are allegations and, as we have stated in the past, no criminal charges have been filed. Given that the Board has engaged an external investigator and is awaiting that final report, I will not be commenting further. Dr. Azaiez remains on administrative leave during the course of the investigation.""Round Rock ISD Board of Trustees President Amber Feller (Round Rock ISD)Terri Romere, a former member of the board from 2010 to 2017, told Fox News Digital that the process to hire Azaiez was indeed rushed, however.""The process was rushed,"" she said. She compared this process to the process of hiring another superintendent in 2013. ""It took a good six months, and this [Azaiez's hiring] was like nothing.""LaCoste-Caputo claimed that the search for former superintendent Steve Flores took ""just under four months."" She pointed to an Aug. 2013 press release announcing Steve Flores as the lone finalist in the search, which the press release said began on March 27 with the appointment of a search firm, thus lasting ""nearly four months.""Romere responded saying that ""the prep time"" extended the search. The board started preparations in January 2013, when Jesus Chavez announced his upcoming retirement, and did not fully approve the next superintendent until October 2013. Romere also said that the board ""involved more of the community"" at the time.Failing the childrenDanielle Weston, one of the two board members who urged caution in hiring Azaiez, told Fox News Digital that she would not comment on the claims in the document. However, she did comment on the board's actions. The five members of the board who oppose Weston and Bone have attempted to censure them.Danielle Weston and Mary Bone, two trustees at Round Rock ISD.  (Round Rock ISD)""I believe the board has failed to find common ground to improve educational outcomes for our 47,000 precious students,"" Weston told Fox News Digital after the document's release.

Jackson Women's Health Organization was genuine – although the draft dates back to February, and it does not represent the current or final opinion of the court. In the draft, Alito strikes down Roe v.

""Until that changes she can take a seat talking about ‘women’s access to health care.’ Hold everyone contributing to this disaster accountable, GOP & Dem obstructionists included.

The Women's Health Protection Act failed in the Senate by a vote of 46-48 in March, with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., voting with Republicans against the bill. Democrats have increasingly called for radical changes to the U.S. government in recent years. Although Joe Biden, as a senator in 1987, condemned former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's scheme to add new members to the Supreme Court amid the court's early unfavorable rulings on New Deal cases in the 1930s, he refused to pledge not to add seats to the court during the 2020 election. Last year, he issued an executive order creating a commission to study ""Supreme Court reform."" The commission he created voted to send him ""no position"" on the issue.PRO-ABORTION GROUPS TARGET CHURCHES FOR MOTHER'S DAY PROTESTSThe Constitution does not stipulate the size of the Supreme Court or the filibuster rule. In Nov. 2013, the Democratic-majority Senate voted to change the rules to approve judges – except Supreme Court justices – with a mere majority vote. In April 2017, the Republican-majority Senate allowed the approval of Supreme Court justices by majority vote.By advocating such drastic reforms in order to block the effects of one Supreme Court ruling, Democrats may be falling afoul of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's warning about rulings like Roe v. Wade. While Ginsburg firmly supported abortion, she warned that Roe represented a drastic move that ""may prove unstable.""""Measured motions seem to me right, in the main, for constitutional as well as common law adjudication,"" she argued in 1992. ""Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable. The most prominent example in recent decades is Roe v. Wade.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIf Democrats pack the court now or abolish the filibuster now in pursuit of passing an abortion bill, they may enable a future Republican president and/or Republican-majority Senate to pass legislation or pack the court further, and even to reverse abortion law far more radically than the leaked draft opinion did. Tyler O'Neil is an editor at Fox News.

Wade, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Tom Dupree weighs in on the legal battle.With Congress set to return from its Independence Day recess to a political landscape rocked by the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democrats plan to make abortion a top priority in their busy legislative agenda.In the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, five justices – three appointed by former President Donald Trump – ruled that elected representatives may make abortion laws, including complete bans of the practice. Republicans rejoiced while Democrats vowed to fight what they said is a half-century backslide on women's rights. ""Today is one of the darkest days our country has ever seen,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said.

(Getty Images)HOW MITCH MCCONNELL PLAYING ‘LONG GAME’ SHAPED THE SUPREME COURT AND LED TO THE END OF ABORTION LANDMARK ROEThe House of Representatives is already planning a robust response to the ruling. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a letter last week that Democrats are exploring bills to protect women's online data on health apps and to ensure the right to cross state lines for an abortion. She also said the House is considering repassing the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA). A senior House Democratic aide told Fox News Digital they are interested to see how Republicans may vote on some of those bills, considering these conversations are no longer abstract with Roe overturned. They are ""playing with live ammo,"" the aide said, and those bills could put Republicans in a tough position. Another senior House Democratic aide said many options for legislation are under discussion, but said none are locked in quite yet. That aide said the bills on health app data and right to travel could move fast because of urgency among Democrats to protect women. PENNSYLVANIA NONPROFIT IS DEDICATED TO HELPING WOMEN AVOID ABORTION'S ‘HOPELESSNESS’The first senior Democratic aide also said more votes on other bills may be coming, and that multiple hearings are expected too. The House Oversight Committee already announced one. Pro-choice demonstrators gather outside the Supreme Court in Washington, June 24, 2022. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)Pelosi also said the House is expected to respond to Justice Clarence Thomas' dissent with legislation targeted at other rights. ""In his disturbing concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas confirmed many of our deepest fears about where this decision may lead: taking aim at additional long-standing precedent and cherished privacy rights, from access to contraception and in-vitro fertilization to marriage equality,"" Pelosi said in a letter to fellow Democrats. ""Legislation is being introduced to further codify freedoms which Americans currently enjoy.""LOUISIANA SUPREME COURT SAYS ABORTIONS MUST REMAIN LEGAL FOR NOW, DESPITE ‘TRIGGER LAW’Two Senate committees are set to hold hearings in the near future on potential abortion-related legislation.

However, it is not clear when or to what extent Senate Democrats may start bringing bills to the floor, a Senate Democratic aide said. There is still the WHPA for Senate Democrats to go back to, the aide said. The chamber voted on this bill earlier this year and did not make it past the filibuster, with bipartisan opposition. MISSISSIPPI JUDGE DECLINES TO BLOCK ‘TRIGGER LAW’ BANNING MOST ABORTIONSWith President Biden now saying that he supports a filibuster carve-out for abortion rights, the Senate Democratic aide said a nuclear option vote on WHPA or another bill is one of many options currently on the table.

Wade without some additional provisions in the WHPA. That may be shot down by liberals, the Senate Democratic aide said, because pro-choice groups do not want to spend political momentum on something that does not go as far as they otherwise may be able to. The senior House Democratic aide also said that the WHPA is Democrats' plan to codify Roe, and its provisions are even more important with a ""hostile Supreme Court.""A second Senate Democratic aide noted that Collins and Murkowski are working with Sen.

Jackson Women's Health Organization, which observers expect will overturn or restrict the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.The bill, H.B. 937, establishes the ""Abortion Care Clinical Training Program"" in the Maryland Department of Health ""to ensure that there are a sufficient number of health professionals to provide abortion care,"" forces the governor to include $3.5 million in the annual budget to fund the program, and alters the law to enable professionals besides medical doctors to perform abortions.COLORADO GOV. POLIS SIGNS BILL CREATING ‘FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT’ TO ABORTION; DENYING ANY RIGHT FOR THE UNBORN""Thank you so much to my House colleagues for voting to override the Governor's veto on my legislation to protect our public health officials from undue political influence,"" Democratic House Delegate Joseline A.

Larry Hogan announced he will not run for U.S. Senate during a news conference on Tuesday, Feb. 8, 2022 in Annapolis, Md.  (AP Photo/Brian Witte, File)The two houses of the Maryland General Assembly passed the bill last month, with Democrats supporting it and Republicans opposing it. Gov. Hogan vetoed the bill Friday, saying that H.B. 937 ""risks lowering the high standard of reproductive health care services received by women in Maryland. These procedures are complex, and can, and often do, result in significant medical complications that require the attention of a licensed physician.""""The only impact that this bill would have on women's reproductive rights would be to set back standards for women's health care and safety,"" Hogan added.71% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS: POLLThe Maryland House overrode the veto, 90-46, and the Senate did the same, 29-15, along party lines, on Saturday.Annapolis, Maryland, USA skyline and State House.

Adriana Kelley, a Democrat and the lead sponsor of the bill, told CBS News that H.B. 937 ""is making sure that people have access to care, particularly people of color, particularly low-income people, particularly rural people. We know that physician-only restrictions exacerbate health inequalities, and we are trying to reduce health inequalities in the state of Maryland with this bill.""Del. Haven Shoemaker, the Republican House minority whip, described the bill as ""the most radical expansion of abortion in Maryland's history in a state that already has some of the most liberal abortion laws in the country.""States with Democratic legislatures have passed laws codifying abortion in case Roe gets overturned. Last week, Gov. Jared Polis, D-Colo., signed a law creating a ""fundamental right"" to abortion and denying any right for the unborn. In 2019, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., signed a law codifying abortion rights and explicitly removing protections from unborn infants. FILE - In this Nov. 5, 2020, file photo the Supreme Court is seen in Washington.

The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion organization, has predicted that 26 states are likely to either ban abortion or severely limit access, should the Court overturn Roe.While many polls suggest Americans support Roe, in-depth polling reveals a more complicated picture. When asked about their opinion on abortion during specific periods of pregnancy and other situations, 71% of Americans say they support restricting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy (22%), or in other limited circumstances such as rape and incest (28%), to save the life of the mother (9%) or not at all (12%). Only 17% of Americans said abortion should be available during an entire pregnancy and 12% said it should be restricted to the first six months.Tyler O'Neil is an editor at Fox News.

Wade, a record number of voters think abortion should be legal, with two-thirds favoring nationwide law guaranteeing access, according to a Fox News national survey. Fifty-nine percent think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from the previous high of 57% in September 2022 and a record low of 44% in April 2022. Support for legalization is up (mostly by double-digits) across the board since April 2022, two months before Roe was overturned. That includes increased support among voters ages 65 and older (+16 points should be legal), conservatives (+12), Republicans (+11), and White evangelical Christians (+10). Overall, just 7% think abortion should never be permitted, while five times as many say it always should be (35%). Another one-third (32%) say abortion should be illegal except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. PRO-LIFE GROUPS ASSAIL FDA FOR ‘RECKLESS DISREGARD’ IN SUPREME COURT ABORTION PILL CASEWhen asked about possible bans on abortions except for medical emergencies, opinions vary depending upon the timing of the procedure. By a 20-point margin, voters oppose a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy (58% oppose vs. 38% in favor). That’s up from an 8-point margin opposing a six-week ban in 2023 and a 4-point margin in favor of the ban in 2022. Voters oppose a 15-week ban by 11 points (54% oppose vs. 43% favor), which is in direct contrast with results in 2023 when it was favored by 12 points (42% oppose vs. 54% favor) and in 2022 when it was favored by 13 points (41% vs. 54%). While the change in views on 6-week and 15-week bans look like genuine movement, it cannot be ruled out that minor edits to question wording and ordering made a difference.This movement is not just among Democrats. Since 2022, Republicans are also more likely to oppose the 6-week (+12 points) and 15-week (+10) bans. Still, majorities of Republicans favor a ban in both instances. Protesters shout as they join thousands marching around the Arizona Capitol after the Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion decision Friday, June 24, 2022.  (Ross D. Franklin)""Sometimes you have to be careful about what you wish for,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""Opinions on abortion are hard to move, but they have shifted slightly to the left in the past two years. Whatever the substantive legal and policy merits of the Court’s ruling in the Dobbs case, overturning Roe has given the Democrats a rallying point in an otherwise bleak issue environment."" Last week, former President Donald Trump indicated in a radio interview that he would support a 15-week abortion ban. SUPREME COURT DECIDING ON ABORTION PILL APPROVALWhen asked about a 24-week ban, however, voters split: 48% oppose vs. 48% favor. Over half of Republicans (58%) and independents (52%) favor the 24-week ban while over half of Democrats oppose it (59%). This was the first time the 24-week question was included on the survey. Two-thirds support a nationwide law guaranteeing access to legal abortion (65%). Most Democrats (89%) and two-thirds (65%) of independents favor a national law, while just over half of Republicans are against it (53%). On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard an abortion case on whether to limit access to the FDA-approved abortion medication Mifepristone, which can be prescribed to end a pregnancy up to 10 weeks after conception. Last April, the high court allowed full access to the drug while the current case made its way through the lower courts. The poll, released Wednesday, shows 68% of voters favor legalizing Mifepristone, up a touch from 65% a year ago (April 2023). Almost 9 in 10 Democrats (87%) and 7 in 10 independents (71%) support it, while Republicans are split (48% legal vs. 46% illegal). Overall, just under 3 in 10 say it should not be permitted (28%). The poll was conducted entirely before the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the Mifepristone case. A ruling is expected in June or July.Looking ahead to 2024Abortion rights is expected to be hotly debated on the 2024 campaign trail, yet in a list of 7 issues, voters rank abortion 5th, with 41% saying it will be extremely important to their vote. The economy (61%), election integrity (53%), immigration (48%), and health care (46%) rank higher. Foreign policy (38%) and climate change (30%) rank the lowest.Abortion ranks at the top for Democrats with 58% saying it’s extremely important followed closely by health care at 57%. The economy is the top issue for Republicans (70%) and independents (65%).CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBy a 12-point margin, registered voters think President Joe Biden would better handle the abortion issue over Trump.
